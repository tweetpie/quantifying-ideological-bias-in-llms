      "text": "Rise of Latino population blurs US racial lines\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Welcome to the new off-white America.\n\nA historic decline in the number of U.S. whites and the fast growth of Latinos are blurring traditional black-white color lines, testing the limits of civil rights laws and reshaping political alliances as \"whiteness\" begins to lose its numerical dominance.\n\nLong in coming, the demographic shift was most vividly illustrated in last November's re-election of President Barack Obama, the first black president, despite a historically low percentage of white supporters.\n\nIt's now a potent backdrop to the immigration issue being debated in Congress that could offer a path to citizenship for 11 million mostly Hispanic illegal immigrants. Also, the Supreme Court is deciding cases this term on affirmative action and voting rights that could redefine race and equality in the U.S.\n\nThe latest census data and polling from The Associated Press highlight the historic change in a nation in which non-Hispanic whites will lose their majority in the next generation, somewhere around the year 2043.\n\nDespite being a nation of immigrants, America's tip to a white minority has never occurred in its 237-year history and will be a first among the world's major post-industrial societies. Brazil, a developing nation, has crossed the threshold to \"majority-minority\" status; a few cities in France and England are near, if not past that point.\n\nThe international experience and recent U.S. events point to an uncertain future for American race relations.\n\nIn Brazil, where multiracialism is celebrated, social mobility remains among the world's lowest for blacks while wealth is concentrated among whites at the top. In France, race is not recorded on government census forms and people share a unified Gallic identity, yet high levels of racial discrimination persist.\n\n\"The American experience has always been a story of color. In the 20th century it was a story of the black-white line. In the 21st century we are moving into a new off-white moment,\" says Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, a global expert on immigration and dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Education & Information Studies.\n\n\"Numerically, the U.S. is being transformed. The question now is whether our institutions are being transformed,\" he said.\n\nThe shift is being driven by the modern wave of U.S. newcomers from Latin America and Asia. Their annual inflow of 650,000 people since 1965, at a rate that's grown in recent years, surpasses the pace of the last great immigration wave a century ago. That influx, from 1820 to 1920, brought in Irish, Germans, Italians and Jews from Europe and made the gateway of Ellis Island, N.Y., an immigrant landmark, symbolizing freedom, liberty and the American dream.\n\nAn equal factor is today's aging white population, mostly baby boomers, whose coming wave of retirements will create a need for first- and second-generation immigrants to help take their place in the workforce.\n\nThe numbers already demonstrate that being white is fading as a test of American-ness:\n\n-More U.S. babies are now born to minorities than whites, a milestone reached last year.\n\n-More than 45 percent of students in kindergarten through 12th grade are minorities. The Census Bureau projects that in five years the number of nonwhite children will surpass 50 percent.\n\n-The District of Columbia, Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Texas have minority populations greater than 50 percent. By 2020, eight more states are projected to join the list: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey and New York. Latinos already outnumber whites in New Mexico; California will tip to a Latino plurality next year.\n\n-By 2039, racial and ethnic minorities will make up a majority of the U.S. working-age population, helping to support a disproportionately elderly white population through Social Security and other payroll taxes. More than 1 in 4 people ages 18-64 will be Latino.\n\n-The white population, now at 197.8 million, is projected to peak at 200 million in 2024, before entering a steady decline in absolute numbers. Currently 63 percent of the U.S. population, the white share is expected to drop below 50 percent by 2043, when racial and ethnic minorities will collectively become a U.S. majority. Hispanics will drive most of the minority growth, due mostly to high birth rates, jumping in share from 17 percent to 26 percent.\n\nThe pace of assimilation for today's Latinos and Asian-Americans is often compared with that of the Poles, Irish, Italians and Jews who arrived around the turn of the 20th century and eventually merged into an American white mainstream.\n\nThere was a backlash. By the 1930s, an immigrant-weary America had imposed strict quotas and closed its borders. Those newly arrived were pushed to conform and blend in with a white mainstream, benefiting from New Deal economic programs that generally excluded blacks. The immigration quotas also cut off the supply of new workers to ethnic enclaves and reduced social and economic contacts between immigrants and their countries of origin.\n\n\"America of the Melting Pot comes to End,\" read a 1924 opinion headline in The New York Times. The author, a U.S. senator, pledged that strict new immigration quotas would \"preserve racial type as it exists here today.\"\n\nToday, data show that Latinos are embracing U.S. life but also maintaining strong ties to their heritage, aided by a new stream of foreign-born immigrants who arrive each year. Hispanics, officially an ethnic group, strive to learn English and 1 in 4 intermarry, taking a white spouse.\n\nNowadays, immigrants face less pressure to conform than did their counterparts from a century ago. Latinos are protected as a minority, benefiting from the 1950s civil rights movement pioneered by blacks. Nearly 40 percent of Latinos now resist a white identity on census forms, checking a box indicating \"some other race\" to establish a Hispanic race identity.\n\nWhile growing diversity is often a step toward a post-racial U.S., sociologists caution that the politics of racial diversity could just as easily become more magnified.\n\nA first-of-its-kind AP poll conducted in 2011 found that a slight majority of whites expressed racial bias against Hispanics and that their attitudes were similar to or even greater than the bias they held toward blacks. Hispanics also remained somewhat residentially segregated from whites in lower-income neighborhoods, hurt in part by the disappearance of good-paying, midskill manufacturing jobs that helped white ethnics rise into the middle class during most of the 20th century.\n\nThe AP survey was conducted with researchers from Stanford University, the University of Michigan and NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nHarvard economist George Borjas projects that by 2030, the children of today's immigrants will earn on average 10 percent to 15 percent less than nonimmigrant Americans, based on past trends, and that Latinos will particularly struggle because of high rates of poverty, lack of citizenship and lower rates of education. In 1940, the children of early 20th-century white ethnics fared much better on average, earning 21.4 percent more than nonimmigrants.\n\nAbout 35 percent of Hispanic babies are currently born into poverty, compared with 41 percent of blacks and 20 percent for whites.\n\n\"How America responds now to the new challenges of racial and ethnic diversity will determine whether it becomes a more open and inclusive society in the future - one that provides equal opportunities and justice for all,\" said Daniel Lichter, a Cornell sociologist and past president of the Population Association of America.\n\nThe demographic shift has spurred debate as to whether some civil-rights era programs, such as affirmative action in college admissions, should begin to focus on income level rather than race or ethnicity. The Supreme Court will rule on the issue by late June.\n\nFollowing a racially lopsided re-election, Obama has spoken broadly about promoting social and economic opportunity. In his State of the Union speech, he said that rebuilding the middle class is \"our generation's task.\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a rising star of a mostly white Republican party now eager to attract Latino voters, is courting supporters in both English and Spanish in part by pledging programs that would boost \"social mobility.\"\n\nLeft unclear is how much of a role government can or should play in lifting the disadvantaged, in an era of strapped federal budgets and rising debt.\n\nThe Latino immigrants include Irma Guereque, 60, of Las Vegas, who says enjoying a middle-class life is what's most important to her.\n\nThings turned bad for the Mexico native in the recent recession after her work hours as a food server were cut at the Texas Station casino off the Strip. As a result, she couldn't make the mortgage payments on a spacious house she purchased and was forced to move into an apartment with her grandchildren.\n\nWhile she's getting almost full-time hours now, money is often on her mind. Her finances mean retirement is hardly an option, even though she's got diabetes and is getting older.\n\nMany politicians are \"only thinking of the rich, and not the poor, and that's not right,\" Guereque said in Spanish. \"We need opportunities for everyone.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Elaine Ganley in Montfermeil, France, Jenny Barchfield in Rio de Janeiro and Michelle Rindels in Las Vegas contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nCensus Bureau: http://www.census.gov\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nMIDDLEBURY, Vt. (AP) - Hundreds of college students on Thursday protested a lecture by a writer some called a white nationalist, forcing the college to move his talk to an undisclosed campus location from which it was live-streamed to the original venue but couldn't be heard above protesters' chants, feet stamping and occasional smoke alarms.\n\nSpeaker Charles Murray wrote \"The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life\" and \"Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center considers him a white nationalist who uses \"racist pseudoscience and misleading statistics to argue that social inequality is caused by the genetic inferiority of the black and Latino communities, women and the poor.\"\n\nMurray hasn't responded to an email seeking comment.\n\nMiddlebury College students turned their backs on Murray just as he started to speak Thursday and chanted \"Who is the enemy? White supremacy!\" ''Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Charles Murray, go away!\" and \"Your message is hatred. We cannot tolerate it.\"\n\nThey continued their chants until the college announced that Murray would speak from another location on campus. Students continued their protests, drowning out the talk.\n\nMore than 450 alumni also signed a letter calling the decision to have Murray on campus \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Both students and other community members came out to show that we are not accepting these kind of racist, misogynistic, eugenist opinions being expressed at our college,\" said student Elizabeth Dunn, a protest organizer. \"We don't think that they deserve a platform because they are literally hate speech.\"\n\nThe student group American Enterprise Institute Club invited Murray, believing it's important to bring speakers from all intellectual and ideological backgrounds to campus, said Alexander Khan, its vice president.\n\n\"Our goal really was to get a conversation started, whether you believe in what Dr. Murray has to say or whether you vehemently disagree with him,\" he said.\n\nThe Political Science Department co-sponsored the lecture.\n\nMiddlebury College said the student group had a right to invite Murray and a sponsorship doesn't mean a department endorses a speaker's point of view. Middlebury President Laurie Patten, who said she attended in response to requests from a student and community members, called Murray's work deeply controversial. She said her attendance was not an endorsement of Murray's research and writings, adding she \"profoundly disagrees with many of Mr. Murray's views.\"\n\nThe college said it was disappointed that the event was so heavily disrupted.\n\n\"We do respect the right of people to protest, to make their views heard, but ultimately not to disrupt an event to the point where it can no longer continue as designed,\" college spokesman Bill Burger said.\n\nMurray's talk was recorded so students can hear it later.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Reparations and Religion: 50 years after 'Black Manifesto'\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\n(RNS) - On a Sunday morning in May of 1969, as clergy processed into the sanctuary of New York's august Riverside Church, civil rights activist James Forman vaulted into the pulpit to demand $500 million in reparations for the mistreatment of African Americans from white churches and synagogues.\n\nAt the time, Forman's interruption represented the high point for the reparations movement. A week before, Forman had debuted a radical proposal for racial justice known as \"the Black Manifesto\" for 500 black activists gathered in Detroit for the National Black Economic Development Conference.\n\n\"(W)e know that the churches and synagogues have a tremendous wealth,\" the manifesto stated, \"and its membership, white America, has profited and still exploits black people.\n\n\"The conference determined, by a 187-63 vote, that it was time for white Christians and Jews to pay reparations and demonstrate a willingness to fight \"the white supremacy and racism which has forced us as black people to make these demands.\n\n---\n\nThis content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.\n\n---\n\n\"Riverside, then a mostly white liberal Protestant congregation whose neo-Gothic landmark building was financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr., would be deeply divided over the next few years over Forman's challenge. As the activist brought his manifesto to other congregations and denominations, Riverside established a lecture series and a \"Fund for Social Justice\" that aimed to raise $450,000 over three years to help the poor in the local community. It fell short of the goal by almost $100,000.\n\nThe Black Manifesto's demands never caught fire in the broader U.S. religious community. The Rev. Gayraud Wilmore, a black Presbyterian leader in New York City in 1969, recalled 50 years later how religious institutions responded.\n\n\"I saw them withering and unable to step forward and say 'Let's be the church,'\" said Wilmore, now 98. \"I saw no bold action taken on our side to go along with the bold action Forman was taking.\n\n\"Five decades later, the reparations debate has reentered the national spotlight , with some religious institutions leading the way.\n\nEarlier in December, Reform Jews, declaring that \"racial inequity is present in virtually every aspect of American life,\" voted overwhelmingly to support a U.S. commission to develop proposals for reparations and urged conversations in their congregations to redress systemic racism.\n\nIn recent months, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary and Georgetown University have all announced plans to fund initiatives that would benefit the descendants of slaves, while Episcopal dioceses in New York and Long Island made million- and half-million-dollar commitments as reparations committees continued their work.\n\nIn May, the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland voted to study reparations and urge congregations to \"examine how their endowed wealth is tied to the institution of slavery.\n\n\"Maryland's African American bishop, Eugene Taylor Sutton, said tears came to his eyes when the measure passed at the diocese's general convention with no dissenting votes, and he realized that the assembled delegates, representing a membership that is 90% white, \"got it.\"\n\n\"They get this thing called justice, and when you put it in a frame that there is a basic injustice in this nation of stealing from generations of people and that has a direct effect on today, then people,\" Sutton said, \"they say, 'OK, we got to get that fixed.'\n\n\"Sutton, who testified before Congress in June with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates to advocate for the idea of a U.S. reparations commission, emphasized that reparations can come in many forms. Starting next month, members of his diocese will begin to consider options such as providing better access for people of color to home buying, job training and faculty positions at seminaries.\n\nIt has taken some American religious institutions 50 years to get their heads around reparations. When Forman hijacked that Sunday morning service, two-thirds of Riverside worshippers, including the minister, stormed out in protest. After activists occupied offices in the Interchurch Center of New York, a court issued restraining orders to bar Forman from the building. In Missouri, manifesto supporters in St. Louis carried out a series of \"Black Sunday\" protests, interrupting local services, which led to confrontations with white church members and arrests.\n\nThe manifesto was quite specific in its demands. Black activists would control the distribution of reparations. The $500 million (soon increased to $3 billion) would be spent on programs designed to ensure black self-determination. These included establishing a Southern land bank, publishing industries, television networks, job training centers, labor unions and a black university.\n\nThe manifesto's rhetoric was just as controversial. Written by Forman, a former member of the civil rights group known as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the preamble framed reparations in Marxist terms. \"Time is short,\" Forman wrote. \"(N)o oppressed people ever gained their liberation until they were ready to fight, to use whatever means necessary, including the use of force and power of the gun to bring down the colonizer.\n\n\"Prominent black and white religious leaders diverged on how to interpret Forman's call for revolution. The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, who succeeded the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, compared Forman to biblical prophets who spoke truth to power. Writing in The Christian Century, he asked, \"Was there not even a physical resemblance between Amos, the dusty-road-weary prophet in his desert garb, and Jim Forman in his dashiki?\"\n\nThe response from some white denominations was outright rejection. The Southern Baptist Convention dismissed the manifesto as \"outrageous.\" The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York called it un-American and touted its own programs for the \"needy and disadvantaged\" instead.\n\nThe American Jewish Committee, which as part of the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization had helped organize the National Black Economic Development Conference, withdrew from the IFCO. Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, IFCO's first president, resigned, stating hecould not \"in conscience stand by in silence and appear ... to give assent to the revolutionary ideology and racist rhetoric of the Black Manifesto.\n\n\"Other denominations were more ambivalent. The Reformed Church in America invited Forman to address its general synod after he occupied the denomination's headquarters a month after his action at Riverside. The Rev. Rand Peabody, a 22-year-old white seminarian who had already been slated to give the sermon the next day, revised his sermon after hearing news of Forman's \"liberation\" of the RCA's offices.\n\n\"I remember I said it's not a time for us to feel either blamed or shamed and certainly not a time to feel futile,\" Peabody, now 73, said in an interview. \"Our denomination, in his eye, did indeed have the power to play a part and we should accept that as almost a commissioning of the denomination to indeed step up to the plate and get involved in more focused and proactive ways.\n\n\"Like other denominations, the RCA didn't accede to Forman's demand that reparations be handed over freely. Instead the synod voted to create a $100,000 fund \"to be disbursed according to the decisions\" of a newly formed Black Council. The council then rejected the money.\"We just basically wanted to be at the table where decisions are being made and not considered an auxiliary or an offshoot or a secondhand portion of the denomination,\" said the Rev. Dwayne Jackson, a Hackensack, New Jersey, pastor, who was a panelist at an RCA event commemorating the manifesto in October titled \"Unfinished Business.\"\n\nJackson, who knew some members of the council from his childhood church in the Bronx, said the staffer hired to oversee the council was the church's first black executive. (Today, people of color comprise a third of the RCA's executive leadership team.)\n\nOther denominations acknowledged the grievances raised by the manifesto but rejected the solutions it proposed and even the language of \"reparations.\" Instead they created or continued programs aimed at helping poor blacks and others. The Presbyterian Committee on the Self-Development of People, the Evangelical Covenant Church's Fund for Disadvantaged Americans of Minority Groups and the Episcopal Church's General Convention Special Program were all created around the time of Forman's action.\n\nDominique DuBois Gilliard, the current director of the ECC's \"racial righteousness and reconciliation\" ministry, recently reflected on how this kind of response \"enacted a very problematic erasure of the black freedom struggle.\"\n\nMet with the manifesto's demands, \"the Covenant found it more palatable to shift the conversation to marginalization in general,\" Gilliard writes in the May/August edition of its Covenant Quarterly, which focused on the 50th anniversary of the manifesto. \"This response has strong parallels to proclamations that 'All Lives Matter' in response to the declaration 'Black Lives Matter.'\"\n\nThere has been a shift in recent years, however, which Gilliard has helped encourage. The ECC Resolution on Racism , passed in June, insists that \"the time is right for white clergy to attend to the sins of our own community and make a public commitment to prioritize antiracism work within our ministerium.\"\n\nNell Gibson, a member and former chair of the Episcopal Diocese of New York's Reparations Committee, recalled that in the wake of Forman's declaration - which resulted in the Episcopal Church's $200,000 donation to the National Committee of Black Churchmen - members of her Manhattan church created a Black and Brown Caucus . After receiving the $30,000 they demanded from their St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery, they developed a free breakfast program for children, a summer \"liberation school\" that taught minority children their ancestors' history and a prison law library.\n\nFifty years on, reparations are often framed as spiritual tests as much as financial ones. This year was named the \"Year of Apology\" for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and each Sunday Gibson's congregation has said a prayer that includes this sentence: \"For the many ways - social, economic and political - that white supremacy has accrued benefits to some of us at the expense of others, we repent.\"\n\nSoon, the diocesan reparations committee will consider a number of possible next steps, such as a truth and reconciliation commission or education and health care initiatives.\n\nLikewise, Sutton said his Maryland Episcopal diocese is moving methodically after years of conversation about reparations to figuring out how that will be lived out financially and otherwise.\n\n\"We don't have all the solutions, we don't know everything that's going to fix the problem and so we're going to be humble in even what we think we can accomplish,\" he said. \"But, by God, we're going to do something.\n\n\"This story is one in a series by Religion News Service about the future of segregation and integration in American religion, produced in partnership with Sacred Writes, a project that helps scholars share their research with a broader audience.\n\n-\n\nThis story is one in a series by Religion News Service about the future of segregation and integration in American religion, produced in partnership with Sacred Writes , a project that helps scholars share their research with a broader audience.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nAUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - Republican Gov. Paul LePage on Tuesday offered an erroneous history lesson about racial segregation to a black Georgia congressman who risked his life to fight for civil rights, and he called on the NAACP to apologize to white people.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who was beaten while marching in Selma, Alabama, with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., should be grateful to Republican presidents and shouldn't question the legitimacy of GOP President-elect Donald Trump's victory, LePage said.\n\n\"You know, I will just say this: John Lewis ought to look at history,\" LePage, who's white, said on WVOM-FM. \"You It was Abraham Lincoln that freed the slaves. It was Rutherford B. Hayes and Ulysses S. Grant that fought against Jim Crow laws. A simple thank you would suffice.\"\n\nLincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and pushed for the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery. But historians say LePage is wrong about Jim Crow laws, which legalized racial segregation.\n\nJim Crow laws didn't exist during the Grant administration and an electoral deal that put Hayes in office led to the end of Reconstruction and the removal of federal troops, setting the stage for the creation of Jim Crow laws that followed, said Colby professor Dan Shea.\n\n\"Paul LePage is going to give John Lewis a tutorial on the history of black oppression in the United States? That's rich,\" Shea said.\n\nLePage's criticism of Lewis comes on the heels of Lewis' comments last week that he would not attend Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"You know, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday.\n\nLewis' spokeswoman said Tuesday that the facts of history refute LePage's statements about the Jim Crow laws.\n\nLater in the afternoon, the governor tried to clarify his remarks to the Portland Press Herald by saying he felt all white people were being lumped together. He said that the \"NAACP should apologize to the white people, to the people from the North for fighting their battle.\"\n\nThe governor also said that \"the blacks, the NAACP\" paint white people with one brush and added that \"to say every white America is a racist is an insult.\" The governor has said a racist \"is the absolute worst, most vile thing you can call a person\" and last summer left an expletive-laced voicemail for a Democratic legislator that he thought called him a racist.\n\nLePage said he knows many Maine families who had ancestors who fought in the Civil War. Maine, the nation's whitest state, is 95 percent white, according to 2015 census estimates.\n\nThe head of the Portland branch of the NAACP says it's unfortunate that LePage tried to revise history and disparage a civil rights leader a day after Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nLePage on Tuesday also had harsh words for a Maine congresswoman who is among more than 40 House Democrats so far to say they are skipping Trump's inauguration. He said Rep. Chellie Pingree should resign if she doesn't attend.\n\n\"They're trying to bully us out of believing our Constitution,\" LePage said of Democrats.\n\nPingree said Monday that \"President-elect Trump's actions go beyond any kind of reasonable debate_they threaten the constitutional values our country is based on.\"\n\nPingree's office on Tuesday called LePage's remarks about Lewis divisive and inaccurate.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nMISSOULA, Mont. (AP) - For the world, the photograph of a Syrian 3-year-old in a red T-shirt and black sneakers, his lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach, was a horrific symbol of the desperation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.\n\nFor Mary Poole, a young mother haunted by \"those little shoes ... the little face,\" it was an inspiration.\n\nShe and members of her book club asked: Why not bring a small number of Syrian families to Missoula?\n\n___\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE - This story is part of Divided America, AP's ongoing exploration of the economic, social and political divisions in American society.\n\n___\n\nShe knows now that this was a \"romantic\" notion. \"It wasn't even a grain of sand in my brain that people wouldn't want to help starving, drowning families. I didn't do this to be controversial. I didn't do this to stir the pot.\"\n\nBut it did. And what started as a disagreement over whether to welcome dozens of refugees to this peaceful corner of western Montana soon erupted into something much larger, encompassing wildly divergent views of Islam, big government and whether Americans should \"take care of our own\" before worrying about newcomers.\n\nNeighboring counties - and in some cases, neighbors - locked horns.\n\nDemonstrators took to the streets: \"No Jobs, No Housing, No Free Anything,\" proclaimed some opponents' signs. Some warned that Islamic State terrorists could infiltrate their communities; others suggested that the federal government, long accused of tyranny in its dealings with the West, was at it again.\n\nThe refugees' supporters did not back off. \"Rise Above Fear, Refugees Welcome\" they declared.\n\nMissoula's mayor, John Engen, was among them. \"I think that the war on terror has produced an internal war on compassion,\" he says. \"We have been programmed to be very afraid since 9/11 and to think of people who aren't white Anglo-Saxon Americans as 'other' and we should be afraid of people who are 'other.'\"\n\nThis did not occur in a vacuum. What's happened here reflects what's happening across the nation in an election year dominated by inflammatory rhetoric over immigration, including calls for building a border wall, the mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally, and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the U.S.\n\nAnd more generally, Montanans are like other Americans who ask: How are we to live together, as one nation, when we are so estranged?\n\nAt a time when the public is polarized over issues ranging from gay marriage to guns, the Rev. Joseph Carver, pastor at St. Francis Xavier Parish, sees this as just another \"incarnation of the larger divide in the country.\" His congregation, which gathers in a towering 124-year-old brick structure with frescoes, ornate scroll work, is overwhelmingly in favor of refugees.\n\nCarver, like others here, believes the spark that ignited this conflict is fear. \"Refugees,\" he declares, \"are seen as a threat to our way of life.\"\n\nMontana is a place of great beauty, with its snow-capped mountains, Ponderosa pines, bighorn sheep, bison and elk. Fly fishermen reel in trout from shimmering streams. College kids can be spotted kayaking on the Clark Fork River on cool spring nights. And a bookstore owner can point to the park down the street where a moose is known to frequent.\n\nIt is not, however, a diverse place. Though the sparsely populated state is home to seven Indian reservations, nearly nine of 10 residents are white, according to Census figures. Only about 2 percent are foreign-born. Since 2012, the state has welcomed just 13 refugees from Cuba and Iraq, according to officials.\n\nBut Missoula, site of a World War II detention center for Japanese-Americans, Italian merchant seamen and others, has a recent history of embracing refugees. The International Rescue Committee resettled the Hmong in the late 1970s and through the 1980s; some remain as farmers. Later, another agency brought Ukrainians and Belarusians here.\n\nWith its coffee houses, murals and bike trails, Missoula has a laid-back feel. It is home to the University of Montana, as well as a peace center named for Jeannette Rankin, a pacifist who was the first woman member of Congress - and the only vote against declaring war on Japan after the Pearl Harbor attack. The center's philosophy is captured on a wall lined with bumper stickers - \"Peace is Patriotic,\" ''Books Not Bombs\" and \"Practice Nonviolence\" - and a stenciled message on a front window: \"Refugees Welcome.\"\n\nWhen Poole, a jewelry maker, and others formed a group called Soft Landing, they quickly expanded their plan to include not just Syrians but all refugees and turned to the International Rescue Committee to lead the resettlement. Their efforts were endorsed by the mayor, most council members and the three Democratic county commissioners, who sent letters to federal officials.\n\nBut Missoula is an island of progressive blue surrounded by a sea of conservative red, and often diverges politically from other communities in Montana.\n\nJust to the south, in rural and Republican Ravalli County, a county commissioners' hearing over the issue was moved to a middle school gym to accommodate the hundreds who showed up for what turned into a raucous meeting. Several pro-refugee speakers were jeered .The commissioners formalized their opposition in their own letter to federal officials- and Flathead County, nearly 130 miles north of Missoula, did the same weeks later.\n\nIn testimony and letters in Ravalli County, those saying \"no\" outlined their objections. They argued that Muslims or others from the Middle East could create the kind of chaos seen in Europe, impose an enormous tax burden and wouldn't be able to assimilate because they don't share American values. Many said their biggest fear was the U.S. government couldn't conduct adequate screening. Some spoke of apocalyptic visions of terrorists posing as refugees making their way to the quiet countryside.\n\n\"There's no 800 number you can call into Morocco or Libya or any one of those places ... and say, 'Can you check the identity of this person?' Without the ability to properly vet them, it's literally putting Americans' lives at risk,\" says Eli Anselmi, who felt compelled to write a letter even though he lives three hours away in Bozeman.\n\nThe risk may be minimal, he says, but the potential harm is great. \"Let's say that you have a bowl of M&Ms ... and there are two that have cyanide. Will you eat from that bowl?\"\n\nRay Hawk, a Ravalli County commissioner, has similar worries. \"These are folks that have declared war on the United States,\" he says. \"Their war is terrorism and that's the way they're going to do it. And I don't feel that we need to give them that chance. Now, if the government gets a handle on this thing and has a way to vet these people, I'm all for them. I love to see anybody come into America and succeed.\"\n\nSupporters of the refugees weighed in with reminders of America's tradition of providing sanctuary to those who've fled war and oppression; some cited their own family history. They spoke of empathy, pointed to a lengthy screening process and noted the other refugees who resettled here successfully in recent decades.\n\nShawn Wathen, a bookstore owner in Ravalli County, was appalled his 18-year-old son was booed when he testified in support of the refugees and then later cursed by some opponents. Wathen wrote the commissioners, accusing them of \"xenophobic grandstanding.\" One replied that he was \"ignorant.\"\n\nWathen, who has called the sprawling Bitterroot Valley home for 20 years, sees the rejection of refugees as a blend of misinformation, economic anxiety and fear of the unknown.\n\n\"It surpasses any notion of reason ... that kind of idea that they are not us, and therefore they pose a threat,\" he says. \"There's just that sense the horde is out there and if we don't circle the wagons ... we're going to be overrun and poor white America is going to suffer.\"\n\nAmerica has a long history of wariness of refugees.\n\nLast November, shortly after the Paris terrorist attacks, a Gallup poll found that Americans, by 60 to 37 percent, opposed taking in refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. In 1978, there was a 57 to 32 percent opposition to accepting Indochinese boat people, and in 1946, after World War II, the public was against welcoming displaced people from Europe, including Jews, by 72 to 16 percent.\n\nGenerally, Americans tend to favor refugees with whom they share some connection - political, religious or personal - and the public has little interaction with Muslims, says David Haines, a professor emeritus at George Mason University who has written extensively about refugees.\n\nHe says the public doesn't understand the rigorous vetting process. \"The risks from refugees are really low because it's an extremely well-screened population,\" he says. \"But it's hard for people to settle down on this issue, especially in a highly politicized context.\"\n\nIn Missoula, academics and religious leaders have expressed alarm about the harsh tone of the presidential campaign, especially comments aimed at Muslims by Donald Trump. In April, they sponsored \"Celebrate Islam Week\" at the university in hopes of countering the trend.\n\nAmong the participants was Samir Bitar, an Arabic studies professor who arrived at the University of Montana in the 1970s as a 16-year-old freshman, raised a family and has spent most of his adult life here.\n\nBitar has lectured for decades across the state without controversy - until this year, when about a dozen people in the nearby town of Darby objected to his planned talk at the library. The reason: They didn't want a Muslim in their town, according to the librarian. The library board voted. Bitar spoke and received a warm reception.\n\nBut the tone and atmosphere are decidedly different now, he says.\n\n\"This is the first time I actually look behind me as I walk. I've been here 42 years,\" he says. \"It's like every part of my identity is coming under attack, including my American identity.\"\n\nRecently, two students accepted Bitar's challenge to walk around wearing Muslim head gear to see how people would react. One young man donned a kufi, or skull cap, and classmates wouldn't sit next to him, Bitar says. While working at a deli, the student was rebuffed by a customer's wife who said: \"'We're not going to have a Muslim help us.'\"\n\nBitar, who is Palestinian, finds it all disheartening. People now are \"motivated by pure emotion and not really thinking in logical terms,\" he says. \"Fear turns into hatred.\"\n\nJameel Chaudhry, the campus architect, a native of Kenya and another member of the small Muslim community, says he, too, senses a new hostility.\n\n\"All of a sudden WE are the problem,\" he says. \"We've never had this before, and I've been here 20 years. We didn't have this even after 9/11.\"\n\nChaudhry attributes this attitude to Trump, accusing the presumptive Republican nominee of stoking fears for political gain.\n\n\"He's become the champion of the anti-Muslim, anti-refugee movement,\" he says. While that group talks of being tired of political correctness, Chaudhry sees something else: \"They don't want the other races coming in here.\"\n\nBut those who've publicly spoken out against refugees bristle at suggestions they're racist. They say they're trying to protect their communities.\n\n\"It doesn't make any difference if they're Muslims, Russians, whatever. You have to know who they are, what they've been doing in the past,\" says Jim Buterbaugh, a construction worker who organized three opposition rallies, including one at the state Capitol. \"Are you going to go downtown and take five people off the streets and move them into your house without knowing who they are? Nobody in their right mind would do that.\"\n\nHe and others are upset they have no vote on this issue. State and local governments legally don't have authority to bar refugees, though they can refuse to directly provide local services, according to Haines. Last fall, more than half the nation's governors declared their opposition to accepting Syrian refugees, saying a pause was needed until security concerns are addressed.\n\nThat sense of being shut out of decision-making reflects a wider distrust of the government in parts of the West, where federal policies involving land, water and endangered species often clash with energy, timber and grazing interests. Though the refugee debate is different, it exposes the same raw nerves among opponents, who also question the economic and social impact.\n\nIn a letter to her commissioners, Ravalli County resident Birte Nellessen said, \"to fool ourselves that we are helping 'poor folks driven out of their homeland by war' is ridiculous. They openly and blazingly state that they are coming to destroy us and our culture. ... Why we would spend any of our hard earned money on people like that?\"\n\nNellessen, who moved to the U.S. from Germany 20 years ago, says officials should instead support local folks in need and that a smarter course would be to send supplies or money to help refugees rebuild in their homeland.\n\n\"I mean, what's a Syrian or Kenyan going to do in winter in Montana? Seriously.\"\n\nThe answer is coming. The International Rescue Committee has met with Missoula's mayor, police chief and others to prepare for the refugees - about 100 will come over a year's time. The agency plans to reopen a resettlement office here this fall, after a 25-year absence. Those most likely to be relocated include Congolese, Afghans and Syrians who will have no family ties, so they'll have to live within a 50-mile radius of the office.\n\nMary Poole is looking forward to their arrival.\n\nAbout 750 people have signed up to help refugees make the transition, she says. One former Missoula resident now living in Mongolia wants to get involved when she returns.\n\nPoole is already thinking ahead, too, about how this could change the life of her 17-month-old son, Jack.\n\nShe envisions a day, she says, when he \"will be able to sit in a school next to someone of a different color, of a different language, of a different culture - and be able to learn that he lives in a global world. ... I don't think we can be insulated anymore.\"\n\nPoole knows resistance remains, and still meets with those who don't want refugees here. She says she's even made friends with some vocal opponents, recently inviting them to her house for a barbecue.\n\n\"We're asking for compassion,\" she says, \"and must be able to give that ourselves.\"\n\nAnd there's always a chance to win some over.\n\n\"They are us,' she says of the opponents. \"They are part of our community, and in order for this to be as successful as it possibly can be, it's about being in it together.\"\n\n___\n\nSharon Cohen, a Chicago-based national writer, can be reached at [email protected]\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - A libertarian author who has been called a white nationalist said college students who protested his guest lecture this week were \"scary.\"\n\nMiddlebury College said a professor was injured by a protester following a demonstration against guest speaker Charles Murray on Thursday.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center considers Murray a white nationalist who uses \"racist pseudoscience and misleading statistics to argue that social inequality is caused by the genetic inferiority of the black and Latino communities, women and the poor.\" Protests of Murray's lecture forced the college to move it to another room.\n\nThe college said Murray and professor Allison Stanger were surrounded by a group of protesters who became violent after the talk and a protester pulled Stanger's hair, twisting her neck. It said the group climbed onto the hood of a car carrying Murray and Stanger and threw a traffic sign in front of it.\n\nThe college's public safety officials cleared a path for the car to leave campus.\n\nStanger was treated at a hospital and was released. Murray, who wrote \"The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life\" and \"Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010,\" tweeted that the Middlebury College administration \"was exemplary.\"\n\n\"The students,\" he tweeted, \"were seriously scary.\"\n\nCollege president Laurie L. Patton said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by the events she witnessed and said members of the college community had \"failed to live up to our core values.\" She said she believed many of the protesters were \"outside agitators\" but there were indications Middlebury students also were involved.\n\nShe apologized to people who attended the lecture in good faith, to Murray and to Stanger \"for the way they were treated during the event and, especially, afterward.\"\n\n\"Today,\" she wrote in a letter to the college community, \"our community begins the process of addressing the deep and troubling divisions that were on display last night.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

People need to feel like the government and the police are there to protect them and not to prey on them.\" (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The rumor spread quickly: A man had been beaten to death by police. For blacks - frustrated by high unemployment, inadequate schools, substandard housing - yet another abuse by police was too much to bear, and they erupted.\n\nThere were no shouts that black lives mattered. This was Newark in 1967, long before deaths at the hands of police in cities like Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, gave birth to another movement in another era.\n\nFor four days in July, Newark was the epicenter of black rage. The rioting left 26 dead, more than 700 injured and nearly 1,500 arrested, mostly black. In addition to the $10 million in property damage, the riots left economic and emotional scars on Brick City that, in many ways, have not yet healed.\n\nNewark was a deadly entry in the long list of major urban areas that exploded over a five-year period, among them Watts in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston and New York's Harlem. Days after Newark burned, Detroit followed. The disorders exposed - for the first time to much of white America - racial and economic disparities that went far beyond the familiar scenes of segregation in the South.\n\n\"A riot is at the bottom of the language of the unheard,\" the Rev. Martin Luther King wrote in his last book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\" in 1967. \"The amazing thing about the ghetto is that so few Negroes have rioted.\"\n\nThe rioters spoke loudly, but were they heard? The echoes of 1967 in today's America would suggest they were not, and the lessons not learned linger for a new generation where racial tensions, indifference and inaction persist.\n\n___\n\n\"People were thinking about who they were, and thinking that they deserved more as American citizens,\" said Komozi Woodard, who grew up in Newark and was 18 years old at the time of the riots. \"It went from a situation that was unbearable, to the community feeling it was unacceptable.\"\n\nAs a 12-year-old black boy, Woodard was beaten by a street gang in his neighborhood. His mother called the police for help, and when they arrived, the officers beat her son, too.\n\nIt was 1961, and Woodard had learned his first lesson about the relationship between police and his community.\n\n\"I believed in the system, and the system came out and beat me up,\" said Woodard, now 68 and a history professor at Sarah Lawrence College. \"It was an everyday occurrence for police to just beat people up. There was no place you could go.\"\n\nBy 1967, as whites fled for the suburbs and were replaced with a wave of black and brown residents, Newark was New Jersey's largest city and the country's first majority-black city aside from Washington. Many blacks were part of the Great Migration to escape the de jure Jim Crow of the Deep South, only to find de facto segregation in the North.\n\nMost of Newark's power structure remained white. Only 11 percent of its police force was black; citizen complaints about treatment by police routinely went unanswered and the few black officers on the force had little opportunity for advancement or leadership.\n\nBy July 12, Newark's black residents had had enough.\n\nJohn W. Smith, a black man, was driving his cab when he was pulled over by two white Newark police officers. Smith and the officers' version of events diverged - there were no body cameras then to record the exchange - but Smith was badly beaten during his arrest.\n\nSmith was taken to a police precinct directly across from Hayes Homes. Residents who saw him dragged inside assumed he'd been killed by the officers, and word spread quickly through the crowded housing project.\n\nThough Smith was treated at a hospital and later released, a riot broke out that night, followed by looting. The unrest continued for three more nights. State police and National Guard troops were called in to quell the uprising.\n\nFred Means, a teacher and activist with the Congress of Racial Equality in Newark at the time, recalled seeing police join in the looting along with some residents.\n\n\"That really symbolized the whole tenor and system of corruption that was going on,\" said Means, now 84 and living in Monroe, New Jersey. \"It was like a war scene. There was that fear, there was that possibility, that the police would shoot you and nothing would happen - much the same as what happens today.\"\n\nMany of the scenes that unfolded in Newark have resembled the conflict of the last few years: Residents clashing with police wearing riot gear and driving armored vehicles down city streets, mass arrests, and government officials calling for curfews in an attempt to restore order and frustrated citizens burning neighborhood storefronts.\n\nJunius Williams was a law student at Yale University fighting gentrification in Newark when the riots broke out. He was driving back from a \"black power\" conference in Philadelphia when news of the riots came across his car radio.\n\n\"This was the rebellion that people had predicted because it had been happening all over the country, and Newark was no different,\" said Williams, 73, now a professor at Rutgers University in Newark. \"There was no representation in government and people were taking advantage of black folks and it was only so much people were going to take. It was on.\"\n\nAs he was driving friends home on the second night of the riots, Williams faced down a police officer wielding a shotgun during a traffic stop. He was spared, he says, when a sergeant defused the situation by searching Williams' car for guns. He found only law books.\n\n___\n\nThe 1967 riots prompted President Lyndon Johnson to launch an inquiry into the cause of the racial disorders. Among the findings of the Kerner Commission were that the country \"is moving toward two societies, one black, one white - separate and unequal.\" The report identified police practices as among the primary factors that led to the unrest in black communities.\n\n\"The abrasive relationship between the police and the minority communities has been a major - and explosive - source of grievance, tension and disorder,\" the report read. \"The blame must be shared by the total society.\"\n\nThe commission recommendations to improve police-community relations included a review of police operations to eliminate abrasive practices, more police protection to inner-city residents, more hiring and promotion of black officers and a means for residents to file complaints against the police.\n\nNationally, there are now greater systems of accountability for police officers, who are the best trained generation of law enforcement officers in the country's history, said Phillip Atiba Goff, co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity. Still, a lack of national metrics to track police behavior shows an uneven progress.\n\n\"What it says is that we have not taken seriously the problem of race in America on a number of fronts, including policing,\" Goff said. \"As a result, we're doomed to repeat the history from which we have not learned.\"\n\nThe conclusions reached in the 2015 Justice Department report on Ferguson sounded similar to the Kerner Commission's findings.\n\nIn 1970, Newark became the first Northeastern city to elect a black mayor. Its police force became more diverse, and more officers lived in the city they were charged with serving. Today, 38 percent of the police department is black and 40 percent is white. The city's overall population is much the same as in 1967: 52 percent black and 26 percent white.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the riots, more affordable housing was built and the city was forced to provide better health care in a deal to build a new medical center.\n\n\"We could not have done that without that invisible brother with the brick standing with us in the negotiating room,\" said Williams. \"The power structure was afraid. They thought it was going to happen again.\"\n\nIn other ways, progress has been slow to arrive.\n\nIn the wake of the riots, economic development was largely limited to the city's downtown, where whites worked. The poverty level for black residents is 33 percent, and Newark residents hold only 18 percent of all jobs in the city.\n\nIn 2016, the police department was put under federal consent decree after a Justice Department investigation found officers were making unlawful stops and arrests, using excessive force and retaliating against residents. Fifty years after Newark, similar recommendations are still being made as part of the federal consent decrees reached between cities and local police departments - including Ferguson, Chicago, Cleveland and New Orleans - found to have discriminatory practices against minority residents.\n\n\"We are a long way from 1967, but we are even further away from where we need to be to prevent 1967 from happening again,\" said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, whose father, poet and activist Amiri Baraka, was badly beaten during the riots. \"There were a myriad of things that were suggested, and frankly they were ignored. People need to feel like the government and the police are there to protect them and not to prey on them.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more on the riots, including historical stories and photos, and video interviews with people who lived through them, visit http://www.apnews.com/tag/1967Riots.\n\n___\n\nErrin Haines Whack is a member of The Associated Press' race and ethnicity team.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks as he tours an emergency operations center and meets with law enforcement officers at Mary D. Bradford High School, Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020, in Kenosha, Wis. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nPresident Donald Trump tours an area on Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020, damaged during demonstrations after a police officer shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nKENOSHA, Wis. (AP) - After struggling for much of the year to settle on a clear and concise reelection message, President Donald Trump appears to have found his 2020 rallying cry.\n\nFour years ago, it was \"Build the Wall,\" a simple yet coded mantra to white America that nonwhite outsiders threatened their way of life. This week, Trump has re-centered his campaign on another three-word phrase that carries a similar racial dynamic: \"Law and Order.\"\n\nFor much of the summer, the Republican president flirted with the bumper-sticker slogan championed by Richard Nixon and George Wallace in 1968. But Trump sharply increased his focus on law and order after a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, multiple times last week as Blake's three children watched, sparking protest-related violence.\n\nThe president toured the Midwestern city on Tuesday, meeting with law enforcement officials and businesses affected by the protests. He largely ignored Blake's family.\n\nTrump referred to protest-related violence as \"domestic terror\" while decrying \"violent mobs\" that demolished or damaged two dozen local businesses.\n\n\"Kenosha has been ravaged by anti-police and anti-American riots,\" he declared.\n\nThe president's shifting message, which draws from Nixon's half-century-old political playbook, carries risks just nine weeks before Election Day.\n\nFirst, it ignores the health and economic crises affecting tens of millions of Americans under Trump's watch. Democrat Joe Biden has repeatedly accused Trump of surrendering to the pandemic, and the president's focus on isolated incidents of violence amid such widespread suffering threatens to reinforce Biden's point. The pandemic's death toll exceeded 184,000 Americans on Tuesday with no end in sight.\n\nSecond, history suggests that Trump's strategy won't work given that any violence that occurs is happening under his presidency.\n\nNixon invoked law-and-order rhetoric to win white voters in 1968, but he was forced to abandon it once he became the incumbent, according to Princeton University history professor Kevin Kruse. Nixon adopted a new message after Republicans suffered deep losses in the 1970 midterm elections when they sought to resurrect law and order as a focus.\n\nNearly 50 years later, Trump's GOP also suffered deep losses in the 2018 midterms after the president warned that a massive caravan of Latin American immigrants was trying to cross the southern border - a variation of the same message he's embracing this year. Instead of immigrants in 2020, however, Trump's peddling notions of dangerous mobs of largely African American rioters.\n\n\"The problem is if you're the incumbent, you represent the law and the order,\" Kruse said. \"An incumbent who presses the issue is effectively making the case for his opponent, not himself.\"\n\nKruse noted that Biden has already borrowed a page from history to challenge Trump's strategy. The Democratic nominee on Monday used the same \"are you better off?\" rhetoric successfully employed by Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan when they defeated incumbent presidents.\n\n\"Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?\" Biden asked Monday in a speech in Pennsylvania. \"He keeps telling us if he was president you would feel safe. Well, he is president.\"\n\nTrump is also applying the law-and-order mantra selectively. While he decries violence, he excused his overwhelmingly white supporters who clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters last weekend in Portland, Oregon, saying their use of paintball guns was a \"defensive mechanism.\" And as he blasted troublemakers, he suggested that a white 17-year-old who has been charged with killing two men during the mayhem in Kenosha acted in self-defense.\n\nStill, for lack of any other cohesive message as the 2020 election enters its final phase, Trump is going all in on law and order, which is aimed directly at the same coalition of white, suburban and rural voters who fueled his White House victory four years ago.\n\nThe states Trump's campaign has targeted for expansion in 2020, Minnesota and New Hampshire, are all far whiter than the nation as a whole with large shares of suburban and rural populations. Such voters were far more sympathetic to Trump's nationalistic immigration and economic policies four years ago, and his campaign believes they will be receptive to his law and order messaging now.\n\nWhile the nation's attitudes toward racial injustice shifted dramatically after the death of George Floyd in police custody in May was captured on video, Trump's team is convinced that months of occasionally violent protests - and the president's persistent highlighting of them - have changed the calculus for some voters.\n\nFor months, Trump and his allies have tried to hold deep-blue cities as the cautionary tale for the nation. With Kenosha, they believe they have their proof positive to Trump's warning to suburban voters that their towns could be next.\n\nRecent polling suggests that public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which peaked after Floyd's death, has leveled off.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll found that approval of the protests among Wisconsin voters slipped from 61% in June to 48% in August. Favorable views of the Black Lives Matter movement also dipped from 59% to 49% over the same period, although Wisconsinites were still more likely to have a favorable opinion than an unfavorable one of the movement.\n\nAnd voters were not pleased with Trump's handling of the protests: 58% disapproved and just 32% approved, Marquette found.\n\nYet Trump's allies believe there has been a definite shift in the suburbs, particularly among suburban men.\n\n\"The suburbs have turned against civil unrest,\" said Wes Anderson, a Republican pollster for the Trump-affiliated political organization America First Policies.\n\n\"The Democrats have touted for a year now, or longer, that Republicans are screwed because we don't have an answer to suburban women who've turned against us. But what we've seen is that we do very well with suburban white men, and we shouldn't be so scared of the gender gap,\" Anderson continued. \"Right now, the president's advantage with suburban white men is greater than deficit with suburban white women.\"\n\nThere is reason to be skeptical that protest-related violence will continue to be a top priority for swing voters throughout the fall, especially if the incidents of looting and violence subside as they have in other cities over the summer.\n\nBut for now, Trump is betting his political future on law and order.\n\nThe people of Kenosha, he said Tuesday, \"want people that are going to keep them safe, where their houses aren't broken into, where they're not raped and murdered.\"\n\nTrump added: \"They want law and order.\"\n\n___\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE - National Political Writer Steve Peoples has covered presidential politics for The Associated Press since 2011.

      "text": "When Will White America Be Ready to Talk About Slavery?\n\nContributing Editor\n\nI was taken by his smooth, leathery brown skin, his broad head covered in fine hair and the dimple in his chin. What I remember most is the slight smile, his kind, yet serious eyes. The formal military photograph, decades old by then and framed in silver, sat on a high shelf in the dining room, above the lace-topped Formica dining-room table. A photo of my brother Terrence, dressed in his stately blue Air Force uniform, stood next to it.\n\nBetween tending to his rose bushes and plucking mangoes from a tree out back, my grandfather Roy, a World War II veteran, would often start-though rarely finish-various family stories. Like clockwork, as another tale took flight, my grandmother Catherine-a diminutive creature with a booming voice-would set him right about the facts of the matter and conclude with her own flourishes. Grandpa Roy spoke little of his military service, and I remember just one family conversation he was part of that openly involved race.\n\nThere had been riots in Miami that year and the two of them barely made it through a throng of rock-throwing looters. It was 1980. In Grandma Cat's telling, they came to a makeshift road block. White drivers were dragged from their cars and beaten. Black people were allowed to pass upon inspection. Quickly assessing the situation, Roy waved his clenched fist out the window. Catherine yanked it back, thrusting her own darker arm so the rioters could see it. \"Your grandfather and his light-bright-almost-white behind nearly got us killed out there,\" she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRoy shrugged. He didn't like talking about that day. In fact, I can scarcely remember a foul word from him about anything really. He preferred Cardinals baseball and the pretty girls at a nearby bus stop above almost all else. For the most part, whatever his lot in this life, he had resigned himself to it. It should be said that Cat was the hero in nearly every story she ever told.\n\nTo the victor goes the spoils, according to the old adage. Among the lands and treasures taken as booty is also the pen that writes the story. To be sure, the history of this nation, from its birth to present day, has been written and sometimes rewritten at the pleasure and whim of its privileged class. The work of its Founding Fathers is held out as unimpeachably moral and courageous, in the name of perfecting this union.\n\nThat history, in that telling, has long been a cudgel of the conquerors and their descendants.\n\nEven now, as The New York Times published The 1619 Project -a collection of essays meant to begin righting that history-a coterie of conservatives responded by evoking the grandeur of their own ideologically tainted narrative, to reduce any complicity in the blood and muck endured by the slaves and how mightily the country profited from that suffering. Led by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a history professor prone to rhetorical flourishes and racial bombast who once called for the return of orphanages for poor children, is now calling that American history unworthy of inspection lest it challenge their present station. It is easier, I imagine, to forget the plunder and malice, to forget the scourge of white supremacy.\n\nThe left doesn't get it. Slavery was AND IS terrible (there are slaves today who need liberating). A 1619 history of slavery project is great. Insisting that slavery is THE defining reality of America is simply factually wrong.\n\nClearly, Gingrich had not read the work he was attacking. How else to explain his dismissal of a work that begins with a rejection of anti-American nihilism as \"propaganda\" designed to \"brainwash\" readers? In a Fox News segment, he complained that \"several hundred thousand white Americans who died in the Civil War\" were not given their due. The project, he complained, is a \"lie\" and is ultimately about impeaching Donald Trump. Others complained that by writing about slavery and its legacy, the paper of record aimed to delegitimize America , and further divide and demoralize its citizenry .\n\nSuch arguments are especially revealing. Representatives of the GOP, which has become the de facto party of White America, insists we must move beyond race with no recognition of how it continues to inform our modern-day politics. Those petty grievances, shared by many though certainly not all white Americans, reflect the extent to which African-American voices have been historically muted and erased in service of political power. For conservatives, it seems anything short of flag-waving patriotism does not merit publication. In their telling, to sully that history with the truth of our founding undermines our collective values and is nothing short of blasphemous.\n\nThe Editor continued: \"Race in the next year...is going to be a huge part of the American story. And I mean, race in terms of not only African Americans and their relationship w/ Donald Trump, but Latinos & immigration.\" So, he's explicit that this is the political narrative. 5/x https://t.co/NvAAKRKBE7\n\nDespite the soil tilled, the lashes endured and the industries built on slave labor, they believe their claim to the American story is absolute.\n\nEvery Fourth of July my late uncle proudly hoisted an American flag into its place on the center porch pillar. Albert Ross was a Korean War veteran, who lied about his age to join his brother in the Army. Is this not his America too? Is our story not theirs?\n\nHe was not alone in his service and sacrifice.\n\nIn my family there were also Navy petty officers, seamen, ensigns and lieutenants, several Army privates and a Marine lance corporal, serving at home and abroad. A Marine Corps private first class, my great aunt, was stationed at Quantico during World War II, while her husband and brother-in-law-one Marine, the other Army-wielded rifles on faraway battlefields. There is an Army command sergeant major and a Naval officer-both now retired and pursuing an advanced education. There is a soon-to-be PhD and two masters degrees among them, but most had little more-and sometimes less-than a high-school diploma. One of them had a voice so glorious he could have regaled audiences at Carnegie Hall. His son, a standout high basketball star with state titles under his belt, followed him into Army service and his daughter enlisted in the Air Force. I enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1987.\n\nNone of us was drafted.\n\nThis I know. The men and women in my family enlisted in the military out of love of country and the chance to fight for a liberty they did not always know at home. For some of them, like Ross and Roy, home was a place where voting, taking a seat at a lunch counter and failing to show an appropriate measure of respect could cost them their lives. Some, like my grandfather Reginald and aunt Juanita, were the sons and daughters of sharecroppers, washerwomen and porters. All were scions of slaves, human chattel in the same country to which they had given their blood and pledged their allegiance.\n\nThe elder among them served in segregated regiments. They were cooks, journalists, admins, medics, supply clerks, radio operators, fighter jet mechanics and infantrymen. All but two survived the beaches of Normandy, the mountains of Korea and the sands of Iraq-at least in body, if not always whole in spirit. But for this writing, their stories-and countless others-would go untold.\n\nI think of them now-my grandfathers, uncles, cousins, nephews and brothers-their lives given as in the cause of other people's freedom. I remember the array of framed photographs my Aunt Geraldine proudly hung in her living room and the others that stood on a high shelf in my grandmother's home.\n\nLest I be mistaken, military service is not a requirement of patriotism, nor does hanging a flag outside one's house it ensure it. But as Hannah Nicole Jones writes in introducing The 1619 Project, \"Our founding ideals of liberty and equality were false when they were written. Black Americans fought to make them true.\" That fight manifested itself on plantations and battlefields, in school rooms and courthouses. The fight to perfect this union crowded on to the Washington Mall, walked the Edmund Pettus Bridge and marched through the streets of Memphis. It prayed in the pews and shouted on the avenues, in a faith that one day we might recognize the original sin on which this nation was built and devote ourselves to living out, as Dr. King pronounced, \"the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"\n\nTo do so means to confront our history of exploitation and oppression. It means to pay homage and credence to the notion that no nation can call itself exceptional while rejecting its own history. The arrival of the first slaves in 1619, the inauguration of \"a barbaric system of chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years,\" as Jones writes, is as much a part of that story as the first shots of the American Revolution.\n\nThat we, their descendants, would now raise our voices and our pens to tell that story and its consequences should be embraced.\n\nContributing Editor\n\ngoldietaylor@me.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "We're Watching White Anxiety Turn Into Violent Rage\n\nDuring Barack Obama 's first presidential campaign I can remember very clearly an extended family member saying, \"There is no way America elects a Black man to that office, but I'm proud he's trying.\"\n\nThen, once Obama won, the sentiments of \"never\" from one family member grew to a chorus of Black people holding their breath that he wouldn't be assassinated and/or harmed following his history-making election.\n\nWhile many during those first few years wanted to tout America's new status as \"post-racial,\" Black and brown America knew the truth. While his election wins in both 2008 and 2012 were indeed historic, the whitelash that had been brewing since the advent of birtherism and the Tea Party would soon manifest itself in an upending of all that \"post-racial\" hope. That's when Republicans nominated the anti-Obama-a man who ramped up racial anxieties rather than speaking to them with compassion and nuance- Donald J. Trump .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump is (and always has been) a caricature of white privilege and white resentment. A silver spoon heir to a multimillionaire, whose failures in business were repeatedly bailed out by Daddy, he somehow conned people into buying his image as the savior of poor white America. He rebuffed political norms and embraced the \"good old days\" of unapologetic racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia-all while embracing white nationalism and fetishizing the American flag .\n\nWhile the Obama era made us believe in our better angels and our better selves-Trumpism had a substantial portion of white America believing that their rejection of equity and inclusivity is some perverse form of patriotism. While Obamaism was about multiculturalism and the abundance of this country's offerings, Trumpism emphasized scarcity-the idea that America's bounties are zero sum, and that white Americans needed to stake their claim to what is theirs alone, what they are owed, and who they should hate and fear encroaching on \"their America.\"\n\nBut this didn't start with Trump.\n\nMany white Americans have been fed a very purposeful lie that began in kindergarten, one that instilled a belief in their excellence and benevolence.\n\nThey learned from the time that they could read and write that white people discovered this country and turned it into something the world bowed to and held up as a beacon.\n\nFrom art to music to innovation, they were fed a steady diet of their heroes. Even former slave owners were given the benefit of the doubt to the \"thinking of their time,\" but were otherwise characterized as good people-glossing over the enslavement and torture of other human beings they deemed as chattel to build \"their nation\" from scratch. They were told wonderful stories of Thanksgiving, instead of the massacres and genocide of an entire Indigenous population at the hands of their ancestors. They were fed stories of love affairs between slave owners like Thomas Jefferson and his enslaved captive, Sally Hemings, but not the reality of rape, abuse, and human property. They were taught about the innovators of government, like Robert Moses , but not his rampant racism that was the basis for their urban planning-the creation of highways that purposefully drove a stake through the heart of Black communities.\n\nThese lies are just the tips of the melting iceberg of white exceptionalism. And it's the desperate need for white dominance and power-the \"we must fight like hell to take our country back\" mentality-that is steadily becoming a violent reality.\n\nOn Fox News and other right-wing media, the lies of the \"Great Replacement Theory,\" nefarious Jewish power, rampant Black criminals, undocumented \"invaders,\" the grooming of children, and stolen elections are driving white anxiety, stoking the flames of which have inspired the rise of white domestic terrorism. In less than two years, we've witnessed an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, a conspiracy to kidnap a Democratic governor, and a likely assassination attempt on the Speaker of the House and her family.\n\n\"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you,\" said President Lyndon B. Johnson, 60 years ago.\n\nIt's a prescient quote, but it's missing the specifics of how this strategy is deployed-using fear and dehumanization.\n\nIf you can convince white people that the opposition is a group of crazed \"groomers\" looking to make their children into \"deviants,\" and that they're stealing \"your America\"-then the violent actions they take against these \"invaders\" and \"pedophiles\" isn't violence at all, it's patriotism in defense of their America.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best in Where Do We Go From Here : \"Whites, it must frankly be said, are not putting in a similar mass effort to reeducate themselves out of their racial ignorance. It is an aspect of their sense of superiority that the white people of America believe they have so little to learn.\"\n\nWhat white Americans still in thrall of the myth of Great White America must reckon with is the truth-their America has been a lie designed not for their comfort, but for their continued control. And they need to recognize that there are things worth loving about America-like diversity, true freedom, and democracy. But what they need to realize most of all is that these things are not a threat to them; rather, the myth of white greatness is a threat to us all.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Donald Trump, the President of White America\n\nThe things Donald Trump says are like shiny, terrible objects, alluring in their horror.\n\nHis proclamations are driven by impotent, unearned swagger. His outbursts are full of impish defiance that makes for compelling entertainment to those who regard our politics as spectacle. Bombastic moments like his combative defense Tuesday of the white supremacist demonstration and subsequent terrorism in Charlottesville , Virginia , are at once revealing and concealing about the truly nefarious work of his presidency.\n\nWhat was crystal clear from Trump's presser at his New York tower was that he thought Monday's statement was enough. Having finally given the most boilerplate of condemnations to the racists who staged a torch rally last Friday and instigated a violent riot on Saturday that ended with a counter-protester murdered, the president showed his annoyance when the assembled press pressed him to go beyond \"racism is evil.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo Trump reverted to form, ripping the \"fake news\" and again blaming \"both sides\" of the Charlottesville confrontation, emphasizing the supposedly violent impulses of the \"alt-left,\" whatever that is. He also tried to validate the racists for \"protesting\" the impending removal of the Robert E. Lee statue, arguing that by taking down Confederate memorials, \"You're changing history. You're changing culture.\"\n\nHe went to say that most of the people there for the white supremacist rally weren't white supremacists, just statue enthusiasts: \"You had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.\n\n\"OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.\"\n\nHe added a strange hypothetical: \"This week, it is Robert E. Lee and this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nIt's not clear what will stop Trump, and I don't expect him to suffer any real consequences from his fellow Republicans. There will be another series of statements strenuously objecting, followed by even more inaction. Perhaps a few of them will say that they'll pray for him, as they do after most calamities. But they'll stand by as his argument rings like music in the ears of white supremacists like former Klan leader David Duke, who tweeted , \"Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville.\" Trump just gave comfort to the enemy, in a literal sense.\n\nOn Monday, as Trump was placating pundits with his temporarily humane remarks about the Charlottesville chaos, Foreign Policy reported that both the FBI and Homeland Security issued a fresh warning about the emergence of white supremacist groups, the kind of warning Republicans were loath to hear from the Obama administration in the past. In a May 10 report, both federal agencies wrote that these racist groups were the most prolific domestic terrorists since the year 2000-49 homicides in 26 attacks, per the report. It also indicated that \"lone actors and small cells within the white supremacist movement likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year.\"\n\nTrump's inaction is more insidious. During his 2016 campaign, the president openly embraced white nationalism to get out the vote, never minding the monsters he was encouraging to become more public. Since he has been in office, his administration has taken concrete steps to not only further the policy goals of white supremacists, but to give them more leeway to spread their violence. In February, he proposed refocusing an anti-terrorism task force, Countering Violent Extremism, to focus solely on Islamists. Homeland Security also halted a $400,000 grant for Life After Hate, a group dedicated to de-radicalizing neo-Nazis. Weeks before the Charlottesville demonstrations and Heather Heyer's murder, the grant was formally revoked-thanks in no small part to Katherine Gorka , a national security analyst married to Sebastian Gorka, the ex-Breitbart editor and current Trump White House official tied to a Nazi-linked group in his native Hungary.\n\nFormer Breitbart editor in chief Stephen Bannon is still Trump's chief strategist. Stephen Miller , a former associate of neo-Nazi Richard Spencer, is now being discussed as a possible candidate for White House communications director.\n\nHowever scattershot his White House has been to this point, though, Trump is remarkably constant in at least two respects: his lack of respect for the rule of law, and his willingness to scapegoat people of color for political gain. Whereas his lack of experience in government has proven to be a problem, his long history of racial provocation and his consistent belief in selective application of constitutional freedoms have been part of what's kept his political support from entirely collapsing.\n\nTrump's policy aims, to the extent he has them, is a combination of initiatives that make rich men richer, along with enough candy for the bigots who proved so essential to his political coalition. At his press conference, as he was bombarded with questions about his equation of other protesters with literal Nazis, he insisted that growing the economy was the best path to racial harmony. But violence is one of the main dialects of white supremacists; in a world in which their cause is becoming ever more futile, they communicate their objectives through intimidation and weapons of all kinds. Now, they've murdered someone with a car. Yet this president feeds the tide of white extremism for his own political benefit.\n\nWhether it's backing voter purges, encouraging more police violence, or working to kill funding for family planning services that primarily help poor women of color, this White House has put in motion an agenda that would make America a tougher place for black people to live and thrive. Trump's policies have further enabled the harassment and discrimination against Muslim immigrants, and have used Hispanic and Latino immigrants as a cultural scapegoat. What's more, he does all this while saying as little as possible about the scourge of domestic terrorism perpetrated by white extremists.\n\nHis tantrums are shocking and unbecoming, surely. But as we react in horror and debate Trump's sanity and his unsuitability for the White House, we should be just as outraged about him doing the very work of white supremacy that the Charlottesville terrorists sought to protect. He gave evil a pass during Tuesday's rant, proving that he's willing to ignore his core duty as president to ensure public safety. There are consequences, after all, to enabling terrorists.\n\njamilsmith@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "When N.W.A. Terrified White America\n\nSenior Political Reporter\n\nYou'll have to wait 'til August to see Straight Outta Compton , the biopic on N.W.A , the groundbreaking gangsta rap group that rose to fame in the late Reagan era. But the trailer for the film, released during the 2015 Grammy Awards, is now online, featuring an introduction by Dr. Dre and Ice Cube:\n\n\"In 1984, I met Compton's best DJ,\" Ice Cube said in a statement to MTV News. \"His name was Dr. Dre, the cousin of my homie Sir Jinx. He liked the neighborhood rhymes I was spitting and we started hanging out all the time. Talking and thinking music. A couple of years later, Dr. Dre's little hustling friend Eric ( Eazy-E ) Wright started coming around. We all created a song together called 'Boyz-N-The-Hood'...and the world would never be the same.\"\n\nNearly three decades on, few recall just how terrifying N.W.A-short for \"Niggaz With Attitude\"-was to many Americans in the late '80s. The group's protest anthem \" Fuck tha Police \" pissed off the LAPD, the FBI, and the Secret Service . Its music was banned from public libraries , radio , and retail chains. And the politicians, pundits, and protesters readily sharpened the culture-war knives.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We're letting people know that America's not a bowl of cherries,\" Dr. Dre said in 1989. \"People expect it to be all sunshine and palm trees. I don't see any palm trees where I'm from.\"\n\nHere are three news clips that show how dangerous-both on a political and cultural level-the rap group was when it exploded onto the national stage:\n\n'Frankly Offensive'\n\nThis CBS piece highlights the efforts of the Minnesota attorney general, Hubert Humphrey III, to prosecute record stores that sold N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton to minors. \"This is frankly offensive to me, and to any parent,\" he said of his efforts. \"If they were to hear and know what these lyrics were all about, they would know that they're nothing but filth.\" Oddly enough, Humphrey's problem lay with the group's sexually explicit lyrics and not their violent content.\n\nYoung Black Men & Law Enforcement\n\nThis segment, also from CBS, is drawn from a larger piece on the role of \"gangsta rap\" in anti-police rhetoric. N.W.A was at the center of a running debate over whether the rappers were inciting violence or merely describing existing social conditions in urban neighborhoods. Police unions came out strongly against N.W.A's \"obscenity-filled message for law enforcement.\"\n\nThe World's Most Dangerous Group\n\nThis clip is from a Chris Rock -narrated VH1 documentary on the group. Featuring clips from some goofy, more sympathetic white reporters, it examines how N.W.A gained acceptance from the mainstream media, which would eventually amplify the group's message: \"The controversy over their music had opened the door for gangsta rap, exposing it to suburban America,\" Rock says.\n\nSenior Political Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Black People Should Stop Expecting White America to 'Wake Up' to Racism\n\nAfter the race-related events of the past few weeks and months , it's clear that the people who speak for black America Have a Dream, in the wake of the one Dr. King so resonantly expressed.\n\nThe idea is that the Civil Rights revolution of the 1960s wasn't enough, that a shoe still has yet to drop. Today's Dream is that white America will somehow wake up and understand that racism makes black America's problems insurmountable. Not in-your-face racism, of course, but structural racism-sometimes termed White Privilege or white supremacy. Racism of a kind that America must get down on its knees and \"understand\" before we can move forward.\n\nThe problem is that this Dream qualifies more as a fantasy. If we are really interested in helping poor black people in America, it's time to hit Reset.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Dream I refer to has been expressed with a certain frequency over the past few weeks, after a succession of events that neatly illustrated the chance element in social history. First, a white woman, Rachel Dolezal , bemused the nation with her assertion that she \"identifies\" as black. Everyone had a grand time objecting that one can't be black without having grown up suffering the pain of racist discrimination, upon which Dylann Roof 's murder of nine black people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church put a gruesome point on the issue. Dolezal was instantly and justifiably forgotten, after which the shootings motivated the banning of the Confederate flag from the American public sphere.\n\nHowever, practically before the flags were halfway down their poles, the good-thinking take on things was that this, while welcome, was mere symbolism, and that what we really need to be thinking about is how to get America to finally wake up to-here comes the Dream-structural racism. A typical expression of the Dream is this one, from Maya Dukmasova at Slate : \"There is little hope for a meaningful solution to the problem of concentrated poverty until the liberal establishment decides to focus on untangling a different set of pathologies-those inherent in concentrated power, concentrated whiteness, and concentrated wealth.\"\n\nStatements like this meet with nods and applause. But since the '60s, the space between the statements and real life has become ever vaster. What are we really talking about when we speak of a \"liberal establishment\" making a \"decision\" to \"untangle\" notoriously impregnable things such as power, whiteness and wealth?\n\nThis is a Dream indeed, and the only reason it even begins to sound plausible is because of the model of the Civil Rights victories of fifty years ago, which teaches us that when it comes to black people, dreaming of an almost unimaginable political and psychological revolution qualifies as progressivism. After all, it worked then, right? So why be so pessimistic as to deny that it could happen again?\n\nBut there are times when pessimism is pragmatic. There will be no second Civil Rights revolution. Its victories grew not only from the heroic efforts of our ancestors, but also from a chance confluence of circumstances. Think about it: Why didn't the Civil Rights victories happen in the 19th century, or the 18th, even-or in the 1920s or 1940s? It's often said that black people were \"fed up\" by the '60s, but we can be quite sure that black people in the centuries before were plenty fed up too.\n\nWhat tipped things in the 1960s were chance factors, in the same way as recent ones led to a breakthrough on the Confederate flag. Segregation was bad P.R. during the Cold War. Television made abuses against black people more vividly apparent than ever before. Between the 1920s and the late 1960s, immigration to the U.S. had been severely curtailed, so black concerns, while so often ignored, still did not compete with those of other large groups as they do today.\n\nThere is no such combination of socio-historical factors today. No, the fact that Hillary Clinton is referring to structural racism in her speeches does not qualify this as a portentous \"moment\" for black concerns. Her heart is surely in the right place, but talking about structural racism has never gotten us anywhere significant. Hurricane Katrina was 10 years ago; there was a great deal of talk then about how that event could herald some serious movement on structural racism. Well, here we are. There was similar talk after the 1992 riots in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict and, well, here we are.\n\nThe old-time Civil Rights leaders did things; too often these days we think talking about things is doing something. But what, really, are we talking about in terms of doing ?\n\nWho among us genuinely supposes that our Congress, amidst its clear and implacable polarization, is really going to arrive at any \"decisions\" aimed at overturning America's basic power structure in favor of poor black people?\n\nThe notion of low-skill factory jobs returning to sites a bus ride away from all of America's poor black neighborhoods is science fiction.\n\nIn a country where aspiring teachers can consider it racist to be expected to articulately write about a text they read on a certification exam, what are the chances that all, or even most, black kids will have access to education as sterling as suburban white kids get?\n\nMany say that we need to move black people away from poor neighborhoods to middle-class ones. However, the results of this kind of relocation are spotty , and how long will it be before the new word on the street is that such policies are racist in diluting black \"communities\"? This is one of Dukmasova's points, and I myself have always been dismayed at the idea that when poor black people live together, we must expect social mayhem.\n\nAnd, in a country where our schools can barely teach students to read unless they come from book-lined homes, what is the point of pretending that America will somehow learn a plangent lesson about how black people suffer from a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and therefore merit special treatment that no other groups in America do? Calls for reparations for slavery, or housing discrimination, resonate indeed-and have for years now. However, they result in nothing, and here we are.\n\nNote: I'm not saying it wouldn't be great if these things happened. However, I argue that they cannot happen. It was one thing to convince America that legalized segregation and disfranchisement were wrong. However, convincing America that black people now need the dismantling of \"white privilege\" is too enlightened a lesson to expect a vast, heterogeneous and modestly educated populace to ever accept.\n\nHow do I know? Because I think 50 years is long enough to wait.\n\nToday's impasse is the result of mission creep. The story of the Civil Rights movement from 1965 to 2015 started as a quest to allow black people the same opportunities others enjoy but has shrunken into a project to show that black people can't excel unless racism basically ceases to exist at all. This is understandable. The concrete victories tearing down Jim Crow have already happened. Smoking out the racism that remains lends a sense of purpose. And let's face it: There's less of a sense of electricity, urgency, importance in teaching people how to get past racism.\n\nBut the result is that we insist \"What we really need to be talking about\" is, say, psychological tests showing that whites have racist biases they aren't aware of such as tending to associate black people with negative words, or white people owning up to their \"Privilege,\" or a television chef having said the N-word in a heated moment decades ago (or posing for a picture where her son is dressed as Desi Arnaz wearing brown makeup).\n\nSo, drama stands in for action. Follow-through is a minor concern. Too many people are reluctant to even admit signs of progress, out of a sense that their very role is to be the Cassandra rather than the problem-solver.\n\nSo, little gets done. In a history of black America, it is sadly difficult to imagine what the chapter would be about after the 1960s, other than the election of Barack Obama, which our intelligentsia is ever anxious to tell us wasn't really important anyway . Maybe we're getting somewhere on the police lately. But there's a lot more to being black than the cops. There is much else to do.\n\nThis new Dream, seeking revolutionary change in how America works, is not only impossible, but based on the faulty assumption that black Americans are the world's first group who can only excel under ideal conditions. We are perhaps the first people on earth taught to consider it insulting when someone suggests we try to cope with the system as it is-even when that person is black, or even the President .\n\nBut this \"Yes, We Can't!\" assumption has never been demonstrated. No one has shown just why post-industrial conditions in the United States make achievement all but impossible for any black person not born middle-class or rich. What self-regarding group of people gives in to the idea that low-skill factory jobs moving to China spells the end of history for its own people but no one else's?\n\nTo be sure, Bayard Rustin, Civil Rights hero and intellectual, famously argued in 1965 that automation and factory relocation left poor blacks uniquely bereft of opportunity, such that he called for the Civil Rights movement's next step to be a call for job creation to a revolutionary degree. However, 50 years is a long time ago. Immigrants moving into black communities and forging decent existences-many of them black themselves-have shown that Rustin's pessimism did not translate perfectly into later conditions. Today, community colleges offer a wider range of options to poor black people than they did 50 years ago. Books depicting black inner-city communities such as Alice Goffman's On the Run and Katherine Newman's No Shame in My Game tiptoe around the awkward fact that there are always people in such communities who acquire and keep solid jobs-something even black activists often bring up in objection to \"pathologizing\" such communities.\n\nI am calling neither for stasis nor patience. However, the claim that America must \"wake up\" and eliminate structural racism has become more of a religious incantation than a true call to action. We must forge solutions to black America's problems that are feasible within reality-that is, a nation in which racism continues to exist, compassion for black people from the outside will be limited and mainly formulaic (i.e. getting rid of flags), and by and large, business continues as usual. Here are some ideas for real solutions:\n\n1.    The War on Drugs must be eliminated. It creates a black market economy that tempts underserved black men from finishing school or seeking legal employment and imprisons them for long periods, removing them from their children and all but assuring them of lowly existences afterward.\n\n2.    We have known for decades how to teach poor black children to read: phonics-based approaches called Direct Instruction, solidly proven to work in the '60s by Siegfried Engelmann's Project Follow Through study . School districts claiming that poor black children be taught to read via the whole-word method, or a combination of this and phonics, should be considered perpetrators of a kind of child abuse. Children with shaky reading skills are incapable of engaging any other school subject meaningfully, with predictable life results.\n\n3.    Long-Acting Reproductive Contraceptives should be given free to poor black women (and other poor ones too). It is well known that people who finish high school, hold a job, and do not have children until they are 21 and have a steady partner are almost never poor. We must make it so that more poor black women have the opportunity to follow that path. The data is in: Studies in St. Louis and Colorado have shown that these devices sharply reduce unplanned pregnancies. Also, to reject this approach as \"sterilizing\" these women flies in the face of the fact that the women themselves rate these devices quite favorably .\n\n4.    We must revise the notion that attending a four-year college is the mark of being a legitimate American, and return to truly valuing working-class jobs. Attending four years of college is a tough, expensive, and even unappealing proposition for many poor people (as well as middle-class and rich ones). Yet poor people can, with up to two years' training at a vocational institution, make solid livings as electricians, plumbers, hospital technicians, cable television installers, and many other jobs. Across America, we must instill a sense that vocational school-not \"college\" in the traditional sense-is a valued option for people who want to get beyond what they grew up in.\n\nNote that none of these things involve white people \"realizing\" anything. These are the kinds of concrete policy goals that people genuinely interested in seeing change ought to espouse. If these things seem somehow less attractive than calling for revolutionary changes in how white people think and how the nation operates, then this is for emotional reasons, not political ones. A black identity founded on how other people think about us is a broken one indeed, and we will have more of a sense of victory in having won the game we're in rather than insisting that for us and only us, the rules have to be rewritten.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Colin Kaepernick Taught Us How Exposed White America Truly Is\n\nColin Kaepernick's physical exile from the NFL symbolized defeat, not just for his professional livelihood but for dissidence, as it was clear that the league was making an example of him. His downfall seemed a victory for corporations crushing individuals everywhere, of whiteness telling blackness to get over it, of ignoring anyone horrified that in less than a year's time, Oklahoma police officer Betty Shelby killed Terence Crutcher in the middle of the street, was acquitted of manslaughter , and then was rehired in law enforcement. Metaphorically, Kaepernick was Metacomet at Plymouth, his head on a stake as a warning for any natives with big ideas. Hearing Kaepernick anew, the voice resurrected, was there value in him, even propped up by Nike's billions, simply staying in the public's face?\n\nInitially, I did not believe any of this to be true. I did not feel much like celebrating the maintaining of the celebrity class, especially when the Nike ads were clearly made with Kaepernick's approval and did not include protest, and did not withstand the scrutiny of a simple question: What does any of this have to do with justice?\n\nSoon, stories appeared nationwide of people cutting up their Nike socks and burning their Nike sneakers, of refusing to carry Nike gear. In a spectacular fail, one Colorado storeowner went out of business. The Mississippi public safety commissioner ordered state police to no longer purchase Nike gear. A Louisiana police department dressed its suspects in Nike gear for their mug shots. The mayor of a New Orleans suburb ordered, and a Rhode Island town voted to prohibit its departments from purchasing Nike products. During the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, which occurred the same week Nike unveiled Kaepernick, Trump gave a speech suggesting all protesting be illegal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs news reports of schools threatening to boycott Nike and municipalities refusing to the purchase the company's apparel increased, my mind began to shift. It was clear that a man who had broken no laws and had only spoken his mind was being actively destroyed by the public. And let's be clear: by public, I mean to say the overwhelmingly white public, and the government. How else does one assess local politicians and law enforcement officers suddenly sufficiently emboldened to undertake an intimidation campaign against one of the world's most powerful corporations? Though he essentially lives on the fringes of the American mainstream, not speaking publicly, not playing in the NFL, and not organizing protest, so many whites were exposing themselves by their disproportional response to the specter of Kaepernick.\n\nDespite Nike's corporate duplicity, the fight could not be decoupled from Kaepernick. There was no way out. Parsing percentages of the opposition's size is a game at which Americans are expert, especially when those in power are indicted. (See: \"not all cops,\" \"not all men,\" and \"not all white people.\") It is an exercise in tedium but some large portion of this America had decided that Colin Kaepernick had no right to any semblance of a life, a career, or a public presence in any form. They had resolved to destroy him personally, as well as any entity associated with him, even a corporation as enormous and ubiquitous as Nike. In the summer of 2019, when Nike pulled a limited edition Independence Day shoe because Kaepernick reportedly objected to its featuring the Betsy Ross flag, designed at a time when all thirteen colonies were slaveholding, Arizona governor Doug Ducey announced he would eliminate the financial incentives Nike was to receive for building a new plant in the Phoenix suburbs, risking local jobs and economic growth for the city of Goodyear. (Ducey quickly backed down.)\n\nIf Kaepernick and Nike were under attack for criticizing police, who deserve every bit of it, then white America had exposed itself yet again in its willingness to sacrifice black life, in its complete and criminal lack of interest in justice. Neither of which, we all know at this late date, is the issue even closely approximating the real one: white people's desire for black people to be the quiet, obedient renters of the American dream. This unknowable percentage of Americans who believed these things and burned their own belongings could not be dismissed as an irrational or racist fringe because chief among their legions was the power: the president of the United States, police chiefs, local mayors, and state governors. This was what America was, and my mind had to change.\n\nThe dream of America can be found on television. Shiny, new-car-smell consumerism, golden-brown French fries in slow-motion free-falling across the flat screen just a commercial away. The reality of America is at the airport, with its runaway obesity; gooey, shitty food; and gluttonous, duty-free excess. The dream is marketable. The reality is not.\n\nThe airport is America's modern-day Manassas, the ugly battleground where the nation, through public sloganeering, bares its teeth: the red versus the blue, the black and the white, the outnumbered protesters and the faux patriots. Since the beginning of the Obama years, when postracialism became pre-apocalypse, Americans have been ratcheting up the hyperbole. The punditry talks of \"a second civil war.\" Can we all get along? No.\n\nThrough the act of getting dressed, Americans have committed to fighting one another. As they board their flights, these human bumper stickers wage their cold civil war, weaponizing and defending their positions on beer bellies across the country. In Atlanta, a white man wears a T-shirt that reads \"I Stand for the Flag . . . and Kneel for the Cross,\" an obvious response to Colin Kaepernick and the black athletes who have the nerve to believe Chicago police needn't have shot Laquan McDonald sixteen times. Twenty feet from him another man, a black man, enters the jet bridge for his connection to Little Rock wearing a black T-shirt with the familiar logo of the National Football League centered on his chest, but instead of the letters \"NFL\" emblazoned in red across the shield, the letters \"KAP\" replace them, a raised fist on the logo replacing the football.\n\nI'm on the Little Rock flight, and as the passengers board, the scene of a million trips to the airport in post-9/11 America repeats itself: a significant volume of sports clothing underscores the militarized nationalism-the American flag on shirts, camouflage yoga pants, baseball caps representing a branch of the military-that has devoured the country since the towers fell. Ten days later, I watch a barrel-chested man board a flight to New Orleans, his pale-green shirt shouting at me \"MY SON HAS YOUR BACK. PROUD ARMY DAD,\" the words superimposed over an American flag. In Hartford, Connecticut, an older white man walks the terminal advertising America's imperial depravity as patriotism, reducing the two bloodiest conflicts in human history to a grotesque buzzer-beater, another championship trophy to be raised by the Greatest Nation in the World. The shirt is black with an American flag filling the geographical shape of the United States in the center, bordered to the north and south by the words \"BACK TO BACK: WORLD WAR CHAMPS.\" If there is a score to be kept, it is of the 40 million worldwide deaths in World War I and the 85 million deaths-an estimated 3 percent of the earth's human population at the time-in World War II. The nationalism is infused not with a love of country but a menacing whiteness, a weaponizing of symbols of power, identity, and words-a reminder of to whom this country really belongs. The reminder is not directed at a foreign power but to the nonwhites in America. It is most certainly a reclaiming.\n\nFor a dozen years now, their fear has been pointing, spitting, and snarling, on the congressional floor (see: Joe Wilson's \"You lie!\" to President Obama), on television, and at the ballot box. Now, it snarls through their clothing. The American flag has been reclaimed and in many ways restored from a lofty, aspirational ideal to cold representation of its present reality, no more visionary welcome banner but threat. The flag is celebrated even when it is desecrated-when commercialized by stars-and-stripes Speedos and bikinis or in the name of the police, when it is altered from the red, white, and blue into the authoritarian black, white, and blue allegiance to a single constituency: police and their sympathizers. Blue Lives Matter , a response not to the difficulty of police work but to the audacity of citizens, especially the black ones, daring to challenge cops . Had its existence been dedicated to the former, Blue Lives Matter wouldn't have required black protest as its incubator. It would have predated Michael Brown .\n\nAuthor Howard Bryant\n\nAmerica's obsession with war, its obsession with cops, the passive-aggressive messaging from citizens, the illegal militias at the border, and the cop-calling white women are a reinforcement of whiteness. War is an authoritarian response to the black and brown internationally, blind fealty to police another to the kneelers and dissenters, the black and brown at home. The T-shirts and hats are again marking territory. A black friend is convinced that a cornered whiteness is the most dangerous whiteness, and though whites are willing to ignore the data of global warming they are certainly unwilling to dismiss the data that America will soon become a majority-minority country. That, they believe. No matter how many white men still overwhelm the Fortune 500 list, no matter how many mediocre white boys dominate the rank and file of corporate America, much of the white race acts as if they are under a Code Red threat. Their America is being taken from them. The information on the stuff they buy is still in English-but it's in Spanish too.\n\nThis friend believes the whites will respond to feeling under threat by eventually taking its country back by force, that Charlottesville was an amuse-bouche and whites have decided to not go down without a fight, that the cold civil war of T-shirts and mean tweets will turn hot, to AR-15s and bloodshed. He, too, does not reject data-the data indicating that, encouraged by Donald Trump, white supremacist groups are regaining strength across the country. Anyone who has done even a cursory amount of research on the subject knows my friend is not exaggerating. Nor does he reject the data showing that hundreds of former and active police and military are part of white nationalist, antigovernment groups. In response, he has joined a \"social group\" of like-minded African American men. They frequent the shooting range. He obtained his concealed-weapons permit. \"They're not getting me without me taking some of them with me,\" he tells me.\n\nThen and now, whether a T-shirt or an oversize American (sometimes joined by Confederate) flag bolted to the beds of a pickup truck, the message is the same: to be nonwhite is to be a renter of the American dream. It is to be reminded that one's citizenship is always tenuous and that one's white neighbors, who consider themselves the owners, think it can be summarily revoked, sometimes legally but always emotionally, anecdotally, figuratively. This is the root of the culture war being fought on the campaign trail and in airport terminals across America. The nonwhite presence in America, regardless of claim or service, years distant from Appomattox or Selma, is always reminded that the white public believes it is, and will always be, more American than you.\n\nHoward Bryant is a senior writer for ESPN the Magazine and a correspondent for NPR's Weekend Edition.\n\nExcerpted from Full Dissidence: Notes from an Uneven Playing Field by Howard Bryant (Beacon Press, 2020).

      "text": "Let's Hope That Kamala Harris Is Done Pandering to White America\n\nKamala Harris, Joe Biden's rival-turned-running-mate , has often been referred to as the \" female Obama ,\" a lazy, reductive moniker meant to highlight superficial similarities between ambitious biracial attorneys who are now both historic \"firsts\" on a presidential ticket.\n\nBut a much more consequential link between Harris and Obama is the way that both-to avoid being typecast as \"too Black\"-prioritized white comfort by embracing politics that often neglected, ignored, or straight-up harmed Black folks.\n\nAnd those efforts to transcend race-in a country where the mere acknowledgement of racism by Black folks is treated as a militant act of rage by white Americans-is an exercise in futility and cowardice. Harris has a chance to learn from Obama's mistakes and recognize that no amount of support for anti-Black policies will ever do enough to allay white fears of radical Blackness. That there's no need to try and reason with white supremacy. Just speak the truth instead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo be sure, Black politicians are often electorally punished by white voters for opposing racism too loudly . That's undoubtedly a key part of the reason why Obama mostly resisted discussing race, and especially racism-to avoid inflaming the hyper-delicate sensibilities of white voters. During his first two years in office, according to political scientist Daniel Q. Gillion, Obama spoke less about race than any Democratic president had since 1961 .\n\nBut that meant he was often mum on pressing issues of anti-Black racism and injustice. Though he would become a more vocal advocate of criminal justice reform on his way out the door, Obama's response to the racial justice uprisings in Ferguson and then across the country in 2014 was to assemble a task force -not to address the national epidemic of police violence in Black communities but rather to \" promote effective crime reduction .\" As white supremacist violence grew and racial disparities persisted, he often publicly blamed and shamed Black folks for outcomes driven by structurally racist systems they had no hand in creating-a stark reminder of his 2012 declaration that he was \" not the president of Black America.\"\n\nSimilar appeals to whites about supposed Black pathologies-and support of blame-the-victim policymaking-sit at the core of Harris' tough-on-crime stance, which garnered winning vote margins from San Francisco's white liberals in her 2003 bid to be City Attorney and the endorsement of nearly 50 law enforcement groups in her 2014 reelection as California Attorney General. They informed Harris' endorsement of a truancy law that disproportionately jailed poor Black parents of elementary school kids, as well as her opposition to the reform of unequally enforced marijuana laws .\n\nIt was Harris who first described herself-proudly at the time-as California's \" top cop \" in July 2016, nearly two years into the Black Lives Matter era and just two weeks after the back-to-back racist police murders of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Those events apparently failed to shake her belief that there was still more political mileage to be gained from shoring up her image as a law-and-order prosecutor even as she paid lip service to being a \" progressive prosecutor .\"\n\nThe \"top cop\" boast was one of several factors, including a poorly run campaign , that helped sink Harris' presidential dreams. Defenders continue to claim that Harris, as a candidate who was both Black and a woman, could not have promoted progressive reforms lest she be seen as \"soft on crime,\" a label that would have been career suicide in the overly carceral 1990s and 2000s. Those same defenders say that to overcome race and gender, or more pointedly, race and gender bias, Harris necessarily downplayed-the temptation is to write \"compromised\"-her deeply-held progressive ideals. In other words, the theory goes, Harris did what she had to do.\n\nBut there's nothing a Black politician can do, no concessions to white supremacy or damage to Black lives, that's enough to shield that politician  from racist condemnations. Obama was accused of being an undercover Marxist, a Muslim double-agent, and a secret Kenyan national. For all his silence on issues afflicting the Black community, white conservatives still blamed him for the worsening of Black-white race relations. The de facto spokesperson for the racist birther movement, Donald Trump, insisted Obama was neither an American citizen nor the deserving recipient of an Ivy League degree .\n\nDon Jr. has been following his father's birther lead while targeting Harris, retweeting social media messages claiming that her South Asian and Jamaican parentage make her not \"American Black.\" Meanwhile, a whole other segment of racist white people have dog whistled that Harris is \" too Black .\" Before Biden picked her, white men in his camp had derided Harris as \" too ambitious \" and prone to \" rub[bing] people the wrong way\"-typically racist and sexist complaints that follow Black women who are too uppity to know their place. Harris's tough-on-crime agenda is a handicap in a way it has never been for Biden, the white male politician who co-wrote the 1994 crime bill and once boasted of authoring legislation that would \" do everything but hang people for jaywalking.\"\n\nPerhaps Harris' losing presidential campaign might offer her some clarity now. In vying to become Biden's second-in-command, Harris seemed to do a kind of priority reassessment-penning essays on the intersection of white supremacy and gun violence , vocally criticizing the system of policing overall and calling for a \" reimagining how we do public safety in America,\" and apologizing for that overly punitive truancy law . She signed on to legislation that strengthens the social safety net in the time of a pandemic that has disproportionately affected the physical and economic health of Black and brown Americans. Harris staffers contend the shift is not a matter of political pragmatism but evidence that the vice presidential nominee has \" always been a progressive ,\" and is just supporting proposals that \"fit with the type legislation that she always supported while in the Senate.\" It seems more likely that there is some political calculation going on, but if it leads Harris to promote less harmful policies for Black people and families, that's headed in the right direction.\n\nIt's just as critical that Harris not waffle here like she did on, say, Medicare For All during the primary. If she wants Black folks that are rightly suspicious of her political motives in this moment to believe this is the progressive she has always been-but felt unable to admit being-her commitment to Black voters can't be compromised in the lead up to election day.\n\nHarris is likely to be one of the most influential vice presidents ever, arriving during one of the most disastrous periods of this country's history. Her running mate has a record on race that is, simply, not good. (Also, he keeps adding to the pile with quotes like this nonsense .)\n\nAnd there are many progressive Black voters who have little to no enthusiasm about voting for the crime-bill guy and the top cop.\n\nWhat would change that is if Harris uses the platform she has as vice president to address racial inequity in a direct and meaningful way, regardless of the racist slings and arrows that are guaranteed to follow.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "'Sorry to Bother You' Is a Searing, Surreal Indictment of White America\n\nHad to be Boots.\n\nSorry to Bother You is so provocative, hilarious and bizarre that it could only come from the mind of Boots Riley. The Coup frontman has imbued his art with humor, candor and creativity since his group debuted almost 30 years ago. Arriving as Public Enemy's peak was beginning to wane and political rap's hold on the mainstream was giving way to other sounds and approaches, The Coup was almost totally ignored by the biggest hip-hop platforms of the '90s. But they became one of the most respected acts in hip-hop and West Coast legends on the strength of stellar albums (Steal This Album! is required listening) and Boots' persona. And there's a lot of that persona in Sorry to Bother You , his feature film directorial debut.\n\nLakeith Stanfield is Cassius \"Cash\" Green , the kind of laid-back, go-nowhere slacker in his late 20s that would bring a fake Employee of the Month plaque to a job interview or ask a gas station attendant to put forty cents on the pump. Green wants more but clearly has no idea how to get it; he lives in his uncle's ( Terry Crews ) garage with his girlfriend Detroit (a radiant Tessa Thompson), and is trying desperately to land a job when he walks in to interview for a telemarketing position. Soon after he gets it, he learns that his uncle is losing the house. Stakes are raised and Green's desperation heightens quickly as he learns the ropes of telemarketing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSorry to Bother You was the title of The Coup's sixth album, released in 2012, which was inspired by Riley's screenplay of the same name. Green is partially inspired by Riley's own experiences as a telemarketer-and there's a lot of humor milked from the slow, soul-crushing disdain that informs the reality of one of America's most-hated-but easy to get-jobs. The awkward responses to stilted sales \"scripts,\" the self-loathing that comes from knowing you're trying to sell people something they don't need or want, the mundane unpleasantness of being cursed at by strangers every day-it's all there in Cassius' first experiences with his new job.\n\nBut an offhand conversation with elder salesman Langston (Danny Glover) changes the trajectory of Cash's career. After hearing Cash stumbling through a call, Langston assures him that the key to success is to use his \"white voice.\" \"Not 'Will Smith white,'\" explains Langston, but more \"like you haven't got a care in the world.\" Suddenly, Cash discovers his \"white voice\" ( provided by David Cross ) and becomes the most successful telemarketer in the office. He's fast-tracked up the ladder to \"Power Caller,\" the upper echelon of telemarketers within the company. He's assured more money-and he gets it-and a company big shot whose name is never revealed (Omari Hardwick) takes him under his wing. But it all puts him at odds with a growing worker strike being led by his friends who want a more livable wage; and when he learns how the \"Power Callers\" really make their money, he's faced with an even deeper moral conflict.\n\nAs Detroit, Cash's girlfriend and a politically-minded artist, Thompson gets to show off her unique brand of playful intensity and revel in Detroit's idiosyncrasies. Door-knocker earrings that also serve as quasi-billboards for her slogans and her forthright idealism make her the less compromising representation of the outsider that Cash is clearly so uncomfortable being. Detroit's performance piece, delivered as Cash is being pulled further away from her and his friends' ideals, is one of the most jaw-dropping moments in the movie. That it involves a monologue from The Last Dragon is only maybe the third weirdest thing about it. The audacity of Sorry to Bother You gets your attention; the intelligence keeps it. This is a story that takes so many wild turns that it can be dizzying and sometimes meandering, but there's a method to the madness.\n\nThe movie's easiest conceit-or at least the one easiest to market via ads for the film-is the idea that Black people have to assume a certain level of white identity to thrive in corporate America. Even in a telemarketing gig where it seems like almost no one is making any money and where the boss admits he'll basically hire anyone, Cash's well-being is predicated on how much of his Blackness he can stifle on the phone. It's not a brand new concept-this has been examined by Black scholarship and pop art for generations. In the '90s, there was a wave of \"keepin' it real\" comedies like Livin' Large (where a Black aspiring TV reporter wrestles with losing his \"blackness\" as he becomes a bigger personality via exploitative dreck) and Strictly Business (an uptight Black commercial real-estate mogul uses his hip friend to connect with the culture in Harlem). But Sorry to Bother You takes the idea of double consciousness and code-switching to hilariously surreal spaces via odd voiceovers from Cross and Patton Oswalt and a story from Riley that isn't afraid to go absolutely nuts.\n\nThere are echoes of Mike Judge's cubicle classic Office Space and traces of Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song that can be found in the loose, dreamlike feel of certain scenes, and there's even a random nod to Michel Gondry. But Sorry to Bother You fits most neatly alongside contemporaneous projects like Jordan Peele's 2017 hit Get Out and the unsettling \"Teddy Perkins\" episode of Atlanta 's second season-and all three featured Stanfield. These are all projects that broach the idea of what it means to be Black in a world that expects-sometimes demands-that you perform whiteness to get ahead while also remaining \"Black\" enough to maintain the novelty of being \"The Black Guy\" in the room.\n\nIn a scene midway through the movie, Cassius is invited to a party at the home of Steve Lift (a scenery-chewing Armie Hammer ). Lift is founder and CEO of Worry Free, the kind of self-made Silicon Valley \"visionary\" that becomes hailed as a game changer both in his field and across popular culture at large. That he's a psychopath doesn't seem to matter much to all who nestle around him, and he \"sees something\" in Cassius. That gets Green into the inner sanctum, but it also turns him into a minstrel, as Lift humiliates him in a way that manages to evoke liberal racism, white hip-hop audiences and the ongoing N-word debate in hilariously uncomfortable fashion. As Cassius sinks deeper, it just becomes more obvious that his would-be benefactor is deeply unhinged. When Lift's master plan is revealed, it's a sendup of everything from the indentured servitude of minimum-wage employment to The Island of Dr. Moreau .\n\nStanfield plays Cassius with the kind of slightly-stoned confusion that has become something of a hallmark for the actor, while also making it clear that Green is observant to all that is happening around him-even when he's not so self-aware. His soul is slowly chipped away by the monetary gains he's gotten in his career, and it seems like he's all-too-eager to sell it. This movie is about a lot more than \"talking white,\" it's about thinking like your oppressor and becoming amenable to ideas that rob you of your identity while also using you to hold others in place. Stanfield and Thompson have an easy chemistry onscreen and the ways that Cash and Detroit counter each other may be predictable, but their relationship lays a foundation on which Bother You hangs its most prescient ideas. Detroit knows who she is and it makes her life chaotic to be true to that-but her strong sense of self gives her peace. Cash is less certain, but his life is just as chaotic. He has no sense of self, and he has no peace.\n\nRiley has long been one of hip-hop's most committed activists and one of the game's most brilliant storytellers. Sorry to Bother You 's third act may stretch the suspension of disbelief to the breaking point, but if you've committed to the film thus far, you're all-in with the zaniness, which doesn't neuter the potency of Riley's vision. This is a bold film that doesn't hit every mark yet is riveting in its brazenness. There are astute observations throughout Sorry to Bother You -the most glaring being the recognition that racism demands that those most affected by it sacrifice part of themselves in order to navigate it. That sacrifice can come via the fight against it, or it can come via acquiescing to it, but there is no getting around it unscathed. And in trying to break off parts of you to fit, you just wind up bloody and lacking. And that's what really has to bother you.\n\nstereowilliams@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Racism Is White America's HIV\n\nWitnessing the death of Eric Garner , at the hands of uniformed police in New York City, got me to thinking about racism in America. This African-American man was confronted by police for selling single, probably-untaxed, cigarettes on the street. When the man resisted, he was held in a chokehold-a practice deemed unlawful for over 20 years-which was horrifyingly caught on tape. The man was obese and carried no firearm, yet he was wrestled to the ground and held in the chokehold, despite his saying seven times, \"I can't breathe!\" He was pronounced dead at the scene, and since then, his death has been ruled a homicide (meaning that his death was caused by the chokehold, rather than a number of other physical maladies which afflicted him, among them asthma and diabetes). I couldn't help but wonder whether or not this man would have ever been stopped, were it not for his race.\n\nWe white Americans all-too-seldom reflect upon the issue of racism, because we don't have to. We don't have to think about it, because the system is set up to benefit us, at the expense of people of color, without our ever doing anything mean or unkind, so it is very easy never to even notice how life is for someone not in our majority.\n\nRacism has often been referred to as a \"cancer\" on and in society. But that has never struck me as terribly apt or helpful, despite its obviously negative connotation. So I began wondering what a more helpful metaphor might be for racism and its on-going effect on many of our citizens. And for some reason, it occurred to me that many of the things we say about being infected with HIV, the virus that can lead to AIDS, are true of racism:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMany people who are infected don't know it. Those infected by racism are largely oblivious to it. It operates behind the scenes and barely shows itself in the early stages. It can be an important part of who we are and how we operate without our knowledge. And because the system is set up to benefit us, we can easily believe that racism is something that other people get. Understanding our being white in a racist society is akin to getting a fish in an aquarium to understand the concept of water - it is simply the medium in which we swim, the reality that supports us and in which we thrive without so much as a passing thought.\n\nIt would never occur to me that I would be stopped for no reason by the police. Yet it is a reality that every parent of color prepares their children for: what to say and not say, what to do or not do, how to avoid an escalation of the situation even if you've done nothing wrong. It never occurs to me when I go shopping that I will be followed around the store by those paid to make sure I don't shoplift, yet it is an everyday experience for many people of color. It would never occur to me that I would be given a higher interest rate on a loan or a higher price on a used car, simply because of the color of my skin. It happens to people of color all the time.\n\nThe only way to know if you're unsuspectingly infected is to get tested. Testing is a voluntary and intentional act. It starts with realizing and admitting that I might be infected. It is painful to learn that we might be intentionally or unintentionally racist, and since we usually shy away from painful things, we avoid conversations and situations that might reveal the ugly truth. The \"test\" for racism is a lot less scientific than getting tested for HIV, and it involves having conversations with people of color (and other race-aware white people) about their experiences. It means listening to the words of people who have indeed experienced racism, and then believing that it is true for them-even if it is not true of our experience. And then it means searching our souls for ways in which we have colluded with a white-majority society in perpetuating such an unjust system.\n\nResistance to being tested comes from the fear of what changes may be in store if I'm \"positive.\" The scary thing about finding out if one has been infected is that if I have, then I will need to change some things about my life. If I open myself to understanding how I participate in and benefit from a racist society (even if I have no personal animosity at all toward people of color!), then I will undoubtedly have to decide if I'm going to resist the racism in myself and seek to dismantle it in the society.\n\nViral load can be reduced to undetectable levels, but it never goes away. And at least for now, it's an incurable condition. Undoing racism in ourselves is a life-long process. We all acquire \"default settings\" in our growing up-that is, standard ways in which we tend to view the world and organize/understand our experiences. We can intentionally go in and change these default settings, but it takes our being intentional and vigilant-or else, the default setting reasserts itself, and without even thinking, becomes our standard operating procedure.\n\nI am a recovering racist, and similar to a recovering alcoholic, who may not drink but who will always be an alcoholic, I must constantly monitor and manage my internal \"settings\" about race. That default setting in me was shaped in my childhood, spent in the segregated south, complete with separate drinking fountains and lunchrooms. As a six or seven-year-old, my mother yanked me out of a public pool when a black family got into the other end of the pool, drove me across town, and paid for the \"protection\" offered at a segregated pool and \"private\" club. The dual message was that black people were dirty and dangerous. Those kinds of experiences establish one's \"default settings,\" and no matter how much or how often I intellectually try to talk myself out of them, from time to time, they still crop up. While lots of self-examination, listening to others, and believing the experiences of those on the receiving end of racism, can reduce my own racism to undetectable levels, still the disease lives on inside me, ready for an outbreak when my guard is down.\n\nOur only defenses are courage and education. Loving one's neighbor, espoused by Jesus and every other major world religion, turns out to be hard work. White people in America must have the courage to look unflinchingly at the ways we have benefitted from a racist society and lower our defenses enough to hear the truth being spoken to us. We must have these difficult and honest conversations. And if we are going to have to live with our past and current racism, then we must strive for undetectable levels of infection. Our nation's future and soul depend on it.\n\nbishopgene9@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "My travels in white America - a land of anxiety, division and pockets of pain\n\nThis summer, Gary Younge took a trip from Maine to Mississippi to find out what has brought the US to this point. From the forgotten poor to desperate addicts, their whiteness is all some of them have left - and that makes fertile ground for the far right\n\nJ eff Baxter's enduring memory, from childhood, is the glow. Coming down over the hill overlooking the coke plant in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the molten iron would make itself known - both as a vision and an aspiration. \"It's like the sun landed there,\" says Baxter, a burly, bearded retiree, who achieved his boyhood dream of becoming a steelworker.\n\nToday, the plant, like the one Baxter worked in for 30 years, stands derelict - a shell that represents a hollowing out not just of the local economy but of culture and hope - as though someone extinguished Baxter's sun and left the place in darkness. Buildings in the centre of town that were once testament to the industrial wealth produced here stand abandoned. More than 40% of the population now live below the poverty line; 9.1% are unemployed .\n\nCambria County, where Johnstown sits, was once a swing county. Al Gore won it in 2000; George W Bush took it in 2004; it went to Barack Obama in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 - each time by fairly narrow margins. Last year, Donald Trump won it in a landslide .\n\nBaxter, who once backed Obama, voted for Trump, the first time he had ever voted Republican. \"I liked [Obama's] message of hope, but he didn't bring any jobs in ... Trump said he was going to make America great. And I figured: 'That's what we need. We need somebody like that to change it.'\"\n\nOver at the century-old Coney Island Lunch, this once-bustling institution famous for its chilli dogs and sundowners is virtually empty. \"A lot of people have left town,\" explains Peggy, who has been serving at the diner for nine years. \"There are no jobs. If you're going to have a life or a steady income, you know, you need to get out of here, because there's nothing here. I expect a lot of towns go this way. You know, when the steel mills died and the coal died. It's sad, it's very sad.\"\n\nAcross from the counter, Ted sits in a T-shirt emblazoned with a Native American in full headdress. He thinks white America is getting a rough deal and will soon be extinct. \"There's not many white Americans left. They're a dying breed. It's going to be yellow-white Americans, African-American white Americans, you know what I'm saying? The cultures are coming together,\" he says, with more than a hint of melancholy. \"Blending and blending, and pretty soon we'll just be one colour.\"\n\nTed also voted for Trump. \"I liked him on TV. I voted for him, alright, but it was because he was supposedly going to make America great, and what's he done so far? He hasn't done anything.\"\n\nTwo days after I spoke to Ted and Peggy, Coney Island Lunch closed down .\n\nIn the 12 years I reported from the US I saw no end of white journalists opine on black America. This summer, I took a trip through white America, driving from Maine (the whitest state) to Mississippi (the blackest), to flip the script. Talking only to white people, I attended a white supremacist conference, accompanied an emergency health worker who sought to revive people who had overdosed, and went to a comedy club in the French Quarter of New Orleans to see the \"Liberal Redneck\" perform. I was told the Ku Klux Klan were liberals (they weren't), that Confederate general Robert E Lee didn't own slaves ( he did ) and that I could not be British because I'm black (I am).\n\nIt was a few weeks before the disturbances in Charlottesville, when a mob of white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and Klansmen, converged on a college town in Virginia, terrorising protesters and leaving one dead and many injured. Just seven months after the US had bid farewell to its first black president, his successor said there were \"some very fine people\" marching with the neo-Nazis who chanted: \"Jews will not replace us.\" A poll shortly afterwards showed that almost half of white Americans thought they were \"under attack\" and one in three thought the country needs to do more to preserve its white European heritage.\n\nAny reckoning with how the US got to this point, politically, demands some interrogation of how white America got to this place economically and culturally; that takes into account both their relative privilege and their huge pockets of pain.\n\nWhite Americans make up a majority of the country. Compared with other races, they may enjoy an immense concentration of wealth and power. But these privileges are nonetheless underpinned by considerable anxiety. Their health is failing (white people's life expectancy has stalled or dipped in recent years), their wages are stagnating (adjusting for inflation, they are just 10% higher now than they were 44 years ago) and class fluidity is drying up (the prospects of poor white Americans breaking through class barriers is worse now than it has been for a long time). Out-traded by China (in 2016 the trade deficit with the country was $347bn); soon to be outnumbered at home (within a generation white people will be a minority); and outmanoeuvred on the battlefields of the Arab world and beyond (neither of the wars launched in response to 9/11 have ended in victory), these vulnerabilities are felt at home and abroad. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter protesters are in the streets over police brutality, football players are taking a knee and the movement to bring legal status to large numbers of undocumented people grows. White Americans feel more pessimistic about their future than any other group. Almost two-thirds of white working-class people think the country has changed for the worse since the 50s.\n\nI covered the last presidential election from Muncie, Indiana, once seen as the archetypal US town thanks to the Middletown project, a sociological study first published in the 20s . Many of the white working-class areas on the south side of Muncie were similar to Johnstown. The head of Middletown Studies at the city's Ball State University, James Connolly, told me this was the area he had found most difficult when it came to finding contacts. Whereas African Americans in the north-east of the city had strong churches and campaigning organisations, he explained, the poorer white areas had few champions.\n\n\"Nobody speaks up for the poor,\" said Jamie Walsh , a white working-class woman who grew up in Muncie, explaining Trump's appeal to those she grew up with on Muncie's Southside. \"There is systemic racism, but black people have advocates. Poor white people don't. They're afraid. They're afraid that they're stupid. They don't feel racist, they don't feel sexist, they don't want to offend people or say the wrong thing. But white privilege is like a blessing and a curse if you're poor. The whole idea pisses poor white people off because they've never experienced it on a level that they understand.\n\n\"You hear privilege, and you think 'money and opportunity', and they don't have it. I understand how it works but I don't think most people do. So when Trump says stuff, they can understand what he's saying and he speaks to them in a way other people don't. And then you've got people calling them stupid and deplorable. Well, how long do you think you can call people stupid and deplorable before they get mad?\"\n\nIncreasingly, for many white Americans, their racial privilege resides not in positive benefits of work and security but in the sole fact that it could be worse - they could be black or Latino. In other words, their whiteness is all they have left. In few areas is this clearer than the opioid epidemic, which is disproportionately affecting white America. Wander down Oxford Street, home to one of the main shelters in Portland, Maine, and you can see people, distraught, disoriented and desperate, openly struggling with their addiction long into the night.\n\n\"In the past, we might go months and not have an overdose call,\" said paramedic Andrea Calvo, as we drove around Portland, Maine. \"And we had a day, not too long ago, when I think we did 14 overdoses ... the majority of people, certainly in this area in this state, probably in the country, are somehow affected by addiction issues.\" A member of her family struggles with addiction. She constantly worried that one day she would be called to assist her.\n\nAndrew Kiezulas was a 22-year-old sports star from a middle-class family when his doctor first prescribed opioids for a back injury. With his thick neck perched on top of mountainous shoulders, he had the air of an all-American boy from an all-American family. But, behind the facade, things had started to go wrong. \"Very quickly, the prescription drugs were removed and I was left with an emotional addiction, a mental addiction and a very physical addiction to the opiates - and, very quickly, I transitioned over to street drugs,\" he explained.\n\nKieszulas has had to struggle hard to remain sober these last five years. His achievements are his own. But he would be the first to tell you that being white helped. When black America was blighted by the crack epidemic, it was understood as a crisis of culture and treated as a problem of crime. African Americans were locked up in unprecedented numbers, leaving more Americans in prison than had been incarcerated in the Soviet gulags at its height and more African Americans in prison than had been enslaved in 1850 .\n\n\"If you are white and middle class, it's much easier to remove the negative consequences of a use disorder,\" Kieszulas explained. \"You're less likely to go to jail, less likely to have any kind of negative criminal consequence. I myself don't have a criminal record. I did some very interesting things to support my habit and to find relief. And transitioning out of that without a criminal record at all? I think it speaks for itself.\"\n\nThanks to contamination through needle sharing, the opioid epidemic is also turning into an HIV crisis, which is particularly acute in rural white areas. Of the most vulnerable 5% of counties at risk of an HIV outbreak, almost all voted for Trump .\n\nIn late October, Trump called it a \"public health emergency\" , while offering little in the way of new funding. When your privilege amounts to this amount of pain, no wonder you can't see it. But just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it's not there.\n\nIf there's one thing that 200 years of slavery and 100 years of segregation did for African Americans, it was to temper their investment in the myth that the US is a meritocracy. The notion that if you worked hard and kept your nose clean, you would get on was always stymied by the grim realities of racial barriers. \"America was never America to me,\" wrote the Harlem renaissance poet Langston Hughes in 1935's Let America Be America Again . \"There's never been equality for me / Nor freedom in this 'homeland of the free'.\"\n\nBut, for many white Americans, the expectation that each year would be better than the next and each generation healthier and wealthier provided the core for optimism. However, with those assumptions being eroded, the mood is now more reminiscent of a post-colonial country. People are looking back for a sense of hope. Ask Trump voters when they would like to go back to if they wanted to make America great again and they will give you a date. Jeff Baxter wants to go back to the glow of the 60s, Ted to the 80s, others to the 50s and beyond.\n\nThere are, of course, many white Americans looking forward, fighting for their place in a more equal and just, multiracial future. Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old paralegal, was killed while protesting against the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville when a car, allegedly driven by a neo-Nazi sympathiser, ploughed into the crowd. \"She wanted equality,\" her father, Mark Heyer, said . \"And in this issue of the day of her passing, she wanted to put down hate.\"\n\nHer mother, Susan Bro, refused to take the president's condolence call . \"I've heard it said that the murder of my daughter was part of making America great,\" Bro added. \"The blood on the streets ... is that what made America great? Attacking innocent people with a vehicle ... is that what made America great?\"\n\nWhen American Renaissance, a white supremacist group straining to put a veneer of intellectualism and respectability on its bigotry, came to Montgomery Bell state park near Nashville in the summer, they were met by a crowd of mostly white protesters, chanting: \"No Klan, no hate, no racists in our state.\"\n\nOne told me that Trump's election had shaken some white people out of their complacency. \"We were asleep at the wheel,\" she said. \"We can no longer find comfort in silence. We have to dig up all the courage we have, to take a stand for what's morally right.\" On the journey back to Nashville I stopped at a secondhand shop on the roadside, selling Confederate paraphernalia, owned by Nikki who had a complicated relationship to the stars and bars. \"I'm a proud southerner,\" she said. \"But you and I both know the [American] civil war's basically about slavery,\" she told me. \"Thank God we lost, thank God ... but it doesn't mean that we still don't wanna honour our dead.\"\n\nTrump did not create this anxiety nor this division . References to the civil war and the Klan illustrate for just how long white America has been riven by its sense of moral purpose and material privilege. What is new is that Trump has emboldened the bigots and channelled their thinking in a fashion not seen in modern times. A president who draws a moral equivalent between neo-Nazis and anti-fascist protesters, who baits black athletes and black journalists, brands Mexicans rapists and Muslims terrorists.\n\nOne of those to whom he has given confidence is Richard Spencer, the intellectually unimpressive, historically illiterate huckster who rallied the far right in Charlottesville. Spencer, who wants to create an \"ethno-state\" for white people, claims to have coined the term \"alt-right\" - a sanitised word for the extreme right. In July last year, Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, boasted that his website Breitbart News was a \"platform for the alt-right\".\n\nWhen I encountered Spencer at Montgomery Bell park, he emerged carrying a glass of what smelled like bourbon and an entourage of adoring bigots soon surrounded me in the car park. More odious troll than eloquent polemicist, he claimed, among other things, that Africans had benefited from white supremacy and that, despite having been banned from 26 European countries, Europe would always be more his home than mine. \"If Africans had never existed, world history would be almost exactly the same as it is today,\" he claimed. \"Because we are the genius that drives it.\" Like a vulture preying on the anxiety, and with few alternatives on offer - as much as people cited Trump as the problem, few offered Democrats as the solution - he felt confident.\n\n\"People are now aware of the term 'alt-right' ... I don't think Trump shares the ideal of the ethno-state ... But he wouldn't have run the campaign that he ran if he didn't feel some sense of loss, that America has lost something,\" he said.\n\nHe felt he was gaining influence. This was one of the few accurate things he actually said. And by far the most chilling.\n\nAngry, White and American is on Channel 4 at 10pm on Thursday 9 November"

      "text": "Is white America ready to confront its racism? Philosopher George Yancy says we need a 'crisis'\n\nIn his new book, philosopher George Yancy uncovers just how unprepared even well-meaning whites are for a courageous conversation about race\n\nG eorge Yancy's new book, Backlash, grew out of Dear White America , a piece on the pervasiveness of white racism that he wrote for the New York Times' philosophy column, The Stone. After the piece was published on Christmas Eve 2015, Yancy received an extraordinary number of responses from white readers, many of whom were aggressively defensive and included racist epithets and threats of physical violence. Backlash extends the argument made in Dear White America, and turns personal and philosophic lenses on the vile responses it received.\n\nWhat was the message of Dear White America, and why do you think it proved so provocative?\n\nDear White America was a letter of love. And by letter of love I mean that it was a letter that was an invitation for white people to engage honestly with their racism, to be vulnerable and to let go of their \"white innocence\".\n\nAfter conducting 19 interviews with philosophers and public intellectuals at The Stone, I decided to write a letter that was direct and candid. I tried to create a mutually vulnerable space where white people could reveal the ways in which they harbor racist assumptions, emotions and embodied habits.\n\nI also invited white people to explore the ways in which they are complicit with white systemic and institutional power and privilege. It doesn't follow from this that all white people are members of the KKK or that white people are born racists. That would be ridiculous. Yet, that is what many white people assumed that I meant.\n\nI think that the anger resulted from a defensive posture, one that is linked to a failure of nerve and honesty that is needed for white people to confront courageously the truth about how racism is insidious and constitutes the DNA of white America. Fear can breed anger, but I wanted a courageous white America, one prepared to remove the masks of self-deception, to love in return.\n\nWhat sorts of response did you get to the piece?\n\nThe majority of the white responses were vile, despicable and unconscionable. I was told to commit suicide immediately. I was told to go back to Africa, called a \"monkey\", \"boy\", \"hoodrat\", \"pavement ape\", and referred to as excrement. One white person fantasized about using a meat hook on me and another white person said that I ought to be beheaded \"Isis style\". Of course, I was also called by that most horrible, dehumanizing and insulting of words, \"nigger\". I couldn't even keep count of the number of times the N-word was used.\n\nWhite racism dripped from their lips. The responses pulled from old white racist imagery that depicted black people as bestial and animalistic. What became clear to me are the deep ways in which that discourse, those assumptions and imagery are still quite palpable within the white American psyche.\n\nSo much of white America is unprepared and unwilling to have a courageous conversation about racism. They would rather avoid the conversation, blame me, call me a \"race baiter\". Some even said that I wrote Dear White America to sexually seduce white women. What does that say about the problematic and racist myth and fear of the so-called black male rapist?\n\nGiven the racist insults, one might argue that the point that I was trying to make was, in many ways, confirmed. I did receive a few very powerful and beautiful responses from white readers who said to me that they accepted the gift that I offered and that they would critically and honestly engage their racism even as they knew that the challenge was real and requires serious work. But after so many insults, I have come to have profoundly less hope in white America.\n\nHow does Backlash take up that response, and take forward the argument of Dear White America?\n\nBacklash is a continuation of the letter of love that began with Dear White America. I make no effort in the book to avoid sharing the racist vile responses that I received, and engage my own personal trauma as the target of so much white racism. And I engaged this with as much clarity and vulnerability as possible.\n\nWhite America, all Americans, must witness the vileness. Backlash inundates its white reader with unmitigated reality, and asks white readers to dwell within a space of black trauma. And it asks the white reader to linger, to touch the truth about their whiteness and its complicity with that trauma. So, it dares to ask \"good whites\" to explore their racism, their hated, their white racist microaggressions and complicity with white racist macroaggressions. The book is an outgrowth of a post-racial America that was always a lie. And it asks white readers, in the words of James Baldwin, to use it as a disagreeable mirror to look at themselves.\n\nYou compare white racism to sexism. What do you mean by that?\n\nI am a sexist. I don't say this with pride. And I don't say it in order to receive praise. I am not a hero for being honest. I don't think that any of us men, raised within a culture that promotes pornography, the degrading sexual objectification of women, the fragmentation of women's bodies and the perpetuation of rigid gender roles, escape such problematic forms of masculine \"normalization\". Let's admit it. Patriarchy is powerful. It shapes men's habits, perceptions, conceptions of romance, authority, pleasure, emotions, body comportment. Of course, this doesn't mean that we are incapable of resisting. We certainly can resist, and we must.\n\nIn Dear White America, my aim was to model for white people, to demonstrate what courageous speech looks like expressed publicly, what public vulnerability looked like. That was my aim. For the most part, it was a missed opportunity for so many white people. They became so obsessed and defensive that they failed or refused to bear witness to the ethical thrust of my public disclosure.\n\nWhen you talk about \"whiteness\" in the letter and book, what do you mean?\n\nWhiteness is a structural, ideological, embodied, epistemological and phenomenological mode of being - and it is predicated upon its distance from and negation of blackness. This is what so many white people forget or refuse to see: their being racialized as white and socially and psychologically marked as privileged has problematic implications for my being black.\n\nWhiteness is what I call the \"transcendental norm\", which means that whiteness goes unmarked. As unmarked, white people are able to live their identities as unraced, as simply human, as persons. And this obfuscates the ways in which their lives depend upon various affordances that black people and people of color don't possess.\n\nWhite racism is thus a continuum, one that includes the KKK, the loving white Christian and the antiracist white. Even good, moral white people, those who have black friends, friends of color, married to people of color, fight for racial justice and so on, don't escape white racist injustice against black people and people of color; they all continue to be implicated within structures of white privilege and to embody, whether they realize it or not, society's racist sensibilities. White people possess white privilege or white immunity from racial disease. And because of this, others of us, black people and people of color, reap the social, political and existential pains of that racialized social skin.\n\nAre you hopeful about your gift being accepted?\n\nI am torn. History, after all, is not closed and time is open-ended. Yet, there is nothing about time that guarantees the end to white supremacy. White supremacy is capable of conceding some things and yet preserving its core values and sustaining a place for black people that no white person will ever inhabit, no matter how poor that white person. The logic of the 13th amendment to the US constitution made involuntary servitude unconstitutional and yet white power was preserved through the criminalization of black people. In this way, white power continued to hold sway.\n\nWhite America needs to engage in a form of crisis regarding its false and oppressive identity. It needs to grapple seriously with why it needed to project its vileness onto black people and people of color in the first place. Perhaps it needs to see its emptiness, to truly love itself beyond its continued de facto segregated spaces, its insularity. The gift contained in Backlash offers an embodied way of rethinking, re-feeling and re-positioning what it means to be white. It is a gift that offers loss, which is so counterintuitive.\n\nToday is white America's time to weep, to become vulnerable, and un-suture itself, which means, for me, a process of suffering oneself to be seen, of remaining wounded. The gift of Backlash is a radical call to white America to tarry with its own racist vomit, and to linger with the stench of the racist catastrophe of which it is responsible, before any talk of \"reconciliation\" is even possible."

      "text": "Is white America blind on racism, or just playing dumb?\n\nMilwaukee is the most segregated city in the US. Here I realised how easy it is for the majority to ignore the black minority and live in a bubble of privilege\n\nT he Washington Highlands area of Milwaukee is the kind of suburb that says you've arrived. The lawns are immaculate: manicured green parcels bordering big, square-jawed houses. Each home is a hotchpotch of architectural styles. Clearly, most owners built the dwelling of their dreams themselves. Birdsong is the soundtrack, not traffic belching out fumes.\n\nThey were having their annual rummage sale in the neighbourhood when I arrived to chat about racism in the US for a film in which I would only talk to white people. Most Americans are courteous. After a few minutes these were also candid.\n\nThey were confessing to an outsider: I was a neutral priest. \"I'm part of the problem,\" Charles Wilkie told me, his red baseball hat shading a look of resignation. A retired businessman, he said it was easy for him to avoid so-called black America and fail to appreciate the privations, the struggles. \"I don't know how to solve the problem, so what do I do, I ignore it, and yes, a lot of people do that. It's a lousy excuse and a poor answer. It's much easier not to know.\"\n\nWashington Heights is a suburb of the most segregated city in America . Charles lives in a part of Milwaukee where the residents are 99% white, yet a few blocks up the street are black neighbourhoods where lawns are not manicured, shops are boarded up, many houses have repossession notices slapped on their front doors, and the air is one of decay and poverty. The separation of black and white in Milwaukee is replicated in big cities right across the US, and separation breeds a lack of empathy.\n\nIn Washington Heights I collared Paula Kieferndorf, a teacher in the public school system. \"We're on 68th Street, but if you go down to 49th Street - especially through the summer - you can hear gunshots a couple of blocks further down. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,\" she said. \"The next day the news will come on, and sure enough, there was a shooting of some young black man, or a girl caught in crossfire. There's a lot of tragic things going on down there.\"\n\nI asked Becky Zrinsky, in her mid-30s, for her perception of the African Americans living a few blocks away. \"It's based purely on what I see on the news,\" she said. \"I'd like more information.\"\n\nI wanted to make a film about race in America, featuring only white people, because I was angry. Despite countless high-profile deaths of young black men at the hands of the police in recent years, nearly half of white Americans, according to a Pew Research Centre survey published this year, said they didn't believe racism was a big problem in the US.\n\nWhat world is white America living in? Surely the statistics say it all. Half of black Americans who are born poor stay poor; black students attend the worst schools; 1.6 million black men aged 24-54 have disappeared from civic life because they have died or are in prison. If you're black in Milwaukee, and earning $100,000, you'll be rejected for a mortgage as often as white people who are earning $20,000 are rejected. A black person with a college degree has less chance of finding a high-paying job than a white college dropout. The socio-economic data is damning. Is white America blind, or playing dumb?\n\nAnd yet, curiously, attitudes were similar in the 1960s, at the height of the civil rights movement. A Gallup poll from 1963 showed that 66% of whites believed that black people were treated equally when it came to housing, education and employment. Another, from the year before, showed that 85% of white people believed black children had the same chances of a good education as white children.\n\nIn the age of Jim Crow, most white people had absolutely no idea what Martin Luther King was trying to do. Like millions around the world, I watched the video of the killing in 2014 of the black man Eric Garner on a television news report. He died in a \"chokehold\", while being held down by several New York City police officers. Eleven times he gasped: \"I can't breathe.\" No charges were brought against any of the officers.\n\nWhere was the march on Washington by all right-thinking white people, let alone black? Some white Americans stood shoulder to shoulder with blacks in the streets, but that man's death deserved the attention of every white housewife, banker, lawyer, fireman, teacher, refuse collector, tax inspector, coal miner: the whole of white America should have stood up and said: enough.\n\nIn a tiny way, my trip to Milwaukee made me realise just how easy it is to avoid the unpalatable in America and to rely on a media too often interested in ratings rather than explanation. The race problem is a Gordian knot, one the US just can't cut.\n\nClive Myrie's report, Race in America, will be broadcast on BBC2 today at 17.10"

      "text": "Danez Smith: 'White people can learn from it, but that's not who I'm writing for'\n\nThe youngest winner of the Forward prize and author of viral sensation 'dear white America', Smith is back with a deeply personal collection, Homie\n\nPlus read an extract from Homie below\n\nD anez Smith was born into a devout Baptist household in St Paul, Minnesota. Smith's grandmother still lives there, in one of only two black households on a street that was mixed but is becoming increasingly white. Smith grew up, on this border between the blacker areas and the white middle-class enclaves of the city, as a black, queer, God-fearing child.\n\nThe future poet and spoken-word artist would listen to family members and friends telling stories on the porch, impressed by their way with words. The friends came and went but there was always one constant: church. Smith may have struggled to fit in among the congregation but Sunday morning meant worship, and more importantly a sermon. It was that rousing religious oration that opened up the world of writing and performance.\n\n\"The first writing I ever loved was the Sunday sermon,\" Smith says when we meet in Manchester, ahead of a live performance. \"There are moments in a Baptist church when the pastor gets caught in the spirit ... I think that's what I'm trying to do. I just have to get it out. Just let me get it out.\"\n\nFor the last decade Smith - who is non-binary and uses the pronouns them/they - has been letting the spirit take over. Three books of searing, brazenly queer and political poetry have made them one of the most discussed poets of their generation, and placed them at the vanguard of an African American movement that has seen spoken-word artists move from stages and backrooms to book deals and awards success.\n\nSmith's 2014 debut, [insert] boy , marked the arrival of a new voice; their 2017 collection Don't Call Us Dead confronted issues that were raging in the US as the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum, holding a mirror up to America's racism and advocating urgently for change, while touching on Smith's own HIV diagnosis. It was a finalist for the National book award in the US, and at 29, Smith became the youngest ever winner of the Forward best collection prize , beating US poet laureate Tracy K Smith to take the top honour.\n\nThe poem \"dear white America\" became a viral sensation, with Smith's intense performance of it earning comparisons to \" Howl \" - Allen Ginsberg's exasperated condemnation of the US in the 1950s.\n\ni tried, white people. i tried to love you, but you spent my brother's funeral making plans for brunch, talking too loud next to his bones. you took one look at the river, plump with the body of boy after girl after sweet boi & ask why does it always have to be about race? ... because Jordan boomed. because Emmett whistled. because Huey P. spoke. because Martin preached. because black boys can always be too loud to live.\n\nDon't Call Us Dead was a collection that spoke truth to white power and made Smith a literary star. But their new book Homie is different. \"This book does not care about white people,\" Smith says bluntly. \"It's about saying 'hello' to the people of colour in the room, 'let's talk'.\"\n\nIn person Smith is softly spoken and polite, carefully crafting each response, though still standing out in the hotel where we meet, with their basketball shoes, nose rings and Whitney Houston T-shirt a hint of the performer that lies beneath.\n\n\"Maybe that was the thing with Don't Call Us Dead , it was a lot angrier with white people,\" Smith says. \"With Homie I stopped asking myself: 'What should I do with the white gaze?' Because I realised I wasn't interested in it. I asked myself: 'Why am I spending so much time worried about this gaze?' I think white people can learn a lot from the poems, but that's not who I'm writing for.\"\n\nThat imagined reader is a specific group Smith calls \"Beloveds\": the largely black and queer friends and acquaintances Homie addresses. Originally, the book was going to have poems named after black people killed by \"state-sanctioned violence\", with a section about a friend's suicide. The latter part stayed but Smith decided to make the titles and themes more personal. \"I was writing to friends, to family, to people I wanted to speak to. I had to shut off the idea that my poems are now being read by this wider audience. I'm still invested in this intimate and small table: I can name the people that my poems are for.\"\n\nAnother reason for this more inward-looking perspective comes from Smith's struggle with writer's block in the lead-up to the deadline for Homie . They'd had bouts of it before but this was different - the usual stimulants of exercise, sex or weed (Smith says they have \"a long-term relationship with marijuana\") were useless. \"I was writing, but it was just all shit,\" says Smith, who put it down to the strain of living up to their newfound reputation. \"I felt a lot of pressure after Don't Call Us Dead was a 'thing'. It meant a lot to people and it won awards, and as much as I like to say that stuff doesn't affect you, it does. It's great, it's a confidence booster, but it also fucked with me for a while.\n\n\"I was in my own head for a little bit, asking myself: 'What does it mean if my next book doesn't win the National book award or some big thing?' I don't like that side of myself. I felt like I had been to the top of something. I had to come back and say: 'That is not at all why I started writing poems. That's not why I still write poems.'\"\n\nThe New Yorker said of Don't Call Us Dead that Smith's poems \"can't make history vanish, but they can contend against it with the force of a restorative imagination\". That imagination was honed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Smith studied before going on to form the Dark Noise Collective with other artists including Franny Choi, with whom Smith co-hosts the poetry podcast VS.\n\nToday, Smith makes a living from book sales, touring and teaching in Minnesota, where they still live, but has struggled with the idea of making money from a book so expressly about black suffering. \"You're doing the work because you want real change for your folks, but that also means capital gains for yourself. I felt I was profiting.\"\n\nDon't Call Us Dead pigeonholed Smith as the person the media went to for angry black poems; an easy fix for white editors and publishers looking to tap into the zeitgeist. \"I want my work to be useful,\" says Smith. \"So it felt good to know a poem was good for healing and rage or whatever for my people. But it also felt really gross.\"\n\n\"I couldn't write Don't Call Us Dead again,\" they add. \"There will always be America in the news and real black people will always be in my poems, but maybe that's why the focus of Homie is a lot more personal. I didn't want trauma porn and I worried about that. I don't think that's what I ever created but it was being used as that.\"\n\nHomie is deeply moving and funny, with poems such as \"all the good dick lives in Brooklyn Park\" combining a story about a booty call with the tragic decline of a lover dying from an unnamed illness. But it is a step change from Smith's earlier work. With Homie , Smith decided to focus on the theme of friendship and what they refer to as a \"deep investigation of the n-word\". That process starts from the very first page. A note says: \"This book was titled Homie because I don't want non-black people to say 'My Nig' out loud. This book is really titled 'My Nig'.\" If that doesn't hit home, the contents page will. Poems titled \"niggas!\", \"shout out to my niggas in Mexico\", \"white niggas\", and an explicit quote from a Lil Wayne song make the point again. It's playful, provocative and serves as a kind of warning to those unprepared for what is about to come.\n\nFor Smith, it is important that Europeans include themselves in those conversations about race and language: not being a white American does not absolve European readers from the burden of racism. At readings in the UK and Europe, Smith often addresses the elephant in the room directly. \"I think that sometimes folks forget that, just because America seems to be the most proud of what it does to its black, brown and indigenous folks, Europe invented that shit and spread it,\" says Smith.\n\nThe poet has been coming to the UK for a decade, since being invited by Manchester's Contact theatre, which has always been on the cutting edge of queer culture. Over that time Smith has observed the hypocritical standards of the race debate in Britain. \"There was always this idea that racism was a thing that Britain was done with and had been for a long time,\" they say. \"But Meghan Markle is Canadian now. She convinced a whole prince to leave because you guys were racist. They tried to send all the Jamaicans back too. Look. You are still up to it. So it's just to pull back from that moment and say: 'Hey, I might not be talking about your particular situation but you can find yourself a seat at the table.'\"\n\nMany of the column inches dedicated to Smith have concerned performance and identity: either their own or their work's exploration of it. But Smith says they are fundamentally a \"formalist\", who loves to \"geek out\" over sonnet crowns and voltas. In her New York Times review of Homie , critic Parul Sehgal identified a new form invented by Smith in the poem \"how many of us have them\", called the \"dozen\", whereby each stanza grows by one line until the final one, comprising 12 lines. \"I'd like to invent or order up new adjectives to describe the startling originality and ambition of Smith's work,\" she wrote.\n\nDoes the general focus on Smith's identity rather than the work grate? \"That is the story of the black writer throughout time,\" says Smith. \"I think that is true but it's not particular to me.\" Some reviewers, Smith argues, are \"so blinded by identity\" that they don't realise they are being \"marvelled by craft\". They are connecting to the work, but \"they are having a different journey to someone who can understand the author's point of view\".\n\n\"With a more forgiving eye, there are ways in which all of us come at the work with whatever references we have - because that is just what we know,\" Smith says. \"So there are people I have been compared to - more canonical folks - who I don't even know. I might have read a poem or two in school but I don't really bang heavies with whoever that might be. But there are ways in which other influences come to you. You might be a student of Whitman because one of your favourites really liked Whitman.\"\n\nFor Smith, the bigger crime is that too few reviewers are aware of many of the established poets who have been influences - people such as Patricia Smith, Lucille Clifton and Amaud Jamaul Johnson. \"If your understanding of black radical art starts and ends with Amiri Baraka and Sonia Sanchez, then you don't really know a lot of the archive. I think a lot of folks only know the 'canon', but there are so many canons to pull from,\" Smith says. \"All writers deserve that type of deep reading and seeing.\"\n\nDanez Smith\n\nlately has been a long time says the girl from Pakistan, Lahore to be specific at the bus stop when the white man ask her where she's from & then says oh, you from Lahore? it's pretty bad over there lately.\n\nlately has been a long time she says & we look at each other & the look says yes, i too wish dude would stop asking us about where we from but on the other side of our side eyes is maybe a hand where hands do no good a look to say, yes, i know lately has been a long time for your people too & i'm sorry the world is so good at making us feel like we have to fight for space to fight for our lives\n\n\"solidarity\" is a word, a lot of people say it i'm not sure what it means in the flesh i know i love & have cried for my friends their browns a different brown than mine i've danced their dances when taught & tasted how their mothers miracle the rice different than mine. i know sometimes i can't see beyond my own pain, past black & white, how bullets love any flesh. i know it's foolish to compare. what advice do the drowned have for the burned? what gossip is there between the hanged & the buried?\n\n& i want to reach across our great distance that is sometimes an ocean & sometimes centimeters & say, look. your people, my people, all that has happened to us & still make love under rusted moons, still pull children from the mothers & name them still teach them to dance & your pain is not mine & is no less & is mine & i pray to my god your god blesses you with mercy & i have tasted your food & understand how it is a good home & i don't know your language but i understand your songs & i cried when they came for your uncles & when you buried your niece i wanted the world to burn in the child's brief memory & still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still & i have stood by you in the soft shawl of morning waiting & breathing & waiting\n\nFrom Homie, published by Chatto on 20 February."

Plus, the Trump-loving cop blocking reform in Minneapolis\n\nGood morning,\n\nCurfews were lifted from Los Angeles to Washington DC on Thursday as peaceful protests against police violence continued for another day in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by officers in Minneapolis.\n\nFloyd's family led the mourners at a memorial service in the Minnesota city - the first of three such events planned across the country - where the Rev Al Sharpton gave voice to the passion, anger and hope of the protesters in a moving eulogy:\n\nWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life. It's time for us to stand up in George's name and say get your knee off our necks.\n\nAmid the widespread unrest over Floyd's death, several fresh incidents of police violence stand out. Two police officers in Buffalo, New York, have been suspended following the emergence of a video in which they shoved a 75-year-old man to the ground . In Vallejo, California, police shot dead an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up. In Austin, Texas, a black college student is in critical condition after suffering brain damage from a police beanbag round during a protest.\n\nThe nephew of David McAtee, shot dead by law enforcement in Louisville this week, says the police \" need to apologize and say 'we was wrong' .\"\n\nThe death of Manuel Ellis, who suffered a respiratory arrest in police custody in Washington state in March, has been ruled a homicide .\n\nRather than reform policing in America, we ought to defund it and use public spending in more publicly responsible ways, says the laywer and activist Malaika Jabali, arguing that police were never really created to protect and serve the masses:\n\nPolicing in America cannot be reformed because it is designed for violence. The oppression is a feature, not a bug.\n\nThe ACLU and other civil rights groups are suing Donald Trump , his attorney general, William Barr, and other federal officials over the law enforcement assault on peaceful protesters in Washington DC on Monday, when police deployed teargas and fired rubber bullets to clear the crowd so the president could walk across the street from the White House to get a photo op at a nearby church.\n\nBarr claims to have evidence of Antifa involvement in \"hijacking\" peaceful protests over Floyd's death to incite violence, saying the amorphous leftwing group was among a \"witches' brew a lot of different extremist organisations trying to exploit the protests .\"\n\nThe numbers are stark: black Americans are by some measures three times as likely to catch and be killed by the coronavirus as whites. On Thursday, witnesses told a House subcommittee on the crisis that structural racism is to blame for leaving African American and other minority populations with inferior health, housing and economic conditions in the face of the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, expressed concern that the mass demonstrations over Floyd's death could spread infections. We asked experts to weigh in on whether it was safe to protest in a pandemic .\n\nMore coronavirus updates:\n\nBrazil has overtaken Italy as the country with the third-highest Covid-19 death toll , after the US and UK.\n\nSouth Africa has seen an 80% jump in cases after the country began gradually easing its lockdown measures.\n\nNew Zealand may be coronavirus-free. The last confirmed case was almost two weeks ago , which means it might be the first country with more than 100 cases to successfully eliminate the disease.\n\nA Confederate statue will be removed from downtown Richmond , Virginia. Black leaders have praised the state's decision to take down the towering tribute to General Robert E Lee that stands on the city's Monument Avenue.\n\nThe Lancet has retracted the hydroxychloroquine paper that led to trials of the anti-malarial drug as a Covid-19 treatment being halted. Following an investigation by the Guardian, the study's lead author said he could no longer vouch for the accuracy of the data used in the research.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden in an audit that examined ties between the son of Trump's presidential rival and the energy company Burisma, of which he was a board member from 2014 to 2019.\n\nThe New York Times has issued a mea culpa over its widely criticised publication of an op-ed by the Republican senator Tom Cotton , in which he urged President Trump to \"send in the troops\" to quell protests.\n\nThe Trump-loving union boss blocking police reform in Minneapolis\n\nFew have spoken up in support of Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd. But one notable exception is Bob Kroll, the Trump-supporting Minneapolis police union chief , who has long blocked reform of a department with a history of racial abuse. Chris McGreal reports.\n\nGrime pioneer Wiley on his final album\n\nAfter the success of his 2019 track Boasty - featuring Sean Paul, Stefflon Don and Idris Elba - the British grime trailblazer is releasing his swan song LP, Godfather III. Wiley tells Dan Hancox about his beefs with Ed Sheeran, Drake and Stormzy , and why \"trying to be in the same field as the kids when you're in your mid-40s is ridiculous\".\n\nFor much of his white evangelical base, Trump's vow to crack down brutally on lawful protest is the sign of a righteous leader defending their god-given freedoms. Their opposition to policies that actually address systemic racism is nothing new, writes Sarah Posner.\n\nAt other similarly transformative moments in recent American history, white fundamentalists and evangelicals viewed the advance of civil rights in America as the nefarious work of leftist outsiders, and opposed laws and policy designed to promote equal rights.\n\nAfter online opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement reared its head in recent days, an unexpected ally rode to BLM's defence: K-Pop stans from around the world commandeered rightwing and racist hashtags including #WhiteLivesMatter , and flooded them with innocuous content featuring their favourite musical artists.\n\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

      "text": "Scaring White America\n\nP layboy's timing couldn't have been better. In this interview in May 1963 it caught Malcolm X at the pinnacle of his most combative black nationalist phase and America in the grip of racial turmoil. Within a year Malcolm X had repudiated almost every stance in the interview. He had broken with the Nation of Islam movement, fallen out with its leader Elijah Muhammad, renounced black supremacy and embraced racial equality, human rights and pan-African solidarity. Within two years he would be assassinated in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom.\n\nBut in 1963 he remained wedded to both the race-based, homegrown theology and cultish organisation. As such Malcolm X was always well aware of his shock value to white America. The interview took place over several days. After delivering a particularly fierce diatribe against whites or Christians, he sometimes almost dares interviewer Alex Haley to censor him. \"You know the devil's not going to print that!\" he said.\n\nPlayboy was more than happy to publish his statements verbatim. The magazine knew its readership well and understood the mawkish fascination an interview with a black nationalist like Malcolm X would hold. \"Many will be shocked by what he has to say,\" wrote the editors in defence of publication. \"Others will be outraged.\"\n\nBut there were yet others, out there in black America, who sympathised with Malcolm X's defiant and unapologetic attitude even if they did not agree with his specific agenda. As the magazine hit the stands, Martin Luther King was in jail in Birmingham, Alabama, from where he wrote a letter to local clergy who had branded his demonstrations in the town as \"untimely\" and \"unwise\". \"For years now I have heard the word 'Wait!'\" wrote King. \"It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This 'Wait' has almost always meant 'Never'. We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that 'justice too long delayed is justice denied'.\"\n\nKing gave voice to the impatience. Malcolm articulated the rage. And there was plenty to be angry about. The year had started with Alabama governor George Wallace stamping his foot on the entrance to the statehouse and declaring: \"I draw a line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny ... and I say segregation now ... segregation tomorrow ... segregation forever.\"\n\nBefore the year was over, police in Birmingham, Alabama, had turned guns and hoses on black demonstrators seeking the vote and the Ku Klux Klan had firebombed a black church killing four little girls at Sunday school. In between all of that, King had made his \"I have a dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln monument.\n\nA Newsweek poll taken shortly afterwards showed that 3% of African-Americans and 74% of whites believed that \"Negroes were moving too fast\". Reasonable demands for civil rights made by reasonable people did not appear to have impressed on white America the urgency to resolve the issue. In Malcolm's eyes it didn't matter if they found him unreasonable or not. Indeed at this stage in his life you get the impression that he didn't feel he was doing his job properly unless he was scaring white people out of their skin.\n\nA pornographic magazine seems an odd outlet for an ascetic soul like Malcolm X. Yet over the years the Playboy interview had snagged some unlikely characters including Bertrand Russell, Jawaharlal Nehru, Muhammad Ali (twice), Martin Luther King, Fidel Castro (twice), Daniel Ortega, Bernadette Devlin and Billie Jean King. And by all accounts Malcolm X was pleased with the outcome. For if the interview came at a crucial time in American racial history and Malcolm X's life, it also proved a pivotal moment in the relationship between him and his interviewer, Alex Haley. Haley, who later wrote the blockbuster slave narrative Roots, had jumped through hoops to secure an interview for Reader's Digest a few years earlier. When they first met, Malcolm X said: \"You're another one of the white man's [agents] sent to spy!\" Haley had to fly to Chicago and have dinner with Elijah Muhammad before the interview could be granted. Malcolm X was happy with Haley's work and after the interview began to collaborate with him. \"He was most aware of the periodicals' power, and he had come to regard me, if still suspiciously, as one avenue of access.\" It was the start of a mutually beneficial doubleact. He started to tip Haley off if he was going to say something newsworthy. Not long afterwards he would tell Haley his life story, which became his bestselling autobiography. When Malcolm signed the contract for the book he told Haley: \"A writer is what I want, not an interpreter.\" In Haley that is what he always got.\n\nGary Younge is the Guardian's New York correspondent."

Plus - Trump: An American Dream\n\nT he standout moment from last night's thoughtful, unflinching but generous-hearted documentary by journalist Gary Younge (of this parish), Angry, White and American (Channel 4), had already gone semi-viral on social media before the programme aired.\n\nAs part of his examination of the mental, economic and emotional state of white America, Younge interviewed Richard Spencer , an influential figure in the \"alt-right\" movement - and coiner of the term, \"which I think,\" said Younge carefully, \"is a new word for 'fascist'\". Spencer was also a featured speaker at the violent \"Unite the right\" protest in Charlottesville this summer that left three people dead , including anti-fascist protester Heather Hayer .\n\nWhat happened in Charlottesville on 12 August?\n\nWhite nationalists gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, to protest against a plan to remove a statue of Robert E Lee, the Confederacy's top general in the American civil war.\n\nDemonstrators chanted racist statements, carried antisemitic placards and held torches during the \"Unite the Right\" rally, which was organised by white nationalist Jason Kessler.\n\nThe march was met by anti-fascist demonstrators, and some skirmishes broke out before James Fields, 20, allegedly ploughed a car into a group of counter-demonstrators.\n\nCivil rights activist Heather Heyer, 32, died and others were injured. Fields has been charged with murder.\n\nIt is already quite something to read about these people and what they say and what they believe. It is something else again to watch one of them say it on camera to a black journalist interviewing him for broadcast.\n\n\"Africans have benefited from their experiences with white supremacy ... how can you deny that?\" Spencer asks. Younge denies it, passionately and eloquently.\n\nSpencer exults in Donald Trump's victory . Although he doesn't think the president shares his full vision, \"People are now aware of the term 'alt-right', my name, that there's a whole other right [wing] out there based in identity and race.\"\n\nThere is no world history without the white man, asserts Spencer - \"We are the genius that drives it\" - before, in essence, telling Younge to go home. He does not mean to England. \"You will never be an Englishman.\" Why, wonders Younge. \"Because my name is Richard Spencer.\"\n\nThe rest of the film functioned as a riposte to such mindless bigotry, as Younge dug slowly down through the layers of contemporary circumstance, experience and history to find how it is that Spencer's sentiments are taking root again.\n\nFirst, there is the sense that, as the day approaches (within a generation) that white people will become a minority, that their - well, they would call it culture, others would call it privilege, so let's split the difference and call it way of life - is under threat. There is the real decline in income and job security since the 50s and the death of the American dream that things can only get better. And there is the opioid crisis , from which more Americans died last year than in the whole of the Vietnam war . The victims are disproportionately white. That it has been primarily defined as a health crisis - unlike the similar situation with crack cocaine that unfolded in the black community in the 80s, which was defined as a social problem to be solved by incarceration on a massive scale - is, Younge notes with characteristic scrupulousness, \"both progress and the definition of white privilege\".\n\nWhite people are now the only group whose life expectancy is decreasing. \"They're dying of despair,\" says Younge. But is it the despair that comes from poverty, unemployment and genuine injustices being perpetrated against them? A rightful sense of abandonment by governments of every stripe? Or a manifestation of the fact that when you have had every advantage, parity feels a lot like deprivation? (To wit: the unselfconscious whining of the moneyed couple who feel perennially \"judged\" as white southerners, despite being just about everything you may have heard about white southerners. \"It hurts us inside!\" they wail.) Or all of the above?\n\nAs he drives out of Mississippi at the end of his journey through the US and its fracturing psyche, Younge - full of grace and insight even at his most combative moments - says he feels that, \"Fear is winning. America is losing.\"\n\nApropos absolutely everything - the other major documentary last night was the opening of a four-part series looking at the life of Trump ( Trump: An American Dream , Channel 4). Archive footage of a younger, paler and - most strikingly of all - perfectly articulate Trump and his acolytes, business associates, employees, wives, lawyers and diabolical father Fred illustrated the biography. The commentary on it was provided mostly by those who had stood on the sidelines, jaws dropping ever further south, as the Trump family's ego , tactics and all-round monstrousness grew to the gargantuan proportions we know and love today.\n\nThanks to his father's savvy and connections and the help of lawyer Roy Cohn - McCarthy's chief counsel during the Red Scare and \"the most repulsive man I ever met in my life\", according to Wayne Barrett, then an investigative journalist for the Village Voice - the Trump empire grew. Trump got everything he wanted. On the rare occasion that he found himself thwarted by someone incorruptible or uncowable, he knew what to do. \"I'll wait for a more progressive administration and for bad times. When bad times come, I'll get whatever I want.\" They're here, and so is he. Or he's here and so, they are.\n\nEither way, America - and all of us - are losing."

      "text": "Why America needs White History Month\n\nT he Republican presidential campaign has persuaded me. Not to vote for Mitt Romney , God no. They have, however, convinced me of something else I previously considered unthinkable. In some ways, the idea betrays my black nationalist inclinations, but having witnessed the GOP's flailing for the past year and a half as they've tried to mount a campaign to unseat President Obama, I've finally come around.\n\nWe need a White History Month.\n\nFor anyone who speaks on issues of race publicly, the idea has long been a joke - a retort thrown at you from frustrated white folks who believe they are being discriminated against because there doesn't exist a special month set aside to celebrate their racial identity. They cry foul at the notion of Black History Month, Black Entertainment Television, Black Enterprise and everything else with \"black\" in the title - even, sometimes, going so far as to say these things are racist in nature because their names and missions are \"discriminatory\". It's preposterous, but they counter that they need a White History Month to provide balance and equality.\n\nAfter laughing this off for years, I'm now on the same page.\n\nI don't mean White History in the same way we (attempt) to celebrate Black History during February, or Women's History in March. Where these are intended to correct an imbalance in the way history is celebrated from an overwhelming white male perspective, White History Month need not rehash the tales of great white heroism. We need a different approach here.\n\nI mean for us to have a White History Month in the way James Baldwin once suggested a White History Week. During a speech before the National Press Club in 1986 , he presented the idea and was later questioned about the seriousness of his remark. He responded :\n\n\"I was not joking about White History Week ... I'm serious about that. White Americans really do not not know their history, and that's one of the reasons they're in trouble. And when I suggest White History Week, I'm not making a parody of Black History Week, but I'm suggesting that the truth about this country is buried in the myths that white people have about themselves. These myths have to be excavated and only can be excavated by white people.\"\n\nMost of the history we learn is built on myths. Even the black history we choose to teach in response to eurocentric learning is centered around myths. But those myths are meant to help a people reclaim a history long denied to them, to instil self-esteem in the face of disempowerment. It may not be exactly ideal, but the rationale is at least noble. The myths of white American history perpetuate oppression and inequality. They instil in white America a false sense of self-imperviousness to facts or logic.\n\nWhen George Washington can't tell a lie, Abraham Lincoln singlehandedly freed the enslaved, FDR lifted the nation out of depression and Ronald Reagan tore down the Berlin Wall with his bare hands ... it's no wonder Michele Bachmann believes the founding fathers fought to end slavery, Newt Gingrich thinks poor black children should be janitors to teach them about work ethic, Rick Perry hunts at \" Niggerhead \" and sees no problem, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney can tell \"jokes\" about the president's birth certificate and his campaign co-chair, John Sununu, can refer to the president as \"lazy\" and \"not that bright\".\n\nThe race-baiting and sabre-rattling that has been on display for the duration of the presidential nomination process - and now is a part of the national campaign - reveal not just a disdain for people of color, but also a deep misunderstanding of what it means to be white. Whiteness has its privileges, and among them is that your view of history is through that of the default, the conqueror, the triumphant. And when you can see history through that lens, you don't have to be burdened with understanding the consequences of your triumph from the perspective of those who were stepped on during the conquest.\n\nAs the racial and ethnic demographics shift in this country, the Republican party has become home to an angry white reactionary base that feels their privilege being threatened. What a White History Month could teach them is that this is nothing new, and that even their identity as white people has evolved. White immigrants of the 18th and 19th century, particularly those of eastern European descent, experienced discrimination, but gradually gained acceptance as they embraced American racism and the white Anglos needed more among their ranks to ensure they retained power.\n\nWhite America needs their myths interrogated, deconstructed and ultimately replaced with a new history altogether. Like Black History Month, a White History Month would be unable to cover all the territory needed to accomplish such a feat in so short a period of time. One would need to do so around the clock, around the calendar.\n\nBut this is the United States, and we enjoy our pageantry. Let us observe White History Month and use it to rescue white America from itself."

How is this still happening in 2024?\n\nA Texas court is set to decide next month if one of its school districts can continue to punish a Black teenager for refusing to cut his locs.\n\nSince last August, 18-year-old Darryl George has been kept out of his regular classroom at Barbers Hill high school in Mont Belvieu while he served in-school suspension and faced other disciplinary action because of his hair.\n\nAccording to CNN, the Barbers Hill independent school district forbids male students from wearing their hair in a style \"that would allow the hair to extend below the top of a t-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes when let down\". George's long dreadlocks, which he keeps woven together in a protective style on top of his head, supposedly violates that dress code.\n\nBlack children shouldn't have to litigate the hair that grows out of their head. I'm a Black woman who also has locs and is all too aware of the ways that my own appearance is often scrutinized. That this teenage Black boy will have to fight in court for his right to his own hair shows just how far traditionally white authorities will go to exert control and reinforce meaningless status quos.\n\nTake this court case itself. We've only arrived at this point - a full-blown trial - because the school district, rather than respond with accountability to the public outcry about George's suspension, doubled down on its stance by filing a lawsuit to determine whether its dress code was in violation of the Crown Act, a law that protects Black people from discrimination on the basis of their hair.\n\nBlack hair discrimination is as old as Black presence in America itself, and it's taken various creative forms throughout history. Today, locs, braids, afros and other textured hair types continue to be made political because of the ways western society privileges straight hair, and disparages and denigrates Black hair.\n\nThis endless debate over Black hair is also indicative of a larger systemic erasure of Black identity from public life. Companies enforcing dress codes that effectively tell Black employees they can't come to work without changing their appearance, Black girls being forced to \"tame\" their hair for school or work, Black boys having their locs viciously shorn in front of hundreds of their peers - all of it amounts to the not-so-subliminal messaging that Black people can't truly be a part of society unless they chase white supremacy's ever-shifting goalposts of cultural compliance.\n\nIn a full-page ad taken out in the Houston Chronicle earlier this month, Barbers Hill's superintendent, Greg Poole, defended the school dress code, adding that \"being an American requires conformity\".\n\nAnd there it is - the underlying idea that anything that bleeds outside the lines of Eurocentric normativity is inherently un-American and therefore a \"danger\" to American society that needs to be taken care of. It's a logic that simultaneously reinforces the \"other\"-ness of Black Americans and justifies the endless state-sanctioned violence that's done to them.\n\n\"I love my hair, it is sacred and it is my strength,\" George wrote in a recent affidavit. \"All I want to do is go to school and be a model student. I am being harassed by school officials and treated like a dog.\"\n\nHis words are haunting.\n\nWhite children are allowed to grow up without having their bodies - their literal hair and skin and features - become a testing ground for political debate. Black children deserve to have that too.\n\nTayo Bero is a Guardian US columnist"

      "text": "Scott Adams Echoes White America's Resentful History of \"Helping\" Others\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFor centuries, we've been assisting African Americans, Native Americans, Vietnamese people, and Iraqis and have never been thanked once.\n\nScott Adams, creator of the comic strip \"Dilbert,\" in Dublin, Calif., on Oct. 26, 2006. Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Wednesday's peculiar YouTube remarks by \"Dilbert\" cartoonist Scott Adams about Black Americans being a \"hate group\" have certainly received a lot of attention. Hundreds of newspapers across the U.S. have now dropped Adams's strip .\n\nScott Adams, creator of the comic strip \"Dilbert,\" in Dublin, Calif., on Oct. 26, 2006.\n\nWhat's gotten almost no notice, however, is how Adams went on at length about his efforts to be \"helpful to Black America.\" But my ears perked up when I heard this, since the most berserk racial ultraviolence in U.S. history has always been accompanied by this kind of rhetoric from white Americans - i.e., we've done our best to help others, only for them to turn around and loathe us rather than respond with the gratitude we deserve for our openhearted kindness.\n\nHere's some of what Adams said on this subject:\n\nAs you know, I've been identifying as Black for a while. Years now, because I like to be on the winning team.\n\nAnd I like to help. And I thought, if you help the Black community, that's sort of the biggest lever, you can find the biggest benefit. ... So I like to focus a lot of my life resources on helping Black Americans. So much so that I started identifying as Black, just to be on the team I was helping. ...\n\nI think it makes no sense as a white citizen of America to try to help Black citizens anymore. ... That's no longer a rational impulse. I'm going to back off from being helpful to Black America, because it doesn't seem like it pays off. I've been doing it all my life, and the only outcome is that I've been called a racist. It makes no sense to help Black Americans if you're white. ... Don't even think it's worth trying.\n\nNow here's what white Americans have been saying for the past 400 years about Native Americans, African Americans, Vietnamese people, Iraqis, and many, many other people. See if you can spot a pattern.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe first seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, created after King Charles I granted the colony a charter in 1629, portrayed a Native American saying, \"Come Over and Help Us.\" Just eight years later, during the Pequot massacre , the men of Massachusetts helped about 500 women, children, and other civilians become dead.\n\nBy the early 1800s, white America had decided that we had to separate ourselves from the ungrateful wretches surrounding us. President Andrew Jackson began his famous 1830 speech to Congress with the happy news that \"the benevolent policy of the government, steadily pursued for nearly 30 years, in relation to the removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is approaching to a happy consummation.\" This was all thanks to how nice we were. \"The policy of the general government toward the red man,\" said Jackson, \"is not only liberal, but generous.\"\n\nThe government's benevolent policy had already been enacted by Jackson's soldiers during the Creek War in 1814, when they removed strips of skin from their defeated enemies and made bridles for their horses out of them. Then, after Jackson's speech, the government helped about 60,000 Native Americans experience the Trail of Tears.\n\nRelated America's 9/11 Wars Created the Foot Soldiers of Far-Right Violence at Home\n\nIt wasn't too much later that President Teddy Roosevelt explained in his book \"The Winning of the West\" that \"no other conquering and colonizing nation has ever treated the original savage owners of the soil with such generosity as has the United States.\"\n\nYou might ask what the reaction of Indigenous people was to all this help. Sadly, there was just a total lack of appreciation. As the Rocky Mountain News pointed out , they were an \"ungrateful race\" that \"ought to be wiped from the face of the earth.\"\n\nAnd what about slavery? You guessed it: It was also the product of white America's sincere efforts to help others. One well-known elucidation of this concept was written before the Civil War by William Gilmore Simms, a popular novelist and member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. As he put it , slavery was \"not simply within the sanctions of justice and propriety, but constituting one of the most essential agencies ... for elevating, to a condition of humanity, a people otherwise barbarous, easily depraved, and needing the help of a superior condition.\"\n\nAnother South Carolinian, John Calhoun, had similar insights. Slavery, he argued , was a \"positive good\" for enslaved people and demonstrated the lengths slave owners would go to in their efforts to help others. \"In few countries so much is left to the share of the laborer,\" Calhoun said in a speech on the floor of the Senate, \"and so little exacted from him, or where there is more kind attention paid to him in sickness or infirmities of age.\"\n\nThis led to a lot of white people getting their feelings hurt when their benevolence wasn't recognized. Harriet Jacobs escaped a plantation in North Carolina and later wrote about her attempts to persuade her owner - who raped many of the women he enslaved - to sell her to someone else:\n\nOn such occasions he would assume the air of a very injured individual, and reproach me for my ingratitude. \"Did I not take you into the house, and make you the companion of my own children?\" he would say. \"And this is the recompense I get, you ungrateful girl!\"\n\nU.S. history just goes on from there in exactly the same way. In 1966, the editor of U.S. News & World Report told the publication's readers that \"what the United States is doing in Vietnam is the most significant example of philanthropy extended by one people to another that we have witnessed in our times.\" When challenged, he responded that \"primitive peoples with savagery in their hearts have to be helped to understand the true basis of a civilized existence.\" A recent book on Vietnam records that \"in the oral and written accounts, the [American soldiers] in Vietnam constantly register bitter complains about what they consider Vietnamese ingratitude.\"\n\nThe Iraq War was, of course, all about helping Iraqis. In a speech just before the U.S. and its allies invaded, President George W. Bush proclaimed , \"The United States and our coalition stand ready to help the citizens of a liberated Iraq.\" Trent Lott of Mississippi, then the top Senate Republican, agreed after the war had started, saying, \"We went in there to free those people.\"\n\nIt was a beautiful moment, but America soon ran into the same problem we'd faced so often before. Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard took a trip to Iraq and reported that \"Iraqis want help. Indeed, they demand it and are angry and frustrated when they don't get it instantly. But they appear to hate being helped.\" Barnes said he'd like to see \"an outbreak of gratitude for the greatest act of benevolence one country has ever done for another.\" Instead, Iraqis were \"sullen and suspicious and conspiracy-minded. ... Papers obsess on the subject of brutal treatment of innocent Iraqis by American soldiers.\" For Lott's part, by this time, he was musing that \"if we have to, we just mow the whole place down, see what happens.\"\n\nThat brings us up to today and the genuine distress of Scott Adams. People like him have been helping so many others, so vigorously, for so many centuries. It's no wonder that he's tired of not getting the least bit of thanks.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "I Was a CIA Whistleblower. Now I'm a Black Inmate. Here's How I See American Racism.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA former CIA officer, imprisoned for disclosing classified information to a New York Times journalist, speaks out about the mechanics of racism and his hopes for overcoming it.\n\nI do not like prison. No one should.\n\nIt is a strenuous, unceasing effort to cope with the ordeal of being incarcerated at a federal prison. I find myself identifying with the title character from Shakespeare's \"Richard II\" when he laments his own effort to adjust to confinement by wondering, \"I have been studying how I may compare this prison where I live unto the world.\" I do my best to resist the thought that prison is a reflection of our society, but the comparisons are unavoidable. Unlike \"Richard II,\" my \"studying\" has not been so much a comparison as an unhappy realization.\n\nFrom the moment I crossed the threshold from freedom to incarceration because I was charged with, and a jury convicted me of, leaking classified information to a New York Times reporter, I needed no reminder that I was no longer an individual. Prison, with its \"one size fits all\" structure, is not set up to recognize a person's worth; the emphasis is removal and categorization. Inmates are not people; we are our offenses. In this particular prison where I live, there are S-Os (sex offenders), Cho-Mos (child molesters), and gun and drug offenders, among others. Considering the charges and conviction that brought me here, I'm not exactly sure to which category I belong. No matter. There is an overriding category to which I do belong, and it is this prison reality that I sadly \"compare unto the world\": I'm not just an inmate, I'm a black inmate.\n\nThinking that you know about something and actually experiencing it are completely different. Previously, my window into prison life was informed, in part, by the same depictions in movies, TV shows, and books that the rest of America has seen. And unfortunately, as a child I heard firsthand so many stories about prison life from people I knew that it seemed commonplace. I expected there to be a separation of the races - by some accounts \"necessary\" racial segregation - because that is what I saw, read, and heard. My expectations and naiveté could not prepare me for actually living in it, however.\n\nI didn't have to be taught the rules of prison society, particularly in regard to racial segregation, because they are so ingrained in just about every aspect of prison society that they seem instinctual. Even though there is no official mandate, here, I am my skin color. Whenever, in my stubborn idealism, I refuse to acknowledge being racially categorized and question the submission to it, the other prisoners invariably respond, \"Man, this is prison.\"\n\nThese distinctions are maintained even when I'm watching TV, because there is no integrated TV watching in prison. I am not welcome to watch in the \"white,\" \"Hispanic,\" or \"Native\" TV rooms. So I spend a lot of time in the black TV room. There are no spatial advantages or disadvantages to this segregation, because all the rooms have one or two tables, one or two TVs that offer the same channels, and the occasional pigeon flitting about indoors.\n\nFor me, the black TV room is a place of solace for reading, writing, being frustrated by Sudoku, and generally escaping from the everyday pain of prison life. However, even as an escape, its very existence constantly reminds me of the pervasiveness, pointlessness, and harmfulness of separation along racial lines. It is a reflection of America outside these walls. What I see in prison is sad, but what I'm seeing from prison is worse.\n\nSince arriving here last June, and from the black TV room, I have seen news reports on the racially motivated shooting of black parishioners at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, and seemingly unending and routine instances of black citizens, including Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana, falling victim to excessive force and being killed by law enforcement officers. I have also seen reports of law enforcement officers being killed in attacks no less horrific. The sadness I feel at what has been happening outside these walls was already festering inside me before I became an inmate; when I entered prison, I was still reeling from the death of Michael Brown in the St. Louis area, which I proudly call home.\n\nWatching these tragedies from prison, and especially from the black TV room, has been a profound experience. Throughout the days when the shootings were being covered and commentary on the news channels was ongoing, both TVs in the black TV room were constantly tuned in. As the events were unfolding on the news, I was struck by the uncommon silence in the TV room. Accentuating the uneasy silence was an air of frustration and a palpable lack of surprise and shock not only from the others, but also from myself. I, for one, did not know what to say. And that silence was impacted by another burning question I had no answer for, especially being in prison: What am I, or anyone else here, to do? A possible answer came in the form of a comment from one of my fellow viewers that was as stark in breaking the silence as it was in defining where I was and what I was seeing. \"Man, this is America,\" he said.\n\nI cannot and will not accept that viewpoint, so I wanted and needed to know that outside the black TV room and outside the prison walls, the rest of America also found it unacceptable. I ventured out to see how the news was playing out in the other TV rooms. With the pretext of going to the ice machine (funny how we can't watch TV together, but we can use the same ice machine), I passed by the white TV room. Those TVs were not tuned to the news reports of the shootings. Instead, one was playing ESPN, the other COPS. I didn't make it into the Hispanic or Native TV rooms, but it became clear that the America of the white TV room, at least, was not the same as the one that was playing out in the black TV room, both on and off the screen.\n\nIllustration: Matt Rota for The Intercept. Comparing prison unto the world has been no more complex than comparing one TV room to another. The black TV room and the prison society that allows and perpetuates it have not been providing me with a window to America - they have provided a lamentable mirror. That mirror is reflecting the reality that racial segregation, particularly tacitly, is all too American. The America one sees and experiences depends on what TV room the color of one's skin mandates.\n\nIn prison, I see that mindset of latent and allowable racism creating and being typified by racial segregation. On TV, I see that very same mindset in tragic action outside the prison walls through the use of racial profiling throughout the country, racially motivated voter ID laws, politicians stoking racial anxieties for votes, a criminal justice system that engages in racially disparate application and enforcement of the law, and much more. Such all-too-American, misguided practices foster, if not encourage, societal segregation and incite the dangers that necessarily accompany it. I can argue that the Charleston church shooter, the white law enforcement officers who have killed black citizens, and the black men who have killed law enforcement officers acted out of an animosity fueled by this same sort of prison mindset. What I have seen of the America I was a part of is the unfortunate and natural extension of what I'm living in prison.\n\nCall me naive, call me a dreamer, and I'll wear those monikers proudly because I still believe, even from prison, in this country and what it is supposed to stand for. Has that been my personal experience and what I've been seeing from prison? No. As merely one example, during my time in the CIA it became clear, in the organization's words and actions toward me, that they saw me not as an American who wanted to serve his country but as \"a big black guy.\" But my dreams of America are far more enduring than a prison TV room mentality. There is a black America, there is a white America, there are many Americas. The greatness and promise of this country lies in equality reinforced by our differences rather than defined by them. My America is not a prison. For now, I'm confined to the black TV room at the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado. When I am free, I don't want to feel that I'm merely going from one prison to another.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

While support for same-sex marriage has increased, for instance, support for \" interpolitical marriage \" - specifically, Gallup asked adults about the prospect of their son or daughter marrying someone of a different political background - has actually gone down.\n\nBut what if the source of this polarization has little do with where people actually fall on the issues, or what people actually believe in? What if people are simply polarized by political labels like \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" and what they imagine their opponents to be like more than they are by disagreements over issues like taxes, abortion, and immigration?\n\nThat news wouldn't surprise anybody who's spent time battling it out in a news outlet's comment section, and it's the firm conclusion of new research by Lilliana Mason, a professor at the University of Maryland.\n\nHer paper, \"Ideologues Without Issues: the Polarizing Consequences of Ideological Identities,\" published in late March by Public Opinion Quarterly, uses 2016 data from Survey Sampling International and American National Election Studies to study how and why Americans are politically polarized.\n\nShe used measures that identify both where people stand on issues and how they identify their political clan. For issues, she took six major ones from the survey: \"immigration, the Affordable Care Act, abortion, same-sex marriage, gun control, and the relative importance of reducing the deficit or unemployment.\" Additionally, she used their measurements of social identity on a range from liberal to conservative.\n\nShe then sought to correlate these answers with questions where respondents answered whether they would prefer to live next door to, marry, be friends with, or spend social time with someone who differs from them politically.\n\nShe found that the political identity people adopt was far more predictive of their preferences for social interaction.\n\nFor instance, \"moving from the least identified to the most identified with an ideological label increases preference for marrying inside the ideological group by 30 percentage points.\" In other words, if you are a committed liberal, you're much more likely to want to live next to other committed liberals. But if you just disagree strongly with them about a specific issue like abortion, not so much.\n\nShe writes, \"The effect of issue-based ideology is less than half the size of identity-based ideology in each element of social distance. ... These are sizable and significant effects, robust to controls for issue-based ideology, and they demonstrate that Americans are dividing themselves socially on the basis of whether they call themselves liberal or conservative, independent of their actual policy differences.\"\n\n\"There's been a debate within political science for a long time about whether or not the American public is polarized,\" Mason said in an interview with The Intercept. \"I'm sort of making this argument that as you have multiple social identities that line up together, people hate their out groups more regardless of their policy positions.\"\n\nShe noted, for instance, that Americans who identify most strongly as conservative, whether they hold more left-leaning or right-leaning positions on major issues, dislike liberals more than people who more weakly identify as conservatives but may hold very right-leaning issue positions.\n\nThe loose connection some voters have with policy preferences has become apparent in recent years. Donald Trump managed to flip a party from support of free trade to opposition to it by merely taking the opposite side of the issue. Democrats, meanwhile, mocked Mitt Romney in 2012 for calling Russia the greatest geopolitical adversary of the United States, but now have flipped and see Russia as exactly that. Regarding health care, the structure of the Affordable Care Act was initially devised by the conservative Heritage Foundation and implemented in Massachusetts as \"Romneycare.\" Once it became Obamacare, the Republican team leaders deemed it bad, and thus it became bad.\n\nMason believes the implications of such shallow divisions between people could make the work of democracy harder. If your goal in politics is not based around policy but just defeating your perceived enemies, what exactly are you working toward? (Is it any surprise there is an entire genre of campus activism dedicated to simply upsetting your perceived political opponents?)\n\n\"The fact that even this thing's that supposed to be about reason and thoughtfulness and what we want the government to do, the fact that even that is largely identity-powered, that's a problem for debate and compromise and the basic functioning of democratic government. Because even if our policy attitudes are not actually about what we want the government to do but instead about who wins, then nobody cares what actually happens in the government,\" Mason said. \"We just care about who's winning in a given day. And that's a really dangerous thing for trying to run a democratic government.\"\n\nShe suggested a solution: Spend some time talking to your neighbors, friends, and loved ones about things besides politics.\n\n\"The problem is not a policy-based problem, because on average we're relatively moderate in these policy attitudes. Talking to each other about political stuff is sort of the worst solution ever, because all that's going to do is activate our political identities, which cause us to dislike each other. The better thing to do is if your next door neighbor is of a different political orientation than you, to talk about their dog, or what's going on in their family,\" Mason said. \"In general, the best way to get through this polarization is to start thinking of each other as human beings.\"\n\nTop photo: A Trump supporter (left) and an anti-Trump protestor (right) have a discussion while waiting for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump to arrive for a tour of the Flint Water Treatment Plant in Flint, Mich., on Sept. 14, 2016.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "How to Love This Freaky Country\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe right loves to accusingly demand, \"Do you love this country?\" We need the confidence to answer, \"I love the parts you're trying to destroy.\"\n\nAmerican progressives can't ever match conservatives in displays of febrile patriotism, and for good reason. What Jesus told his followers about prayer is also good advice about loving a country: \"Thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.\"\n\nMoreover, anyone who's spent five minutes thinking about human history knows how dangerously volatile nationalism is. This is especially important to keep in mind in a country that has used nuclear weapons and pondered whether to drop tungsten rods on our enemies from orbit .\n\nNonetheless, I believe it behooves all of us to consider and celebrate what is resplendent about the United States of America.\n\nFirst, if you don't do so, you wear blinders that prevent you from seeing a giant chunk of reality. In Catholic theology most souls are of middling virtue - but the ones which are not are generally not good or evil alone but both at once. As St. Augustine put it, \"my two wills, one old and the other new, one carnal, the other spiritual, contend within me.\" The same goes for countries: If they're not in the middle of the bell curve they often occupy both ends simultaneously. That is definitely the United States.\n\nSecond, one of America's most beautiful attributes is that we have freedom and resources that our fellow malcontents in many other countries could only dream of. Pretending that we don't have this wiggle room is - particularly for white activists - to show ourselves to be distastefully spoiled.\n\nThird, being conscious of this country's upside is the only way we'll ever be able to communicate with anyone outside the minute lefty archipelago. The lived experience of millions of Americans has been that it's superior to where their families once came from. Trying to convince them that it's uniformly appalling is like trying to convince them that they have three arms. That's not going to work.\n\nFinally, it's critical for our own psychological wellbeing. Much about America's past has been hideous and much about the present is grim. But keeping that going as an endless interior monologue is a recipe for stasis and failure. Conversely, an appreciation of the glorious parts of the U.S. is motivation to protect and expand them. The right loves to accusingly demand, \"Do you love this country?\" We need the confidence to give the correct answer, which is \"I love the parts you're trying to destroy.\"\n\nSo for July 4, I've made a list of what's most deeply meaningful to me about America.\n\nJennifer Burbank of the Georgetown volunteer fire department, decorates a firetruck with a 48-star U.S. flag donated by longtime Georgetown resident Bernice Plass before the start of the Fourth of July Parade in downtown Georgetown on Friday July, 4, 2003.\n\nPeople Have Rights, Not the Government\n\nFor most of the time in most places, societies believed that the natural order was to have a king who had the final word about everything. The Declaration of Independence was one of the first attempts to flip that on its head, and declare that individual people come first and governments derive their power \"from the consent of the governed.\"\n\nIt's easy to forget the momentousness of this statement in an era when Fortune 500 companies complain that governmental tyranny prevents them from putting arsenic in their line of baby food. But it was a giant step forward, and one of the best parts about being an American is an instinctive understanding of the zaniness of monarchies. For instance, Great Britain pays an old lady from some German family to live in a gigantic house, and if you have dinner there you have to immediately stop eating when she does .\n\nThe Declaration of Independence resonated so deeply with universal human aspirations that it was copied by many other rebellions. Ho Chi Minh used parts of it verbatim in 1945 in a declaration of independence for Vietnam. We were so moved by this that the Eisenhower administration offered France two nuclear bombs to drop on Dien Bien Phu.\n\nSeparation of Church and State\n\nNot only did most places have kings in 1776, it was usually accepted that these kings had been appointed by god. This meant that you couldn't question the king's decisions even when large holes had been eaten in his brain by syphilis.\n\nSo establishing a wall between religion and government in the Bill of Rights was deeply radical and positive. The corporate right has long understood how this levels society, which is why they've quietly supported efforts to tear it down and retcon U.S. history to make the founding fathers fervent Christians.\n\nAnyone From Anywhere\n\nIn most places at most times, nationality has depended on blood and soil. For instance, Korean-Japanese whose families have been there for 100 years are still referred to as zainichi - which literally means \"staying in Japan,\" presumably temporarily. But in theory and to a large degree in fact, anyone can come to the U.S. from anywhere, and when they take the oath of citizenship they become as American as everyone else.\n\nThe Nazis used to call the U.S. a mongrel nation. They were absolutely right; it's fantastic and the source of our hybrid vigor.\n\nWe're So Rich\n\nThe U.S. right likes to tout our enormous wealth as a sign of our success. In reality, it signifies a humiliating failure of our economic system, even leaving aside our stunning levels of inequality.\n\nWe have advantages possessed by no other country in history. We're gigantic, in the temperate zone, overflowing with natural resources, and with neighbors so weak we generally forget that they're there. Yet Europe and Japan are about as rich as we are, despite having few of these assets and regularly destroying themselves in catastrophic wars. We should have twice as much money as they do.\n\nNevertheless, by any reasonable standard the U.S. is an incredibly wealthy place, as wealthy as any country needs to be to maximize human happiness. If we get our act together to fight, we could use our riches to do amazing things.\n\nFor instance, much of our gains in economic productivity over the past 40 years have gone into the pockets of millionaires and billionaires. The median household income in the U.S. now is about $56,500. If flight attendants and firemen had gotten their share of economic growth, they would be making over $70,000. Alternatively - and even more enticingly - if we'd had the power to take our increased productivity in time off regular people could be making their current salaries while only working about 30 hours per week.\n\nWho knows what we'd do with that kind of extra time for ourselves, but it's thrilling to contemplate. If current trends continued there would certainly be a lot of podcasts; once we're only working 15 hours a week and the ratio of podcasts to podcast listeners passes 1:1, we'll have to invent robots to rate and review them on iTunes.\n\nAfrican American and Secular Jewish Culture\n\nI'm not black and, despite the enthusiastic (((feedback))) I receive from the alt-right, I'm also not Jewish. I'm a baptized Episcopalian, a Mischling second degree , and a practicing nothing. But to me, looking at black culture and Jewish culture in America from the periphery, they seem to be humanity's two premiere achievements.\n\nI used to think that William Faulkner's claim that \"man will not merely endure: he will prevail\" was hokey and overoptimistic. But the history of African Americans is evidence he knew what he was talking about.\n\nTwo hundred fifty years of kidnapping, murder, rape and chattel slavery; \"freedom\" followed by 100 years of treatment that was slavery-adjacent; a 10-year window when change seemed possible; and then 40 years of mass incarceration that is intermittent reenslavement. It's incredible African Americans haven't collapsed in exhaustion, or simply perished.\n\nInstead, faced with a 1,000-foot high wall of hate, they've dug tunnels under it, floated over it waving from hot air balloons, and built transporters to dematerialize and then rematerialize on the other side, all to the bafflement and fury of much of white America. We understand violence and in fact rejoice when faced with it, because we know how to respond in kind a hundred times over. What we can't understand is black America's unending eruption of invention - in politics, music, literature, sports, Twitter, general stylishness, and a thousand other areas - that reverberates around the world. It's set a standard of wisdom and humanity for everyone else on earth to aim for.\n\nThe accomplishments of secular Jewish culture in America have been similar, although modulated differently.\n\nAll religions have the same essential precepts, and most religions ignore them in practice. Judaism stands out for sometimes taking them seriously. Both the Torah and Old Testament instruct us that \"Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\" Only Judaism builds a holiday around this admonition, and sends participants out into the world believing that maybe those words mean what they say.\n\nLikewise, I can't help but love an ethical tradition that requires kids to ask questions . As Rabbi Jonathan Sacks has put it, \"To be a Jewish child is to learn how to question.\" I.I. Rabi, an American Nobel Prize-winning physicist, said he became a scientist because when he came home from school each day his mother would ask him not what he'd learned, but whether he'd asked a good question. Polls have shown that American Jews value \"thinking for oneself\" as the most critical quality to encourage in children.\n\nThe collision of this perspective with the openness of American culture has exploded in every direction. It's impossible to imagine how different, and how much worse, the U.S. would be without the influence of secular Judaism.\n\nThen there's what is, for me, the dazzling summit of African American and Jewish culture: the collaborative creation of American comedy.\n\nComedy of the powerful tends to take this structure: \"Wouldn't it be funny if...\" You can see this clearly in Monty Python, whose main five performers went to Oxford and Cambridge. Wouldn't it be funny if a pet store owner refused to acknowledge a parrot he'd just sold to a customer had died ? Wouldn't it be funny if the head of a mountaineering expedition had double vision ?\n\nBut the comedy of the powerless usually says something else: \"Isn't it funny that...\" The powerless don't need to invent surrealistically absurd situations, they live them. So a Chris Rock joke is: Isn't it funny that that train's never late ?\n\nAnd the comedy of reality will always be superior to the comedy of imagination, no matter how well executed. That's why American comedy, created by African Americans and Jews (with an assist from Irish Catholics) is the current reigning world champion.\n\nOf course, I understand that the individual humans involved in all this did not do so as a hobby or to make America better, but to survive in the face of monstrous cruelty. Billie Holiday would have traded \"Strange Fruit\" for an end to lynchings. Our goal should be to make this country so good that we end up with a bland, Swiss-like pudding of a culture.\n\nBaseball\n\nI can't honestly claim I like baseball that much. But all lists like this by liberals seem to include it, so I feel peer pressure to do so too. You're also supposed to be super into jazz.\n\nSo that's why I love America. I encourage you to think about it yourself today in between the cookout, beach, and fireworks. Writing it down made me feel much better about being alive right here right now, and it could do the same for you.\n\nTop photo: A Liberty Bell float looms high over spectators in the 2015 Fourth of July Parade in Pittsfield, Mass. on Saturday, July 4, 2015.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Moral and Strategic Calculus of Voting for Joe Biden to Defeat Trump - or Not\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIs voting for Biden, a terrible candidate, the only principled position to fight Trump?\n\nDonald Trump ran for president in 2016 on an often ad-libbed and reactionary campaign of hate, greed, xenophobia, misogyny, and racism. He clearly viewed the fact that a black man had ascended to the presidency as an abomination and rightly assessed that there were a lot of racists in this country who saw the eight years the Obamas spent living in the White House as a crime against the real, white America. Trump already had a brand, realized early on the power of being an outsider in U.S. presidential elections, and focused on some key economic issues, including trade, that would play well with people dissatisfied with the two party system's regular offerings. And he focused on hate.\n\nTo directly call Trump fascistic is not incorrect, but it also may give him too much credit. He has largely been an incompetent authoritarian, albeit one whose key policies have caused massive suffering and death. What we have seen throughout his career and his three and a half years in power is that Trump is primarily concerned with making money for himself, his family, and his cronies . Literally everything this man does is a racket.\n\nHis foreign policy has been hawkish and reckless, but aside from his often insane rhetoric and public threats to annihilate various countries, it has not represented a radical departure from that of his predecessors. He acts like an unstable buffoon on the international stage, and he burns bridges with traditional U.S. allies, governments, and international bodies across the globe. Trump openly embraces vile authoritarians and mocks democratic leaders and institutions. All of this is certainly dangerous and unsettling, though some of it is disproportionately offensive to establishment foreign policy elites. Trump's predecessor started his own share of wars, did some regime change, ratcheted up an existing war, downsized another, and greatly expanded the use of weaponized drones and so-called targeted killings. But Barack Obama delivered these policies with an intelligently crafted, though at times absurd, justification wrapped in the notion of inventing a \"smarter\" way to wage war. Liberals ate it up. Obama's policies killed a lot of innocent people.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe few times Trump has signaled his openness to pursue a less militaristic approach to long-existing crises, such as the war in Afghanistan or the conflict with North Korea, he has been ridiculed by leading Democrats and liberal pundits. In terms of Trump's military pursuits, he has proven less murderous than George W. Bush and more of a war criminal than Jimmy Carter. So far. That can certainly change with a second term.\n\nPerhaps the gravest threat posed by the unstable narcissist in the White House is that of the use of a first strike nuclear weapon. It has never been beyond the pale to imagine an apocalyptic nuclear scenario that begins with a tweet from a foreign leader Trump hates. The fact that we can even imagine this is nothing to wag a stick at.\n\nTrump's monumentally incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic hammers home some of the greatest dangers posed by his presidency. It has highlighted the extent to which he is motivated not by any sense of duty or concern for his fellow citizens, but by money and his popularity among a fairly small circle of corporations, television hosts, and special interests. That Trump uses the daily platform of what are supposed to be public health briefings by professionals to pontificate ignorantly , babble incoherently , or to score points politically underscores how little he actually cares about the U.S. public and our lives. Instead, he is obsessed with the stock market as an imagined extension of his own ego. It is the sign of a deeply sick individual that he would effectively make aid conditional on how nice governors are to him . Trump encourages group protests against Democratic governors during a pandemic with scores of people refusing to wear protective gear, while his administration has insisted on testing visitors for coronavirus before meeting with the president or vice president. All of this costs lives, as sure as any military operation.\n\nDemonstrators gather in front of the Colorado State Capitol building to protest coronavirus stay-at-home orders during a \"ReOpen Colorado\" rally in Denver, Colorado, on April 19, 2020.\n\nPerhaps the most devastating dimension of Trump's time in office, on a policy level, is how the Republican establishment brilliantly exploited Trump as a Trojan horse for its extreme agenda. It is unlikely that any of the GOP's preferred candidates could have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump dragged the Republican Party kicking and screaming back into executive power. For them, he was a messiah they chided and scorned when he first appeared, but now they prostrate themselves before him every minute of every day.\n\nThe public still does not know the full story of how Mike Pence ended up on the ticket as Trump's running mate, but when it was announced, it was clear that the professional Republicans and the extremist evangelical lobby had their inside man . With Mitch McConnell running the Senate and Pence babysitting the president, Trump could focus on barking for the crowds in between golf outings and Twitter rants while the political hitmen in Washington dust off every extreme right-wing initiative they've cooked up for decades and which they work day and night to methodically ram through. Trump has had his signature moments, but much of his policy has been outsourced to craftier and more sophisticated policymakers.\n\nTrump is famously not a fan of reading detailed briefings, but give him a few nuggets of oversimplified policy talking points to pepper throughout his rants, and he's going to be your gaudy QVC host pitching the crappy product to his base. The bonus is that none of it actually has to be true, it just needs to be acceptable to the right people and truthfully exposed or documented by journalists whom he can then dismiss as the fake news media.\n\nMore broadly, the real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this: The consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party. This includes the scores of federal judges named to the bench, the shaping of the Supreme Court, the radical drive toward deregulation, and the canceling of even the most minimal commitments the U.S. has made to try to confront climate change. What the Republicans have managed to accomplish on a policy level in Trump's time in office is profound and terrifying.\n\nOut in full view, Trump has presided over the separation of families and the locking up of immigrant children in cages, empowering ICE agents to act as storm troopers. He has intervened to protect war criminals from accountability, threatened to kill the families of suspected terrorists, sought to ban - and in some ways has succeeded in banning - Muslims from entering the country. His threat to fill Guantanamo prison back up still looms, especially in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Is it so hard to imagine it becoming a disease-ridden black hole for migrants seeking refuge?\n\nTrump's economic policies have enriched corporations and special interest groups beyond their imaginations, while sawing off the already inadequate social programs in this country. We still have no idea of the extent to which Trump and his family are financially benefiting from his presidency. He talks about women in disgusting ways, including attempting to publicly humiliate the women he is accused of raping and assaulting. And the sick reality is that a significant number of people in the U.S. clearly like these things even if they won't openly admit it, though a disturbing number of them do feel emboldened to admire it. Trump has offered up an IPO on ignorance and hatred as a source of pride, and a lot of people enthusiastically bought in.\n\nDonald Trump's presidency is not an aberration of U.S. history in substance. His rise to power and the policies he has implemented are, in many ways, the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state, politically and functionally. Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud, but his agenda is firmly rooted in the bloody history of this republic. And his rise was made possible by the failed two-party system and the corporate dominance of electoral politics in the U.S. Also, let's not pretend that congressional Democrats have not enabled Trump by regularly voting for his obscene military budgets and sweeping surveillance powers while simultaneously calling him the most dangerous president in history.\n\nWhat would happen if Trump wins the election in November? In practical terms, it would be a nightmare. Trump would emerge emboldened beyond imagination. What minuscule restraints that currently exist would be wiped out entirely. He would almost certainly be in a position to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with yet another atrocious extremist. An ability to further stack the court will have a multigenerational impact on a legion of issues; among them are voting rights, civil liberties, corporate power, workers' rights, civil rights, women's reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, executive power, and the climate. No one should minimize the dangers of Trump remaining in office. And his reign will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, much like the coronavirus , and the terrors will ricochet for many years to come. Trump encourages and emboldens racists and bigots and embraces far-right ideology and action. Four more years of this will be deadly.\n\nIt is in contemplating all of the above that the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic Party's presumptive choice to take on Trump is a deeply disturbing and risky response to the threats we face. It is easy to underestimate Biden's chance of winning in November. Biden is a terrible candidate in many ways, but it is possible that \"I'm not Trump\" combined with Biden having been Obama's vice president will appeal to enough of the population to win not only the popular vote (a virtual certainty) but the Electoral College - especially if the party keeps him under wraps until the final stretch, as appears to be the strategy. Still, that seems to be a dangerous gamble given what is at stake.\n\nThere is also another factor that must not be ignored: Republicans are masters of voter suppression and disenfranchisement. That, combined with Trump's core belief that corruption isn't corrupt if he does it places an ominous cloud over the election's integrity before it even occurs. And we know that the pandemic will cast a long enough shadow over normal life that there will be plenty of opportunities for irregularities.\n\nBiden has an abominable public policy record on a wide range of issues. He has a penchant for lying - about his role in the civil rights movement and about being arrested in apartheid South Africa. He continues to lie and mislead about his support for the war in Iraq, the most consequential foreign policy decision of the post-Vietnam era. He has been accused by eight women of misconduct, including one allegation of very serious sexual assault by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Biden's cognitive health and mental acuity is, to say the least, questionable, particularly when you compare his current performance with videos from just a few years ago. He frequently rambles without a clear point, forgets what office he is running for , and has to rely on teleprompters and notes to make it through interviews and speeches without saying something embarrassing. In numerous interactions with voters, Biden has poked their chests in an aggressive manner; told an immigrant rights activist to \"vote for Trump\"; called voters childish names; and threatened a union worker in Detroit, telling the man to stop objecting to Biden pointing his finger in his face unless the worker \"want[s] to go outside with me.\" Let's not even discuss the tale of his showdown with a rusty razor-wielding \"Corn Pop\" at the pool. Trump's temperament is frightening, but Biden isn't exactly a cool head who exudes competence or confidence.\n\nLiberals may poo poo the whole Hunter Biden-Burisma-Ukraine-China attacks from Trump, but this is going to be a problem in the general election. On many of the key issues where Democrats could attack Trump, Biden is going to be virtually incapacitated by his own skeletons. What Sen. Elizabeth Warren did to Mike Bloomberg at a February debate would be impossible for Biden to do to Trump. \"You have more allegations of sexual assault than I do, Donald,\" is not a good line. \"Your sons have profited off the presidency more than my son did off my vice presidency\" - also not a winning zinger. And don't think for a moment that Trump won't hammer away on Biden's Iraq War vote and his trade policies. The Democratic primary is not the general election.\n\nThere is no point to going through and listing all of the terrible aspects of Biden's career, his policy record, his mental stamina, or his substantial failures to make himself visible or consistently cogent since securing the presumptive nomination. All of this is going to be put on display for the next six months. The Democratic Party and the voters in the roughly 50 percent of primaries that were held have committed our fate to Biden's candidacy. Obama and other senior party leaders, major news organizations, and a lot of money deployed to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders also played a role in manufacturing this reality. Sanders ending his campaign and vowing to support Biden leaves people with two viable candidates on the ballot. Barring a health crisis or death of one of these older men, the only two candidates with enough public support to win the presidency will be Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\nWhat we get with Trump is as clear as it is terrifying. What we get with Biden, in his current form, is less apparent. Biden will have a team of competent (for better and worse) technocrats and, in all likelihood, an incredibly influential vice president and an unelected chief of staff running the show. Biden's administration will also include appointments aimed at throwing some bones to progressives and likely other Cabinet appointments that recognize the growing influence of progressive ideas. It will, without a doubt, also be riddled with a disproportionate number of hawkish, corporatist Democratic apparatchiks. It will be an administration that does the bidding of Wall Street, believes in bloated war budgets, and will put a friendlier face on the worst excesses of empire. It's always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates - so we can't even bank on a return to Obama's brand of neoliberalism. But there will be policy areas where some victories may be possible for a well-organized and militant left willing to take Biden on. Such a dynamic wouldn't be the worst thing in the world and would be better for more people than a second Trump term in virtually every tangible way.\n\nBiden isn't great on many issues that motivate young voters. His health care plan keeps the profit-driven system intact, and it will result in millions of Americans remaining uninsured. His policy to confront massive student and consumer debt is anemic. Biden's climate plan is uninspiring and generally milquetoast when weighed against the severity of the crisis the planet faces, though this is an area in which he might be susceptible to pressure from activists. Some of his foreign policy positions are downright disturbing, if not explicitly right-wing. The latest Biden campaign ad is a fearmongering attack on China and an effort to outbid Trump's xenophobic rhetoric. Biden's long record indicates that he could prove more inclined to authorize military interventions than Trump, who has been quite belligerent himself, without following through on most of his threats. Biden is almost certainly going to start and continue wars, impose deadly economic sanctions, and support or enact regime change efforts.\n\nThere is an abundance of justification to oppose a Biden presidency. And principled people are right to ring loud alarms over Biden's record, policies, and some of his personal conduct. At the same time, it is not honest to imply there would be no difference between a Biden and Trump administration.\n\nThe Obama-Biden administration's immigration policy has now been dwarfed in awfulness by Trump, but in its own right it operated as a cruel, mass deportation machine that also separated families. During the campaign, Biden has responded to extraordinary activist pressure and eventually began to carefully distance himself from the record of the \"deporter in chief,\" as Obama was labeled by immigrant rights activists. When pressed on the mass deportations under Obama, Biden acknowledged that deporting people without criminal records was a \"big mistake.\" At a Democratic debate, Biden was asked whether he would resume Obama's torrid pace of deportations. \"Absolutely not,\" he said, adding that he was vice president, not president, drawing a rebuke from Julián Castro, who observed accurately that Biden was content to bathe in the glow of his former Obama boss while looking to sidestep responsibility for his more unpopular policies. At the same time, Biden's campaign has made a sweeping series of pledges that he could implement as president that would potentially protect millions of vulnerable people. On immigration, the alternative to that is four more years of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, an extremist nut who shouldn't be allowed within 100 feet of a consequential decision-making process.\n\nBiden has pledged to immediately lift the Muslim travel ban, as well as other racist immigration and asylum policies Trump has put in place. It is also worth noting that toward the end of the Obama administration, under pressure from Black Lives Matter activists, Obama placed a dozen city police forces under Department of Justice consent decrees in response to police killings and other abuses. Trump cannot be pressured by BLM, but Biden can.\n\nBiden has a troubling record on Iran, including his support for deadly sanctions, but he has emphatically said he would reenter the Iran nuclear agreement, which is also no small matter. Similarly, Biden has been politically forced to denounce the genocidal Saudi war against Yemen, despite the fact that it was initiated under the Obama-Biden administration. He has also had to publicly accept that viewing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as an unsavory murderer is now widely held by many Democrats, including centrist figures. Remarkably, Biden has vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into \" a pariah .\" That's an incredible statement given the long bipartisan love affair with the kingdom's despots and raises all sorts of questions about what that would mean if Biden is elected.\n\nFormer US Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden arrives to speak about COVID-19, known as the Coronavirus, during a press event in Wilmington, Delaware on March 12, 2020.\n\nAmong the wild cards of a Biden administration will be the issue of whether he has the actual mental stamina to govern, or if he is going to be frequently disoriented and infrequently seen or heard. Setting aside the protestations of people who pretend they don't see exactly what everyone else does when Biden speaks in public, we are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate, because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self. We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show, a cast of familiar characters and a few exciting new additions who would take charge of the executive branch, without the popular star of the original show among the visible cast. The fact that the Democrats have forced through a candidate that many people don't believe is fully functional and will rely on the strength of \"the team\" assembled around him is a pretty grim statement about the state of democracy in the U.S. If Biden is the best the Democrats have to offer in the face of Trump, the system is rotten.\n\nSo what should people who want Trump gone but cannot stand Biden do? First of all, no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote. (Full disclosure: I always vote.) Our system is dominated by corporate influence, big money, and the skewed rules of a default duopoly, and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds, joining debates, or gaining ballot access. There is no mandatory voting in the U.S., roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party, and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting. In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace. There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change. Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats. Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose, and the candidates they support have a right to run for office.\n\nIt is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say, \"I believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, and I will not vote for a rapist.\" It is an understandable and morally principled position to say, \"I will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq.\" None of these people's votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs - and they are not votes for Trump.\n\nUltimately, however, given the abomination of our two-party system, progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes. Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position. This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do, just as they did in 2016. It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record. Voters in swing states, where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump, face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California. In 2004, the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states, including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush.\n\nIf you believe that progressives or leftists should be \"bending the knee\" for Biden by promising right this second that they will vote for him in six months and that they will never utter an inconvenient fact about him or express their anger with their meager Election Day options, please show them all of your work fighting for Medicare for All, for ending the carceral state, for serious radical action on climate change, your work opposing the most dangerous aspects of the Obama-Biden administration, including on issues of war, immigration, and, yes, health care.\n\nMany of the social and political movements that backed Sanders were populated by people in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It was an incredibly diverse coalition of supporters and drew millions of primary voters in 2016 and 2020. Its backbone was young voters, including young African Americans, Latinos, students, immigrants, and independents. These groups and many of Sanders's supporters have spent nearly four years fighting Trump nonstop. Many of them organized against Obama's troubling policies before that. That should be commended not scorned. You want to label these people Trump supporters because they are intensely disturbed by the corporatist candidate you have chosen to take on Trump? Show them your work on the issues they care about, explain what Biden's policies are on those issues and make the most convincing case you can for why they should vote for him. Better yet, explain to them how you are fighting to make Biden's platform one that even minimally pretends to want their votes.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Sanders organized the most significant challenge to the Democratic Party's centrist and center-right establishment since Jesse Jackson ran twice for president in the 1980s . Unlike Ralph Nader's independent runs for president, Sanders attempted to deliver sweeping change within the Democratic Party's own framework. He fought against an extremely hostile corporate media environment and some pretty vile smear campaigns, where he was compared to the coronavirus, his supporters were called brown shirts, and his primary victories described as akin to the Nazi invasion of France on liberal TV networks. Despite the powerful chorus of red-baiting and lies, Sanders still came extremely close to pulling off a victory.\n\nBiden was usually the frontrunner and always the favorite, even though he came close to being defeated by Sanders early on. The establishment fiercely defended its territory in an effort capped off by the last-minute secret diplomacy from Obama ahead of Super Tuesday to pressure other candidates and the party to coalesce around Biden. Ultimately, the party's primary voters, at the crucial moment, threw their weight behind a name they know and who served as vice president of an administration they trusted. These voters should not be collectively shamed either. Most of them are not party cogs, but people genuinely scared of what four more years of Trump will mean for their survival, particularly older African American voters.\n\nThe traditional, moderate, and right-wing forces within the Democratic Party united and won the primary battle. Sanders may have surrendered too early, but there is little value to debating that right now or wasting energy attacking Sanders.\n\nThe war for the future of the Democratic Party is intensifying. There is a possibility of a fracture or at least more clearly defined factions within the party. There will be serious discussions around forming a new party that isn't the Green Party, but rather an outgrowth of the \"Not Me, Us\" framework of the Sanders campaign and the growing popularity of groups like the Justice Democrats, the Sunrise Movement, prison abolitionists, immigrant rights groups, and Democratic Socialists of America. It would be a great thing for this country to have a democratic socialist party grow, one that runs serious political campaigns. We have already seen early stage efforts at this with mixed results. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez understands the need to engage in strategic partnerships with establishment Democrats to achieve meaningful policy change and strengthen the areas of common ground. But there will need to be a lot more like-minded politicians elected for the strategy to succeed. This primary has shaken the Democratic establishment to its core, and that is a good thing and should be built on.\n\nBut none of that is going to happen before November.\n\nSome Sanders supporters who are deeply concerned by the candidacy of Biden have said he can have their vote but not their soul. For many people that will be their strategic rationale. For others, it will be a question of individual or collective morality in the face of Trump's horrors. Leftist voters in swing states shoulder a greater moral burden than the rest of us, and many will decide to vote against Trump by pulling the lever for Biden.\n\nThere are also very vocal opponents of Biden who are fed up and are flat out going to refuse to vote for him. They recognize that the opposite of Trump is not Biden. They want a society where free health care is a right and wars are ended, where everyone has housing and work that pays livable wages, where you don't amass a mountain of debt to get an education , and one that treats immigrants and workers with dignity and defends a woman's absolute right to choose. They want the racist justice system dismantled and ICE to be abolished. They believe we are in a climate emergency and that Biden is a part of the problem. Mainstream Democrats tell them they want much of that too and electing Biden is a strategic step in that direction or that President Biden will be more susceptible to progressive pressure. They reject that. They don't believe that forcing a choice between two bad candidates is right, even if one is admittedly worse. Electing Biden might solve some problems, but it also could result in a strengthening of the far right in the U.S. and could produce a worse threat than Trump in 2024. A Biden administration, they believe, will undoubtedly be a massive corporate-friendly juggernaut that wages military and economic wars and, for them, voting in the affirmative for that is a bridge too far. And many of these people hold the Democratic Party responsible for Trump because of the terrible campaign it ran in 2016, so trying to convince them to buy into the same strategy twice is a losing battle. They are tired of being Democrats' cheap dates - treated with contempt, offered few and paltry concessions, and expected to go along. As a strategic matter, at this juncture, they regard supporting Biden as tantamount to telling Democrats to continue to take them for granted.\n\nIf Democrats want to try to win them over, they should use the next six months to show them you take their concerns about 2016 seriously and map out the ways this campaign is different. Most people on the left who oppose Biden but also view Trump as the gravest danger are going to vote against Trump by voting for Biden. But those who disagree with that strategy do not support Trump. For them, \"He's not Trump\" is not a gamble worth taking. The onus is on the Biden campaign and its supporters to make their case to every eligible voter in this country and earn their votes. No one should be taken for granted.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Facebook's Tough-on-Terror Talk Overlooks White Extremists\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe social network has detailed its fight against jihadist groups but has nothing to say about domestic radical groups.\n\nPublicly traded companies don't typically need to issue statements saying that they do not support terrorism. But Facebook is no ordinary company ; its sheer scale means it is credited as a force capable of swaying elections, commerce, and, yes, violent radicalization. In June, the social network published an article outlining its counterterrorism policy, stating unequivocally that \"There's no place on Facebook for terrorism.\" Bad news for foreign plotters and jihadis, maybe, but what about Americans who want violence in America?\n\nIn its post, Facebook said it will use a combination of artificial intelligence-enabled scanning and \"human expertise\" to \"keep terrorist content off Facebook, something we have not talked about publicly before.\" The detailed article takes what seems to be a zero-tolerance stance on terrorism-related content:\n\nWe remove terrorists and posts that support terrorism whenever we become aware of them. When we receive reports of potential terrorism posts, we review those reports urgently and with scrutiny. And in the rare cases when we uncover evidence of imminent harm, we promptly inform authorities. Although academic research finds that the radicalization of members of groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda primarily occurs offline, we know that the internet does play a role - and we don't want Facebook to be used for any terrorist activity whatsoever.\n\nKeeping the (to put it mildly) highly motivated membership of ISIS and Al Qaeda off any site is no small feat; replacing a banned account or deleted post with a new one is a cinch. But if Facebook is serious about refusing violent radicals a seat at the table, it's only doing half its job, as the site remains a cozy home for domestic - let's be frank: white - extremists in the United States, whose views and hopes are often no less heinous and gory than those of the Islamic State.\n\nIn Facebook's post, ISIS and Al Qaeda are mentioned by name 11 times, while the word \"domestic\" doesn't appear once, nor are U.S.-based terror networks referenced in any other way. That gap in the company's counterextremism policy is curious.\n\nIn January 2016, a band of armed militants led by Ammon and Ryan Bundy entered and occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon. Members of the group, with ties to armed, extremist \"patriot\" groups like the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, said they wanted to shift federal land to local control, and at one point Ryan Bundy told a reporter the group was willing to kill or die if necessary. It would take little work to draw a clear through line from the movement that spawned Timothy McVeigh to the loose confederation around the Bundy family. One of the radicals posted a \"goodbye\" video to YouTube, taking as a given that he would be slain by the government during the occupation. Between their assault rifles and their implicitly violent rhetoric, opinion pieces at Newsweek , the Washington Post , and CNN all argued that the occupiers were domestic terrorists.\n\nAmmon and Ryan Bundy had earned extremist cachet prior to the Oregon takeover, when, in 2014, they joined with supporters (many of them armed) and their father, Cliven Bundy, to chase off agents of the Bureau of Land Management who were trying to confiscate Cliven Bundy's cattle in connection with delinquent grazing fees. Sen. Harry Reid at the time denounced the ideologues as \"nothing more than domestic terrorists\" who do \"not recognize the United States.\"\n\nAnd indeed, many in the \"Patriot Movement\" also consider themselves \"sovereign citizens,\" a logically bankrupt ( and sometimes violent ) strain of anti-government anger in which you simply declare yourself exempt from American laws and, in particular, the payment of taxes. At MSNBC, a former ATF agent described his work with homegrown extremists like those at Malheur:\n\nWe worked them under the classification of domestic terrorism. There is the umbrella federal crime of terrorism, and domestic terrorism is a classification we used against any homegrown group which intends to coerce or intimidate through threats or acts of violence.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ammon Bundy and five of his followers were, surprisingly, acquitted of federal charges stemming from their occupation of the reserve, while federal charges in connection with the Nevada case remain tied up in court following a mistrial. Still, had the group's members been born in Pakistan or Syria, Harney County would probably resemble the surface of the moon right now. American radicals like the Bundy clan are cuter about their fantasies of destroying the federal government than, say, ISIS, who of course won't hesitate to explicitly call for violent attacks using every medium at their disposal. Domestic extremists are sometimes more careful about their words and rely on insinuations and dog whistles rather than overt threats, and American gun culture makes it easy to camouflage violent speech within political speech. But what is an online call for armed reinforcements and a willingness to shed blood (or die) if confronted by police if not a threat?\n\nThroughout the entire ordeal, the occupiers (and their sympathizers nationwide) made extensive use of the social web (including Facebook) to coordinate and spread their message (the Bundy Ranch Facebook group has nearly 200,000 followers today). Federal prosecutors and investigators with the FBI's Domestic Terrorism Operations Unit zeroed in on the occupiers' use of Facebook, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported at the time . Since the occupation, finding anti-government extremism on Facebook remains easy. This seems at odds with Facebook's zero-tolerance policy.\n\nAsked whether the company is as committed to combating white extremists as jihadists, a Facebook spokersperson reiterated that the company's policy was to refuse a presence to any person or group who supports a violent agenda. When asked about specific entities like the Bundy family, the spokesperson replied, \"I can't speak to the specific groups you cited, but, again, if a group has engaged in acts of violence, we don't want to give them a voice on Facebook.\" So what's violence, then? \"Does Facebook,\" I asked, \"consider the armed takeover of a federal building to be an act of violence?\" The company's reply: \"I don't have an answer on that.\" Brian Fishman, a co-author of the Facebook company post on terrorism, did not answer a request for comment.\n\nDaryl Johnson is a former Homeland Security analyst who spent years studying domestic threats to the United States . Johnson told The Intercept that although \"not all extremists are violent,\" treating domestic threats as something distinct from the likes of ISIS for policy purposes \"on the surface makes sense, but if you start comparing and contrasting, it doesn't.\" Domestic extremists \"are using social media sites as platforms to put forth their extreme ideas and a violent agenda, enabling people to recruit and spread\" their ideology - an ideology that Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center said is as dangerous as any threat from the Middle East. \"It's as though terrorism can't be white,\" Beirich told The Intercept after reviewing the Facebook post. \"They're willing to go hardcore against ISIS and Al Qaeda, but where's the response to white supremacism and its role in domestic terrorism or anti-government crazies?\" To Beirich, \"What this article is saying is how we counter Islamic terrorism,\" not terrorism per se:\n\nMy position is this is outrageous. Terrorism from the Dylan Roofs of the world is as much of a problem here in the United States as it is from the Tsarnaev brothers. The bodies stacked on both sides is about the same since 9/11. I don't understand why they can't see that. It's worrying to me because it plays into the narrative as though all terrorism is coming from radical Islam, which is a false narrative. This adds to that, and it takes our eye off the ball in terms of where terrorism comes from ... A large chunk of our domestic terrorism is committed by folks with beliefs like those at the Bundy Ranch or Malheur occupation.\n\nWithout further comment from Facebook, one can only speculate about why ISIS gets top billing and Bundy supporters do not - but little speculation is needed. A beheading video or pipe bomb instruction image are no-brainers for content moderators, while posts about armed anti-government sedition are perhaps murkier (especially if Facebook is going to let algorithms do the heavy lifting). Labeling right-wing extremism as terrorism would also likely cause a public relations migraine Facebook doesn't care for, particularly after reports of how it filters out bogus right-wing news sources have already tarnished its image on the right.\n\nAll of this is to say that the work ahead of Facebook, if it really does want to be serious about combating terrorism, is extremely difficult, and given the company's track record, may well be fumbled. Preventing Facebook from being a place where anti-government radicals can comfortably spread an ideology of implicit violence feels reasonable, while blocking discussions about these figures and ideologies - in everything from academic or journalistic contexts to your dad's News Feed - would not. When does sympathy for an armed radical group become support? When (if ever) does Facebook-cheering a violent group become complicity in the violence? This is deeply complex and horribly fraught, whether you're looking at Mosul or Montana. Facebook knows this, which is why its article on moderating extremist content is titled \"Hard Questions.\" Facebook also knows that an overly broad crackdown on foreign terrorism would provoke the tiniest fraction of backlash compared to clamping down on right-wing white America, where love of assault rifle ownership and hatred for government are shared in polite society. But hard questions deserve better than cop outs, which is exactly what ignoring white, domestic terrorism amounts to: a cop out. If the company wants to live up to its commitments here, it will require even harder work, harder thinking, harder scrutiny, and harder debates. Yes, it might require sometimes banning extremists in cowboy hats.\n\nTop photo: Members of the Georgia Security Forces are seen during a military drill in Flovilla, Georgia, on Nov. 12, 2016.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump's Nationalism Advances on a Predictable Trajectory to Violence. His Supporters Will Kill When They're Told To.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThose who survived the bloody undoing of Yugoslavia saw the havoc nationalism can wreak. It is hard not to worry about its symptoms now.\n\nEver since Donald Trump declared his presidential candidacy and rank racism in 2015, those of us who'd witnessed the nationalist undoing in the Balkans at the end of the last millennium have found the subsequent rise of Trumpism frighteningly familiar. We quickly recognized a host of nationalist pathologies: the tactical importance of bigotry, since enemies must be ceaselessly identified and hated; relentless misogyny as a means of controlling women and their bodies, because the nation is a masculinist project where women serve as wombs for national reproduction; a profusion of lies, conspiracy theories, and plain nonsense, since reality is controlled by the enemies (fake news, deep state, the Jews, etc.) and must be perpetually undone and redone; the coalescing of a diverse political field around a leader and a stupidly conceptual goal ( Greatness ! Capitalism ! Freedom !); loyalist cabals who are vetted, validated, and eliminated by the leader's whims; and rampant venality combined with a criminal reconfiguration of the economy.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

As we bear witness to armed white American militias storming or protesting outside government institutions, it is clear that the chaos and tragedy of Covid-19 are being used by Trump and the GOP to enhance the conflict and accelerate the birth of a new, greater America. At the heart of every nationalist mythology is some kind of a rebirth, usually bloody and requiring sacrifices, preferably of the weak and the doubtful. At the heart of every nationalist mythology is some kind of rebirth, usually bloody and requiring sacrifices.\n\nBecause those who experienced the bloody undoing of Yugoslavia have already seen the havoc nationalism wreaked in their own lives and countries, it is hard not to worry about its symptoms again - or, as a Bosnian saying goes: If you were bitten by a snake, you're scared of lizards. It would be wrong, of course, to ignore the differences between the histories, including the respective political conditions, in pre-dissolution Yugoslavia and in the United States in the last few years (or decades). Still, insisting there are no points of comparison means accepting the proposition at the root of every emanation of nationalism: that \"our\" nation is unlike any other, historically unique and incomparable. If one is not blinded by that kind of essentialist entitlement, the common practices of nationalism become recognizable across cultures and histories.\n\nTake the nationalist conviction that the nation is oppressed by state structures controlled by (the) others and is therefore unable to fulfill its unique potential, which is why state structures need to be smashed, along with those who control them. Such a conviction is repeatedly fueled by Trump and widely shared by his supporters, not least by those brandishing assault rifles around the state legislatures of Michigan , Virginia , and Ohio , soon to arrive in your neighborhood.\n\nSlobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader who in died in 2006 in the Hague while on trial for genocide and crimes against humanity committed in the 1990s in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo, similarly framed his nationalist narrative. He insisted that the Serbian people made sacrifices for Yugoslavia but were instead cheated out of their victorious gains by those who controlled the federal state. He wanted to reshape Yugoslavia so that his people could rightfully dominate it and thus make Serbia great again, or greater. Similarly, for the Croat nationalists, led by Franjo Tudjman, once a general in the Yugoslav People's Army, only an ethnically pure nation state could provide freedom and actualization. Milosevic and Tudjman were on opposing sides, but their projects were akin. Both strived to destroy the Yugoslav state by any means necessary. Pursuing a conflict that would irreversibly undo civic and governmental structures was essential to their nationalist projects. Armed men take part in an \"American Patriot Rally,\" organized by Michigan United for Liberty on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing, demanding the reopening of businesses, on April 30, 2020.

A crucial role in the rise of millennial Serbian nationalism was played by rallies where masses of aggrieved Serbs protested against myriad injustices. The rallies were presented as spontaneous happenings of the people ( dešavanje naroda , in Serbian), but were orchestrated by Milosevic's proxies and underlings. These extra-systemic performances of mass infuriation were bludgeons with which the nationalists attacked weak state structures, as well as the doubters in their own ranks. The rallies also constituted loyalist spaces from which warriors and collaborators could be recruited for the future wars. What was invariably promised at the rallies, implicitly or explicitly, were revenge and punishment for those who \"the people\" believed wronged them. Milosevic's nationalist project would carry out those promises, which eventually landed him at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Once he set out to follow the trajectory of destructive confrontation, there was no way or reason for him to stop until he reached its logical extreme: genocide.\n\nArmed men take part in an \"American Patriot Rally,\" organized by Michigan United for Liberty on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing, demanding the reopening of businesses, on April 30, 2020.\n\nThe conflictual essence of Trumpism was made fully evident very early, in the course of the Republican primaries in 2016. While all the other GOP candidates tried to validate their garden-variety bigotry by importing fancy reactionary ideas and referring gratuitously to the Bible, the Framers, or some historical figure or another, the only thing Trump consistently offered was his pathological narcissism (exactly matching the popular belief in American exceptionalism) and his penchant for conflict and aggression. He promised, implicitly and explicitly , revenge and punishment for those who wronged white America. As we now know all too well, white America's response to Trumpian revenge fantasies was quick and enthusiastic, and thus the GOP graduated from a routinely racist conservative party to one unquestionably committed to white nationalism, up to and including outright white supremacy. Trumpism is nothing without the constant perpetuation of conflict.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump, the chosen tool of undoing, has been carrying out his promises, with the full and passionate support of the GOP and many of its rich donors. The claims of false and foolish pundits notwithstanding, at no point was Trump going to relent, change, or metamorphose into being \"presidential,\" for the simple reason that Trumpism is nothing without the constant perpetuation of conflict.\n\nFor many of my fellow ex-Yugoslavs, it was instantly clear that once the GOP and Trump committed to conflict and destruction, they could never afford to quit, for that would constitute a tactical error leading to an irreversible defeat. They now have no choice but to follow their trajectory to its logical extreme, which must be victory and rebirth at all cost. They will kill if they have to, or at least let Covid-19 do it.\n\nWhen armed Trumpists pretend to be a happening of good people who demand the end of the lockdown, anti-fascist ex-Yugoslavs don't necessarily see an American version of murderous Serbian paramilitaries. What we see with heart-clenching clarity is that the familiar nationalist strategy of perpetually inciting conflict is advancing along a predictable trajectory.\n\nWhat is even more frightening is the hankering across the political range for a magical national correction, the indulging of a persistent fantasy that some essential American quality (decency, reasonability, checks and balances, etc.) will finally kick in and halt the Trumpist madness, thus allowing the country to snap out of its nightmare and revert to its good old national essence. That was never going to happen: The ongoing conflict is not a glitch but a process that cannot be stopped or resolved politically. With the GOP in death-cult mode, a steady destruction of checks and balances previously imagined to be fail-safe, the jelly-spined leadership of the Democratic Party, and the Soviet-grade purging of any disloyalty or disobedience in the federal systems, Trump has effectively destroyed American politics.\n\nWhat the actual resolution might look like, I fear to envision, but I know it will not resemble anything Americans can remember or dare to imagine.\n\nWAIT!

How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "America's Problem With Policing Doesn't Stop at the U.S. Border\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe national conversation on policing sparked by George Floyd's murder must extend to the U.S. military's overseas crimes and the victims of its drone war.\n\nPakistani villagers carry the shrouded casket of a person, reportedly killed by a U.S. drone attack in the tribal area of Mir Ali along the Afghanistan border, during his funeral in Bannu, Pakistan, on Dec. 29, 2010.\n\nGeorge Floyd wasn't the first victim of state violence in the United States; law enforcement officers have killed countless people who were never properly memorialized and for whom justice was never sought. Part of what made Floyd's murder especially cruel - setting off what may be the largest protest movement in U.S. history - is that it was a public execution that lasted for 8 minutes and 46 seconds and was broadcast online. Floyd gave a face, a story, and a video to the issue of state violence situated in white supremacy. As civil rights attorney David Lane has written , \"Police brutality hasn't increased. Videoing brutal cops has increased and white America is finally seeing it.\"\n\nNow that Floyd's murder has forced a national conversation about policing within our country's borders, it's time the American public begins to reckon with the victims of our foreign policy abroad. Since waging the war on Iraq, how many Americans can name a single one of the approximately 200,000 civilian casualties of that war? Even when exposed to the gross images of torture at Abu Ghraib at the hands of members of the U.S. military, the victims' faces remained blurred and their names unknown.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Or the 30 pine nut farm workers in Afghanistan caught off guard by a U.S. drone in 2019? When the U.S. military chooses to publicize its actions abroad, the videos we get of drone strikes usually include little more than a sudden green haze demonstrating the might of American weaponry. We don't hear the last cries of the unsuspecting victims. We don't see them hold each other tight, hoping they'll somehow be missed. We see our machinery, but never their humanity. They don't even become hashtags: just hidden casualties.\n\nFor years, researchers have logged the details of America's opaque drone war, a fulcrum of the war on terror that is a signature part of President Barack Obama's legacy, now continued by Trump. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates that up to 17,000 people have been killed by U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia, while Airwars has tracked reports of nearly 30,000 civilians being killed by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The Intercept in 2015 published a secret cache of U.S. government documents detailing the inner workings of the drone program, and a New York Times investigation in 2017 found that civilians were killed at a rate 31 times higher than that acknowledged by the anti-ISIS coalition.\n\nDespite these efforts , there has been an overall paucity in news coverage of the drone war, and specifically of the stories of those killed by drone operators pushing buttons from thousands of miles away: a combination of public apathy and efforts by the federal government to shield the drone program from public view. It was only three days after Obama's inauguration in 2009, as America projected its best image of progress and hope, that a CIA drone murdered nine civilians having dinner in Pakistan. Faheem Qureshi, a teenager who barely survived the attack, told The Guardian at the time, \"I had all the hopes and potential and now I am doing nothing.\" Faheem has never received an explanation for why his family was killed by an American drone, and the vast majority of the American public has likely never even heard his story.\n\nIt was not until 2013 that Congress heard testimony from a family impacted by the drone war. Nabila Rehman, a sweet 9-year-old girl, brought members of Congress to tears as she held up her hand-drawn images of what the drone strike that killed her grandmother in Pakistan looked like. Her father, Rafiq ur Rehman, shouted, \"Not a militant, but my mother,\" feeling the extra burden of having to impress upon this nation that his mother meant something and did absolutely nothing that warranted her cruel death. It was a moment, that if broadcast to every American living room, could potentially activate people of conscience to demand greater accountability for our military actions abroad as we fight the militarization of our police here at home.\n\nWe need to demand greater accountability for our military actions abroad as we fight the militarization of our police here at home.\n\nTrump, after inheriting the drone program from Obama, has made this war both more ambitious and more ambiguous by simultaneously expanding it further and hiding it better. The U.S. military launched 2,243 drone strikes in Trump's first two years in office, compared to Obama's 1,878 strikes over his entire presidency. Trump has also made this war even more secretive, issuing an executive order to no longer require the release of annual summaries of U.S. drone strikes and casualties, even as the Navy has expanded its mysterious drone technology. There has not been a single testimony in front of Congress by the families of drone victims since Trump has taken office.\n\nWe cannot make our government accountable for the victims of state violence if there is no transparency into its actions. We also cannot generate the moral outrage necessary to usher in change if we don't consider the humanity of our victims. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who lost much of his popularity for connecting America's conduct in Vietnam to its conduct at home, challenged us to think about the intoxicating power that yielded the government's false sense of invincibility as it used weapons of war at home and abroad on innocent civilians, as well as the dangerous apathy of much of the American public that didn't seem to grasp the magnitude of the war. In a world of no social media, he sought to convey the tragedy of the senseless murder of \"some one million Vietnamese children ... incinerated by napalm\" while some American soldiers \"in unrestrained hatred shoot the wounded enemy as they lie on the ground.\" He called it a war that had mutilated our conscience, and insisted that \"these casualties are enough to cause all men to rise up with righteous indignation.\"\n\nWhat the story of George Floyd did, no number of un-videotaped police killings could have done. We watched and heard him cry for his mother under the knee of officer Derek Chauvin. It drove the masses to the streets in righteous indignation, even amid a life-altering pandemic. It's time we also start hearing the cries of Nabila Rehman for her grandmother under the thrust of our bombs - and insist that those like her are not murdered in silence, and without accountability.\n\nCorrection: July 22, 2020 Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article stated that Airwars has tracked 3,000 civilian casualties of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The group has actually tracked nearly 30,000 civilian deaths. The article has also been updated to clarify details about the Rehman family's congressional testimony.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Here's How the Residents of Super-White America Voted in 2016\n\nI've long been a skeptic of the theory that Donald Trump won the presidency because of his appeal to white racial anxiety. He certainly tried to win on that basis, but exit polling is pretty clear that, nationwide, Trump won no more of the white vote than Mitt Romney did. It's true that he won the majority of the white vote, but that's because Republicans always win the majority of the white vote.\n\nBut that's just the 100,000-foot view. What happens when you dig deeper? Thomas Edsall, who consistently writes some of the most thought-provoking analysis around, takes a look at some of the data that's now starting to trickle out and presents us with this chart that compares the 2012 and 2016 elections:\n\nIn most places, even those that are heavily white, the red trendline is below zero, which means Trump won a smaller share of the vote than Romney did. The only places where he outperformed Romney were in the very whitest suburbs and small towns:\n\nThe very white municipalities that voted so strongly for Trump believe that they have reason to worry about the racial stability of their neighborhoods....It is in these locales, which are experiencing the earliest signs of minority growth, that anxiety over approaching diversity is strongest. Put another way, anger, fear and animosity toward immigrants and minorities was most politically potent in the communities most insulated from these supposed threats.\n\n....Will Stancil, a research fellow at the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity who created the chart, explained....\"To the extent Trump really resonated, it was in heavily-white areas - and that includes exurbs at the urban fringe, rural areas, and many heavily white second-ring suburbs, \" Stancil wrote in his email. \"It was his message resonating in those areas that gave him a fighting chance at all.\"\n\nThis fits a lot of the evidence we have. As it turns out, racial anxiety among whites really isn't widespread. But it is strong among whites in a very small number of ultra-white communities. That's why Trump didn't do unusually well in California, Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas, where the immigrant population is highest. People in those states have lived with Mexican immigrants for a long time and learned that the sky isn't falling. But farther away, in the very white communities of the upper Midwest, this is still brand new stuff. Unlike Californians, who know better from experience, they buy the idea that immigrants are unusually crime prone and take away everyone's jobs-and that makes them scared. They're a receptive audience for Trump's \"Build a Wall\" message.\n\nAll this said, we're still left with a question: if the only place Trump did better than Romney was in the very whitest communities, was that enough to push him to victory? After all, he did worse than Romney everywhere else. Well, Edsall has a chart for that too, showing how Trump performed in the upper Midwest, but you'll have to click the link to see it. (Spoiler alert: the answer is probably yes.)\n\nEdsall finishes up with this:\n\nIn some respects, the data gathered by Orfield's team is good news for Democrats. The core of Trump's support lies in counties and municipalities like Dravosburg and Elk County, many of which are losing population. They are, in effect, the last gasp of white hegemony.\n\nStill, immense damage has been done.... As the public discourse around issues of social welfare, immigration, national security, and a whole host of other issues becomes highly racialized and explicitly hostile, the potential for open racial conflict may rise. Furthermore, as these negative attitudes toward racial outgroups become increasingly tightly tied to parties, polarization increases and gridlock and a lack of legislative compromise ensue.\n\nWhen I look back at the 2016 election, what is really striking is how much influence over the course of events was exercised by the relatively small numbers of voters in super-white municipalities and counties and by the politician who ignited them - how the last gasp of a small fraction of the electorate set the nation on such a dangerous and destructive course.\n\nAmen. And the faster the politicians who have set fire to this movement-or even merely tolerated it-are sent packing, the better off our country will be.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The End Of White America\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevegatto/421280461/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr/stevegatto2</a>\n\nThursday's New York Times had news sure to provoke demographic panic in some of the more unsavory corners of American society: the Census Bureau announced that non-white babies now account for the majority of births in the US . Here's the Times writeup:\n\nNon-Hispanic whites accounted for 49.6 percent of all births in the 12-month period that ended last July, according to Census Bureau data made public on Thursday, while minorities - including Hispanics, blacks, Asians and those of mixed race - reached 50.4 percent, representing a majority for the first time in the country's history.\n\nSuch a turn has been long expected, but no one was certain when the moment would arrive - signaling a milestone for a nation whose government was founded by white Europeans and has wrestled mightily with issues of race, from the days of slavery, through a civil war, bitter civil rights battles and, most recently, highly charged debates over efforts to restrict immigration.\n\nWhile over all, whites will remain a majority for some time, the fact that a younger generation is being born in which minorities are the majority has broad implications for the country's economy, its political life and its identity. \"This is an important tipping point,\" said William H. Frey, the senior demographer at the Brookings Institution, describing the shift as a \"transformation from a mostly white baby boomer culture to the more globalized multiethnic country that we are becoming.\"\n\nI'm generally skeptical of stuff like this, because the definition of \"white\" has never been static. White ethnics-Irish, Italians, Jews-were long excluded from whiteness on the grounds that they were racially inferior, but they were integrated into a more inclusive redefinition of whiteness post-World War II. The same is likely to happen in the next generation-people that we don't consider to be white today might identify as such in the future.\n\nAdam Serwer is filling in while Kevin is on vacation.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What's Hurting White America? It's Not the Welfare State\n\nSince the election of Barack Obama, right-wingers like Glenn Beck have made a concerted effort to craft a narrative in which whites are the new oppressed and reverse-racism, rather than actual racism, is the new great challenge of our times. CNN captured the zeitgeist last month, when it headlined a story, \" Are whites racially oppressed? \" (the actual article was far less hysterical).\n\nCharles Murray, the libertarian scholar most famous for his book The Bell Curve , thankfully, did not go down that path in his \" State of White America \" address to the American Enterprise Institute last night. Instead, he focused on a set of social trends he believes \"will end what has made America, America.\" Specifically, an ever-widening gap between what he calls \"the new lower class\" and \"the new elite,\" which he attributes to the slow creep of the European-style welfare state.\n\nHe's offered a glimpse of this before, but he expanded on it at AEI: Essentially, he says, the four virtues that hold the key to American Exceptionalism-marriage, religiosity, work ethic, and honesty-are in steady decline among the white lower class, with destructive consequences. It's an age-old problem: the government gives you food  stamps, and the next thing you know, your marriage has collapsed, you've  quite your job, you've turned your back to God, and you're facing 5 to  10 for holding up a Piggly Wiggly.\n\n\"The parallel that keeps nagging at me is Rome,\" he explained, comparing the nation's current precipice to the classical civilization's conversion from a republic to an empire. We're not going to collapse, he says, but society will become a lot more stratified.\n\nWhat Murray ignores are the political forces that makes it possible  for issues facing poor whites to be kept so muffled. To that end, the  night's most revealing moment came when Murray discussed the tea party.  Coming to the defense of the conservative political movement, Murray  began to read off a list of agenda items he said he'd found at \"the tea  party's website.\" There is no tea party website (he was quoting the Tea Party Patriots );  just a lot of different, often feuding groups vying for the  attention. But, when coupled with his assertion that the movement was a  \"spontaneous\" and \"grassroots\" effort, you can start to see where he  goes so wildly astray: Murray's totally blind to the corporatism that  drives Republican (and increasingly Democratic) politics-and its effect  on growing income inequality (now available in chart form ).\n\nIn other words, the greatest problem facing the new white lower  class (such as it is) probably isn't that poor whites are coasting along  on government handouts; quite the opposite. Their main party has  embraced a corporate philosophy that says that the freedom to fail is  what makes America great, that people who receive government assistance  are akin to stray dogs, and that having an \"adult conversation\" means  cutting capital gains tax rates in a recession while slashing funding  for programs that might help poor people. Murray's right to call  attention to problems facing the white working class. But he doesn't  need to look far to figure out why nothing's being done.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Dear White People: Here's How to Honor Native Americans\n\nChiricahua Apache children at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1885 Library of Congress\n\nNovember is my annual season of ambivalence. Although I love autumn, its poignant air of loss and the promise of renewal, it has the bittersweet distinction of also being Native American history month.\n\nEvery year, for as long as I can remember, editors of the legacy press, as well as church and school groups, have asked me to regale their audiences with Native American history. Inevitably these requests seek to frame Indigenous peoples as denizens of a long-ago past, as occupants of a fantasy world that has almost nothing to do with our lived experiences.\n\nThis annual exercise has taken on a wearying sameness: It's the month of explaining Indians to white people. Typically they tell me they want to know more about Native people, our lives today, how to honor our culture and be allies. But almost always this means they want me to present generic versions of Native dance, crafts, spirituality; to help them participate in ceremonies and drumming, identify their power animals, and become shamans. In short, they want to celebrate an Indian who never was, one who soothes their settler souls.\n\nI often relent and offer up a few words encouraging folks to read pertinent books and conduct a bit of research on their own. Such presentations are far more mindful of white fragility than I'd prefer. Nevertheless, what I say can be shattering to them, like watching a 5-year-old's face crumble as she's told Santa Claus isn't real.\n\nThis year, the requests have been especially fraught. Prompted by discoveries of hundreds of children's graves at the boarding schools that Native children were coerced into by the governments of Canada and the United States, white people want me to describe these atrocities and my own family's experience as survivors. For reasons that are difficult for me to fathom, this is a new story for White America. They are shocked, horrified, and weirdly eager for appalling details.\n\nNative people, myself included, are shocked that it's taken so long for non-Natives to acknowledge this grim history, one we've been hollering about for decades, only to be met with deafening silence or denial.\n\nMy grandmother, mother, aunts and uncles, and many cousins are all boarding school survivors. Theirs was run by the Catholic church, but its curriculum and culture were modeled on federal schools such as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, which also inspired those in Canada where the bodies of children were first disinterred in June.\n\nAfter Canada passed the Indian Act in 1876, which authorized the government to regulate and administer the affairs of Indigenous peoples, Nicholas Flood Davin, a member of Parliament, was tasked with finding a means to educate the country's Indigenous peoples. Davin visited the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879 and was impressed with how US Army Lt. Richard Pratt, the school's founder, used education to force assimilation onto Native people.\n\nBefore founding Carlisle, Pratt ran a prison school for Natives at Fort Marion in Florida, where he developed a pedagogical style of systematically destroying Native culture, language, and family connections with the goal of absorbing Native children into mainstream America. His motto, \" Kill the Indian, save the man ,\" helped shape the regimented military style that defined most Native boarding schools.\n\nUS boarding schools were often woefully underfunded. Deplorable conditions-poor food, clothing, housing-contributed to the spread of disease and sometimes death. According to researchers, many schools failed to keep accurate records of student deaths. Parents of those who died were often notified after the child's burial, if they were notified at all; few could afford travel expenses to pick up their children's remains.\n\nUnlike Canada, where the 2008 Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and subsequent Truth and Reconciliation Act helped unlock church and government records, there is little definitive data on the number of schools or children who attended or died at schools in the United States. Researchers estimate that more than twice as many Indian boarding schools operated in the United States as in Canada.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland, the only Indigenous person to serve at the Cabinet level, recently announced her agency's creation of the Federal Indian Boarding School Truth Initiative. Under the initiative, the Bureau of Indian Affairs is instructed to collect records of the boarding school program, with special attention to deaths and burial sites. The initiative also includes securing documentation from Christian denominations that operated schools.\n\nHaaland's initiative represents the first official effort to own up to the boarding school era and recognize its enduring impact on Native peoples. It's also the first concrete commitment by the US government to investigate and acknowledge the history of assimilationist policies.\n\n\"For more than a century, the Department was responsible for operating or overseeing Indian boarding schools across the U.S.,\" the initiative states. \"While it may be difficult to learn of the traumas suffered in the boarding school era, understanding its impacts on communities today cannot occur without acknowledging that painful history.\"\n\n\"Only by acknowledging the past can we work toward a future we are all proud to embrace.\"\n\nBut as of yet, it's pretty vague. There are no specific plans to perform archeological investigations of boarding school sites, nor is there any funding appropriated. And, crucially, the United States has never apologized for its boarding school policies.\n\nThe enormity of my family's trauma is simply too deep to be reduced to the indignity of a benign synopsis offered to a gathering of blissfully ignorant and well-intentioned, always well-intentioned, White people. In the end, those intentions remain firmly centered in a White world where White saviors pave the way for healing and reconciliation on terms that don't look too deeply into their own culpability and benefits associated with colonialism.\n\nThere is a childlike quality to the White fragility and entitlement, even among the most woke persons, that almost fills me with pity. Until I remember how much power they hold and how, if they really wanted, they could make an enormous difference in the world.\n\nFor this year's Native American history month, therefore, I have a modest proposal. Help us bring out our dead.\n\nA bill establishing the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policy in the U.S. Act was introduced in Congress again this year. It would compel the investigation of America's boarding school history and actions to address the policy's intergenerational impact.\n\nBut rather than waiting for lawmakers to rule, churches, universities, and communities who truly want to be allies can support Indigenous efforts to locate boarding schools and cemeteries. Guided entirely by Indigenous peoples, allies can pay for all costs associated with this work-be it disinterring remains and repatriating them to their homes, building memorials, or holding ceremonies to honor the dead.\n\nAllies can do this work without centering themselves in any way. They can facilitate healing and reconciliation by simply being of service to their Indigenous neighbors. The Genoa Indian School Digital Reconciliation Project -a collaboration between the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, the Genoa Foundation, and members of Nebraska tribes, including descendants of those sent to that boarding school-is a great model. By combing through newspaper archives and school newsletters, the project has identified more than 100 children who died at the school and is working to locate their graves.\n\nAlthough not nearly as entertaining as learning how to be a shaman or reading aloud land acknowledgements in suitably lofty tones, a nationwide effort to find all the graves at all the schools would represent authentic reckoning. It's a Native American history month activity I could support wholeheartedly and without rancor, one that might represent a true step forward.\n\nAdapted in part from \"We Won't Forget About the Children\" in Indian Country Today , where Mary Annette Pember is a national correspondent.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Michael Eric Dyson Wants White People to Step Up and Actually Do Something About Racism\n\n<a href=\"http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Jay-Z-Georgetown/bbd5c60eb52b402bbae92a973db4ecf7/42/0\">AP Photo/Evan Vucci</a>\n\nThe election of Donald Trump sent things spinning in America and got people talking about \"whiteness.\" Did Democrats ignore the white working class? Was Trump making a legitimate appeal to rural America, or was his rhetoric a thinly masked courtship of white racists? If progressives want to win the next presidential election, do they need to abandon identity politics?\n\nAs befuddling as it all seems, the author Michael Eric Dyson, a Georgetown University sociology professor and Baptist minister, has a pretty simple message: If America is to improve racial harmony, then white people-all of them-will need to get on board.\n\nIn Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America , out this week, Dyson doesn't sugarcoat what he expects from \"white brothers and sisters.\" He demands action, not just empathy. The book calls on all whites, urban and rural, to get involved, and Dyson even offers a list of ways to do so. You might start reading notable black authors (James Baldwin is a favorite), create an \"individual reparations account,\" or find another way to pay a \"secular tithe\" that helps young black people in your neighborhood. He even calls on whites with social-media savvy to use their resources for good: If young whites were to tweet, for example, every time a cop let them off the hook for a minor infraction that a minority kid might have been punished for, it might help highlight policing disparities.\n\nNot everyone, as Dyson is well aware, will be receptive to his ideas-in fact, he might just piss some people off. But minority voices in America can't be buried, Dyson writes, least of all during a Trump administration\n\nMother Jones: Tell me a little bit about your childhood in Detroit.\n\nMichael Eric Dyson: I grew up on the West Side-the \"near West Side,\" as they say-in what would be considered now the inner city. I had an exciting, interesting childhood, to be sure, with all of the challenges that ghetto life provides-but had loving parents. I was born in '58, so the riot in Detroit in 1967 was a memorable introduction to the issue of race and how race made a difference in American society. And then the next year, of course, Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. And the Detroit Tigers winning the World Series. All of that made a huge impression on my growing mind.\n\nMJ: Why the World Series?\n\nMED: It introduced me for the first time to a team with a lot of black players. Detroit had about three of them: I think it was Willie Horton , Gates Brown , and Earl Wilson -might have been one or two more in '68. But the St. Louis Cardinals, the team we were facing and eventually beat in a seven-games series, had Lou Brock and Bob Gibson, who just mowed down 17 batters in that first game and made me want to become a pitcher. To see all those beautiful black ballplayers in one place and thriving and doing so well made a huge impression on me.\n\nMJ: So you were a good student? A big reader?\n\nMED: Yep.\n\nMJ: You have a great list of black authors at the end of your book. When did you start reading their books?\n\nMED: Mrs. James, my fifth-grade teacher, introduced us to some of the great literature of African American culture. I won my first blue ribbon reciting the vernacular poems of Paul Lawrence Dunbar, in particular \"Little Brown Baby.\" She introduced us to these authors early on and taught us that their literature is important. Langston Hughes-we read his poetry. We studied who W.E.B DuBois was. And so she whetted our appetites.\n\nAnd then I went to the library and began to read some of this stuff on my own. My discovery of James Baldwin was life-changing. I read Go Tell It on the Mountain first, and that was hugely impactful. The beauty of the literary art, the grappling with the black church, the wrestling with one's identity in the bosom of a complicated black community that was both bulwark to the larger white society as well as a threshing ground, so to speak, to hash out the differences that black people have among ourselves.\n\nMJ: You were ordained as a minister pretty young, right?\n\nMED: Yeah, I grew up in the church and began to recite set pieces at the age of four and five, like many of the other kids. We began to connect literacy and learning and the lively effects of biblical knowledge and preaching pretty early. That was a tremendous impact. When I was 12 years old, my pastor came to the church: Dr. Fredrick Samson. And that was revolutionary because he mentored me and I got a chance to see up close the impact of a rhetorical genius. I received my calling and accepted it at around 18. I went to school four years later than most people because I was a teen father, hustled on the streets, worked, lived on welfare and the like, and didn't get to college until almost 21. That's when I officially got licensed and ordained, right after that.\n\nMJ: You note in this book that you felt a sermon coming-as opposed to a sociological work.\n\nMED: I was trying to write a straightforward book of sociological analysis, or at least cultural criticism, and I failed. I've written a lot of other books and this book was different. I couldn't just say what I wanted to say in the same style that I said it in those other books. I felt compelled to preach.\n\nMJ: You also write that Trump's victory was America's response to eight years of Barack Obama. In terms of racial attitudes, do you think his victory uncovered something new-or merely revived things that never went away, but that many of us had forgotten?\n\nMED: I think it's both. When people are not sure about their future, when their economies are suffering, when their personal fortunes are flagging, we have often in this country turned to nativism and xenophobia and racism and anti-immigrant sensibilities and passions to express our sense of outrage at what we can't control-and to forge a kind of fitful solidarity that turns out to be rather insular-we look inward and not outward.\n\nAs a result, the demand for racial (and sexual) justice gets reduced to politics of identity-and excoriating the so-called perpetrators of the identity politics. What the left ends up missing is that politics have always been at the heart of American culture; it's been a white identity that's been rendered invisible and neutral because it's seen as objective and universal. As a result, we don't pay attention to how whiteness is one among many racial identities, and that identity politics have been here since the get-go. But they only become noticeable when the dominant form gets challenged-when the invisible is made visible, when the universal is seen as particular. That's what people of color do when they challenge white privilege and unconscious bias. In that sense, it's an ongoing process.\n\nMJ: One line that really stuck with me came when you were talking about urban white people looking down on rural whites as \"poor white trash.\" You write, \"In the end, it only makes the slaughter of our people worse to know that your disapproval of those white folks has spared your reputations but not our lives.\" Are you basically saying to the \"good\" white people who didn't vote for Trump that not being racist isn't enough?\n\nMED: Right. It's not enough to be against something. What are you for? It may be, to a degree, consoling that white brothers and sisters did not vote for Trump, and do not participate in that brand of animus, that gas-bagging of enormous bigotry. But the problem is we are left only with empathy-which is critical, if it can be developed-without substantive manifestations of that empathy. It's one thing to attain it intellectually, but it's another thing to do something about it. To challenge norms, presuppositions, practices in communities across this country-where the unconscious valorization and celebration of whiteness and conscious resistance to trying to grapple with black and brown and other peoples of color's ideas and identities-makes a huge difference.\n\nMJ: So you would say that's one of the more important roles for an enlightened white person?\n\nMED: Yeah, that kind of peer learning, that peer teaching, that peer evaluation, and then administration of insight. That is an extremely important role: how white brothers and sisters laterally spread knowledge, insight, and challenge in a way that white brothers and sisters will not hear it from a person like me, necessarily. I hope they read this book and engage with it, but other white people have a better chance of speaking more directly to the white folk they know, because they're less likely to be subject to ridicule. They're insiders, so to speak.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How White is \"Rural America\"?\n\nOver at Vox, Sean Illing writes about how we think of rural America:\n\nThe media often conflates rurality and whiteness in this country. But this is a false - and misleading - narrative.\n\nRoughly one-fifth of rural residents in this country are people of color, and their interests and political views are as diverse as they are. When coverage of rural areas dismisses or otherwise ignores this fact, actual political consequences follow: The specific concerns of certain communities simply fall out of view.\n\nIlling talks about this with Mara Casey Tieken, a professor at Bates College, who says this:\n\nI think policymakers that represent white communities have disproportionately more power than policymakers representing rural communities of color....I think the problem also becomes self-perpetuating because what gets covered is rural white America, so that shapes how people think about rural America, and those are the stories that get told over and over again.\n\nI want to offer up a guess about one reason why \"rural\" is so associated with whiteness. Here it is:\n\nWhen the media reports on rural America, the stories are usually about Ohio or Missouri or Indiana or Pennsylvania or Nebraska. \"Rural\" means the Midwest and the Rust Belt. And as you can see on the map, those places really are mostly white.\n\nAs Tieken says, this becomes self-perpetuating. The Midwest and the Rust Belt are politically interesting, so rural areas there get lots of coverage. That means we largely see rural America as white, and that in turn means that news items about non-white areas usually end up getting coded as something else: In the Deep South they become \"race and the lingering effects of slavery\" stories, and in the Southwest they become \"Hispanic immigration and the changing demographics of America\" stories.\n\nDoes this happen because of implicit bias among reporters and the rest of us? Or because the Midwest and the Rust Belt really are the interesting areas when it comes to politics (big populations, loud voices, plenty of swing voters)? Maybe both.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "website": "https://www.motherjones.com",
      "text": "The Race Course\n\nWhen President Clinton went to San Diego early this summer and announced a \"great and unprecedented conversation about race,\" it was no secret that he hoped to address historians as much as the graduating college seniors seated before him. For months, Clinton had searched for a defining crusade to mark his presidency. He settled on America's most agonizing and enduring dilemma, and it was a good choice. Although many Americans have stopped rooting for this president, most of us would like him to succeed on this issue. But we're deeply skeptical. A survey taken immediately following Clinton's speech showed that almost 60 percent of Americans believe racial problems are beyond the president's control.\n\nWhy the pessimism? One trouble is that, in some sense, we converse about race enough already. But we converse dishonestly, or at least disingenuously. There is a chasm between our public and private discussions of race, between the way we talk about other people when we are in classrooms and how we talk about them in our living rooms. In public, most Americans praise the benefits of a diverse and multicultural society. But when the doors are closed, the same Americans retreat into their own ethnic and racial tribes and voice deeper and darker emotions: resentment and guilt, rage and fear.\n\nThough American society is more diverse than ever before, a charged division persists: the line between blacks and whites. Both blacks and whites want racial comity and both believe racial discrimination still exists in America. But when the discussion turns to specific causes and solutions, the consensus fractures. Here's one reason: affirmative action.\n\nOf course, affirmative action didn't cause America's fundamental racial problems - slavery and segregation did. But affirmative action has eroded liberals' moral credibility as reformers and driven away many natural allies. So progressives need to reassess their commitment to affirmative action and find better alternatives that can re-establish racial healing as a national priority.\n\nIt seems safe - if not completely comforting - to say that affirmative action's political defeat is imminent. Blacks and whites have irreconcilable differences on this issue. Only 17 percent of whites believe blacks and other minorities should receive preferences in admissions to college. A majority of blacks think the opposite. According to the most recent Gallup poll, almost 60 percent of African-Americans believe the government should make every effort to improve conditions of blacks and other minorities. Only 34 percent of white Americans agree.\n\nLike welfare reform, the dissolution of affirmative action without the proposition of real alternatives could prove shamefully destructive. Even during its dismantling, affirmative action has allowed us to talk about race euphemistically: Both its supporters and detractors could appeal to principle, each claiming to be the champions of equality. This let everyone off the hook. To date, we have avoided the emotional rawness that lies below the surface of racial civility.\n\nBeneath their professed tolerance, many white Americans suspect that the black community carries a defective pathology that no amount of government programs or \"conversation\" can cure. Whites wonder why blacks continue to underachieve in comparison to other ethnic and immigrant groups, particularly Asian-Americans. And whites fear, in times of high tension, that blacks will act as a racially united and irrational mob. The first O.J. Simpson verdict horrified so many whites because it seemed to flout the mores of law and reason, in favor of some controlling racial solidarity. That terrified whites, many of whom see themselves as potential victims of that mob.\n\nBlacks, on the other hand, perceive white America as a persistent, quiet mob. When an all-white jury in a white enclave, Simi Valley, California, acquitted Rodney King's assailants in 1992, many blacks (and not only those in the hoods of South Central Los Angeles) saw the triumph of a self-protecting tribe that ignores documented brutality. Many blacks sympathize with claims that the CIA introduced crack cocaine into inner cities, or with the hateful cant of Louis Farrakhan, because they believe that white America harbors a primal desire to close ranks in order to preserve its power.\n\nCertainly the desire to exploit \"the other\" is an old American tradition. Economic conservatives have long treated America's ethnic groups as laborers who could be bought for cheap and then integrated when an even more alien labor force was allowed in. Although American liberals derided this cold calculation, they also relied heavily upon a certain economic logic. Their greatest victories in the period following the New Deal and ending with the Vietnam War came about largely because, for three decades, the bounties of the American economy seemed limitless. The left did not anticipate that America's taste for serious social reform would contract when resources did. Instead, much of the left embraced a politics of racial consumerism. It assumed that in an infinitely prosperous America, every group and subgroup was entitled to its own share of the riches. Support for affirmative action became a virtual mantra for liberals, even though it contradicted a widely held American belief that no racial or ethnic group deserved a mandated advantage in the marketplace, and even though the central beneficiaries - middle-class blacks - commanded a limited political base.\n\nWhen the sustainability of American growth came into question, any racial unity that the left had built fractured into battles over turf and money. One casualty is the withering of affirmative action. Another is the very notion that America can become an integrated, harmonious whole. Even the NAACP reconsidered its commitment to integration. Despite the recent prosperity that is fattening federal coffers, most Americans no longer believe that government incentives to ease racial tensions will succeed.\n\nThis alarming loss of faith is the reason why Mother Jones is devoting so much of this issue to rethinking race. The right, by successfully dismantling affirmative action, has seized the initiative on race in America. But progressives can recover it. First we need to admit that affirmative action has failed as a long-term political strategy. In its place, the left should call the bluff of affirmative action's opponents, by crafting a more pragmatic strategy that emphasizes basic solutions to racial injustice - such as making superior public education accessible to all students. We can insist, as places such as Boston Latin School have strived to do, that the opportunity to receive a high-quality public education is a right owed to all American children, of every race, religion, and economic background.\n\nAffirmative action's demise means liberals must reshape their political alliances. An agenda that sheds race- and identity-based politics in favor of shared, communal goals could bring many citizens - whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians - who have deserted the left over affirmative action back into a progressive, transracial coalition. Such a coalition could call for renewed public investment as long as individual responsibility remains at the core.\n\nSome conservatives might join such a coalition if its values were uncompromising. Visionary progressives should realize that the right potentially has more than an economic interest in seeing race relations improved. Contemporary American conservatism's stated ideal is to redress the country's moral failings. Americans in the next century could find, as did 19th-century abolitionists and 20th-century civil rights leaders, that race problems cannot be solved solely through economics. Racial inequity is a moral, emotional, and spiritual problem shared by blacks and whites. On a fundamental level, inequality of opportunity should signify immorality - particularly to religious fundamentalists. All honest conservatives could be helped to see the resolution of America's racial problems as the test of their faith.\n\nFor progressives, the end of affirmative action presents a critical moment. The progressive philosophy is essentially optimistic: A democratic society's enduring attribute should be its capacity for self-improvement. The death of affirmative action need not be a dispiriting event. Our history teaches that the nation's greatest periods of renewal came out of crisis. Truly visionary Americans will not wait for the president's conversation on race. They will seize the moment for themselves now.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Charlie Kirk Doesn't Really Seem to Mind White Nationalism\n\nMother Jones illustration; Brian Cahn/ZUMA\n\nIn 2012, Charlie Kirk deferred his acceptance to Baylor University to found Turning Point USA and establish himself as a young conservative whisperer who could convince his peers of the wonders of capitalism. In early 2016, the organization's website argued that through \"non-partisan debate, dialogue, and discussion, Turning Point USA believes that every young person can be enlightened to true free market values.\" But as the group grew and set up more campus chapters, TPUSA was forced to adapt as Donald's Trump's reactionary brand of populism took over the Republican party. Kirk responded by spreading the MAGA gospel himself, traveling from school to school epically dunking on any liberal students who tried to spar with him during Q&A.\n\nBut during question sessions on his 2019 campus speaking tour, Kirk repeatedly found himself facing critics from the right. Groypers-what acolytes of Nick Fuentes , the young white nationalist, call themselves-showed up to pepper him with thinly veiled white supremacist, Christian nationalist, and homophobic questions, sometimes even using explicitly Nazi terms. In what became known as the \"Groyper Wars,\" Fuentes would watch livestreams of the events, and egg on his followers, who even published guides on 4chan and in the neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer , on how to properly troll a Kirk Q&A: \"Dress nice, be polite, remain calm, cool AND DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS RELATED TO [ the Jewish question ].\"\n\nAt the time, Kirk was irritated, but did not yield and refused to be dragged to the right by the Groypers'  leading questions. But more recently, Kirk appears to have shifted, embracing racist and white nationalist rhetoric and figures with little hesitation. In the past year, he's hosted far-right and white supremacist figures on his podcast and has tweeted in support of whiteness, earning praise from white supremacists who have long campaigned to mainstream such rhetoric.\n\nIn October, he invited veteran white supremacist Steve Sailer, whose bonafides include writing for overt white nationalist publications including VDare and the Unz Review , on his podcast. During their interview, Kirk called Sailer his favorite \"noticer\"-a word frequently used in internet conservative spaces as a euphemism for individuals willing to publicly draw bigoted conclusions linking race and criminality. Sailer did exactly this during their conversation, insinuating that Black people commit crimes because of innate characteristics: \"Blacks tend to commit murder about 10 times as often per capita as whites... it's not just all explained by poverty.\"\n\n\"Steve, what you're doing is so important,\" Kirk gushed.\n\nIn January, Kirk hosted Curtis Yarvin, a neo-reactionary, anti-egalitarian who has described slavery as \"a natural human relationship\" and argued the biological roots of intelligence vary between populations. (He has tried to walk such claims back.) While Kirk seemed uncomfortable when Yarvin's expressed his affinity for monarchy, he mostly remained effusive and praised his guest for \"thought-provoking ideas\" that \"I love.\"\n\nOthers associated with Turning Point USA are also giving voice to white supremacist positions. In a tweet last week, right-wing internet figure Jack Posobiec, a TPUSA contributor with his own history of ties to white nationalists, slammed Nikki Haley's financial backers as \"rootless cosmopolitans,\" an established antisemitic euphemism, while arguing the same \"monied class\" wrote the recent failed immigration bill. When asked for comment, TPUSA spokesman Andrew Kolvet pointed to a tweet about a pro-Israel event that had been hosted by one campus chapter.\n\nJust a few years ago, Kirk was not the type of conservative who would give space to far-right figures like Yarvin and Sailer. His Twitter feed focused on espousing the neoliberal conservatism that had been the dominant strain of right-wing ideology since Reagan. While Turning Point USA went viral for touching third rails on race-as one chapter did in 2017 for an \"affirmative action bake sale\" offering differently priced baked goods to different races-they often retreated, firing employees or excising members who went too far into extremism. In 2019, for example, the organization severed ties with a student ambassador after she appeared in a photo with white nationalists.\n\nBut today, Kirk and his organization no longer seem to care. Indeed, they are starting to say the kinds of things that they used to cut ties with people over. Jared Holt, a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue who focuses on hate and extremism, has noticed the organization's increasing willingness to go there. \"You'd see them dip their toe in it,\" Holt said. \"They would talk about demographic shifts, but say it was about voter turnout, instead of it being about a White America. At some point, it seems like they gave up doing that.\"\n\nKirk's Twitter feed has matched this shift. Between 2016 and 2019, Kirk sent dozens of tweets praising \"free markets,\" calling them a \"cure to poverty,\" which brings \"out the best in individuals,\" the thing that \"built our cities,\" and so on. These tweets fizzle out by 2020. In that same time period he tweeted about whiteness just once, in response to a 2018 New York Times story , when Kirk seemed to affect a form of racial blindness in response to an article on white women's privilege, by complaining that \"the left is obsessed with race\" and that the Times writer's use of the term \"whiteness\" was \"highly racist.\"\n\nBut in the past year, Kirk has shifted from fetishizing free markets to fetishizing whiteness, authoring tweets on how \"whiteness is great,\" that there is an undeniable \"War on White People in The West,\" and about various innovations like \"[o]wning property\" and \"[a]bolishing slavery\" that he claims \"you can thank the White European for.\" If you search Kirk's tweets for mentions of \"white,\" you'll find a similar transition. Prior to 2020, the majority are mentions of the White House. After 2020, they tend to refer to white people or rail against perceived instances of \"anti-white\" bias.\n\nThe far-right has been approvingly watching Kirk's overtures. His tweets praising whiteness and European heritage are often mobbed by gleeful replies from Groypers claiming victory for their racist politics. Fuentes himself even reposted Kirk's \"War on White People\" tweet to brag about how it was \"a testament to how thoroughly Groypers have taken over the conversation.\" And in January, Jeremy Carl, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute-a think tank that has tried to provide intellectual ballast to the far-right-tweeted in praise of Kirk's platforming of Sailer and Yarvin, saying that Kirk, \"arguably the most influential leader for young conservatives, is quietly expanding the range of voices that can be heard on the mainstream right and its great to see...\"\n\nKirk's sway with young conservatives is harder to parse than Carl suggests, but his reach is certainly far wider than those of people like Fuentes-even if the Turning Point base lacks the Groypers' reverence and fervor. But despite his prominence, it might be better to see Kirk not as an influencer, but as a window into shifting right-wing permission structures.\n\n\"TPUSA has very deep pockets, which makes them adopting this rhetoric more consequential than your random internet personality shock jock,\" Holt said. Indeed, if someone as reliant on right-wing mega-donors and as connected to the top of the party as Kirk is can say these things with little internal pushback, it's probably because the bigwigs are fine with it in private. (Turning Point USA took in some $80 million in donations last year, a 20 million increase from 2021. Kirk purchased a $4.7 million estate in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2023).\n\nThe year before the Groyper wars, Kirk faced a similar public humiliation when he interviewed Tucker Carlson at a Turning Point USA conference, and the then-Fox News host spent most of the 50 minutes mocking Kirk for his free-market tendencies. When Kirk tried to establish that it is \"not the state's role to incentivize or de-incentivize individual behavior,\" Carlson laughed at him and dryly said \"hilarious.\"\n\n\"If you start with these inflexible theories,\" Carlson said minutes later, talking about Kirk's libertarian-esque rejection of regulation, \"you wind up where are now: in a country where a small number of people are taking all the spoils and you guys are shafted.\"\n\n\"Tucker, we're not getting shafted,\" Kirk responded. Carlson cocked his head back and laughed. The crowd laughed with him. Online, commenters crowed. \"Embarrassing effort Charlie,\" one wrote. \"Nationalism really throws both leftists and rightists for a loop. Great job by Tucker as always.\"\n\nKirk might have spent that day arguing back. But this June, Kirk hired Blake Neff, who had spent years as a key producer and writer on Carlson's Fox News show, helping spread his nationalist politics. \"Anything he's reading off the teleprompter, the first draft was written by me,\" Neff once boasted , before he resigned from Fox in 2020 after he was caught having posting misogynistic, homophobic, and racist content to an online forum.\n\nAccording to Media Matters , Kirk welcomed Neff to Talking Point USA during a live stream, saying \"we're honored to have Blake on our team-he's great.\"\n\nLast spring , Rolling Stone 's Tim Dickinson documented Kirk's growing appreciation for Christian Nationalism. But since then, Kirk has gone beyond that already extreme ideology to make his recent overtures to racists on the right. The reasons behind Kirk's ideological drift are unclear. He may be reacting to changes among young GOP supporters; many campus conservatives-the audience he's built a career claiming to represent-have also shifted to the right; last year, I was able to find roughly 30 schools where Fuentes followers had taken over once mainstream conservative student groups.\n\nAndrew Kolvet, a spokesman for both Kirk and Turning Point, insists Kirk is not a white supremacist, nor is he making overtures to them. \"We reject the darkness of those [far-right] movements. It's negative and anti-human,\" he added, before defending TPUSA's record. \"It's critically important for observers to not conflate a legitimate and forceful pushback against radical Marxism with White Nationalism.\"\n\nSimilarly, Kolvet argues Kirk's praise of whiteness is justified by the term being \"used as a pejorative\" by \"certain professors\" and others on the left.\n\nKolvet waved off Kirk's conversations with people like Sailer and Yarvin as an example of being \"willing to engage with forbidden topics...He's not endorsing everything they believe.\"\n\n\"Kirk might have agreed with everything Sailer said that interview,\" he added, \"but Sailer has also written a ton of things. It's not a wholesale endorsement of everything he has written.\"\n\nEven if you're uninclined to take him at his word, Kolvet is correct about at least one thing: Kirk is not the vanguard of the far-right. But as a political operator, he sees value in adopting more of their positions-and the why doesn't much matter to the outcome. Either way, it moves the window of acceptable discourse to a space more favorable for extremists. I told Kolvet this. He disagreed.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Anti-Immigrant Activist Warns of Obama Plot to End \"White America\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama is secretly plotting to bring an end to \"White America,\" according to one conservative activist. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/6047294665/sizes/z/in/photostream/\">Pete Souza</a>/Flickr\n\nIs President Obama allowing millions of Central Americans to live in the United States illegally as part of his secret plan to destroy \"White America\"? According to William Gheen of the group Americans For Legal Immigration, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Gheen told a conservative talk radio show earlier this week that if things don't improve under \"Dictator Obama,\" patriotic Americans may resort to possibly violent, \"revolutionary means.\" (Gheen, as Media Matters pointed out , has been a frequent presence on Fox News and at tea party rallies). Here's what Gheen told talk show host Janet Mefferd:\n\nWhat Janet Napolitano has spent most of her time doing in the last  couple of months has been, one, preparing the new spy network that's  available now, the new data-collecting, see everything you do online,  beyond the normal terrorist list that they're creating, they're creating  a much larger list now of people who might be troublesome here in the  country. And putting out videos and propaganda telegraphing what I  believe to be a conflict with White America they're preparing for after  they get another 10 or 15 million people in the country to back them up...\n\nWe're no longer referring to him as President Barack Obama, our national  organization has made the decision and made the announcement we now  refer to him as Dictator Barack Obama. That's what he is. And basically  at this point, if you're looking for a peaceful, political recourse  there really isn't one that we can think of, and I'm really not sure  what to tell people out there than I guess they need to make decisions  soon to just accept whatever comes next or some type of extra-political  activities that I can't really talk about because they're all illegal  and violent.\n\nGheen has since clarified (sort of) that he doesn't personally support violence as a political tool, but believes President Obama isn't leaving freedom-loving Americans with much a choice. (Gheen previously made news when he called Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) gay at a tea party rally and alleged that Graham's supposedly closeted lifestyle was being used as blackmail to force him to adopt more moderate stances on immigration.)\n\nIt's worth noting that Gheen's conspiracy theory, while extreme, isn't so far removed from what actual elected officials are saying. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), who famously suggested that terrorists were smuggling babies across the border as part of a stealth jihad, revealed on Tuesday that Democrats were secretly planning to register undocumented residents to vote in the November elections. Gohmert, citing no one in particular, alleged that it would be part of a \"quid pro quo\"-\"we allow you to stay illegally and make sure you go down and vote.\" ACORN!\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Inside the White Supremacist Group Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nThe group formed in the aftermath of the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Anadolu Agency /Getty\n\nThis story was originally published by ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica's Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.\n\nIn the hours after the slaughter in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, a final toll emerged: 22 dead, most of them Latinos, some Mexican nationals. A portrait of the gunman accused of killing them soon took shape: a 21-year-old from a suburb of Dallas who had been radicalized as a white supremacist online and who saw immigrants as a threat to the future of white America.\n\nWhile much of the country reacted with a weary sense of sorrow and outrage, word of the mass killing was processed differently by members of Patriot Front, one of the more prominent white supremacist groups in the U.S.\n\nIn secret chat forums, some Patriot Front members embraced the spirit of the anti-immigrant manifesto left behind by the accused gunman. Others floated false conspiracy theories: the CIA was behind the murders; the accused killer was actually Jewish. Still other members cautioned that the group had its own \"loose cannons\" to worry about. It would be a bad look if the next mass murderer was one of their own.\n\nBut there was little, if any, regret over the loss of life.\n\n\"It shouldn't be hard to believe that the group facing the harshest oppression from our ruling elite are producing shooters,\" one Patriot Front member wrote. \"White men are being slowly destroyed in a way calculated to produce resentment and a sense of helplessness. Of course, some of them decide to lash out.\"\n\nSeveral Patriot Front members alerted others to the need to be careful, for the killings in El Paso would likely make the group a target of the FBI.\n\n\"Watch your backs out there,\" one wrote.\n\nPatriot Front was formed in the aftermath of the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. While many on America's far-right cheered the rally, its violence struck others as a public-relations debacle for the white nationalist brand that was sure to attract greater oversight by law enforcement.\n\nPatriot Front aspired to help chart a new way forward: spread propaganda espousing its version of a nascent American fascism; quietly recruit new members worried about a nation overrun by immigrants and a world controlled by Jews; avoid talking about guns or violence online, but engage in a mix of vandalism and intimidation to foster anxiety; wear masks in public and communicate secretly.\n\n\"The organization is not about its members,\" the group's leader, Thomas Rousseau, once wrote to its members in the secret chats. \"It is about its goals. Each person behind the mask is just another awoken member of the nation, who could be anyone who's had enough.\"\n\nProPublica spent several months examining the makeup and operations of Patriot Front, which records suggest numbers about 300 members.\n\nWhile the group is careful not to talk about guns online, two members in the last year have been arrested with arsenals of illegally owned high-powered rifles and other weapons. While many of the group's propaganda \"actions\" are legal exercises of free speech, its members have been arrested in Boston and Denver in recent months for acts of vandalism. In Boston, three members engaged in a nighttime propaganda effort last winter were arrested on suspicion of weapons possession and assaulting a police officer. What the group touts as political protests have felt to those targeted like acts of menace, as was the case in San Antonio, Texas, last year when Patriot Front members filmed themselves trashing an encampment of immigration activists.\n\nOne person whose establishment was targeted by Patriot Front in recent months spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing the group's return.\n\n\"Ordinarily would you call the police if somebody put a big sticker on your door? No,\" the person said. \"However, once you find out what this is all about, and who is involved, and what they are promoting? Then, yeah, now we are in hate speech space.\"\n\nTo the Southern Poverty Law Center, Patriot Front is a white hate group and a genuine criminal threat. To some of the more avowedly violent neo-Nazi groups in the U.S., Patriot Front is a laughable collection of clowns and cowards, content to chat online and put up stickers while a race war awaits.\n\nBut for law enforcement, gauging how serious a threat Patriot Front might pose is difficult. Patriot Front shares qualities both with groups engaged in real domestic terrorism and with fringe political groups.\n\nAsked about the group, the FBI issued a statement that reflected these complexities and the limitations they place on police agencies.\n\n\"When it comes to domestic terrorism, our investigations focus solely on the criminal activity of individuals-regardless of group membership-that appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion. We would encourage you to keep in mind that membership in groups which espouse domestic extremist ideology is not illegal in and of itself-no matter how offensive their views might be to the majority of society.\"\n\nRousseau, a Boy Scout and high school journalist before he founded Patriot Front, has much the same profile as the accused gunman in El Paso, Patrick Crusius: both grew up in middle-class suburbs of Dallas-Crusius in Allen, Rousseau 35 miles away in Grapevine; both were seen as unremarkable teenagers before being inculcated in their racist ideology online; both talk of a desire to reclaim America for \"true\" or \"pure\" patriots; both regard immigrants as a poisonous and present danger.\n\nIn the days after the rampage in El Paso, Rousseau told his members in the secret chats that such acts of wholesale violence were not for him. While fascist causes like Patriot Front's could survive the blowback from such killings, he said, real success for the group would come from spreading its ideology and increasing its numbers. Of the alleged El Paso shooter, Rousseau wrote in a chat, \"He'd have made more progress toward his goals by swallowing the first round in his magazine instead.\"\n\nIn the months of chats obtained by ProPublica, Rousseau is by turns amateur philosopher and historian, as well as the group's sole spokesman and its online policeman. He warns members that they will be kicked out if they don't stay busy-pasting up flyers and conducting banner drops, joining street actions and posting regularly in the chat forums. He has put together a security guide to help Patriot Front members stay anonymous. He waxes admiringly about certain far-right groups in Europe, and he sees them as a model for how to become more serious political players in the years ahead. He has the secret chats routinely deleted, and he tells members to avoid ever writing or saying anything that might later be of interest to a prosecutor.\n\n\"It should be known,\" he wrote to members recently, \"that political dissidents are subject to unjust scrutiny.\"\n\nPete Simi, a professor at Chapman University in California and an expert on white supremacists in the U.S., said Rousseau's stewardship of Patriot Front is deeply familiar.\n\n\"It is very common for the leadership of these groups to disqualify violence, while doing things that are encouraging violence,\" Simi said. \"It is part of their strategy to avoid liability, while simultaneously promoting hate. When they say they are not violent, this is a lie. They are promoting violence by their goals.\"\n\nTo gain an understanding of Patriot Front-its origins and ambitions, both the careful talk and the criminal behavior of its members-ProPublica examined hundreds of online postings, interviewed a person who infiltrated the group, obtained police records, reviewed its leader's public statements online and in a variety of far-right podcasts, collected video material recorded both by the group and members of the public, and traveled to the homes of its founder and two of the members who had recently been arrested.\n\nThe person who infiltrated Patriot Front in recent years-posting in the group's chats and accompanying it in its propaganda actions-sketched out a portrait of its members, which appear to be exclusively male:\n\nThey come from seven or eight regional \"networks,\" and the vast majority of them are recruited online; the typical member is around 25 years old and can be from blue-collar backgrounds or be working as \"white-collar tech geeks\"; many of them are gamers; few have wives or girlfriends; they can look like \"the nerdy boys that sit next to you in high school,\" but they clearly sympathize with \"right-wing terrorism.\"\n\nThe person who infiltrated Patriot Front said he applied for membership on the group's website-the one with the mission statement written by Rousseau. American democracy was dead. The government had been taken over by Jews and other \"elites.\" Land claimed by descendants of the country's original white settlers had been surrendered to immigrants of color. The dream was of a white ethnostate, in which all that was good and true and pioneering about the America of long ago could be restored.\n\nThe person who gained entrance to the group said Rousseau was one of three Patriot Front members who interviewed him on the telephone when he applied. He was asked to explain his political evolution, to say which political figures he hated and admired most, to state the circumstances in which the use of violence would be OK and to articulate the greatest threat to America. He was told Mussolini's \"The Doctrine of Fascism\" would be required reading.\n\nThe chats reviewed by ProPublica show Rousseau spends lots of time online pressing members to take part in targeting streets, parks and colleges with the group's propaganda. He and others delight in seeing their actions reflected in the SPLC's nationwide map recording acts of hate and in the media. Last spring, the group tried to stage protests in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's offices in multiple cities, including New York.\n\n\"One minute of action is better than 10,000 books on ideology,\" Rousseau told his members.\n\nRousseau, still a teen when he founded Patriot Front, makes clear in the secret chats reviewed by ProPublica that he is in charge, though he's happy to go without a formal title.\n\n\"The title commander gives me bad flashbacks,\" he wrote in a chat once. \"If I absolutely had to have a title, it would probably be general director. But my name works just fine for now.\"\n\nThe chats show some members regard Rousseau as a disciplined and effective spokesman for the group, and they appear to heed his repeated scoldings about preserving their anonymity.\n\n\"The enemy cannot attack you if they do not know who you are,\" Rousseau wrote.\n\nUsing the pseudonym Samuel, a member from New York expanded on the idea in response.\n\n\"I would say the biggest accomplishment of masking up is obfuscating our total numbers,\" he wrote. \"We can make them feel as if there are thousands of us when it's only a few hundred, and we could be anyone and no one. Next time they are at the CVS and see a white kid with a neat haircut, it could be us. Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all.\"\n\nRousseau, when he isn't criticizing members who violate the ban on talking about guns or violence, can often be found policing the group's ideological thinking. Nazism, however popular among members, can't now be the goal, Rousseau said.\n\n\"This is not Germany, this is not the 1930s,\" he chastised. \"Get a grip on the fact that we're activists, not re-enactors trying to scratch some self-indulgent itch for a political fantasy.\"\n\nRousseau conducts his online leadership from the home he shares with his divorced father in Grapevine, a largely white, solidly middle-class city between Dallas and Fort Worth. ProPublica went to see Rousseau there this summer, and we found the shades drawn in every window and a rusting boat filled with fallen leaves on the property.\n\nRousseau came to the door, but he closed it quickly and would not talk. The following day, the red sports car in the driveway had been reparked, making it hard to see the lone license plate on its rear end.\n\nInterviews with people in and around Grapevine-those who went to school with Rousseau, those who participated in the Boy Scouts with him, a man who dated his mother-produced a unanimous sense of surprise that he'd started an organization committed to an all-white America.\n\nHe'd mixed easily with the diverse array of students at his high school, and while he was against gay marriage, he was regarded more as a nice, conservative boy than a threat. He wore his hair long, in braids or a bun, and was obsessed with working out and the state of his physique.\n\nAt the student newspaper, he wasn't regarded as an impressive writer, but he won a national award for editorial cartooning. Classmates saw him as a lazy student and a bit of a loner, but he had a knack for argument and a stubborn streak about never being wrong. The school had its share of racial incidents, but he was never involved and wasn't seen as condoning them.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president, some senior boys at the school made a show of chanting, \"Build a wall.\" Rousseau, for his part, was certainly an ardent Trump supporter-he wore a Make America Great Again hat and carried a Trump lunchbox. But his enthusiasm wasn't seen as menacing.\n\n\"He seemed Republican, but he didn't seem crazy, said one fellow student.\n\nTo someone who was with him in Boy Scouts, Rousseau seemed serious about the organization, and he was elected patrol leader. At the same time, Rousseau could be difficult with adults, developing what the person called an \"authoritarian defiance.\"\n\n\"I'm saddened,\" the person said of Rousseau's embrace of white supremacy.\n\nSimi, the professor at Chapman University, said enough research exists on modern-day white supremacists to develop a profile: young men, isolated and angry in some way despite their relatively privileged upbringing in middle class or affluent circumstances, and vulnerable to invitations to join up with others with similar grievances.\n\nIn years past, Simi said, groups like Patriot Front used to recruit potential new members by waiting outside schools for the last children to leave, the loners wandering off long after the final bell. Now such groups don't have to work so hard to find targets. They have the internet, Simi said.\n\n\"It is a central aspect of these groups to take the frustration and anger and combine it with the special feeling and insights of being part of a group,\" he said.\n\nRousseau, then just 18, was in Charlottesville in 2017, marching in the \"Unite the Right\" rally as a member of Vanguard America. The Anti-Defamation League calls Vanguard America a neo-Nazi group formed in 2016 that, like Patriot Front after it, was chiefly engaged in spreading propaganda. James Fields, the white supremacist convicted of murdering a young protester at the Charlottesville event, was photographed there carrying a Vanguard America shield, though he was not a member of the group.\n\nVanguard America splintered after the debacle in Virginia. Some wanted to abandon efforts to disguise their Nazi leanings and simply be brazen in their public look and violent aims. Rousseau took a different tack, and he started Patriot Front as an ostensibly more strategic, savvy, careful alternative. It would embrace more homegrown symbols-the flag, the bald eagle and patriotic language. Such shifts might attract a wider membership.\n\n\"I did go to Charlottesville. Some bad activism there,\" Rousseau wrote in one of the secret chats. \"I've done my part to learn from my mistakes.\"\n\nWhile Rousseau publicly and in the chats reviewed by ProPublica disavows violence, some Patriot Front members have shown support for a white supremacist group that embraces it: the Rise Above Movement . Eight RAM members have been arrested on charges related to violence in Charlottesville and in California .\n\n\"Gotta love RAM,\" a Tennessee member said in the chats. \"I hope they see us as 100 percent allies.\"\n\nIn the chat logs, a Patriot Front member from Texas provides a list of addresses for 11 people in prison or under house arrest, referring to them as \"POWs.\" The list includes four members of RAM, numerous men arrested for violence in Charlottesville including Fields , and an imprisoned white supremacist in California. The Texan urged Patriot Front members to write to the prisoners and provided links to send some prisoners money directly. He also listed a donation link for a fund tied to Augustus Sol Invictus, a lawyer known for defending white supremacists.\n\nLater in the chats, a member from New York shared a link to a white supremacist online fundraiser, saying proceeds would be given to a legal fund for RAM. He then chimed in that nearly $2,000 had been donated. \"When they crack down we double down and become stronger,\" he said. \"Hail Victory!\"\n\nObservers of white hate groups credit Rousseau as a talented in-fighter, and they portray his breakaway from Vanguard America as a shrewd coup.\n\nAccording to the person who infiltrated Patriot Front, Rousseau worries greatly about his members making the worst strategic mistake: carrying out an act of terrible violence. It would end his group, he has said.\n\n\"Thomas' biggest fear is someone doing something crazy,\" said the person who infiltrated Patriot Front.\n\nJakub Zak was in bed in the Chicago suburb of Vernon Hills when police, accompanied by his father, shook him awake. The police had been told that Zak, 19, was a member of Patriot Front, and that he might have a stash of illegal guns.\n\n\"He appeared nervous and tried to cover a few items on his bed as he put on his blue jeans,\" police records say.\n\nThe police, though, had a clear view of what couldn't be hidden: a gun safe meant for rifles, as well as magazines of ammunition on the bedroom floor.\n\nZak asked his father to make the police leave. His father would not.\n\n\"I advised Jakub that we would like for him to be cooperative, and explained to him cooperation goes a long way,\" one detective wrote in a formal report, dated April 2018. \"I explained to him the decision is for him to make, and he should think what is best for him.\"\n\nZak spoke with his father and then offered the code for the safe. If there were guns in the house, the police wrote, Zak's father wanted them out.\n\nThe police found a loaded 9 mm pistol and then, in a second safe, four more guns, including three high-powered semiautomatic rifles. The police records show Zak's only concern was whether he could get his case for carrying the guns back after their confiscation.\n\nIt is unclear when or how Zak joined Patriot Front. The initial tip sent to law enforcement identified him as a member, one who often posted in the secret chats under the pseudonym \"Hussar.\" Postings under that name-portions of which were first published by Unicorn Riot , a media organization-suggest Zak was a frequent participant in the group's propaganda efforts in the streets.\n\nOnline, Zak posted a mix of Patriot Front slogans and images-\"America: Revolution is tradition\"; \"Deport them all.\" But there was also much more explicitly violent material: a young black man lying prone on the street and about to be stomped; a Glock pistol.\n\nZak, who had no prior criminal record, ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun possession charge and was sentenced to probation. Whether local police referred his case, and his affiliation with Patriot Front, to any other law enforcement agency is unclear.\n\nBut the basic facts of Zak's case amount to one of the hard-to-identify, hard-to-quantify, hard-to-assess threats in the U.S. today: an enthusiastically racist young man exposed to a steady diet of like-minded white supremacists, who doesn't find it terribly hard to get his hands on dangerous weapons. Crusius, the accused El Paso killer, had no prior record; he lived with his grandparents; his mother is reported to have anonymously called law enforcement, worried once her son had bought a gun, even if it was legal; the parents of a classmate of Crusius' told a local news organization in Dallas that their son had been encouraged by Crusius to join him in a white supremacist group.\n\nIn a brief interview at their home in Vernon Hills, Zak's parents would not let him be interviewed.\n\n\"There is nothing to talk about,\" his mother said, claiming he was not a member of any white hate group. \"He is going through rough times, and he is in a better place now. I don't want to start anything. He is getting his life together and planning [for] the future.\"\n\n\"We are regular people,\" his father added.\n\nConcerns about how effectively federal authorities have been in thwarting the threat of white supremacists extends back years, covering both Democratic and Republican administrations. In recent months, though, there has been a series of arrests suggesting that federal and local authorities are being more aggressive.\n\nIn a recent report , the Department of Homeland Security took care to restate the balance law enforcement has to strike.\n\n\"The Department must take care, while addressing the scourge of violence, to avoid stigmatizing populations, infringing on constitutional rights, or attempting to police what Americans should think,\" the report said.\n\nLast February, a Patriot Front member, Joffre Cross, was arrested on gun charges in Houston. At a probable cause hearing, authorities said they got on to Cross through phone records belonging to a white supremacist in Texas who was convicted on assault charges this year.\n\nCross, 33, fits what experts see as another familiar profile for potentially violent white supremacists: a former Army soldier whose association with white supremacists dates back to his active-duty days. Disaffected former soldiers are a prime recruiting target for white hate groups, prized for their gun and bomb training and their possible access to weapons. Cross, while on active duty, was convicted on drug charges and imprisoned for five years. As part of the investigation, the authorities developed information that he was eager to secure weapons for white supremacist groups.\n\nCross, who has pleaded not guilty, was charged with felony weapons possession after police found guns and body armor in his home.\n\n\"If you don't know me,\" Cross once posted on Instagram, \"consider this your trigger warning.\" Cross and his attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCross is a regular participant on the Russian social media platform VK, whose terms of service about extremist content are not strictly enforced. His posts are rife with Nazi videos, Holocaust denial material and white supremacists beating protesters.\n\nOne post reads: \"Help more bees; plant more trees; save the seas; shoot refugees.\"\n\nIn the Patriot Front chats, Cross continued to post even after his arrest.\n\n\"We have to build a foundation that can weather any storm, anything they throw at us,\" he wrote last April. \"We just have to keep pushing.\"\n\nIt was the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend 2019 when 20 or so masked members of Patriot Front made their way onto a corner of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. They set off flares and smoke devices, delivered a short speech using a megaphone and fled. The police report said it lasted all of three minutes.\n\nBlakely Lord, a high school English teacher, managed to capture the incident on video. In brief, she called the episode \"profoundly disturbing.\"\n\n\"I chose to film because you feel helpless,\" Lord said. \"I'm a dumpy middle-aged English teacher. I'm not going to get out my sword and face them down.\"\n\nShe added, \"I do think it's a narrative people need to be thinking about: these little incidents may seem unimportant, but in the aggregate they are disturbing.\"\n\nSuch disturbances-masked flash mobs, defacing property, distributing propaganda-are the day-to-day work of Patriot Front. Screaming outside an anarchist book fair in Texas. Plastering stickers across multiple store fronts on a busy block in Denver. Parading with flares at night in a public park in Boston . Posting an \"America First\" sticker at a gay pride center in Vermont . All in the last year.\n\nMembers give one another tips about where to place posters and stickers legally, and they urge one another to wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. But in practice, Patriot Front members frequently target storefronts or places of worship, which is vandalism. Additionally, many colleges and universities, another favorite target for postering, prohibit flyers from nonstudent groups. White supremacists see campuses as a strategic location for flyering: a place to recruit potential members while attracting press coverage to amplify their propaganda.\n\nIn Columbus, Georgia, three months ago, two Patriot Front members posted flyers on and around a local synagogue, Temple Israel. \"Reclaim America,\" read one. \"Life, liberty and the pursuit of victory,\" read another. And the address of Patriot Front's website was printed at the bottom of the flyers. The temple's leadership became aware of Patriot Front's history and said it was clear the synagogue and its members were targeted because of their faith.\n\n\"To me, the sinister aspect is this particular group disguises themselves as patriots, Tiffany Broda, the temple's president, told the Ledger-Enquirer last July. \"Yet they are a hate group, a nationally recognized hate group. And though we don't want to give them publicity, we think that it's important to bring this out of the shadows.\"\n\n\"Jews have been a part of Columbus almost since the founding of our city, which is almost 200 years ago,\" Rabbi Beth Schwartz added. \"We will remain vigilant as a congregation, vigilant as a Jewish community. We don't hide our heads in fear.\"\n\nPatriot Front members make clear in their chats that such actions-almost always recorded by one of the masked members-have multiple aims: to frighten, to provide material for their own propaganda efforts on social media, and to recruit. The drive to recruit might help explain why college campuses are Patriot Front's most common targets.\n\nLate last month, Patriot Front launched what it claimed were coordinated actions to distribute flyers and stickers and posters at more than 100 campuses across the country. The group posted on Twitter what it said was evidence of success at 90 schools.\n\nMichael Loadenthal, a visiting professor of sociology at Miami University in Ohio, said Patriot Front had recently been targeting the school.\n\n\"Fascists having a public presence is organizing; this is recruitment,\" Loadenthal said, adding that the simple idea that \"white supremacists are individually radicalized people in their basement at home is wrong.\"\n\n\"They are a network,\" he said. \"No particular node is dangerous until they are.\"\n\nSimi, the professor in California, said Patriot Front had hit the campus of Chapman University three times in a single month recently. The school, he said, had set up a permanent conference dealing with the nation's southern border, and Patriot Front had singled out posted materials related to the conference to be defaced or covered up.\n\n\"People on the campus get intimidated,\" Simi said.\n\nHe said the school had to add security cameras and police protection.\n\n\"This is part of their strategy,\" Simi said of Patriot Front. \"These are things they want to happen.\"\n\nThalia Beaty and Lucas Waldron contributed to this report.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

(Courtesy of Flickr user Steven Depolo ) It's a rare moment when I'm in the position to soothe white people's anxiety around an issue concerning race. My usual preference is to start riots. So please allow me this one opportunity I have to assuage any fear white people may be experiencing around the recent news that more white people died in the United States last year than were born. Ready? OK. Relax. White America isn't going anywhere. We went through this last year when the Census Bureau reported that whites were a minority of all newborns, and Jay Smooth did a nice job of calmly explaining why that shouldn't scare white people. But as the demographics continue to shift and more of these stories become news, our white brothers and sisters may require more consoling. Those of us who are members of historically oppressed racial groups are surely accustomed to a barrage of grim statistics about our community's future. This isn't a reality many white-identified people have had to deal with, and I think it's the humane thing to do to help them through this time of great consternation. The first thing to note is, if you're truly in fear of losing the majority, just change the definition of \"white.\" There is more than enough historical precedence for doing so. We're told over and over again that race is a social construction. It is not a fixed category. If you simply allow more people to identify as white, problem solved. Jamelle Bouie bets we will reach the point where some groups of Latinos and Asians \"will identify themselves as white, with Hispanic or Asian heritage, in the same way that many white Americans point to their Irish or Italian backgrounds.\" But also, understand that holding the majority in terms of population has never been the key to white America's success. What makes whiteness successful is the control of America's political and economic systems. The two go hand-in-hand, and so long as wealth is largely concentrated in the hands of a white oligarchy, so too will political power be. The centuries-long project of creating race and then using the idea of racial inferiority to exacerbate the inequality between the races, otherwise known as racism, has done an amazing job of ensuring the capital attached to whiteness will not fade any time soon. White privilege is a hell of a drug. And if that's not enough, consider this: according to Feeding America, more than a quarter of black households are food insecure. One in three black children live in households that lack access to enough food to ensure a healthy lifestyle. In fact, \"of the 104 US counties with a majority black population, 92 percent of these counties also record high food insecurity rates.\" We can talk about incarceration, wealth, education, housing, healthcare and other important disparities, but black America is struggling with even the most basic of human needs-food. Of course, this is a problem in communities across the country, white and non-white alike, but that's with anything we discuss. What makes these things unique to non-white people, and what assures me of white America's bright future, is that they hit communities of color hardest and there is little-to-no political will to do anything about it. Whiteness is and will continue to be the norm in American society, not because white people have represented a statistical majority of the population, but because of where power and resources have historically been concentrated. So, fear not white people, the \" Rise of the Colored Empires \" is not upon you. Whiteness still has the upper hand, and that will change only when more white people decide that racism is a morally corrupt injustice worthy of eradication.

Scott Applewhite) Remember the days after the 2012 election when it looked like Republicans would finally be persuaded, if only by self-interest, to support immigration reform? Brit Hume of Fox News blamed Mitt Romney's loss on his abysmal showing among Latinos and his \"hard-line position on immigration.\" Hume's colleague Sean Hannity came out in favor of a pathway to citizenship. \"Yes, amnesty,\" implored Charles Krauthammer. \"Use the word.\" That panicked counsel proved to be the high point of GOP minority-outreach efforts. In Congress, as immigration reform went from cheap talk to real legislation, the hard-liners circled the wagons, pressuring Speaker John Boehner into declaring the measure \"dead on arrival.\" Now Hannity is opposed to reform because he thinks \"it won't help the GOP in future elections,\" and Hume calls his own argument \"baloney,\" contending that the Latino vote is \"not nearly as important\" as the white vote. This is an example of what psychologists call \"adaptive preference formation,\" or as Aesop allegorized in \"The Fox and the Grapes \" : if you can't get something, convince yourself it wasn't very good in the first place. The most insidious of these arguments-because it comes wrapped in the cool logic of charts lacking explicit racial animus-belongs to Sean Trende, an analyst with Real Clear Politics, who composed an influential four-part series purporting to show that Republicans can survive and indeed thrive as a de facto whites-only party. Simply by finding the 6 million \"missing white voters\" who sat out 2012, Republicans can roll Democrats in presidential elections 2016 to 2044 (sorry, Hillary!)-even in a worst-case scenario in which 90 percent of all minorities vote Democratic. As Ruy Teixeira and Alan Abramowitz point out at Think Progress, there's a heavy dose of magical thinking in Trende's math, which assumes a boost in turnout exclusively among whites instead of the electorate as a whole. Even more magical is Trende's strategic advice to the GOP: court downscale, rural white voters by embracing the economic populism of Ross Perot, whose platform included higher taxes on the rich and universal healthcare. Good luck selling that to the Tea Party. For candor and a certain brute common sense, one must turn to Pat Buchanan, who starkly warns that the \"demographic winter of white America\" is nigh. His solution: \"no amnesty, secure the border, enforce laws against businesses that hire illegals [ sic ], and impose a moratorium on new immigration.\" And there you have a succinct blueprint for the construction of Fortress White America: evict as many brown people as legally possible; build a wall to keep out the rest.

For the past two decades, the GOP has waged a crusade to redraw the political map so as to maximize the number of white voters in Republican-leaning districts, while lumping as many minority voters as possible into Democratic-leaning ones. The siege mentality is baked into the very DNA of the party, and it creates a perverse incentive structure in which only white voters matter. This precision racial gerrymandering has been frighteningly effective. In 2012, Democratic House candidates won 1.4 million more votes than Republicans, who nonetheless control 54 percent of the seats in that chamber. Similarly, while many Southern states have been getting bluer (and browner), Republicans have locked down Southern state legislatures by wildly disproportionate margins. In North Carolina, for example, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 45 to 32 percent, and Mitt Romney squeaked out a two-point victory over Obama in 2012. Republicans, however, control the state Senate and House by almost 2-to-1 margins, their largest share ever. And what have North Carolina Republicans done with this historic, veto-proof supermajority ? They've cut unemployment benefits and Medicaid eligibility, gutted environmental regulations, and repealed the Earned Income Tax Credit and the 2009 Racial Justice Act, which allows death row prisoners to appeal their sentence if they can prove race was a factor in sentencing. If the GOP budget goes through, more programs will get the ax: early childhood education, pay for teachers and teachers' aides, campaign financing, water safety, even the state income tax, which will be replaced by a regressive sales tax. Polling has shown that the majority of North Carolinians reject these measures, but enough voters who support them live in the white districts, where the GOP has retrenched. It's a similar story in Texas, where a supermajority of Republicans has pushed through voter ID laws, rejected Medicaid expansion and cut school budgets. Yes, Texas State Senator Wendy Davis became famous for filibustering a bill that would in effect shut down the state's abortion clinics, but the bill eventually passed, and its author, State Representative Jodie Laubenberg, hasn't faced an opponent in the last three elections. Her district was drawn to be 67 percent white, a bleached electoral haven in a state that is majority-minority. One day, the ultimate victims of Republican efforts to build a whites-only party may be the Republicans. But for now, it is women, gays, minorities and poor people who are being royally screwed. As the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman reminded us, there is nothing more dangerous than a white man standing his ground in his own castle. George Zornick looks at the ugly, racist side of the immigration reform opposition.\n\nRemember the days after the 2012 election when it looked like Republicans would finally be persuaded, if only by self-interest, to support immigration reform?

Even more magical is Trende's strategic advice to the GOP: court downscale, rural white voters by embracing the economic populism of Ross Perot, whose platform included higher taxes on the rich and universal healthcare. Good luck selling that to the Tea Party. For candor and a certain brute common sense, one must turn to Pat Buchanan, who starkly warns that the \"demographic winter of white America\" is nigh. His solution: \"no amnesty, secure the border, enforce laws against businesses that hire illegals [ sic ], and impose a moratorium on new immigration.\" And there you have a succinct blueprint for the construction of Fortress White America: evict as many brown people as legally possible; build a wall to keep out the rest.

For the past two decades, the GOP has waged a crusade to redraw the political map so as to maximize the number of white voters in Republican-leaning districts, while lumping as many minority voters as possible into Democratic-leaning ones. The siege mentality is baked into the very DNA of the party, and it creates a perverse incentive structure in which only white voters matter. This precision racial gerrymandering has been frighteningly effective. In 2012, Democratic House candidates won 1.4 million more votes than Republicans, who nonetheless control 54 percent of the seats in that chamber. Similarly, while many Southern states have been getting bluer (and browner), Republicans have locked down Southern state legislatures by wildly disproportionate margins. In North Carolina, for example, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 45 to 32 percent, and Mitt Romney squeaked out a two-point victory over Obama in 2012. Republicans, however, control the state Senate and House by almost 2-to-1 margins, their largest share ever. And what have North Carolina Republicans done with this historic, veto-proof supermajority ? They've cut unemployment benefits and Medicaid eligibility, gutted environmental regulations, and repealed the Earned Income Tax Credit and the 2009 Racial Justice Act, which allows death row prisoners to appeal their sentence if they can prove race was a factor in sentencing. If the GOP budget goes through, more programs will get the ax: early childhood education, pay for teachers and teachers' aides, campaign financing, water safety, even the state income tax, which will be replaced by a regressive sales tax. Polling has shown that the majority of North Carolinians reject these measures, but enough voters who support them live in the white districts, where the GOP has retrenched. It's a similar story in Texas, where a supermajority of Republicans has pushed through voter ID laws, rejected Medicaid expansion and cut school budgets. Yes, Texas State Senator Wendy Davis became famous for filibustering a bill that would in effect shut down the state's abortion clinics, but the bill eventually passed, and its author, State Representative Jodie Laubenberg, hasn't faced an opponent in the last three elections. Her district was drawn to be 67 percent white, a bleached electoral haven in a state that is majority-minority. One day, the ultimate victims of Republican efforts to build a whites-only party may be the Republicans. But for now, it is women, gays, minorities and poor people who are being royally screwed. As the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman reminded us, there is nothing more dangerous than a white man standing his ground in his own castle. George Zornick looks at the ugly, racist side of the immigration reform opposition.\n\nThat panicked counsel proved to be the high point of GOP minority-outreach efforts. In Congress, as immigration reform went from cheap talk to real legislation, the hard-liners circled the wagons, pressuring Speaker John Boehner into declaring the measure \"dead on arrival.\" Now Hannity is opposed to reform because he thinks \"it won't help the GOP in future elections,\" and Hume calls his own argument \"baloney,\" contending that the Latino vote is \"not nearly as important\" as the white vote. This is an example of what psychologists call \"adaptive preference formation,\" or as Aesop allegorized in \"The Fox and the Grapes \" : if you can't get something, convince yourself it wasn't very good in the first place. The most insidious of these arguments-because it comes wrapped in the cool logic of charts lacking explicit racial animus-belongs to Sean Trende, an analyst with Real Clear Politics, who composed an influential four-part series purporting to show that Republicans can survive and indeed thrive as a de facto whites-only party. Simply by finding the 6 million \"missing white voters\" who sat out 2012, Republicans can roll Democrats in presidential elections 2016 to 2044 (sorry, Hillary!)-even in a worst-case scenario in which 90 percent of all minorities vote Democratic.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Most days, the answer is \"no.\" We live in an age when the ubiquity of white violence is plain for all to see, thanks to the camera phone. When I'm not covering white domestic threats directed at people of color, I'm often covering state-sponsored terrorism against those same targets. When I'm not covering agents of the state behaving violently, I'm covering appellate and Supreme Court rulings, many of which will lead to more violence against people of color, women, or the LGBTQ community. And the whole time, I'm asking if anybody will be held accountable for the killings or beatings or the permissiveness that enables those killings and beatings. Most days, the answer to my question is \"not today.\" Today will not be the day Kyle Rittenhouse is punished or Breonna Taylor's killers are held accountable or George Zimmerman goes to hell. That's tough to take. I ran out of patience in 2006 when the New York City Police Department shot Sean Bell 50 times the night before his wedding. It's no fun chronicling the drumbeat of white courts and white juries being permissive of white violence while white media repeats the narrative of white cops. Remember, I'm not a war correspondent. I'm afraid of violence and don't like to see human suffering up close. And I'm not a crime reporter. I've never been titillated by \"true crime\" whodunit mysteries or even been all that interested in wrongdoing. I don't really care why Jimmy hit Billy with the baseball bat, in the abstract. What I do care about is justice. I care about fairness. I ask for white people to be held accountable, because too often they are not. Nearly every statistic we have points to the manifest unfairness in our justice system. White people are less likely to be charged with crime, and more likely to receive lighter sentences when they are convicted. They receive more favorable media coverage. It is almost impossible to convict a cop for anything . These are not controversial points. They are backed up with mountains of statistical evidence. And yet, when I try to explain why we see these statistical disparities, when I try to draw the line between the known white bias in the system and the applied bias in an individual case, when I point out that racism is the self-evident reason for these obvious and statistically provable racial disparities, that is when white people, the very beneficiaries of this systemic injustice, get all up in their feelings and into my mentions. It's not enough that I have to write about these constant eruptions of white violence against people who look like me every day; I also have to contend with white people who loudly and proudly feign ignorance of the very cause of this violence. And it's always the same people, every day. Oh, they think they're different: This white man thinks he'd be totally on your side, normally; that white woman thinks she's tough and fair-minded but is just looking for more data; and that white guy totally loves The Lion King and agrees with you, usually. But not today. Today, this police killing or that legal ruling isn't really \"racist.\" Today, I go too far. Today tough, fair, agreeable ally-person thinks that there is no shadowy force orchestrating evil from behind the scenes.

This country was built on white supremacy-a Western slave empire that has never gone back and made restitution to the progeny of those it held in bondage. A war was fought in defense of American apartheid; amendments were written and then cast aside; untold thousands of humans have been lynched as a warning to those who would hold themselves out as equals; wealth has been bombed out of existence from the sky; drugs have been pushed; loans have been denied; and 400 years after people who look like me were first forcibly brought to these shores, I still can be executed on the street like a dog by a cop who mistakes my phone for a gun. But white people still walk this earth with the unmitigated gall to tell me what is and is not racist. How? It's the hubris that gets me most of the time. Do they realize how galactically out of touch they sound lecturing me about the good-faith intentions of white folks? I've been more knowledgeable about how racism works in this country than the average white person since I was 15. I've been more knowledgeable than the above-average white person since I was 20. At 43, there is not a \"race neutral\" argument that a white person can make to me that I haven't heard, and defeated, a hundred times before. A white person trying to explain racism to me-or to pretty much any Black person who has lived here long enough-sounds like a parakeet trying to explain astrophysics to Stephen Hawking. Everything they've thought about, I've already thought about. Everything they're saying is just the repetition of something I read in the original German. Or Confederate. Or Jeffersonian. Yet still they come. No matter how many white folks I lay out on Twitter, more show up the next day. No matter how many cops show themselves to be the vicious bastards they are, white people will show up to defend the next one. No matter how many Black people are lynched, white people will show up to defend the next lynch mob. There's no end; they never \"get it.\" Even if I convince one white person, one time, that one killing was probably racially motivated, that same person will use that one \"concession\" of theirs against me the next time. \"Well, Elie, I agreed with you that the white cop shouldn't have knelt on that man for almost 10 minutes, so we can see I'm reasonable. But that is why I can say with total confidence that this other cop did not shoot that man six times in the back because he was Black.\" I'm forced to conclude that most white people just don't get the core concept of systemic racism. It means that racism is part of the system, you see. It's happening all the time. It doesn't turn itself off just because you forgot to think about it that day. Hope that helps. E xplaining systemic racism to the people who benefit most from it frustrates many reporters, regardless of race, who cover the justice system in this country. But I'm one of the people who tries to cover it while Black. That means, invariably, some white person will accuse me of \"injecting\" race into the issue. Of projecting racism instead of merely noticing it. Of \"playing the race card.\" God, I can feel my nacho-clogged arteries ready to burst every time I hear that stupid phrase. The suggestion that my race, that any person's race, the very color of our skin, is something nobody else would notice if they didn't bring it up fills me with so much rage I can taste the bitter rush of adrenaline on my tongue. My color is the first thing people notice about me- when they see me. It's the first thing white children notice about me (\"You must be [my children's] dad.\") It's the first thing some of y'all's racist pets notice about me (don't think Black people can't tell when your dog barks at us and not the white person who just walked past). Playing a card suggests I could \"not\" play it if I didn't want to. But that's not how it works. It's not a \"card\"; it's just my face. But even if I could hide my face, even if I could make people think that I was white for a period of time, why would I? Why would I be embarrassed to be who I am? And why wouldn't I rely on my lived experience to help me explain the world? Why wouldn't I remember what has happened in the past to try to understand what's going to happen in the future? Memory, especially of things white people would rather I forget, is one of my strongest analytical tools. Memory is how I predicted that white people would try to let Kyle Rittenhouse get away with murder. It's how I surmised that the judge in his case, Bruce Schroeder, would be biased toward the young white gunman. I didn't need to know them; I needed only to remember everything I know about justice and white America, and then watch their individual actions. They told me everything I needed to know about them from their own mouths, in their own words. Rittenhouse filmed himself two weeks before the protests in Kenosha ideating about buying a gun and shooting looters. He then acquired a gun (illegally), drove across state lines, lied about his qualifications as an EMT, and killed two people. I know him now. Schroeder made a series of pretrial decisions to help Rittenhouse's case, then refused to make Rittenhouse comply with the terms of his bail. At trial, he's continued to make decisions that favor Rittenhouse, in addition to yelling at the prosecution, refusing to let them put forward their best case, and literally making the courtroom clap for Rittenhouse's expert witness, ostensibly because he was a veteran and it was Veterans Day. Schroeder told me everything I needed to know about him, even before his cell phone went off and played the Trump-rally theme song. I don't need to know what's in a person's heart. Frankly, I don't give a damn about their heart. I only care about what a person is going to do . And I have been studying what white people will do for my whole life. I've had to in order to stay alive. When I was 19, I was on the Red Line in Boston, heading back to school. The train was full, but I had a seat. A few people were standing. Everybody was white. At one stop, people in the row next to mine got up, and three new people got on and sat down. Skinheads. As soon as the train started moving, they started berating me. \"Get up, [n-word]... I said get up... Can't you see all these nice white people standing... Look at me when I'm talking to you [n-word].\" More from Mystal I Hope Everyone Is Prepared for Kyle Rittenhouse to Go Free Elie Mystal Joe Biden and the Age of Blaxhaustion Elie Mystal I was a teenager, and the only Black kid in the car. Nobody helped me. Nobody even went and got help. (Literally nobody familiar with Boston is surprised right now.) I got up at my stop and they got up with me, so I sat back down, I didn't want them to know where I lived. They sat back down too. I knew the next station had this crazy-steep escalator, and I didn't want to get off there because I was afraid they'd throw me off it and claim I'd \"slipped.\" The station after that I knew to be well-populated. I got off there, and so did they. But once they figured out I was making a bee-line for the ticket counter, they fell back. I never saw them again. I've told that story before in mixed company. Black people just nod or say, \"You were smart.\" But invariably a white person says, \"I would have helped you\" or \"I would have done something.\" No, most of you wouldn't have. Most white people would have been the same cowardly do-nothings as the rest of the white people in my train car that night. And the white folks I know who really would have helped me, I already know who they are. It's not even about politics: In fact, one of the people I'm sure would have had my back is a loud, obnoxious, conservative lawyer I fight with almost every day. See, I know white people. My survival depends on knowing white people, what they're capable of, and what they're not willing to do. By now, somebody will already be grabbing screen shots of this column to use out of context and accuse me of being \"the real racist.\" But the good-faith reader will note that I'm talking about how I understand people based on their words and deeds. Assuming that all white people are \"the same\" would get me killed. If I am to survive, I have to be able to make judgments about each individual white person's capabilities to kill me or harm me or help me, quickly and accurately, based on as much information as I can gather. I must be able to distinguish between the white guy who is coming at me because he hates something he heard me say on television from the white guy who is coming at me because he likes something he heard me say on television. I don't hate white people-I don't have the luxury of making a blanket, sweeping determination like that. I'm just a guy who can spot the white people who hate me coming a mile away. Two miles, if I'm paying attention. I know what Kyle Rittenhouse is capable of. I know what Bruce Schroeder is capable of. I knew what those skinheads were capable of. I know what Thomas Jefferson was capable of. I know white people. And if more of them would shut up long enough to listen, they might one day know about themselves, too.\n\nMost days, the answer to my question is \"not today.\" Today will not be the day Kyle Rittenhouse is punished or Breonna Taylor's killers are held accountable or George Zimmerman goes to hell. That's tough to take. I ran out of patience in 2006 when the New York City Police Department shot Sean Bell 50 times the night before his wedding. It's no fun chronicling the drumbeat of white courts and white juries being permissive of white violence while white media repeats the narrative of white cops. Remember, I'm not a war correspondent. I'm afraid of violence and don't like to see human suffering up close. And I'm not a crime reporter. I've never been titillated by \"true crime\" whodunit mysteries or even been all that interested in wrongdoing. I don't really care why Jimmy hit Billy with the baseball bat, in the abstract. What I do care about is justice. I care about fairness. I ask for white people to be held accountable, because too often they are not.

It's the first thing white children notice about me (\"You must be [my children's] dad.\") It's the first thing some of y'all's racist pets notice about me (don't think Black people can't tell when your dog barks at us and not the white person who just walked past). Playing a card suggests I could \"not\" play it if I didn't want to. But that's not how it works. It's not a \"card\"; it's just my face. But even if I could hide my face, even if I could make people think that I was white for a period of time, why would I? Why would I be embarrassed to be who I am? And why wouldn't I rely on my lived experience to help me explain the world? Why wouldn't I remember what has happened in the past to try to understand what's going to happen in the future? Memory, especially of things white people would rather I forget, is one of my strongest analytical tools. Memory is how I predicted that white people would try to let Kyle Rittenhouse get away with murder. It's how I surmised that the judge in his case, Bruce Schroeder, would be biased toward the young white gunman. I didn't need to know them; I needed only to remember everything I know about justice and white America, and then watch their individual actions. They told me everything I needed to know about them from their own mouths, in their own words. Rittenhouse filmed himself two weeks before the protests in Kenosha ideating about buying a gun and shooting looters. He then acquired a gun (illegally), drove across state lines, lied about his qualifications as an EMT, and killed two people. I know him now. Schroeder made a series of pretrial decisions to help Rittenhouse's case, then refused to make Rittenhouse comply with the terms of his bail. At trial, he's continued to make decisions that favor Rittenhouse, in addition to yelling at the prosecution, refusing to let them put forward their best case, and literally making the courtroom clap for Rittenhouse's expert witness, ostensibly because he was a veteran and it was Veterans Day. Schroeder told me everything I needed to know about him, even before his cell phone went off and played the Trump-rally theme song. I don't need to know what's in a person's heart. Frankly, I don't give a damn about their heart. I only care about what a person is going to do . And I have been studying what white people will do for my whole life. I've had to in order to stay alive. When I was 19, I was on the Red Line in Boston, heading back to school. The train was full, but I had a seat. A few people were standing. Everybody was white. At one stop, people in the row next to mine got up, and three new people got on and sat down. Skinheads. As soon as the train started moving, they started berating me. \"Get up, [n-word]... I said get up... Can't you see all these nice white people standing... Look at me when I'm talking to you [n-word].\" More from Mystal I Hope Everyone Is Prepared for Kyle Rittenhouse to Go Free Elie Mystal Joe Biden and the Age of Blaxhaustion Elie Mystal I was a teenager, and the only Black kid in the car. Nobody helped me. Nobody even went and got help. (Literally nobody familiar with Boston is surprised right now.) I got up at my stop and they got up with me, so I sat back down, I didn't want them to know where I lived. They sat back down too. I knew the next station had this crazy-steep escalator, and I didn't want to get off there because I was afraid they'd throw me off it and claim I'd \"slipped.\" The station after that I knew to be well-populated. I got off there, and so did they. But once they figured out I was making a bee-line for the ticket counter, they fell back. I never saw them again. I've told that story before in mixed company. Black people just nod or say, \"You were smart.\" But invariably a white person says, \"I would have helped you\" or \"I would have done something.\" No, most of you wouldn't have. Most white people would have been the same cowardly do-nothings as the rest of the white people in my train car that night. And the white folks I know who really would have helped me, I already know who they are. It's not even about politics: In fact, one of the people I'm sure would have had my back is a loud, obnoxious, conservative lawyer I fight with almost every day. See, I know white people. My survival depends on knowing white people, what they're capable of, and what they're not willing to do. By now, somebody will already be grabbing screen shots of this column to use out of context and accuse me of being \"the real racist.\" But the good-faith reader will note that I'm talking about how I understand people based on their words and deeds. Assuming that all white people are \"the same\" would get me killed. If I am to survive, I have to be able to make judgments about each individual white person's capabilities to kill me or harm me or help me, quickly and accurately, based on as much information as I can gather. I must be able to distinguish between the white guy who is coming at me because he hates something he heard me say on television from the white guy who is coming at me because he likes something he heard me say on television. I don't hate white people-I don't have the luxury of making a blanket, sweeping determination like that. I'm just a guy who can spot the white people who hate me coming a mile away. Two miles, if I'm paying attention. I know what Kyle Rittenhouse is capable of. I know what Bruce Schroeder is capable of. I knew what those skinheads were capable of. I know what Thomas Jefferson was capable of. I know white people. And if more of them would shut up long enough to listen, they might one day know about themselves, too.\n\nThese are not controversial points. They are backed up with mountains of statistical evidence. And yet, when I try to explain why we see these statistical disparities, when I try to draw the line between the known white bias in the system and the applied bias in an individual case, when I point out that racism is the self-evident reason for these obvious and statistically provable racial disparities, that is when white people, the very beneficiaries of this systemic injustice, get all up in their feelings and into my mentions. It's not enough that I have to write about these constant eruptions of white violence against people who look like me every day; I also have to contend with white people who loudly and proudly feign ignorance of the very cause of this violence. And it's always the same people, every day. Oh, they think they're different: This white man thinks he'd be totally on your side, normally; that white woman thinks she's tough and fair-minded but is just looking for more data; and that white guy totally loves The Lion King and agrees with you, usually. But not today. Today, this police killing or that legal ruling isn't really \"racist.\" Today, I go too far. Today tough, fair, agreeable ally-person thinks that there is no shadowy force orchestrating evil from behind the scenes. Today, Mufasa just threw his own damn self off the cliff and should have been more careful. After all, if everything is \"racist,\" nothing is, amiright?

I wonder sometimes how these people stop themselves from walking into traffic, given their determination to walk around without seeing things. The shapes some white people will twist themselves into in order to justify white violence falls into the uncanny valley. Their justifications are grotesque. Current Issue View our current issue And embarrassing. By Zeus, are their arguments embarrassing. This country was built on white supremacy-a Western slave empire that has never gone back and made restitution to the progeny of those it held in bondage. A war was fought in defense of American apartheid; amendments were written and then cast aside; untold thousands of humans have been lynched as a warning to those who would hold themselves out as equals; wealth has been bombed out of existence from the sky; drugs have been pushed; loans have been denied; and 400 years after people who look like me were first forcibly brought to these shores, I still can be executed on the street like a dog by a cop who mistakes my phone for a gun. But white people still walk this earth with the unmitigated gall to tell me what is and is not racist. How? It's the hubris that gets me most of the time. Do they realize how galactically out of touch they sound lecturing me about the good-faith intentions of white folks? I've been more knowledgeable about how racism works in this country than the average white person since I was 15. I've been more knowledgeable than the above-average white person since I was 20. At 43, there is not a \"race neutral\" argument that a white person can make to me that I haven't heard, and defeated, a hundred times before. A white person trying to explain racism to me-or to pretty much any Black person who has lived here long enough-sounds like a parakeet trying to explain astrophysics to Stephen Hawking. Everything they've thought about, I've already thought about. Everything they're saying is just the repetition of something I read in the original German. Or Confederate. Or Jeffersonian. Yet still they come. No matter how many white folks I lay out on Twitter, more show up the next day. No matter how many cops show themselves to be the vicious bastards they are, white people will show up to defend the next one. No matter how many Black people are lynched, white people will show up to defend the next lynch mob. There's no end; they never \"get it.\" Even if I convince one white person, one time, that one killing was probably racially motivated, that same person will use that one \"concession\" of theirs against me the next time. \"Well, Elie, I agreed with you that the white cop shouldn't have knelt on that man for almost 10 minutes, so we can see I'm reasonable. But that is why I can say with total confidence that this other cop did not shoot that man six times in the back because he was Black.\" I'm forced to conclude that most white people just don't get the core concept of systemic racism. It means that racism is part of the system, you see. It's happening all the time. It doesn't turn itself off just because you forgot to think about it that day. Hope that helps. E xplaining systemic racism to the people who benefit most from it frustrates many reporters, regardless of race, who cover the justice system in this country. But I'm one of the people who tries to cover it while Black. That means, invariably, some white person will accuse me of \"injecting\" race into the issue. Of projecting racism instead of merely noticing it. Of \"playing the race card.\" God, I can feel my nacho-clogged arteries ready to burst every time I hear that stupid phrase. The suggestion that my race, that any person's race, the very color of our skin, is something nobody else would notice if they didn't bring it up fills me with so much rage I can taste the bitter rush of adrenaline on my tongue.

There's no end; they never \"get it.\" Even if I convince one white person, one time, that one killing was probably racially motivated, that same person will use that one \"concession\" of theirs against me the next time. \"Well, Elie, I agreed with you that the white cop shouldn't have knelt on that man for almost 10 minutes, so we can see I'm reasonable. But that is why I can say with total confidence that this other cop did not shoot that man six times in the back because he was Black.\" I'm forced to conclude that most white people just don't get the core concept of systemic racism. It means that racism is part of the system, you see. It's happening all the time. It doesn't turn itself off just because you forgot to think about it that day. Hope that helps. E xplaining systemic racism to the people who benefit most from it frustrates many reporters, regardless of race, who cover the justice system in this country. But I'm one of the people who tries to cover it while Black. That means, invariably, some white person will accuse me of \"injecting\" race into the issue. Of projecting racism instead of merely noticing it. Of \"playing the race card.\" God, I can feel my nacho-clogged arteries ready to burst every time I hear that stupid phrase. The suggestion that my race, that any person's race, the very color of our skin, is something nobody else would notice if they didn't bring it up fills me with so much rage I can taste the bitter rush of adrenaline on my tongue. My color is the first thing people notice about me- when they see me. It's the first thing white children notice about me (\"You must be [my children's] dad.\") It's the first thing some of y'all's racist pets notice about me (don't think Black people can't tell when your dog barks at us and not the white person who just walked past). Playing a card suggests I could \"not\" play it if I didn't want to. But that's not how it works. It's not a \"card\"; it's just my face. But even if I could hide my face, even if I could make people think that I was white for a period of time, why would I? Why would I be embarrassed to be who I am? And why wouldn't I rely on my lived experience to help me explain the world? Why wouldn't I remember what has happened in the past to try to understand what's going to happen in the future? Memory, especially of things white people would rather I forget, is one of my strongest analytical tools. Memory is how I predicted that white people would try to let Kyle Rittenhouse get away with murder. It's how I surmised that the judge in his case, Bruce Schroeder, would be biased toward the young white gunman. I didn't need to know them; I needed only to remember everything I know about justice and white America, and then watch their individual actions. They told me everything I needed to know about them from their own mouths, in their own words. Rittenhouse filmed himself two weeks before the protests in Kenosha ideating about buying a gun and shooting looters. He then acquired a gun (illegally), drove across state lines, lied about his qualifications as an EMT, and killed two people. I know him now. Schroeder made a series of pretrial decisions to help Rittenhouse's case, then refused to make Rittenhouse comply with the terms of his bail. At trial, he's continued to make decisions that favor Rittenhouse, in addition to yelling at the prosecution, refusing to let them put forward their best case, and literally making the courtroom clap for Rittenhouse's expert witness, ostensibly because he was a veteran and it was Veterans Day. Schroeder told me everything I needed to know about him, even before his cell phone went off and played the Trump-rally theme song. I don't need to know what's in a person's heart. Frankly, I don't give a damn about their heart. I only care about what a person is going to do . And I have been studying what white people will do for my whole life. I've had to in order to stay alive. When I was 19, I was on the Red Line in Boston, heading back to school. The train was full, but I had a seat. A few people were standing. Everybody was white. At one stop, people in the row next to mine got up, and three new people got on and sat down. Skinheads. As soon as the train started moving, they started berating me. \"Get up, [n-word]... I said get up... Can't you see all these nice white people standing... Look at me when I'm talking to you [n-word].\" More from Mystal I Hope Everyone Is Prepared for Kyle Rittenhouse to Go Free Elie Mystal Joe Biden and the Age of Blaxhaustion Elie Mystal I was a teenager, and the only Black kid in the car. Nobody helped me. Nobody even went and got help. (Literally nobody familiar with Boston is surprised right now.) I got up at my stop and they got up with me, so I sat back down, I didn't want them to know where I lived. They sat back down too. I knew the next station had this crazy-steep escalator, and I didn't want to get off there because I was afraid they'd throw me off it and claim I'd \"slipped.\" The station after that I knew to be well-populated. I got off there, and so did they. But once they figured out I was making a bee-line for the ticket counter, they fell back. I never saw them again. I've told that story before in mixed company. Black people just nod or say, \"You were smart.\" But invariably a white person says, \"I would have helped you\" or \"I would have done something.\" No, most of you wouldn't have. Most white people would have been the same cowardly do-nothings as the rest of the white people in my train car that night. And the white folks I know who really would have helped me, I already know who they are. It's not even about politics: In fact, one of the people I'm sure would have had my back is a loud, obnoxious, conservative lawyer I fight with almost every day. See, I know white people. My survival depends on knowing white people, what they're capable of, and what they're not willing to do. By now, somebody will already be grabbing screen shots of this column to use out of context and accuse me of being \"the real racist.\" But the good-faith reader will note that I'm talking about how I understand people based on their words and deeds. Assuming that all white people are \"the same\" would get me killed. If I am to survive, I have to be able to make judgments about each individual white person's capabilities to kill me or harm me or help me, quickly and accurately, based on as much information as I can gather. I must be able to distinguish between the white guy who is coming at me because he hates something he heard me say on television from the white guy who is coming at me because he likes something he heard me say on television. I don't hate white people-I don't have the luxury of making a blanket, sweeping determination like that. I'm just a guy who can spot the white people who hate me coming a mile away. Two miles, if I'm paying attention. I know what Kyle Rittenhouse is capable of. I know what Bruce Schroeder is capable of. I knew what those skinheads were capable of. I know what Thomas Jefferson was capable of. I know white people. And if more of them would shut up long enough to listen, they might one day know about themselves, too.\n\nI wonder sometimes how these people stop themselves from walking into traffic, given their determination to walk around without seeing things. The shapes some white people will twist themselves into in order to justify white violence falls into the uncanny valley. Their justifications are grotesque. Current Issue View our current issue And embarrassing. By Zeus, are their arguments embarrassing. This country was built on white supremacy-a Western slave empire that has never gone back and made restitution to the progeny of those it held in bondage. A war was fought in defense of American apartheid; amendments were written and then cast aside; untold thousands of humans have been lynched as a warning to those who would hold themselves out as equals; wealth has been bombed out of existence from the sky; drugs have been pushed; loans have been denied; and 400 years after people who look like me were first forcibly brought to these shores, I still can be executed on the street like a dog by a cop who mistakes my phone for a gun. But white people still walk this earth with the unmitigated gall to tell me what is and is not racist. How? It's the hubris that gets me most of the time. Do they realize how galactically out of touch they sound lecturing me about the good-faith intentions of white folks? I've been more knowledgeable about how racism works in this country than the average white person since I was 15. I've been more knowledgeable than the above-average white person since I was 20. At 43, there is not a \"race neutral\" argument that a white person can make to me that I haven't heard, and defeated, a hundred times before. A white person trying to explain racism to me-or to pretty much any Black person who has lived here long enough-sounds like a parakeet trying to explain astrophysics to Stephen Hawking. Everything they've thought about, I've already thought about. Everything they're saying is just the repetition of something I read in the original German. Or Confederate. Or Jeffersonian.

By now, somebody will already be grabbing screen shots of this column to use out of context and accuse me of being \"the real racist.\" But the good-faith reader will note that I'm talking about how I understand people based on their words and deeds. Assuming that all white people are \"the same\" would get me killed. If I am to survive, I have to be able to make judgments about each individual white person's capabilities to kill me or harm me or help me, quickly and accurately, based on as much information as I can gather. I must be able to distinguish between the white guy who is coming at me because he hates something he heard me say on television from the white guy who is coming at me because he likes something he heard me say on television. I don't hate white people-I don't have the luxury of making a blanket, sweeping determination like that. I'm just a guy who can spot the white people who hate me coming a mile away. Two miles, if I'm paying attention. I know what Kyle Rittenhouse is capable of. I know what Bruce Schroeder is capable of. I knew what those skinheads were capable of. I know what Thomas Jefferson was capable of. I know white people. And if more of them would shut up long enough to listen, they might one day know about themselves, too.\n\nYet still they come. No matter how many white folks I lay out on Twitter, more show up the next day. No matter how many cops show themselves to be the vicious bastards they are, white people will show up to defend the next one. No matter how many Black people are lynched, white people will show up to defend the next lynch mob. There's no end; they never \"get it.\" Even if I convince one white person, one time, that one killing was probably racially motivated, that same person will use that one \"concession\" of theirs against me the next time. \"Well, Elie, I agreed with you that the white cop shouldn't have knelt on that man for almost 10 minutes, so we can see I'm reasonable. But that is why I can say with total confidence that this other cop did not shoot that man six times in the back because he was Black.\" I'm forced to conclude that most white people just don't get the core concept of systemic racism. It means that racism is part of the system, you see. It's happening all the time. It doesn't turn itself off just because you forgot to think about it that day. Hope that helps. E xplaining systemic racism to the people who benefit most from it frustrates many reporters, regardless of race, who cover the justice system in this country. But I'm one of the people who tries to cover it while Black. That means, invariably, some white person will accuse me of \"injecting\" race into the issue. Of projecting racism instead of merely noticing it. Of \"playing the race card.\" God, I can feel my nacho-clogged arteries ready to burst every time I hear that stupid phrase. The suggestion that my race, that any person's race, the very color of our skin, is something nobody else would notice if they didn't bring it up fills me with so much rage I can taste the bitter rush of adrenaline on my tongue. My color is the first thing people notice about me- when they see me. It's the first thing white children notice about me (\"You must be [my children's] dad.\") It's the first thing some of y'all's racist pets notice about me (don't think Black people can't tell when your dog barks at us and not the white person who just walked past). Playing a card suggests I could \"not\" play it if I didn't want to. But that's not how it works. It's not a \"card\"; it's just my face. But even if I could hide my face, even if I could make people think that I was white for a period of time, why would I? Why would I be embarrassed to be who I am? And why wouldn't I rely on my lived experience to help me explain the world? Why wouldn't I remember what has happened in the past to try to understand what's going to happen in the future? Memory, especially of things white people would rather I forget, is one of my strongest analytical tools. Memory is how I predicted that white people would try to let Kyle Rittenhouse get away with murder. It's how I surmised that the judge in his case, Bruce Schroeder, would be biased toward the young white gunman. I didn't need to know them; I needed only to remember everything I know about justice and white America, and then watch their individual actions. They told me everything I needed to know about them from their own mouths, in their own words. Rittenhouse filmed himself two weeks before the protests in Kenosha ideating about buying a gun and shooting looters. He then acquired a gun (illegally), drove across state lines, lied about his qualifications as an EMT, and killed two people. I know him now. Schroeder made a series of pretrial decisions to help Rittenhouse's case, then refused to make Rittenhouse comply with the terms of his bail. At trial, he's continued to make decisions that favor Rittenhouse, in addition to yelling at the prosecution, refusing to let them put forward their best case, and literally making the courtroom clap for Rittenhouse's expert witness, ostensibly because he was a veteran and it was Veterans Day. Schroeder told me everything I needed to know about him, even before his cell phone went off and played the Trump-rally theme song. I don't need to know what's in a person's heart. Frankly, I don't give a damn about their heart. I only care about what a person is going to do . And I have been studying what white people will do for my whole life. I've had to in order to stay alive. When I was 19, I was on the Red Line in Boston, heading back to school. The train was full, but I had a seat. A few people were standing. Everybody was white. At one stop, people in the row next to mine got up, and three new people got on and sat down. Skinheads. As soon as the train started moving, they started berating me. \"Get up, [n-word]... I said get up... Can't you see all these nice white people standing... Look at me when I'm talking to you [n-word].\" More from Mystal I Hope Everyone Is Prepared for Kyle Rittenhouse to Go Free Elie Mystal Joe Biden and the Age of Blaxhaustion Elie Mystal I was a teenager, and the only Black kid in the car. Nobody helped me. Nobody even went and got help. (Literally nobody familiar with Boston is surprised right now.) I got up at my stop and they got up with me, so I sat back down, I didn't want them to know where I lived. They sat back down too. I knew the next station had this crazy-steep escalator, and I didn't want to get off there because I was afraid they'd throw me off it and claim I'd \"slipped.\" The station after that I knew to be well-populated. I got off there, and so did they. But once they figured out I was making a bee-line for the ticket counter, they fell back. I never saw them again. I've told that story before in mixed company. Black people just nod or say, \"You were smart.\" But invariably a white person says, \"I would have helped you\" or \"I would have done something.\" No, most of you wouldn't have. Most white people would have been the same cowardly do-nothings as the rest of the white people in my train car that night. And the white folks I know who really would have helped me, I already know who they are.

At one stop, people in the row next to mine got up, and three new people got on and sat down. Skinheads. As soon as the train started moving, they started berating me. \"Get up, [n-word]...

I got up at my stop and they got up with me, so I sat back down, I didn't want them to know where I lived. They sat back down too. I knew the next station had this crazy-steep escalator, and I didn't want to get off there because I was afraid they'd throw me off it and claim I'd \"slipped.\" The station after that I knew to be well-populated. I got off there, and so did they. But once they figured out I was making a bee-line for the ticket counter, they fell back. I never saw them again. I've told that story before in mixed company. Black people just nod or say, \"You were smart.\" But invariably a white person says, \"I would have helped you\" or \"I would have done something.\" No, most of you wouldn't have. Most white people would have been the same cowardly do-nothings as the rest of the white people in my train car that night. And the white folks I know who really would have helped me, I already know who they are.

If I am to survive, I have to be able to make judgments about each individual white person's capabilities to kill me or harm me or help me, quickly and accurately, based on as much information as I can gather. I must be able to distinguish between the white guy who is coming at me because he hates something he heard me say on television from the white guy who is coming at me because he likes something he heard me say on television. I don't hate white people-I don't have the luxury of making a blanket, sweeping determination like that. I'm just a guy who can spot the white people who hate me coming a mile away. Two miles, if I'm paying attention. I know what Kyle Rittenhouse is capable of. I know what Bruce Schroeder is capable of. I knew what those skinheads were capable of. I know what Thomas Jefferson was capable of. I know white people.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The new knowledge promised to transform the pain into something more useful. But what? All anyone knew is that the need for remedy was strong. Roughly 1,000 of us, more brown and foreign-born than normal for this town, were expressing our collective sorrow, candles in our hands and hurt in our eyes, on the green, grand yard outside Hollywood Station on Saturday, May 27. We mostly stood a strong stone's throw from where a worst-case scenario white male, Jeremy Joseph Christian, had stabbed three differently iconic American white males the day before. Christian killed a 53-year-old veteran, Ricky Best, and a crunchy Ashland scholar, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23; he also severely wounded 21-year-old Micah David-Cole Fletcher. All of this for the crime of defending two young, nonwhite women-including one who wore a hijab-from Christian's torrent of hate. They defended their fellow Oregonians on the car of a Tri-Met light rail train. This story was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, a journalism nonprofit. Portland is arguably the most transit-friendly town in the West, and the Tri-Met attracts all manner of resident, car culture be damned. The low-wage workers who serve up the city for Portland's demographic desirables share space on the same train with early adopters, and we all commiserate in huddling from the rain. On the Tri-Met's rails, the whitest big city in the United States is briefly peppered a darker shade of pale. This freely mingled ridership distilled a profound cross section into the vigil: the bantam-like black basketball coach in a backpack, the horrified white grandma from Beaverton. Sitting in the center, amid a tableau of tears and flowers, were Fletcher's mother and a couple of brown women wearing hijabs. White Oregonians all about them were finally grasping the problem-a knot that could not be undone by the \"Black Lives Matter\" signs looking out from neighborhood windows and lawns. They were owning their reality, and to watch the ownership play out on this lawn provided a vaguely pornographic pain. The mourning swelled, and just when it felt the wave would peak, we learned they were coming. A blond member of Namkai-Meche 's family had been weeping to the very edge of complete breakdown when another vigil attendee announced on a microphone the forthcoming racist infusion: \"A Patriot Prayer Portland Trump Rally,\" she read from her phone. Much like a recent alt-right getdown in enlightened Berkeley, the event scheduled for the next Sunday, June 4, was billed as a celebration of \"free speech.\" The line-up promised appearances by the Northwest 's biggest names in white supremacy. \" Thor Odinson ,\" the so-called mystical racist, and \" Based Stickman ,\" a heavy on the Berkeley protest battle scene, were both expected. Tim \"Baked Alaska\" Gionet, a libertarian-turned-far-right troll and Milo Yiannopoulos sidekick, was set to speak.

Though progressive transplants from California and the East have cemented Portland's liberal identity, Oregonians walk among us whose parents were Ku Klux Klan members. Speaker upon speaker addressed the need to address the meaning of our state's uniquely racist past in their lives. As they spoke, the mother of Namkai-Meche held out a photo of her bearded, glee-filled son. A murmur circulated around the crowd of Namkai-Meche's reported last words: Tell everyone on the train I love them. It was at this moment that the mourners, this newly reconstituted \"we,\" suddenly browned to its soul, went full-and-final solidarity. \"People of color?\" the white folks said again and again, \"We have your back!\" This made a lot of white people applaud. Nodding and the whole nine. A significant number of PoC's put their hands together, too. But every time one of these Portland people said they had my back I thought, Really? What does that look like? P eople don't talk enough about the Northwest Imperative. Decades before Portlandia popularized the image of a progressive white utopia, white-nationalist groups set their sights on the region. In the 1980s, racists were encouraged to move to a five-state region in the upper left-hand corner of America, for the purpose of forming an Aryan Homeland. With its long history of black-exclusion laws, de facto slavery, and freely cavorting Klansman, Oregon has long been viewed as a white-power vector. Lately, that past has been leaking back into the present. There's been a groundswell of race warring in the Northwest neck of the woods, blowing rangily from the long, hot squall of last year's election. There was a racially motivated stabbing in Olympia, Washington, last August and, a month later, a murder in Portland's poor neighbor, Gresham; there, a white couple mowed down a black teenager outside a 7-Eleven because of his skin color. Swastikas and Nazi stickers began popping up on walls. And though we didn't know it at the time, another enraged white man would in the days after the vigil pummel a TriMet driver, screaming for his free-speech rights . It felt like winter was coming, in June. As I gamed the risks associated with the influx, I figured public transit wouldn't be my problem. Nobody tries me on the train. Although 51, I am a 200-pound black guy with dreadlocks who's in halfway decent shape. It's hard to imagine that the average Portland racist would want a problem with someone like me in a confined space, not when there are so many elderly, infirm, and developing women to target. On the open street, though? The ones I walk all of the time? In the weeks and months after Hillary Clinton conceded, white men repeatedly got in my face. And in some of my friends' faces. What's more, in rural Oregon, a super-specific anti-black-or is it pro-white?-aggression has been real enough to register as heat on my face: The big guy in Bend who looked at me with a ferocity unlike anything I've previously seen or felt, the coastal-town government official who shot something similar my way-less murderous, differently disconcerting-and then went on to ratfuck my reporting. Current Issue View our current issue During that vigil, it felt inappropriate to ask. But eight days later, I walked downtown to see whether these Trump chauvinists were capable of pulling a downtown crowd in broad daylight. Nagging me along the way remained the question, What would Portland having my back look like? B ecause staying prepped-to-fight drunk racists in the street is now part of my life-job description, the pre-rally plan on June 4 had been to hit the gym, one block away from the site of the 2 pm protest. But a sign taped to its door on that Sunday morning alerted customers that my 24-7 fitness joint was being closed \"for safety reasons.\" Looking away, I got that: A few red \"Make America Great Again\" caps bobbed into view. Few shops were open and I had time to kill, so I made my way to a certainty: McDonald's. I approached, walking with my hands on my hips, frustrated from workout denial. A white guy in whitewashed Washington Redskins gear at the Mickey D's doorway made eye contact. His outfit struck me as a white-genocide dog whistle, à la 88, the secret skinhead code for \"Heil Hitler\" (the first letter in both words, \"H,\" being the eighth letter of the alphabet). The skin sorta wiggled, perhaps surprised to see someone like me out in chilly racial weather like this. A young black cat lined up for bad food found my eyes the moment I passed through the doors of McDonald's. Dude's eyes widened with alertness, which turned to panic. What is he doing here? And his panic brought out the panic in me. What is he doing here? Suddenly, the man gave up his place in line and rushed out past me. It's fully possible that he forgot to bring his wallet, or felt that a critical mass for Negritude in this Portland spot on this Portland day might have been exceeded with my arrival. My gut, though, said he was out there comparing notes with the 'skins fan, and might get me. Chewing on fries in the corner, I pondered how weirdly off white the alt-right sampling in Oregon has been. Joey Gibson, the pro-Trump rally organizer , is nobody's idea of a WASP. Hillsboro's Raul Gonzalez wears SS bars on a flight jacket. The aforementioned \"Baked Alaska\" was, for what it's worth, once a rapper. Halfway through my 2-for-1 special, an antifa friend texted that he'd just been harassed by one of America's Next Top Racists, one of the big names in Northwest white supremacy, and requested my backing. I tossed the dregs and left the restaurant. My mantra involved preparing as though getting called a nigger might not be the most negative thing that might happen this afternoon. E ven before the scheduled 2 pm start of the pro-Trump rally, crowds had flooded three parks. Profanities, antagonizing signs, and decibels flew in all directions. Local legend of white supremacy \"Thor Odinson\" loudly blasted his motorcycle around Chapman Square, doing his best MAGA threat display for the antifascists gathering nearby. The alt-right and Portland antifa had a hangover beef from a recent brawl, instigated by \"out-of-town elements,\" according to a spokesman for Portland's mayor. The increasingly active \"antifa\" movement has a long tradition of confronting thuggery-or, as a New York antifa group described it, of \"revulsion at racists, sexists, homophobes, anti-Semites, and Islamophobes, with the international anti-fascist culture of taking the streets and physically confronting the brownshirts of white supremacy, whoever they may be.\" Weaving between the two parks and City Hall, I saw that the counter-protesters numbered in the thousands. Two hundred people ended up rallying for Trump-flying the Confederate flag, calling Black Lives Matter racist-in the park to the southeast of City Hall. Portland's mayor had unsuccessfully tried to halt it. Instead, Portland officials hosted a huge, sanctioned event that spilled out into the street and was gently ringed by cops.

Before I left the City Hall rally opposition line I'd run into Malcolm, a colleague and friend and one of a very small number of black males on hand who could fail the \"Brown Paper Bag Test\" (a distinctly American complexion-based valuation). Malcolm said something that brought me back to white people watching out for me, and I thought about the brave martyrs from Hollywood Station. \"I support these white people in their struggle,\" he told me. \"It's not my cousins out there doing this stuff. I support their efforts to talk to their cousins.\" A white dude in front of us-50-something, bearded-heard what Malcolm said and jerked around. He put out his hand for a high five and said, \"That's why I'm here!\" He was getting fortified for the fight. And maybe that's as effective as this \"having my back\" deal is going to get.

In this racial market, where the wack white people just keep coming, where the alt-right violence seems to spread and take new forms -I'll take it.\n\nRoughly 1,000 of us, more brown and foreign-born than normal for this town, were expressing our collective sorrow, candles in our hands and hurt in our eyes, on the green, grand yard outside Hollywood Station on Saturday, May 27. We mostly stood a strong stone's throw from where a worst-case scenario white male, Jeremy Joseph Christian, had stabbed three differently iconic American white males the day before. Christian killed a 53-year-old veteran, Ricky Best, and a crunchy Ashland scholar, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23; he also severely wounded 21-year-old Micah David-Cole Fletcher. All of this for the crime of defending two young, nonwhite women-including one who wore a hijab-from Christian's torrent of hate. They defended their fellow Oregonians on the car of a Tri-Met light rail train. This story was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, a journalism nonprofit. Portland is arguably the most transit-friendly town in the West, and the Tri-Met attracts all manner of resident, car culture be damned. The low-wage workers who serve up the city for Portland's demographic desirables share space on the same train with early adopters, and we all commiserate in huddling from the rain. On the Tri-Met's rails, the whitest big city in the United States is briefly peppered a darker shade of pale. This freely mingled ridership distilled a profound cross section into the vigil: the bantam-like black basketball coach in a backpack, the horrified white grandma from Beaverton. Sitting in the center, amid a tableau of tears and flowers, were Fletcher's mother and a couple of brown women wearing hijabs. White Oregonians all about them were finally grasping the problem-a knot that could not be undone by the \"Black Lives Matter\" signs looking out from neighborhood windows and lawns. They were owning their reality, and to watch the ownership play out on this lawn provided a vaguely pornographic pain. The mourning swelled, and just when it felt the wave would peak, we learned they were coming. A blond member of Namkai-Meche 's family had been weeping to the very edge of complete breakdown when another vigil attendee announced on a microphone the forthcoming racist infusion: \"A Patriot Prayer Portland Trump Rally,\" she read from her phone. Much like a recent alt-right getdown in enlightened Berkeley, the event scheduled for the next Sunday, June 4, was billed as a celebration of \"free speech.\" The line-up promised appearances by the Northwest 's biggest names in white supremacy. \" Thor Odinson ,\" the so-called mystical racist, and \" Based Stickman ,\" a heavy on the Berkeley protest battle scene, were both expected. Tim \"Baked Alaska\" Gionet, a libertarian-turned-far-right troll and Milo Yiannopoulos sidekick, was set to speak.

Though progressive transplants from California and the East have cemented Portland's liberal identity, Oregonians walk among us whose parents were Ku Klux Klan members. Speaker upon speaker addressed the need to address the meaning of our state's uniquely racist past in their lives. As they spoke, the mother of Namkai-Meche held out a photo of her bearded, glee-filled son. A murmur circulated around the crowd of Namkai-Meche's reported last words: Tell everyone on the train I love them. It was at this moment that the mourners, this newly reconstituted \"we,\" suddenly browned to its soul, went full-and-final solidarity. \"People of color?\" the white folks said again and again, \"We have your back!\" This made a lot of white people applaud. Nodding and the whole nine. A significant number of PoC's put their hands together, too. But every time one of these Portland people said they had my back I thought, Really? What does that look like? P eople don't talk enough about the Northwest Imperative. Decades before Portlandia popularized the image of a progressive white utopia, white-nationalist groups set their sights on the region. In the 1980s, racists were encouraged to move to a five-state region in the upper left-hand corner of America, for the purpose of forming an Aryan Homeland. With its long history of black-exclusion laws, de facto slavery, and freely cavorting Klansman, Oregon has long been viewed as a white-power vector. Lately, that past has been leaking back into the present. There's been a groundswell of race warring in the Northwest neck of the woods, blowing rangily from the long, hot squall of last year's election. There was a racially motivated stabbing in Olympia, Washington, last August and, a month later, a murder in Portland's poor neighbor, Gresham; there, a white couple mowed down a black teenager outside a 7-Eleven because of his skin color. Swastikas and Nazi stickers began popping up on walls. And though we didn't know it at the time, another enraged white man would in the days after the vigil pummel a TriMet driver, screaming for his free-speech rights . It felt like winter was coming, in June. As I gamed the risks associated with the influx, I figured public transit wouldn't be my problem. Nobody tries me on the train. Although 51, I am a 200-pound black guy with dreadlocks who's in halfway decent shape. It's hard to imagine that the average Portland racist would want a problem with someone like me in a confined space, not when there are so many elderly, infirm, and developing women to target. On the open street, though? The ones I walk all of the time? In the weeks and months after Hillary Clinton conceded, white men repeatedly got in my face. And in some of my friends' faces. What's more, in rural Oregon, a super-specific anti-black-or is it pro-white?-aggression has been real enough to register as heat on my face: The big guy in Bend who looked at me with a ferocity unlike anything I've previously seen or felt, the coastal-town government official who shot something similar my way-less murderous, differently disconcerting-and then went on to ratfuck my reporting. Current Issue View our current issue During that vigil, it felt inappropriate to ask. But eight days later, I walked downtown to see whether these Trump chauvinists were capable of pulling a downtown crowd in broad daylight. Nagging me along the way remained the question, What would Portland having my back look like? B ecause staying prepped-to-fight drunk racists in the street is now part of my life-job description, the pre-rally plan on June 4 had been to hit the gym, one block away from the site of the 2 pm protest. But a sign taped to its door on that Sunday morning alerted customers that my 24-7 fitness joint was being closed \"for safety reasons.\" Looking away, I got that: A few red \"Make America Great Again\" caps bobbed into view. Few shops were open and I had time to kill, so I made my way to a certainty: McDonald's. I approached, walking with my hands on my hips, frustrated from workout denial. A white guy in whitewashed Washington Redskins gear at the Mickey D's doorway made eye contact. His outfit struck me as a white-genocide dog whistle, à la 88, the secret skinhead code for \"Heil Hitler\" (the first letter in both words, \"H,\" being the eighth letter of the alphabet). The skin sorta wiggled, perhaps surprised to see someone like me out in chilly racial weather like this. A young black cat lined up for bad food found my eyes the moment I passed through the doors of McDonald's. Dude's eyes widened with alertness, which turned to panic. What is he doing here? And his panic brought out the panic in me. What is he doing here? Suddenly, the man gave up his place in line and rushed out past me. It's fully possible that he forgot to bring his wallet, or felt that a critical mass for Negritude in this Portland spot on this Portland day might have been exceeded with my arrival. My gut, though, said he was out there comparing notes with the 'skins fan, and might get me. Chewing on fries in the corner, I pondered how weirdly off white the alt-right sampling in Oregon has been. Joey Gibson, the pro-Trump rally organizer , is nobody's idea of a WASP. Hillsboro's Raul Gonzalez wears SS bars on a flight jacket. The aforementioned \"Baked Alaska\" was, for what it's worth, once a rapper. Halfway through my 2-for-1 special, an antifa friend texted that he'd just been harassed by one of America's Next Top Racists, one of the big names in Northwest white supremacy, and requested my backing. I tossed the dregs and left the restaurant. My mantra involved preparing as though getting called a nigger might not be the most negative thing that might happen this afternoon. E ven before the scheduled 2 pm start of the pro-Trump rally, crowds had flooded three parks. Profanities, antagonizing signs, and decibels flew in all directions. Local legend of white supremacy \"Thor Odinson\" loudly blasted his motorcycle around Chapman Square, doing his best MAGA threat display for the antifascists gathering nearby. The alt-right and Portland antifa had a hangover beef from a recent brawl, instigated by \"out-of-town elements,\" according to a spokesman for Portland's mayor. The increasingly active \"antifa\" movement has a long tradition of confronting thuggery-or, as a New York antifa group described it, of \"revulsion at racists, sexists, homophobes, anti-Semites, and Islamophobes, with the international anti-fascist culture of taking the streets and physically confronting the brownshirts of white supremacy, whoever they may be.\" Weaving between the two parks and City Hall, I saw that the counter-protesters numbered in the thousands. Two hundred people ended up rallying for Trump-flying the Confederate flag, calling Black Lives Matter racist-in the park to the southeast of City Hall. Portland's mayor had unsuccessfully tried to halt it. Instead, Portland officials hosted a huge, sanctioned event that spilled out into the street and was gently ringed by cops. That protest had musicians and speakers and a healing energy. A cluster of the pro-humanity protesters adjacent to City Hall took notice of a bony older white woman, perhaps 70.

But a sign taped to its door on that Sunday morning alerted customers that my 24-7 fitness joint was being closed \"for safety reasons.\" Looking away, I got that: A few red \"Make America Great Again\" caps bobbed into view. Few shops were open and I had time to kill, so I made my way to a certainty: McDonald's. I approached, walking with my hands on my hips, frustrated from workout denial. A white guy in whitewashed Washington Redskins gear at the Mickey D's doorway made eye contact. His outfit struck me as a white-genocide dog whistle, à la 88, the secret skinhead code for \"Heil Hitler\" (the first letter in both words, \"H,\" being the eighth letter of the alphabet). The skin sorta wiggled, perhaps surprised to see someone like me out in chilly racial weather like this. A young black cat lined up for bad food found my eyes the moment I passed through the doors of McDonald's. Dude's eyes widened with alertness, which turned to panic. What is he doing here? And his panic brought out the panic in me. What is he doing here? Suddenly, the man gave up his place in line and rushed out past me. It's fully possible that he forgot to bring his wallet, or felt that a critical mass for Negritude in this Portland spot on this Portland day might have been exceeded with my arrival. My gut, though, said he was out there comparing notes with the 'skins fan, and might get me. Chewing on fries in the corner, I pondered how weirdly off white the alt-right sampling in Oregon has been. Joey Gibson, the pro-Trump rally organizer , is nobody's idea of a WASP. Hillsboro's Raul Gonzalez wears SS bars on a flight jacket. The aforementioned \"Baked Alaska\" was, for what it's worth, once a rapper. Halfway through my 2-for-1 special, an antifa friend texted that he'd just been harassed by one of America's Next Top Racists, one of the big names in Northwest white supremacy, and requested my backing. I tossed the dregs and left the restaurant. My mantra involved preparing as though getting called a nigger might not be the most negative thing that might happen this afternoon. E ven before the scheduled 2 pm start of the pro-Trump rally, crowds had flooded three parks. Profanities, antagonizing signs, and decibels flew in all directions. Local legend of white supremacy \"Thor Odinson\" loudly blasted his motorcycle around Chapman Square, doing his best MAGA threat display for the antifascists gathering nearby. The alt-right and Portland antifa had a hangover beef from a recent brawl, instigated by \"out-of-town elements,\" according to a spokesman for Portland's mayor. The increasingly active \"antifa\" movement has a long tradition of confronting thuggery-or, as a New York antifa group described it, of \"revulsion at racists, sexists, homophobes, anti-Semites, and Islamophobes, with the international anti-fascist culture of taking the streets and physically confronting the brownshirts of white supremacy, whoever they may be.\" Weaving between the two parks and City Hall, I saw that the counter-protesters numbered in the thousands. Two hundred people ended up rallying for Trump-flying the Confederate flag, calling Black Lives Matter racist-in the park to the southeast of City Hall. Portland's mayor had unsuccessfully tried to halt it. Instead, Portland officials hosted a huge, sanctioned event that spilled out into the street and was gently ringed by cops. That protest had musicians and speakers and a healing energy. A cluster of the pro-humanity protesters adjacent to City Hall took notice of a bony older white woman, perhaps 70. She wept with such intensity that a young woman felt she had to intervene. When the stranger asked if the older woman needed help, she shook her head, stopped her tears and wailed, \"It's just that I can't believe we've finally woken up!\" Related Article Justine Damond's Murder Deserves Sympathy and Outrage. So Does Every Incident of Police Violence. Collier Meyerson To the northeast of the far right were the antifascists, and they were rowdy as fuck . Far more anarchic-and Caucasian-than the City Hall set, antifa leaders pushed the cops, verbally and physically. I ended up spending most of the dust-up with them, but moved about enough to see that Homeland Security and ICE officers were ringing the Trump crowd, among a range of cartoonishly militarized local law enforcement. An uneasy peace was kept, but I moved away from the fray at the first flash-bang explosion and cannot provide concrete reportage. How strange to have flurries of open racists falling upon your town. How thrilling to see action, not signs. Perhaps every community should weather such a storm, to bring forth truth. Before I left the City Hall rally opposition line I'd run into Malcolm, a colleague and friend and one of a very small number of black males on hand who could fail the \"Brown Paper Bag Test\" (a distinctly American complexion-based valuation). Malcolm said something that brought me back to white people watching out for me, and I thought about the brave martyrs from Hollywood Station. \"I support these white people in their struggle,\" he told me. \"It's not my cousins out there doing this stuff. I support their efforts to talk to their cousins.\" A white dude in front of us-50-something, bearded-heard what Malcolm said and jerked around. He put out his hand for a high five and said, \"That's why I'm here!\" He was getting fortified for the fight. And maybe that's as effective as this \"having my back\" deal is going to get. White Oregon-and, by extension, America-can't practically prevent me from getting snatched when I'm out alone in the wild, say tubing down the Clackamas River. But they'll work to wean their aunties off Fox News. And maybe help me hold off one more month from buying a gun. In this racial market, where the wack white people just keep coming, where the alt-right violence seems to spread and take new forms -I'll take it.\n\nThe mourning swelled, and just when it felt the wave would peak, we learned they were coming. A blond member of Namkai-Meche 's family had been weeping to the very edge of complete breakdown when another vigil attendee announced on a microphone the forthcoming racist infusion: \"A Patriot Prayer Portland Trump Rally,\" she read from her phone. Much like a recent alt-right getdown in enlightened Berkeley, the event scheduled for the next Sunday, June 4, was billed as a celebration of \"free speech.\" The line-up promised appearances by the Northwest 's biggest names in white supremacy. \" Thor Odinson ,\" the so-called mystical racist, and \" Based Stickman ,\" a heavy on the Berkeley protest battle scene, were both expected. Tim \"Baked Alaska\" Gionet, a libertarian-turned-far-right troll and Milo Yiannopoulos sidekick, was set to speak.

Speaker upon speaker addressed the need to address the meaning of our state's uniquely racist past in their lives. As they spoke, the mother of Namkai-Meche held out a photo of her bearded, glee-filled son. A murmur circulated around the crowd of Namkai-Meche's reported last words: Tell everyone on the train I love them. It was at this moment that the mourners, this newly reconstituted \"we,\" suddenly browned to its soul, went full-and-final solidarity. \"People of color?\" the white folks said again and again, \"We have your back!\" This made a lot of white people applaud. Nodding and the whole nine. A significant number of PoC's put their hands together, too. But every time one of these Portland people said they had my back I thought, Really? What does that look like? P eople don't talk enough about the Northwest Imperative. Decades before Portlandia popularized the image of a progressive white utopia, white-nationalist groups set their sights on the region. In the 1980s, racists were encouraged to move to a five-state region in the upper left-hand corner of America, for the purpose of forming an Aryan Homeland. With its long history of black-exclusion laws, de facto slavery, and freely cavorting Klansman, Oregon has long been viewed as a white-power vector. Lately, that past has been leaking back into the present. There's been a groundswell of race warring in the Northwest neck of the woods, blowing rangily from the long, hot squall of last year's election. There was a racially motivated stabbing in Olympia, Washington, last August and, a month later, a murder in Portland's poor neighbor, Gresham; there, a white couple mowed down a black teenager outside a 7-Eleven because of his skin color. Swastikas and Nazi stickers began popping up on walls. And though we didn't know it at the time, another enraged white man would in the days after the vigil pummel a TriMet driver, screaming for his free-speech rights . It felt like winter was coming, in June. As I gamed the risks associated with the influx, I figured public transit wouldn't be my problem. Nobody tries me on the train. Although 51, I am a 200-pound black guy with dreadlocks who's in halfway decent shape. It's hard to imagine that the average Portland racist would want a problem with someone like me in a confined space, not when there are so many elderly, infirm, and developing women to target. On the open street, though? The ones I walk all of the time? In the weeks and months after Hillary Clinton conceded, white men repeatedly got in my face. And in some of my friends' faces. What's more, in rural Oregon, a super-specific anti-black-or is it pro-white?-aggression has been real enough to register as heat on my face: The big guy in Bend who looked at me with a ferocity unlike anything I've previously seen or felt, the coastal-town government official who shot something similar my way-less murderous, differently disconcerting-and then went on to ratfuck my reporting.

B ecause staying prepped-to-fight drunk racists in the street is now part of my life-job description, the pre-rally plan on June 4 had been to hit the gym, one block away from the site of the 2 pm protest. But a sign taped to its door on that Sunday morning alerted customers that my 24-7 fitness joint was being closed \"for safety reasons.\" Looking away, I got that: A few red \"Make America Great Again\" caps bobbed into view. Few shops were open and I had time to kill, so I made my way to a certainty: McDonald's. I approached, walking with my hands on my hips, frustrated from workout denial. A white guy in whitewashed Washington Redskins gear at the Mickey D's doorway made eye contact. His outfit struck me as a white-genocide dog whistle, à la 88, the secret skinhead code for \"Heil Hitler\" (the first letter in both words, \"H,\" being the eighth letter of the alphabet). The skin sorta wiggled, perhaps surprised to see someone like me out in chilly racial weather like this. A young black cat lined up for bad food found my eyes the moment I passed through the doors of McDonald's. Dude's eyes widened with alertness, which turned to panic. What is he doing here? And his panic brought out the panic in me. What is he doing here? Suddenly, the man gave up his place in line and rushed out past me. It's fully possible that he forgot to bring his wallet, or felt that a critical mass for Negritude in this Portland spot on this Portland day might have been exceeded with my arrival. My gut, though, said he was out there comparing notes with the 'skins fan, and might get me. Chewing on fries in the corner, I pondered how weirdly off white the alt-right sampling in Oregon has been. Joey Gibson, the pro-Trump rally organizer , is nobody's idea of a WASP. Hillsboro's Raul Gonzalez wears SS bars on a flight jacket. The aforementioned \"Baked Alaska\" was, for what it's worth, once a rapper. Halfway through my 2-for-1 special, an antifa friend texted that he'd just been harassed by one of America's Next Top Racists, one of the big names in Northwest white supremacy, and requested my backing. I tossed the dregs and left the restaurant. My mantra involved preparing as though getting called a nigger might not be the most negative thing that might happen this afternoon. E ven before the scheduled 2 pm start of the pro-Trump rally, crowds had flooded three parks. Profanities, antagonizing signs, and decibels flew in all directions. Local legend of white supremacy \"Thor Odinson\" loudly blasted his motorcycle around Chapman Square, doing his best MAGA threat display for the antifascists gathering nearby. The alt-right and Portland antifa had a hangover beef from a recent brawl, instigated by \"out-of-town elements,\" according to a spokesman for Portland's mayor. The increasingly active \"antifa\" movement has a long tradition of confronting thuggery-or, as a New York antifa group described it, of \"revulsion at racists, sexists, homophobes, anti-Semites, and Islamophobes, with the international anti-fascist culture of taking the streets and physically confronting the brownshirts of white supremacy, whoever they may be.\" Weaving between the two parks and City Hall, I saw that the counter-protesters numbered in the thousands. Two hundred people ended up rallying for Trump-flying the Confederate flag, calling Black Lives Matter racist-in the park to the southeast of City Hall. Portland's mayor had unsuccessfully tried to halt it. Instead, Portland officials hosted a huge, sanctioned event that spilled out into the street and was gently ringed by cops. That protest had musicians and speakers and a healing energy. A cluster of the pro-humanity protesters adjacent to City Hall took notice of a bony older white woman, perhaps 70. She wept with such intensity that a young woman felt she had to intervene. When the stranger asked if the older woman needed help, she shook her head, stopped her tears and wailed, \"It's just that I can't believe we've finally woken up!\" Related Article Justine Damond's Murder Deserves Sympathy and Outrage.

An uneasy peace was kept, but I moved away from the fray at the first flash-bang explosion and cannot provide concrete reportage. How strange to have flurries of open racists falling upon your town.

Before I left the City Hall rally opposition line I'd run into Malcolm, a colleague and friend and one of a very small number of black males on hand who could fail the \"Brown Paper Bag Test\" (a distinctly American complexion-based valuation). Malcolm said something that brought me back to white people watching out for me, and I thought about the brave martyrs from Hollywood Station. \"I support these white people in their struggle,\" he told me. \"It's not my cousins out there doing this stuff. I support their efforts to talk to their cousins.\" A white dude in front of us-50-something, bearded-heard what Malcolm said and jerked around. He put out his hand for a high five and said, \"That's why I'm here!\" He was getting fortified for the fight. And maybe that's as effective as this \"having my back\" deal is going to get.

In this racial market, where the wack white people just keep coming, where the alt-right violence seems to spread and take new forms -I'll take it.\n\nP eople don't talk enough about the Northwest Imperative. Decades before Portlandia popularized the image of a progressive white utopia, white-nationalist groups set their sights on the region. In the 1980s, racists were encouraged to move to a five-state region in the upper left-hand corner of America, for the purpose of forming an Aryan Homeland. With its long history of black-exclusion laws, de facto slavery, and freely cavorting Klansman, Oregon has long been viewed as a white-power vector. Lately, that past has been leaking back into the present. There's been a groundswell of race warring in the Northwest neck of the woods, blowing rangily from the long, hot squall of last year's election. There was a racially motivated stabbing in Olympia, Washington, last August and, a month later, a murder in Portland's poor neighbor, Gresham; there, a white couple mowed down a black teenager outside a 7-Eleven because of his skin color. Swastikas and Nazi stickers began popping up on walls. And though we didn't know it at the time, another enraged white man would in the days after the vigil pummel a TriMet driver, screaming for his free-speech rights . It felt like winter was coming, in June. As I gamed the risks associated with the influx, I figured public transit wouldn't be my problem. Nobody tries me on the train. Although 51, I am a 200-pound black guy with dreadlocks who's in halfway decent shape. It's hard to imagine that the average Portland racist would want a problem with someone like me in a confined space, not when there are so many elderly, infirm, and developing women to target. On the open street, though? The ones I walk all of the time? In the weeks and months after Hillary Clinton conceded, white men repeatedly got in my face. And in some of my friends' faces. What's more, in rural Oregon, a super-specific anti-black-or is it pro-white?-aggression has been real enough to register as heat on my face: The big guy in Bend who looked at me with a ferocity unlike anything I've previously seen or felt, the coastal-town government official who shot something similar my way-less murderous, differently disconcerting-and then went on to ratfuck my reporting.

The increasingly active \"antifa\" movement has a long tradition of confronting thuggery-or, as a New York antifa group described it, of \"revulsion at racists, sexists, homophobes, anti-Semites, and Islamophobes, with the international anti-fascist culture of taking the streets and physically confronting the brownshirts of white supremacy, whoever they may be.\" Weaving between the two parks and City Hall, I saw that the counter-protesters numbered in the thousands.

Portland's mayor had unsuccessfully tried to halt it. Instead, Portland officials hosted a huge, sanctioned event that spilled out into the street and was gently ringed by cops. That protest had musicians and speakers and a healing energy. A cluster of the pro-humanity protesters adjacent to City Hall took notice of a bony older white woman, perhaps 70.

Before I left the City Hall rally opposition line I'd run into Malcolm, a colleague and friend and one of a very small number of black males on hand who could fail the \"Brown Paper Bag Test\" (a distinctly American complexion-based valuation). Malcolm said something that brought me back to white people watching out for me, and I thought about the brave martyrs from Hollywood Station. \"I support these white people in their struggle,\" he told me. \"It's not my cousins out there doing this stuff. I support their efforts to talk to their cousins.\" A white dude in front of us-50-something, bearded-heard what Malcolm said and jerked around. He put out his hand for a high five and said, \"That's why I'm here!\" He was getting fortified for the fight. And maybe that's as effective as this \"having my back\" deal is going to get.

The ones I walk all of the time? In the weeks and months after Hillary Clinton conceded, white men repeatedly got in my face. And in some of my friends' faces. What's more, in rural Oregon, a super-specific anti-black-or is it pro-white?-aggression has been real enough to register as heat on my face: The big guy in Bend who looked at me with a ferocity unlike anything I've previously seen or felt, the coastal-town government official who shot something similar my way-less murderous, differently disconcerting-and then went on to ratfuck my reporting.

Few shops were open and I had time to kill, so I made my way to a certainty: McDonald's. I approached, walking with my hands on my hips, frustrated from workout denial. A white guy in whitewashed Washington Redskins gear at the Mickey D's doorway made eye contact. His outfit struck me as a white-genocide dog whistle, à la 88, the secret skinhead code for \"Heil Hitler\" (the first letter in both words, \"H,\" being the eighth letter of the alphabet).

A young black cat lined up for bad food found my eyes the moment I passed through the doors of McDonald's. Dude's eyes widened with alertness, which turned to panic. What is he doing here? And his panic brought out the panic in me. What is he doing here? Suddenly, the man gave up his place in line and rushed out past me.

Dude's eyes widened with alertness, which turned to panic. What is he doing here? And his panic brought out the panic in me. What is he doing here? Suddenly, the man gave up his place in line and rushed out past me. It's fully possible that he forgot to bring his wallet, or felt that a critical mass for Negritude in this Portland spot on this Portland day might have been exceeded with my arrival. My gut, though, said he was out there comparing notes with the 'skins fan, and might get me. Chewing on fries in the corner, I pondered how weirdly off white the alt-right sampling in Oregon has been. Joey Gibson, the pro-Trump rally organizer , is nobody's idea of a WASP. Hillsboro's Raul Gonzalez wears SS bars on a flight jacket. The aforementioned \"Baked Alaska\" was, for what it's worth, once a rapper. Halfway through my 2-for-1 special, an antifa friend texted that he'd just been harassed by one of America's Next Top Racists, one of the big names in Northwest white supremacy, and requested my backing. I tossed the dregs and left the restaurant. My mantra involved preparing as though getting called a nigger might not be the most negative thing that might happen this afternoon. E ven before the scheduled 2 pm start of the pro-Trump rally, crowds had flooded three parks. Profanities, antagonizing signs, and decibels flew in all directions. Local legend of white supremacy \"Thor Odinson\" loudly blasted his motorcycle around Chapman Square, doing his best MAGA threat display for the antifascists gathering nearby. The alt-right and Portland antifa had a hangover beef from a recent brawl, instigated by \"out-of-town elements,\" according to a spokesman for Portland's mayor. The increasingly active \"antifa\" movement has a long tradition of confronting thuggery-or, as a New York antifa group described it, of \"revulsion at racists, sexists, homophobes, anti-Semites, and Islamophobes, with the international anti-fascist culture of taking the streets and physically confronting the brownshirts of white supremacy, whoever they may be.\" Weaving between the two parks and City Hall, I saw that the counter-protesters numbered in the thousands. Two hundred people ended up rallying for Trump-flying the Confederate flag, calling Black Lives Matter racist-in the park to the southeast of City Hall. Portland's mayor had unsuccessfully tried to halt it. Instead, Portland officials hosted a huge, sanctioned event that spilled out into the street and was gently ringed by cops. That protest had musicians and speakers and a healing energy. A cluster of the pro-humanity protesters adjacent to City Hall took notice of a bony older white woman, perhaps 70. She wept with such intensity that a young woman felt she had to intervene. When the stranger asked if the older woman needed help, she shook her head, stopped her tears and wailed, \"It's just that I can't believe we've finally woken up!\" Related Article Justine Damond's Murder Deserves Sympathy and Outrage. So Does Every Incident of Police Violence. Collier Meyerson To the northeast of the far right were the antifascists, and they were rowdy as fuck . Far more anarchic-and Caucasian-than the City Hall set, antifa leaders pushed the cops, verbally and physically. I ended up spending most of the dust-up with them, but moved about enough to see that Homeland Security and ICE officers were ringing the Trump crowd, among a range of cartoonishly militarized local law enforcement. An uneasy peace was kept, but I moved away from the fray at the first flash-bang explosion and cannot provide concrete reportage. How strange to have flurries of open racists falling upon your town. How thrilling to see action, not signs. Perhaps every community should weather such a storm, to bring forth truth. Before I left the City Hall rally opposition line I'd run into Malcolm, a colleague and friend and one of a very small number of black males on hand who could fail the \"Brown Paper Bag Test\" (a distinctly American complexion-based valuation). Malcolm said something that brought me back to white people watching out for me, and I thought about the brave martyrs from Hollywood Station. \"I support these white people in their struggle,\" he told me. \"It's not my cousins out there doing this stuff. I support their efforts to talk to their cousins.\" A white dude in front of us-50-something, bearded-heard what Malcolm said and jerked around. He put out his hand for a high five and said, \"That's why I'm here!\" He was getting fortified for the fight. And maybe that's as effective as this \"having my back\" deal is going to get. White Oregon-and, by extension, America-can't practically prevent me from getting snatched when I'm out alone in the wild, say tubing down the Clackamas River.

In August 2007 Esquire ran a cover of John Edwards with the question: \"Can a white man still be elected president?\" That the headline made any sense at all is a testament to the assumptions that prevail about who is entitled to the job. Of the seventeen presidential candidates in both main parties, fourteen were white men-32 percent of the population, 82 percent of the candidates, 100 percent of the past presidents. These are the kinds of odds that would make Kim Jong Il's election agent smile. Back then, with Obama trailing Clinton and both trailing Giuliani in the polls, the lash had not yet been wielded. But the backlash was already beginning. Today it is in full swing. Right-wingers have turned up at Obama's events carrying guns. Facebook recently pulled a poll asking, \"Should Obama be killed?\" with choices of yes, no, maybe and \"If he cuts my health care.\" This was clearly anticipated by Apollo Braun, a Manhattan store owner, whose \"Who Killed Obama?\" T-shirts were his most popular even before the election. In between came gun-toting protesters at town hall meetings and official events. One of them carried a placard saying, \"It is time to water the tree of liberty\"-a reference to Thomas Jefferson's famous quote: \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" It's the same quote Timothy McVeigh was wearing on his T-shirt when he was arrested for bombing the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people. From the time that Obama declared he was running, the primary concern among African-Americans was the same as the one expressed by Alma Powell as her husband, Colin Powell, contemplated running in 1996-assassination. Now it appears that those dark fears have become, in some quarters, white fantasies. How real these threats are and how many people are behind them is anybody's guess. They are certainly part of a trend. In April a Homeland Security report, \"Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,\" concluded: \"The economic downturn and the election of the first African American president present unique drivers for rightwing radicalization and recruitment.\" It also surmised that \"rightwing extremist groups' frustration over a perceived lack of government action on illegal immigration has the potential to incite individuals or small groups toward violence.\" In any case, as 9/11 showed, you don't need that many people to send the world into turmoil. What is truly stunning is the degree to which these marginal voices are explicitly sustained and implicitly condoned by the mainstream. Rarely condemned by Congressional Republicans, the rage has been galvanized by the sum of the slanders from the right-wing echo chamber. After all, if Obama truly were a Kenyan-born Nazi and terrorist sympathizer who has usurped the presidency in order to set up concentration camps to house dissenters, then armed insurrection could be one logical response. The fact that he is none of those things suggests that there are far deeper forces at play. The right's ability to cast white people as victims is possible only because of the dramatic downward spiral of power and influence for white Americans at home and abroad that, paradoxically, accelerated under Bush. Internationally, the United States' failed wars and flailing economy have left one of the world's most patriotic nations desperately trying to recalibrate its role in global affairs. \"Owing to the relative decline of its economic and, to a lesser extent, military power, the US will no longer have the same flexibility in choosing among as many policy options,\" concluded the National Intelligence Council (which coordinates analysis from all US intelligence agencies) in November 2008. Meanwhile, neoliberal globalization has left white Americans feeling insecure in a world where they once called the shots. Among citizens of forty-six countries polled in 2007, Americans had the least positive view on foreign trade and one of the least positive on foreign companies. With unemployment edging toward double figures and a once stagnant median income now shrinking, white Americans do not experience their lot compared with nonwhite Americans as one of relative privilege, because compared with last year they are poorer. Add to this the fact that numerically, white Americans will be a minority by 2045, and you have the basis for the panic that has been unleashed. Obama's election did not create these anxieties. (Were he more radical in his policies, he might actually alleviate some of them.) It has simply provided a focus for them and, conversely, proved that there is a vast constituency-particularly among the young-who do not share them. The country these right-wingers keep saying they \"want back\" is a white one in which their exclusive entitlement to the exercise of power, locally and globally, goes unchallenged. The fact that that country isn't coming back is what makes their voices so shrill and their actions so extreme. Demographically, economically and geopolitically, white America is in decline. In the absence of any meaningful analysis of class, race or internationalism, white Americans are understandably disoriented. Never having considered the unearned privilege of being white and American, all they can see are things being taken away from them. Never having considered solidarity with blacks and Latinos, they see them not as potential allies but as perpetual enemies. Obama's election showed that these appeals to fear can be defeated; events since then indicate that they can still be destructive.\n\nToday it is in full swing. Right-wingers have turned up at Obama's events carrying guns.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

His most recent book is Another Day in the Death of America: A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives . This interview has been edited and condensed. You can listen to Gary Younge on the Start Making Sense podcast . Jon Wiener: A month or two ago, you set out on a trip across America, going from the whitest state, Maine, to the blackest, Mississippi. What exactly where you looking for? Gary Younge: I'm black and British. Over the years when Obama was in power, white journalists would talk about what that meant for black Americans. I felt that we were now in a particularly racial moment. And it is a strange contradiction how rarely the media will discuss white people, because white people are seen as a default-in the same way that nobody asks me, \"When did you come out as straight?\" The interrogation of white people, of whiteness, is all too rare. And when it does happen, sometimes it ends up being an interrogation of racism, which is perfectly plausible but not the same thing. My idea was to travel through the country and look at this group of people who, ethnically at least, single-handedly put Trump in the White House. People who he seems determined to represent. And to look at those pockets of both pain and privilege in white America. The idea also was that we would only speak to white people, and only about white people. Related Article 'Whiteness Is All They've Got': Gary Younge on Trump's Working-Class Supporters Start Making Sense and Jon Wiener JW: What did you look for in Maine? GY: In Maine I wanted to hear about the opioid epidemic. I drove around with a paramedic who fears that one day she will find her sister, who is an addict. We spoke to a guy called Andrew who'd been opioid dependent and who'd managed to get out of that situation and had been sober now for a while. He had managed to do so without any criminal record. It is progress, in a sense, that the opioid epidemic is now understood as a health crisis. Even Trump says so. Whereas the crack epidemic was understood as a crisis of culture and crime. That's one of the things about white privilege: Even when you're on your back in the street with a needle hanging out of your arm, it could always be worse. You could be black. JW: From Maine you went to Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

The town looks like what happens when capitalism doesn't need people anymore; it just leaves. Johnstown is in Cambria County, which voted narrowly for Obama 2008, narrowly for Romney in 2012, and then voted in a landslide for Trump. JW: This phenomenon is crucial to us. The Republican party is the white people's party, but there are white people who voted for Obama and then switched to Trump. These are not lifelong Republicans. They're the new converts that we need to understand. Did you talk to any of those people in Johnstown, Pennsylvania? GY: I did. There's a guy who'd voted for Obama. He had liked Obama's jingle. He said, \"I voted for hope. And then the jobs didn't come. And then Trump said he's going to make America great again. And I voted for that.\" I said, \"Okay. They see.\" It's the Democrats' failure to deliver that to a large extent can explain some of these people switching sides. And why even more of them just stayed at home-they felt \"there's nothing out there for me.\" JW: Did the white working-class Trump voters you talked to actually like Trump? Or was it more that they hated Hillary? GY: They definitely didn't like Hillary. And they didn't necessarily like Trump, but a lot of them felt they had nothing to lose. I did say to this one guy, Jeff, \"Trump looks like the guy that closed your factory-not the guy that was in the picket line with you.\" And he said, \"Yeah, but he looks like maybe he'd be the guy who might start another factory up.\" It's important to remember in all of this that Trump's base was the white and wealthy and they will be the primary beneficiaries of his tenure. The white working class was a decisive but junior partner in the electoral coalition. The question is what was in it for them. I think in the absence of an appealing alternative, they thought, \"Screw it. I'll give this guy a go.\" For those who bothered to vote, it was, \"Let's try this.\" JW: We are told that white Americans feel more pessimistic about their own future than any other group. Why do you think that is? GY: I think it's because they have farther to fall. I don't think many African-Americans are raised to think, \"All you've got to do is work hard at school and you'll be fine. You'll get the job you want. The world is out there for you.\" Whereas white people had a sense of economic entitlement that was actually quite reasonable-except that they shouldn't have been reserved for one race. The idea was that \"if I work hard and graduate from school, I should be able to get a job, support my family, have health care, have a decent life.\" And that was the assumption until the mid-'70s when wages started stagnating and then the jobs started to go away. Then the bottom fell out. So white Americans had further to fall than black Americans. In fact, during this time the gap between black and white has grown in terms of wealth. But pessimism has grown among whites because they have seen a more dramatic fall in their expectations. And that's one of the reasons why they're so angry. During that time, Democrats have been in power pretty much as long as Republicans, and you have this system rooted in money and lobbyists-and it isn't working for them, for the white working class. So they're desperate. JW: Is there one conclusion that you came to after your travels? GY: It should be said first of all that white America is big group of people. There are rich and poor and there's a North and a South and so on. And in terms of the ones I'm most interested in, the working-class whites, there are some who are happy to throw in with others and fight for a better lot. We should not pretend that there isn't a resistance. But of all of the groups in America, white American life expectancy has either stalled or is falling. So their health is failing, their wages are stagnating, their jobs are fleeing. In terms of white privilege, whiteness is all they've got left. So they fight for it even harder-because without that, what are they?\n\nYou can listen to Gary Younge on the Start Making Sense podcast . Jon Wiener: A month or two ago, you set out on a trip across America, going from the whitest state, Maine, to the blackest, Mississippi. What exactly where you looking for? Gary Younge: I'm black and British. Over the years when Obama was in power, white journalists would talk about what that meant for black Americans. I felt that we were now in a particularly racial moment. And it is a strange contradiction how rarely the media will discuss white people, because white people are seen as a default-in the same way that nobody asks me, \"When did you come out as straight?\" The interrogation of white people, of whiteness, is all too rare. And when it does happen, sometimes it ends up being an interrogation of racism, which is perfectly plausible but not the same thing. My idea was to travel through the country and look at this group of people who, ethnically at least, single-handedly put Trump in the White House. People who he seems determined to represent. And to look at those pockets of both pain and privilege in white America. The idea also was that we would only speak to white people, and only about white people.

GY: In Maine I wanted to hear about the opioid epidemic. I drove around with a paramedic who fears that one day she will find her sister, who is an addict. We spoke to a guy called Andrew who'd been opioid dependent and who'd managed to get out of that situation and had been sober now for a while. He had managed to do so without any criminal record. It is progress, in a sense, that the opioid epidemic is now understood as a health crisis. Even Trump says so. Whereas the crack epidemic was understood as a crisis of culture and crime. That's one of the things about white privilege: Even when you're on your back in the street with a needle hanging out of your arm, it could always be worse. You could be black. JW: From Maine you went to Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

The Republican party is the white people's party, but there are white people who voted for Obama and then switched to Trump. These are not lifelong Republicans. They're the new converts that we need to understand. Did you talk to any of those people in Johnstown, Pennsylvania? GY: I did. There's a guy who'd voted for Obama. He had liked Obama's jingle. He said, \"I voted for hope. And then the jobs didn't come. And then Trump said he's going to make America great again. And I voted for that.\" I said, \"Okay.

Or was it more that they hated Hillary? GY: They definitely didn't like Hillary. And they didn't necessarily like Trump, but a lot of them felt they had nothing to lose.

The white working class was a decisive but junior partner in the electoral coalition. The question is what was in it for them.

I'll give this guy a go.\" For those who bothered to vote, it was, \"Let's try this.\" JW: We are told that white Americans feel more pessimistic about their own future than any other group.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Hallmark should make some kind of card: \"Hoping Your Windpipe Hasn't Been Crushed by Racism Today.\" I perceive that white liberals who are reaching out to the black people they know are well-meaning and honestly confused about what to do. They want to help and have no idea how to, because \"fighting systemic racism\" is not part of their daily lives or professional competencies. The most this country has ever asked of white people is that they not be individually racist, and most people struggle even with that. Tearing down the structures of institutionalized white supremacy, like the police, is just not something many white people have spent a great deal of time thinking about. In this moment, as they Columbus the deep pain and anger that black people live with every day, they really don't know what to do. Normally, well-meaning whites might look to community leaders to give them cues about how to express condolences over racial oppression before going back to business as usual. And sometimes, the president attempts to provide some of that leadership: He tries to tell white people where to send the \"sorry about racism\" care packages, while assuring them that only one or two white people are still bigots and we've almost got this race problem licked. White people are lost right now because this president tells them black lives are worthless, and we should save the Sunglass Hut. That's a fine message for the majority of white people. Trump won the white vote in 2016 and he certainly will again in 2020. But that message is deeply unsatisfying to a minority of white people. They want to help and, absent any official guidance, they're reaching out to whoever they know, or know of, to see what they might be able to do. I don't really know what to tell them. I'm not the one with the racism problem. I think y'all should probably do something about your biased police forces before they kill me. I think that every day. James Baldwin said: \"To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.\" I am in a rage almost all the time. My real-life white friends will back me up on this: If you see me, then I am pissed off about something, usually racism. My life does not get better or worse depending on whether white people feel like acknowledging that rage. My life is a war that I've already lost. Current Issue View our current issue If white people want to help, they can do what I do, and go fight the racists. Fight them in public, where everybody can see you. Fight them in private, where nobody can see you. Fight them at parties where I ain't invited. Fight them every day, at all times, everywhere.

They're in their freaking families. They're in their companies. They're in their networks and clubs and social media feeds. I don't need to hear that you really understand how police brutality is a systemic threat to my health and well-being-your racist uncle does. Your boss does. Your \"let's not put politics above friendship\" sorority sister does. Go make some racists know that their opinions are frowned on in this society. Go make them know that you hate them as much as I do. That makes less work for me. Here's a white person who has really helped me personally over the past week: Seth Rogen. I'm serious. Seth Rogen found time this week to spend hours on Instagram simply telling white people who didn't agree with the statement \"black lives matter\" to \"fuck off.\" He told them to stop watching his movies. He told them, and their parents, to go jump in a lake. Seth Rogen is the first white person my wife and I have talked positively about in days . We just sat together, reading his responses and laughing, and a good laugh has been hard for us to come by recently. Telling racist white people to go F themselves might not seem like serious social justice work, but, for what it's worth, it's some of the most time-consuming and emotionally labor-intensive work that I do. If I'm playing a video game, I have to spend time telling racist white people to go F themselves in chat. If I take my kids to the park, I constantly have to be on the lookout for white parents who need to be told to keep their racist ideas the F away from my kids. My Twitter life is pretty much a rolling documentation of white people who need to go get F'd . Most of my posts are long essays trying to explain why specific politicians or judges desperately need to F off. It's hard. It's draining. It's not the most important work, but it is useful. One of the reasons we find ourselves being led by a bigoted president who advocates police brutality and violence is because that bigotry and brutality has been entirely normalized in American life. The racists are comfortable. They think most white people agree with them and are just too afraid or \"politically correct\" to say it. It is important that they know that any time they spout their filth outside one of their neo-Klan Trump rallies, they're going to be challenged. It is important that they know that they can't walk around with MAGA hats that symbolize racism, and then have a nice quiet dinner around fellow white folks. More from Mystal People Can Only Bear So Much Injustice Before Lashing Out Elie Mystal There's Only One Possible Conclusion: White America Likes Its Killer Cops Elie Mystal I'm sick to death of white people showing more civility to racist people than those racist people show me, and then acting like that civility is part of some grand strategy to convince these deplorable racist, violent white people to change their ways. Because those white people, the ones who counsel civility and courtesy and building bridges to the land of kumbaya, are never there when the cops come. They're never there when the officer has a knee in my back and a gun pointed at my head. Asking me later, if I survive, \"Oh, are you OK?\" does nothing for me. I am not OK. I haven't been OK since the first cop called me the N-word when I was 15. I wonder why that cop was on the force. I wonder how many people heard that cop use that word and said and did nothing. I wonder why I have to take the pain because somebody's parents, teachers, and friends did such a bad job. If you want to help me, be on my side. Not just during \"protest week\" but also during restaurant week and beach week and finals week and \"I know a guy who has a yacht\" week and all the weeks in between. Be one-tenth as pissed off about racism two weeks from now as I am every day, and let all your white friends know about it. I do not need white validation of my rage. But I wouldn't object if more white people shared it. Go be angry at other white people for me, because some days I'd like to stay under the covers and hide from all your cops and crap.\n\nI perceive that white liberals who are reaching out to the black people they know are well-meaning and honestly confused about what to do. They want to help and have no idea how to, because \"fighting systemic racism\" is not part of their daily lives or professional competencies. The most this country has ever asked of white people is that they not be individually racist, and most people struggle even with that. Tearing down the structures of institutionalized white supremacy, like the police, is just not something many white people have spent a great deal of time thinking about. In this moment, as they Columbus the deep pain and anger that black people live with every day, they really don't know what to do. Normally, well-meaning whites might look to community leaders to give them cues about how to express condolences over racial oppression before going back to business as usual. And sometimes, the president attempts to provide some of that leadership: He tries to tell white people where to send the \"sorry about racism\" care packages, while assuring them that only one or two white people are still bigots and we've almost got this race problem licked. White people are lost right now because this president tells them black lives are worthless, and we should save the Sunglass Hut. That's a fine message for the majority of white people.

Seth Rogen found time this week to spend hours on Instagram simply telling white people who didn't agree with the statement \"black lives matter\" to \"fuck off.\" He told them to stop watching his movies. He told them, and their parents, to go jump in a lake. Seth Rogen is the first white person my wife and I have talked positively about in days .

If I take my kids to the park, I constantly have to be on the lookout for white parents who need to be told to keep their racist ideas the F away from my kids. My Twitter life is pretty much a rolling documentation of white people who need to go get F'd .

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Now comes the part where white people say, \"I believe that Black Lives Matter, but...\" Now comes the part where white people start literally telling Black people to stop protesting because some \"bad\" people are also protesting. In the immediate aftermath of George Floyd's murder, white people seemingly joined Black people in their calls for justice and change. But that support was always soft. It was entirely predictable that most white people would abandon the movement long before justice was done or change achieved. It was so predictable that I, in fact, predicted it back in June . I knew a majority of white people would revert to form and regress to their mean, because a majority of white people were always going to value their own comfort over justice for Black people. And I knew that white people would eventually find a way to blame Black people for making them not care about us. Because not every Black person brutalized by the cops can go out like Floyd. In many ways, Floyd was the perfect victim for white America. Floyd didn't die quickly; he was subdued in a \"nonthreatening\" position for eight minutes and 46 seconds while he died. He died pleading for his life. He died calling out to his mother. That's how white people like us to die: face down, begging. They don't like us to die on our feet. They don't like us to die trying to get away. They certainly don't like us to die while trying to defend ourselves. Jacob Blake was not the perfect victim for white people. He was trying to walk away. Sure, he was shot at seven times, from behind, right into the back, but quickly. He was not tortured on camera long enough for white people to consider other alternatives. If his three children (who were in the car and saw the whole thing) cried out for their father, their wails and screams were drowned out by the car horn blaring under the weight of Blake's bullet-riddled body. The police and white-wing forces have gone into overdrive smearing Blake's character, and the mainstream media has lapped it up. Just a few months after Floyd was murdered, we're back to shaming the victims of police brutality. The police have brought up past criminal allegations that have nothing to do with why they shot him in the back. Days after the shooting, they invented a knife they now claim he was brandishing. To complete the narrative that Blake was a \"dangerous criminal,\" the police chained Blake to his hospital bed by his legs-legs that no longer work because the cops paralyzed him from the waist down. He'll never be able to walk away from the cops again.

It's being done to make the people who protest and call for justice on behalf of Blake and all Black people seem wrong. It's being done to let white people off the hook for having to give a damn. This is usually the point where some white people start firing off \"not all white people\" tweets at me. Black people share the collective burden of being shot at or choked out or beaten up by armed agents of a white supremacist police state, but white people like for their complicity in that oppression to be meted out in individualized shares based on a case-by-case analysis of their personal wokeness. The white people who won't abandon the calls for racial justice get bent out of shape at being lumped in with those who will, even though my point is that all white people can opt out of their concern for justice if they choose to. I can't. I have two Black kids. I don't have the luxury of getting distracted or bored or exhausted by the conversation about whether they can ride their bikes past a cop without being shot to death. I don't have the option of speculating about whether a white teenager's decision to gun down defenders of Black lives in the street, with at least the tacit consent of the cops, helps or hurts Joe Biden's presidential campaign. I have to stay laser-focused on keeping my family safe, and since all white people are seemingly authorized by the state to snatch my life from me if I piss them off too much, I don't have a lot of time left over to break white folks up into their preferred groupings. The mainstream media does have that kind of time. Instead of maintaining focus on the state-sponsored terrorism faced by Black people, or the calls to end it, the media can't help itself from devolving into cynical horse-race coverage that centers on white voters and their reactions to the protests. The Atlantic ran a piece preemptively blaming protests for a Biden electoral defeat. The New York Times ran a piece warning that \"chaos\" was swaying white voters in Wisconsin. Andrew Sullivan wrote that the Democrats walked into a \"trap\" because a 17-year-old white boy shot people in the street, thus somehow proving that the Democrats do not respect \"law and order.\" \"Law and order\" is the whitest possible way to describe shooting a Black man seven times in the back. \"Chaos\" is a weird euphemism for the uprising of a people who are sick of being brutalized at the hands of the state. Electoral politics is an interesting lens through which to view the effects of white terrorism on our nation. There are something like 70 BLM protests a week throughout America right now, but you don't hear about them unless something burns or somebody gets shot. Most of those protests don't fit the racist white media narrative that \"chaos\" is upending \"law and order\" to the \"electoral detriment\" of Joe Biden. None of this is all that surprising, however. White people blaming Black people for the horrors white people inflict upon Black people is as American as apple pie. They blamed the slave who ran away for forcing the master to whip him. They blamed the Black people agitating for freedom for causing the Civil War. They blamed the Freedom Riders trying to register Black people to vote for getting themselves killed. Now, Black people are being blamed as being too violent to police our own communities, and too strident to build a coalition with \"moderate\" whites who would totally be on our side if we weren't all arsonists who wanted to eat white people, or something. It's all working, after a fashion. Social media was aflutter this weekend about a Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters that showed white support for the Black Lives Matter movement declining to 49 percent, down from a high of 59 percent support a few months ago. Other polls show some slippage in white support, nationally. It's worth noting that Black support for BLM remains where it's always been. It's also worth noting that the conflation of BLM and support for racial justice is an intellectually lazy way for a pollster to shape the question. Black Lives Matter is a movement, but it's also a statement. Either you agree with it or you don't. If your response to that statement is \"it depends,\" then you don't agree with it, and never did. If you are like Nikki Haley and care only about the Black lives that die in the manner that seems best to you, then you were never on the side of racial justice and equality. Pollsters cannot account for slippage from white \"supporters\" who were lying in the first place. Centering Black demands for an end to police brutality in white feelings is offensive and crazy-making. One does not consult the foxes for their opinions on the measures taken to stop them from murdering all the hens. More from Mystal America's Racist Police Won't Be Dismantled by 2 Weeks of Protests Elie Mystal We Need to Talk About the GOP's 'Black Friends' Elie Mystal At the RNC, Republicans Go All In on Police Impunity Elie Mystal But, since we're here, I would ask whites what they would have us do to secure their tepid and revocable support for the notion that we shouldn't be gunned down by the police. Not get shot in the back by the cops? Yeah, we've tried that. Not get pissed off when we get shot in the back? When that happens, y'all just let our murderers go back to the work of murdering us. Protest, but don't be civilly disobedient when we do? We do that, and those protests are never covered. The only time the media shows our daytime protests is when Bill Barr gasses them so the president can take a photo-op. Engage in civil disobedience, but don't be violent? We try that, and we are met with tear gas, flash bangs, rubber bullets, and armed vigilantes who shoot at us with their AR-15s and then get a drink of water from the police. There is no way to protest white supremacy in a way that will meet the approval of white supremacists. There is no way to protest institutional racism that will be accepted by racist institutions. White people have a lot of thoughts on the proper way for Black folks to die; where they come up short is imagining a society that allows Black people to live in peace without harassment and brutality from the police or any other white guy with a gun. And so here we are, barely three months after George Floyd was choked to death, and already white allyship is waning. Derek Chauvin stared right into a camera phone and forced white America to look at itself in a mirror, and for a few minutes, white people were horrified with what they saw. But that moment has passed now. White people could only look at themselves for so long before looking away. A majority of white folks could only contemplate the system of brutality and oppression they tacitly support for a brief time before concluding, as they always do, that Black people deserve it, that killing Black people is self-defense, that even a paralyzed Black man is still a threat who needs to be shackled. Essentially, the months after Floyd's murder have been a summer fling for a majority of white people. It's like they went on safari in Ghana, saw some lions, had sex with a Black person who works there, and learned a lot about the transatlantic slave trade. But now playtime's over, and the white majority has to get back to the serious work of enforcing white supremacy and privilege and reelecting a bigoted president. If you thought Floyd's murder was going to lead to structural change, then you don't know white people as well as I do.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of George Floyd's murder, white people seemingly joined Black people in their calls for justice and change. But that support was always soft. It was entirely predictable that most white people would abandon the movement long before justice was done or change achieved. It was so predictable that I, in fact, predicted it back in June . I knew a majority of white people would revert to form and regress to their mean, because a majority of white people were always going to value their own comfort over justice for Black people. And I knew that white people would eventually find a way to blame Black people for making them not care about us. Because not every Black person brutalized by the cops can go out like Floyd. In many ways, Floyd was the perfect victim for white America. Floyd didn't die quickly; he was subdued in a \"nonthreatening\" position for eight minutes and 46 seconds while he died. He died pleading for his life. He died calling out to his mother. That's how white people like us to die: face down, begging. They don't like us to die on our feet. They don't like us to die trying to get away. They certainly don't like us to die while trying to defend ourselves. Jacob Blake was not the perfect victim for white people. He was trying to walk away. Sure, he was shot at seven times, from behind, right into the back, but quickly. He was not tortured on camera long enough for white people to consider other alternatives. If his three children (who were in the car and saw the whole thing) cried out for their father, their wails and screams were drowned out by the car horn blaring under the weight of Blake's bullet-riddled body. The police and white-wing forces have gone into overdrive smearing Blake's character, and the mainstream media has lapped it up. Just a few months after Floyd was murdered, we're back to shaming the victims of police brutality. The police have brought up past criminal allegations that have nothing to do with why they shot him in the back. Days after the shooting, they invented a knife they now claim he was brandishing. To complete the narrative that Blake was a \"dangerous criminal,\" the police chained Blake to his hospital bed by his legs-legs that no longer work because the cops paralyzed him from the waist down. He'll never be able to walk away from the cops again.

It's being done to make the people who protest and call for justice on behalf of Blake and all Black people seem wrong. It's being done to let white people off the hook for having to give a damn. This is usually the point where some white people start firing off \"not all white people\" tweets at me. Black people share the collective burden of being shot at or choked out or beaten up by armed agents of a white supremacist police state, but white people like for their complicity in that oppression to be meted out in individualized shares based on a case-by-case analysis of their personal wokeness. The white people who won't abandon the calls for racial justice get bent out of shape at being lumped in with those who will, even though my point is that all white people can opt out of their concern for justice if they choose to. I can't. I have two Black kids. I don't have the luxury of getting distracted or bored or exhausted by the conversation about whether they can ride their bikes past a cop without being shot to death. I don't have the option of speculating about whether a white teenager's decision to gun down defenders of Black lives in the street, with at least the tacit consent of the cops, helps or hurts Joe Biden's presidential campaign. I have to stay laser-focused on keeping my family safe, and since all white people are seemingly authorized by the state to snatch my life from me if I piss them off too much, I don't have a lot of time left over to break white folks up into their preferred groupings. The mainstream media does have that kind of time. Instead of maintaining focus on the state-sponsored terrorism faced by Black people, or the calls to end it, the media can't help itself from devolving into cynical horse-race coverage that centers on white voters and their reactions to the protests. The Atlantic ran a piece preemptively blaming protests for a Biden electoral defeat. The New York Times ran a piece warning that \"chaos\" was swaying white voters in Wisconsin. Andrew Sullivan wrote that the Democrats walked into a \"trap\" because a 17-year-old white boy shot people in the street, thus somehow proving that the Democrats do not respect \"law and order.\" \"Law and order\" is the whitest possible way to describe shooting a Black man seven times in the back. \"Chaos\" is a weird euphemism for the uprising of a people who are sick of being brutalized at the hands of the state. Electoral politics is an interesting lens through which to view the effects of white terrorism on our nation. There are something like 70 BLM protests a week throughout America right now, but you don't hear about them unless something burns or somebody gets shot. Most of those protests don't fit the racist white media narrative that \"chaos\" is upending \"law and order\" to the \"electoral detriment\" of Joe Biden. None of this is all that surprising, however. White people blaming Black people for the horrors white people inflict upon Black people is as American as apple pie. They blamed the slave who ran away for forcing the master to whip him. They blamed the Black people agitating for freedom for causing the Civil War. They blamed the Freedom Riders trying to register Black people to vote for getting themselves killed. Now, Black people are being blamed as being too violent to police our own communities, and too strident to build a coalition with \"moderate\" whites who would totally be on our side if we weren't all arsonists who wanted to eat white people, or something. It's all working, after a fashion. Social media was aflutter this weekend about a Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters that showed white support for the Black Lives Matter movement declining to 49 percent, down from a high of 59 percent support a few months ago. Other polls show some slippage in white support, nationally. It's worth noting that Black support for BLM remains where it's always been. It's also worth noting that the conflation of BLM and support for racial justice is an intellectually lazy way for a pollster to shape the question. Black Lives Matter is a movement, but it's also a statement. Either you agree with it or you don't. If your response to that statement is \"it depends,\" then you don't agree with it, and never did. If you are like Nikki Haley and care only about the Black lives that die in the manner that seems best to you, then you were never on the side of racial justice and equality. Pollsters cannot account for slippage from white \"supporters\" who were lying in the first place. Centering Black demands for an end to police brutality in white feelings is offensive and crazy-making. One does not consult the foxes for their opinions on the measures taken to stop them from murdering all the hens.

Not get shot in the back by the cops? Yeah, we've tried that. Not get pissed off when we get shot in the back? When that happens, y'all just let our murderers go back to the work of murdering us. Protest, but don't be civilly disobedient when we do? We do that, and those protests are never covered. The only time the media shows our daytime protests is when Bill Barr gasses them so the president can take a photo-op. Engage in civil disobedience, but don't be violent?

This is usually the point where some white people start firing off \"not all white people\" tweets at me. Black people share the collective burden of being shot at or choked out or beaten up by armed agents of a white supremacist police state, but white people like for their complicity in that oppression to be meted out in individualized shares based on a case-by-case analysis of their personal wokeness. The white people who won't abandon the calls for racial justice get bent out of shape at being lumped in with those who will, even though my point is that all white people can opt out of their concern for justice if they choose to. I can't. I have two Black kids. I don't have the luxury of getting distracted or bored or exhausted by the conversation about whether they can ride their bikes past a cop without being shot to death. I don't have the option of speculating about whether a white teenager's decision to gun down defenders of Black lives in the street, with at least the tacit consent of the cops, helps or hurts Joe Biden's presidential campaign. I have to stay laser-focused on keeping my family safe, and since all white people are seemingly authorized by the state to snatch my life from me if I piss them off too much, I don't have a lot of time left over to break white folks up into their preferred groupings. The mainstream media does have that kind of time. Instead of maintaining focus on the state-sponsored terrorism faced by Black people, or the calls to end it, the media can't help itself from devolving into cynical horse-race coverage that centers on white voters and their reactions to the protests. The Atlantic ran a piece preemptively blaming protests for a Biden electoral defeat. The New York Times ran a piece warning that \"chaos\" was swaying white voters in Wisconsin. Andrew Sullivan wrote that the Democrats walked into a \"trap\" because a 17-year-old white boy shot people in the street, thus somehow proving that the Democrats do not respect \"law and order.\" \"Law and order\" is the whitest possible way to describe shooting a Black man seven times in the back. \"Chaos\" is a weird euphemism for the uprising of a people who are sick of being brutalized at the hands of the state. Electoral politics is an interesting lens through which to view the effects of white terrorism on our nation. There are something like 70 BLM protests a week throughout America right now, but you don't hear about them unless something burns or somebody gets shot. Most of those protests don't fit the racist white media narrative that \"chaos\" is upending \"law and order\" to the \"electoral detriment\" of Joe Biden. None of this is all that surprising, however. White people blaming Black people for the horrors white people inflict upon Black people is as American as apple pie. They blamed the slave who ran away for forcing the master to whip him. They blamed the Black people agitating for freedom for causing the Civil War. They blamed the Freedom Riders trying to register Black people to vote for getting themselves killed. Now, Black people are being blamed as being too violent to police our own communities, and too strident to build a coalition with \"moderate\" whites who would totally be on our side if we weren't all arsonists who wanted to eat white people, or something. It's all working, after a fashion. Social media was aflutter this weekend about a Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters that showed white support for the Black Lives Matter movement declining to 49 percent, down from a high of 59 percent support a few months ago. Other polls show some slippage in white support, nationally. It's worth noting that Black support for BLM remains where it's always been. It's also worth noting that the conflation of BLM and support for racial justice is an intellectually lazy way for a pollster to shape the question. Black Lives Matter is a movement, but it's also a statement. Either you agree with it or you don't. If your response to that statement is \"it depends,\" then you don't agree with it, and never did. If you are like Nikki Haley and care only about the Black lives that die in the manner that seems best to you, then you were never on the side of racial justice and equality. Pollsters cannot account for slippage from white \"supporters\" who were lying in the first place. Centering Black demands for an end to police brutality in white feelings is offensive and crazy-making. One does not consult the foxes for their opinions on the measures taken to stop them from murdering all the hens.

Not get shot in the back by the cops? Yeah, we've tried that. Not get pissed off when we get shot in the back? When that happens, y'all just let our murderers go back to the work of murdering us. Protest, but don't be civilly disobedient when we do? We do that, and those protests are never covered. The only time the media shows our daytime protests is when Bill Barr gasses them so the president can take a photo-op. Engage in civil disobedience, but don't be violent? We try that, and we are met with tear gas, flash bangs, rubber bullets, and armed vigilantes who shoot at us with their AR-15s and then get a drink of water from the police. There is no way to protest white supremacy in a way that will meet the approval of white supremacists. There is no way to protest institutional racism that will be accepted by racist institutions. White people have a lot of thoughts on the proper way for Black folks to die; where they come up short is imagining a society that allows Black people to live in peace without harassment and brutality from the police or any other white guy with a gun. And so here we are, barely three months after George Floyd was choked to death, and already white allyship is waning. Derek Chauvin stared right into a camera phone and forced white America to look at itself in a mirror, and for a few minutes, white people were horrified with what they saw. But that moment has passed now. White people could only look at themselves for so long before looking away. A majority of white folks could only contemplate the system of brutality and oppression they tacitly support for a brief time before concluding, as they always do, that Black people deserve it, that killing Black people is self-defense, that even a paralyzed Black man is still a threat who needs to be shackled. Essentially, the months after Floyd's murder have been a summer fling for a majority of white people. It's like they went on safari in Ghana, saw some lions, had sex with a Black person who works there, and learned a lot about the transatlantic slave trade. But now playtime's over, and the white majority has to get back to the serious work of enforcing white supremacy and privilege and reelecting a bigoted president. If you thought Floyd's murder was going to lead to structural change, then you don't know white people as well as I do.\n\nJacob Blake was not the perfect victim for white people. He was trying to walk away. Sure, he was shot at seven times, from behind, right into the back, but quickly. He was not tortured on camera long enough for white people to consider other alternatives. If his three children (who were in the car and saw the whole thing) cried out for their father, their wails and screams were drowned out by the car horn blaring under the weight of Blake's bullet-riddled body. The police and white-wing forces have gone into overdrive smearing Blake's character, and the mainstream media has lapped it up. Just a few months after Floyd was murdered, we're back to shaming the victims of police brutality. The police have brought up past criminal allegations that have nothing to do with why they shot him in the back. Days after the shooting, they invented a knife they now claim he was brandishing. To complete the narrative that Blake was a \"dangerous criminal,\" the police chained Blake to his hospital bed by his legs-legs that no longer work because the cops paralyzed him from the waist down. He'll never be able to walk away from the cops again.

Black people share the collective burden of being shot at or choked out or beaten up by armed agents of a white supremacist police state, but white people like for their complicity in that oppression to be meted out in individualized shares based on a case-by-case analysis of their personal wokeness. The white people who won't abandon the calls for racial justice get bent out of shape at being lumped in with those who will, even though my point is that all white people can opt out of their concern for justice if they choose to. I can't. I have two Black kids. I don't have the luxury of getting distracted or bored or exhausted by the conversation about whether they can ride their bikes past a cop without being shot to death. I don't have the option of speculating about whether a white teenager's decision to gun down defenders of Black lives in the street, with at least the tacit consent of the cops, helps or hurts Joe Biden's presidential campaign. I have to stay laser-focused on keeping my family safe, and since all white people are seemingly authorized by the state to snatch my life from me if I piss them off too much, I don't have a lot of time left over to break white folks up into their preferred groupings. The mainstream media does have that kind of time. Instead of maintaining focus on the state-sponsored terrorism faced by Black people, or the calls to end it, the media can't help itself from devolving into cynical horse-race coverage that centers on white voters and their reactions to the protests. The Atlantic ran a piece preemptively blaming protests for a Biden electoral defeat. The New York Times ran a piece warning that \"chaos\" was swaying white voters in Wisconsin. Andrew Sullivan wrote that the Democrats walked into a \"trap\" because a 17-year-old white boy shot people in the street, thus somehow proving that the Democrats do not respect \"law and order.\" \"Law and order\" is the whitest possible way to describe shooting a Black man seven times in the back. \"Chaos\" is a weird euphemism for the uprising of a people who are sick of being brutalized at the hands of the state. Electoral politics is an interesting lens through which to view the effects of white terrorism on our nation. There are something like 70 BLM protests a week throughout America right now, but you don't hear about them unless something burns or somebody gets shot. Most of those protests don't fit the racist white media narrative that \"chaos\" is upending \"law and order\" to the \"electoral detriment\" of Joe Biden. None of this is all that surprising, however. White people blaming Black people for the horrors white people inflict upon Black people is as American as apple pie. They blamed the slave who ran away for forcing the master to whip him. They blamed the Black people agitating for freedom for causing the Civil War. They blamed the Freedom Riders trying to register Black people to vote for getting themselves killed. Now, Black people are being blamed as being too violent to police our own communities, and too strident to build a coalition with \"moderate\" whites who would totally be on our side if we weren't all arsonists who wanted to eat white people, or something. It's all working, after a fashion. Social media was aflutter this weekend about a Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters that showed white support for the Black Lives Matter movement declining to 49 percent, down from a high of 59 percent support a few months ago. Other polls show some slippage in white support, nationally. It's worth noting that Black support for BLM remains where it's always been. It's also worth noting that the conflation of BLM and support for racial justice is an intellectually lazy way for a pollster to shape the question. Black Lives Matter is a movement, but it's also a statement. Either you agree with it or you don't. If your response to that statement is \"it depends,\" then you don't agree with it, and never did. If you are like Nikki Haley and care only about the Black lives that die in the manner that seems best to you, then you were never on the side of racial justice and equality. Pollsters cannot account for slippage from white \"supporters\" who were lying in the first place. Centering Black demands for an end to police brutality in white feelings is offensive and crazy-making. One does not consult the foxes for their opinions on the measures taken to stop them from murdering all the hens. More from Mystal America's Racist Police Won't Be Dismantled by 2 Weeks of Protests Elie Mystal We Need to Talk About the GOP's 'Black Friends' Elie Mystal At the RNC, Republicans Go All In on Police Impunity Elie Mystal But, since we're here, I would ask whites what they would have us do to secure their tepid and revocable support for the notion that we shouldn't be gunned down by the police. Not get shot in the back by the cops? Yeah, we've tried that. Not get pissed off when we get shot in the back? When that happens, y'all just let our murderers go back to the work of murdering us. Protest, but don't be civilly disobedient when we do? We do that, and those protests are never covered. The only time the media shows our daytime protests is when Bill Barr gasses them so the president can take a photo-op. Engage in civil disobedience, but don't be violent? We try that, and we are met with tear gas, flash bangs, rubber bullets, and armed vigilantes who shoot at us with their AR-15s and then get a drink of water from the police. There is no way to protest white supremacy in a way that will meet the approval of white supremacists. There is no way to protest institutional racism that will be accepted by racist institutions. White people have a lot of thoughts on the proper way for Black folks to die; where they come up short is imagining a society that allows Black people to live in peace without harassment and brutality from the police or any other white guy with a gun. And so here we are, barely three months after George Floyd was choked to death, and already white allyship is waning. Derek Chauvin stared right into a camera phone and forced white America to look at itself in a mirror, and for a few minutes, white people were horrified with what they saw. But that moment has passed now. White people could only look at themselves for so long before looking away. A majority of white folks could only contemplate the system of brutality and oppression they tacitly support for a brief time before concluding, as they always do, that Black people deserve it, that killing Black people is self-defense, that even a paralyzed Black man is still a threat who needs to be shackled. Essentially, the months after Floyd's murder have been a summer fling for a majority of white people. It's like they went on safari in Ghana, saw some lions, had sex with a Black person who works there, and learned a lot about the transatlantic slave trade. But now playtime's over, and the white majority has to get back to the serious work of enforcing white supremacy and privilege and reelecting a bigoted president.

White people have a lot of thoughts on the proper way for Black folks to die; where they come up short is imagining a society that allows Black people to live in peace without harassment and brutality from the police or any other white guy with a gun. And so here we are, barely three months after George Floyd was choked to death, and already white allyship is waning. Derek Chauvin stared right into a camera phone and forced white America to look at itself in a mirror, and for a few minutes, white people were horrified with what they saw. But that moment has passed now. White people could only look at themselves for so long before looking away. A majority of white folks could only contemplate the system of brutality and oppression they tacitly support for a brief time before concluding, as they always do, that Black people deserve it, that killing Black people is self-defense, that even a paralyzed Black man is still a threat who needs to be shackled. Essentially, the months after Floyd's murder have been a summer fling for a majority of white people. It's like they went on safari in Ghana, saw some lions, had sex with a Black person who works there, and learned a lot about the transatlantic slave trade. But now playtime's over, and the white majority has to get back to the serious work of enforcing white supremacy and privilege and reelecting a bigoted president. If you thought Floyd's murder was going to lead to structural change, then you don't know white people as well as I do.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBut, since we're here, I would ask whites what they would have us do to secure their tepid and revocable support for the notion that we shouldn't be gunned down by the police. Not get shot in the back by the cops? Yeah, we've tried that. Not get pissed off when we get shot in the back? When that happens, y'all just let our murderers go back to the work of murdering us. Protest, but don't be civilly disobedient when we do? We do that, and those protests are never covered. The only time the media shows our daytime protests is when Bill Barr gasses them so the president can take a photo-op. Engage in civil disobedience, but don't be violent?

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

We know he was murdered because a video shows Floyd handcuffed and pinned under the knee of an officer who was crushing his throat into the pavement. Floyd could be heard telling the officer that he couldn't breathe. He could be heard telling the officer, \"Don't kill me.\" Onlookers were heard begging the officer to stop killing the man. The police didn't stop. The police are never going to voluntarily stop killing black and brown people. The killings will continue until the majority of white people in this country make the killings stop. The police work for white people, and they know it. White people know it too. Deep down, white people know exactly whom the police are supposed to protect and serve, and they damn well know it's not black and brown people. We saw some video of that too , over the weekend. Amy Cooper, who is white, was walking in Central Park with her dog. Her dog was off its leash, in violation of park rules and city ordinances . A bird-watcher, Christian Cooper, who happens to be black, asked her to follow the rules. Instead of just putting her dog on a leash, she decided to use his race against him. She first threatened to call the cops and then did just that, claiming that an \"African American man\" was \"threatening\" her in the park. The very instant that Amy Cooper felt she needed the support of institutionalized racism to get her through her morning, she knew exactly where to find it. She knew exactly whom to call. She was the one in violation of the rules. Yet there she was, calling the cops. No doubt, it wouldn't have even occurred to her to call them to the scene of her lawlessness if not for the way cops tend to harass, jail, and yes, murder people who look like Christian Cooper. Or George Floyd. Or Eric Garner. Or Terence Crutcher. Or Alton Sterling. Or Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Or Amadou Diallo. When Amy Cooper threatened to call the cops, she was threatening to take a black man's life. It's a threat that works only because cops are so consistently willing to murder black and brown men. She was able to dial up 400 years of racial oppression and violence on her phone more easily than I am able to order a pizza. It doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers' unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we'd start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

A majority of them clearly want the cops to behave this way. They want the viciousness. They want the horror. Why? It's not just that a majority of white America probably thinks Amy Cooper did the right thing in her specific situation; it's that they think they will one day be in a situation in which such actions are justified. One day they might be alone in a park around a strange black man, and what might happen then? Sure, Christian Cooper seems like a \"nice\" black person, but what if he weren't? What if he were a \"mean\" or \"aggressive\" black person, and you were just alone in the park, illegally walking your dog? Best to keep brutal, dangerous, and racist cops around, because, hey, you never know. White people think they might one day be Amy Cooper, and they want to have somebody to call, just in case. They know they'll never be Christian Cooper. Making a society that's safe for Christian Cooper to bird-watch while black just isn't the most important thing to a majority of white America. Oh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper's behavior. They'll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders. Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols. Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith.

But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders. Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols. Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

White people are not ignorant, and they're not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they're not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they're not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good, even if they never use it. I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith. Black people have tried, again and again, to end the horror of police brutality against us. We march, we protest, we educate, we vote. We teach our children a special set of rules. We produce art and literature and music documenting our pain. We start organizations and movements. And yet we can't achieve structural change in policing because a majority of white America always sets its will against us. White people in our own communities, our alleged friends and neighbors, consistently vote and act in ways that empower the police and ignore their brutality against us. White people could put their police dogs on a leash. But they won't. And more black and brown people will get mauled and killed until white people decide to do better. More black people will die like George Floyd, because most white people want to live like Amy Cooper.\n\nThe very instant that Amy Cooper felt she needed the support of institutionalized racism to get her through her morning, she knew exactly where to find it. She knew exactly whom to call. She was the one in violation of the rules. Yet there she was, calling the cops. No doubt, it wouldn't have even occurred to her to call them to the scene of her lawlessness if not for the way cops tend to harass, jail, and yes, murder people who look like Christian Cooper. Or George Floyd. Or Eric Garner. Or Terence Crutcher. Or Alton Sterling. Or Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Or Amadou Diallo. When Amy Cooper threatened to call the cops, she was threatening to take a black man's life. It's a threat that works only because cops are so consistently willing to murder black and brown men. She was able to dial up 400 years of racial oppression and violence on her phone more easily than I am able to order a pizza. It doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers' unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we'd start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

White people are not ignorant, and they're not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they're not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they're not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good, even if they never use it. I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith. Black people have tried, again and again, to end the horror of police brutality against us. We march, we protest, we educate, we vote. We teach our children a special set of rules. We produce art and literature and music documenting our pain. We start organizations and movements. And yet we can't achieve structural change in policing because a majority of white America always sets its will against us. White people in our own communities, our alleged friends and neighbors, consistently vote and act in ways that empower the police and ignore their brutality against us. White people could put their police dogs on a leash. But they won't. And more black and brown people will get mauled and killed until white people decide to do better. More black people will die like George Floyd, because most white people want to live like Amy Cooper.\n\nOh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper's behavior. They'll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders. Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

I had seen the movie Cry Freedom , though I kind of thought Stephen Biko, Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela were all the same guy at various stages of life. I knew apartheid was \"bad,\" kind of like segregation but way worse, and not really a problem for me, an African American boy who was freed by Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Apartheid didn't become my problem until I was sitting in that Foot Locker trying on a pair of Reebok's new Pump sneakers. I was positive those shoes would literally make me jump higher, and I was excited to get my hands on them. I couldn't understand why the Foot Locker guy, a black man whom I had just seen sell the shoes to a white customer, sat down next to me and told me I couldn't buy those shoes. Reebok had officially joined the economic boycott of South Africa in 1987, but rumors persisted in the African American community that the company was still doing business in or somehow involved with the racist South African regime. The Foot Locker guy explained to me that protesting against apartheid wasn't enough, that we (black people) didn't have enough economic power to make directly boycotting South African businesses effective. We also had to boycott companies that didn't boycott South Africa. The Foot Locker guy was persuasive. Not buying one particular brand of shoe seemed like the very least I could do to support my international brothers and sisters. I left the store with a pair of Jordans. I never was able to jump high enough to dunk. Lots of factors brought white South Africa to heel-most important, the tireless work of black South Africans, who demanded their humanity despite terror, torture, and imprisonment. But the moral suasion of the international community, the shaming and the economic boycotts, also helped. Current Issue View our current issue White South Africa was defeated in my lifetime, during my formative years. So, I've always wondered if the international community would ever rise in solidarity against the white American regime of oppression and violence-the one that operates at home as well as abroad. The white ruling class in America has nothing on the visceral brutality and structural terrorism of the South African apartheid regime. There's a difference between fighting Loki and fighting Thanos. But black Americans could still use some help in our own centuries-long struggle against white oppression. Nobody who fights racism should fight alone. The spread of the George Floyd protests across the globe marks the first time I've ever had hope that the international community-even the Europeans, who can still largely be blamed for all of this-might someday start treating white America with the kind of moral outrage and economic distancing it deserves.

The world is watching and, apparently, is appalled by America's version of brutalizing its own citizens. It's also heartening that these protesters are confronting some of the racial biases in their own societies. Statues of King Leopold II are being removed in Belgium . King Leopold would be on everybody's top 10 list of the most destructively racist men ever to have lived, if everybody actually knew about him. Black people living under white rule around the world are having a moment. The Rev. Mark Thompson surfaced the idea of divestment from America , in the wake of George Floyd's murder. A unified global community against American-style police and military brutality could be a powerful thing. I do not think any of this global solidarity would be happening without the traveling shame-circus that is Donald Trump. Since the latter years of the 20th century, American presidents have shielded white Americans from international moral opprobrium over the country's racist policies by saying all the right things on the international stage. American presidents talk about human rights. They talk about healing and respect for different peoples. They hold the United States out as a beacon of human potential, a place where, no matter where you come from or what you look like, you can expect a fair shake and an opportunity to succeed. If you are a person of color living anywhere else in the world, you can always imagine that coming to America will be better, if not for you, then for your children. That message has never been true for black people. Nonetheless, the belief in that message hampers the standing of African Americans on the global stage. African Americans who have traveled internationally know that in many parts of the world, there are people who blame us for the discrimination we face in our own country. When the United States is thought to be the \"land of opportunity,\" some international observers assume that black people can't \"make it\" here because of our own cultural flaws. When America is viewed as oppressive, some observers wonder why black people here don't \"rise up\" against the white man. I've got a whole Thomas Friedman book worth of stories from cab drivers, born in far-off countries, asking me why African Americans are so \"lazy\" or \"docile,\" depending on whatever they heard on Rush Limbaugh before I asked them to turn it off. \"Barack Obama did it, why can't the rest of you?\" Those conversations do not happen to me anymore. This was true even before the murder of George Floyd and the eruption of mass protests against police brutality. Trump, unintentionally, has shown the world the truth about American-style racism. In his words and actions, the international community can see the contempt in which he holds all nonwhite people, from those who live in \"shithole\" countries to his own fellow citizens. They see him praising and retweeting white nationalists. They see him advocating police brutality. And now they've seen him threaten to use the most lethal military on Earth against his own people.

Americans are already thought to be crass, thoughtless, and uneducated; on the world stage, their country is seen as an aggressor nation, starting wars and squeezing the economic life out of poorer, browner countries. The injustice of its foreign policy is already well known. But a country that \"gases its own people\" reaps its own kind of censure. White South Africans can tell you that \"most racist nation\" status is hard to live with. The American economy is too big and too critical to world markets for the international community to \"divest\" from America like it once did from South Africa.

Trump has already postponed the G-7 summit (the one he initially intended to have at his golf course), but it wasn't clear that everybody would come, seeing how poorly this country has handled the coronavirus pandemic.

The world is watching how white people here react to the George Floyd protests. I suggest they govern themselves accordingly.\n\nApartheid didn't become my problem until I was sitting in that Foot Locker trying on a pair of Reebok's new Pump sneakers. I was positive those shoes would literally make me jump higher, and I was excited to get my hands on them. I couldn't understand why the Foot Locker guy, a black man whom I had just seen sell the shoes to a white customer, sat down next to me and told me I couldn't buy those shoes. Reebok had officially joined the economic boycott of South Africa in 1987, but rumors persisted in the African American community that the company was still doing business in or somehow involved with the racist South African regime. The Foot Locker guy explained to me that protesting against apartheid wasn't enough, that we (black people) didn't have enough economic power to make directly boycotting South African businesses effective. We also had to boycott companies that didn't boycott South Africa. The Foot Locker guy was persuasive. Not buying one particular brand of shoe seemed like the very least I could do to support my international brothers and sisters. I left the store with a pair of Jordans. I never was able to jump high enough to dunk. Lots of factors brought white South Africa to heel-most important, the tireless work of black South Africans, who demanded their humanity despite terror, torture, and imprisonment. But the moral suasion of the international community, the shaming and the economic boycotts, also helped. Current Issue View our current issue White South Africa was defeated in my lifetime, during my formative years. So, I've always wondered if the international community would ever rise in solidarity against the white American regime of oppression and violence-the one that operates at home as well as abroad. The white ruling class in America has nothing on the visceral brutality and structural terrorism of the South African apartheid regime. There's a difference between fighting Loki and fighting Thanos. But black Americans could still use some help in our own centuries-long struggle against white oppression. Nobody who fights racism should fight alone. The spread of the George Floyd protests across the globe marks the first time I've ever had hope that the international community-even the Europeans, who can still largely be blamed for all of this-might someday start treating white America with the kind of moral outrage and economic distancing it deserves.

A unified global community against American-style police and military brutality could be a powerful thing. I do not think any of this global solidarity would be happening without the traveling shame-circus that is Donald Trump. Since the latter years of the 20th century, American presidents have shielded white Americans from international moral opprobrium over the country's racist policies by saying all the right things on the international stage. American presidents talk about human rights. They talk about healing and respect for different peoples. They hold the United States out as a beacon of human potential, a place where, no matter where you come from or what you look like, you can expect a fair shake and an opportunity to succeed. If you are a person of color living anywhere else in the world, you can always imagine that coming to America will be better, if not for you, then for your children. That message has never been true for black people. Nonetheless, the belief in that message hampers the standing of African Americans on the global stage. African Americans who have traveled internationally know that in many parts of the world, there are people who blame us for the discrimination we face in our own country. When the United States is thought to be the \"land of opportunity,\" some international observers assume that black people can't \"make it\" here because of our own cultural flaws. When America is viewed as oppressive, some observers wonder why black people here don't \"rise up\" against the white man. I've got a whole Thomas Friedman book worth of stories from cab drivers, born in far-off countries, asking me why African Americans are so \"lazy\" or \"docile,\" depending on whatever they heard on Rush Limbaugh before I asked them to turn it off. \"Barack Obama did it, why can't the rest of you?\" Those conversations do not happen to me anymore. This was true even before the murder of George Floyd and the eruption of mass protests against police brutality. Trump, unintentionally, has shown the world the truth about American-style racism. In his words and actions, the international community can see the contempt in which he holds all nonwhite people, from those who live in \"shithole\" countries to his own fellow citizens. They see him praising and retweeting white nationalists. They see him advocating police brutality. And now they've seen him threaten to use the most lethal military on Earth against his own people.

So, I've always wondered if the international community would ever rise in solidarity against the white American regime of oppression and violence-the one that operates at home as well as abroad. The white ruling class in America has nothing on the visceral brutality and structural terrorism of the South African apartheid regime. There's a difference between fighting Loki and fighting Thanos. But black Americans could still use some help in our own centuries-long struggle against white oppression. Nobody who fights racism should fight alone. The spread of the George Floyd protests across the globe marks the first time I've ever had hope that the international community-even the Europeans, who can still largely be blamed for all of this-might someday start treating white America with the kind of moral outrage and economic distancing it deserves.

Since the latter years of the 20th century, American presidents have shielded white Americans from international moral opprobrium over the country's racist policies by saying all the right things on the international stage. American presidents talk about human rights. They talk about healing and respect for different peoples. They hold the United States out as a beacon of human potential, a place where, no matter where you come from or what you look like, you can expect a fair shake and an opportunity to succeed. If you are a person of color living anywhere else in the world, you can always imagine that coming to America will be better, if not for you, then for your children. That message has never been true for black people. Nonetheless, the belief in that message hampers the standing of African Americans on the global stage. African Americans who have traveled internationally know that in many parts of the world, there are people who blame us for the discrimination we face in our own country. When the United States is thought to be the \"land of opportunity,\" some international observers assume that black people can't \"make it\" here because of our own cultural flaws. When America is viewed as oppressive, some observers wonder why black people here don't \"rise up\" against the white man. I've got a whole Thomas Friedman book worth of stories from cab drivers, born in far-off countries, asking me why African Americans are so \"lazy\" or \"docile,\" depending on whatever they heard on Rush Limbaugh before I asked them to turn it off. \"Barack Obama did it, why can't the rest of you?\" Those conversations do not happen to me anymore. This was true even before the murder of George Floyd and the eruption of mass protests against police brutality. Trump, unintentionally, has shown the world the truth about American-style racism. In his words and actions, the international community can see the contempt in which he holds all nonwhite people, from those who live in \"shithole\" countries to his own fellow citizens. They see him praising and retweeting white nationalists. They see him advocating police brutality. And now they've seen him threaten to use the most lethal military on Earth against his own people. They also see that a dedicated majority of white Americans steadfastly approve of his message. Even as Trump's approval generally craters, he still holds a five-point advantage in the polls over Joe Biden among white voters. Oh, white people can (and will, repeatedly) say \"not all white people\" or \"I didn't vote for him.\" But being members of the ruling ethnicity in a racially oppressive country carries collective benefits, and collective complicity.

The world is watching how white people here react to the George Floyd protests. I suggest they govern themselves accordingly.\n\nThat message has never been true for black people. Nonetheless, the belief in that message hampers the standing of African Americans on the global stage. African Americans who have traveled internationally know that in many parts of the world, there are people who blame us for the discrimination we face in our own country. When the United States is thought to be the \"land of opportunity,\" some international observers assume that black people can't \"make it\" here because of our own cultural flaws. When America is viewed as oppressive, some observers wonder why black people here don't \"rise up\" against the white man. I've got a whole Thomas Friedman book worth of stories from cab drivers, born in far-off countries, asking me why African Americans are so \"lazy\" or \"docile,\" depending on whatever they heard on Rush Limbaugh before I asked them to turn it off. \"Barack Obama did it, why can't the rest of you?\" Those conversations do not happen to me anymore. This was true even before the murder of George Floyd and the eruption of mass protests against police brutality. Trump, unintentionally, has shown the world the truth about American-style racism. In his words and actions, the international community can see the contempt in which he holds all nonwhite people, from those who live in \"shithole\" countries to his own fellow citizens. They see him praising and retweeting white nationalists. They see him advocating police brutality. And now they've seen him threaten to use the most lethal military on Earth against his own people. They also see that a dedicated majority of white Americans steadfastly approve of his message. Even as Trump's approval generally craters, he still holds a five-point advantage in the polls over Joe Biden among white voters. Oh, white people can (and will, repeatedly) say \"not all white people\" or \"I didn't vote for him.\" But being members of the ruling ethnicity in a racially oppressive country carries collective benefits, and collective complicity.

      "text": "Paul Mooney, Comedy's Maestro of White America\n\n\"White\" is an unsensual word. Where other terms that begin with the same consonants sound whimsical-\"whiff\" or \"whiskers\" or, well, \"whimsical\"-\"white\" coldly whistles.  Even without the distinctly regional pronunciation that makes the \"h\" known, the word's imperious breathiness is there in wait, a coiled but uncracked whip. \"White\" and its associated terms pepper the English lexicon with euphemism: whitewash, white elephant, white lie. And, of course, \"white,\" as in white people , is a modifier that still sends its own referents running scared. Really, who can blame them? Unlike other, perhaps less civil, monikers-\"buckra,\" \"ofay,\" \"honkey\"-\"white\" is abrupt, without music. And yet Paul Mooney made it sing.\n\nThis is probably not the racial term that most people associate with the comedy of Mooney, who died on Wednesday, of a heart attack, at the age of seventy-nine. The more expected one would be \"nigger,\" that utterance with which so many comics (not all of them Black) form a special relationship. But take one well-known joke of Mooney's, in which he claims that he says \" 'nigger' a hundred times every morning; makes my teeth white.\" The poet Tyehimba Jess riffs on this idea in his poem \"100 Times,\" in which the speaker does just as Mooney prescribes, and records the dental benefits. (\"Week eight saw a 2/3 increase in brightening, with a luminousness approaching diamond quality, particularly in the lower incisors.\") The humor lies not in the N-word's bombast but in the joke's gleaming final word, \"white.\"\n\nMooney (who was born Paul Gladney) grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, before moving with his family to Oakland, then Berkeley, the site of what he describes in his memoir \" Black Is the New White \" as his \"watershed 'nigger' moment.\" Compared with Shreveport, where he was cocooned by immediate family, integrated Northern California made him feel the color line-not that Mooney much respected it. During typing class one day in high school, he recalls, he accidentally knocked the bag of a white classmate onto the floor. He was stooping to retrieve it when the classmate ordered him to pick it up- \"Like a command,\" Mooney writes. He was sure at first that he hadn't heard her correctly, but, oh, he had. \"Pick up my purse, nigger!\" she repeated, and slapped him. He managed to drag her by her \"blond stringy hair\" before the teacher spotted him: \"Then it's the principal's office, followed by the police station.\"\n\nNeither Dick Gregory, the author of \" Nigger: An Autobiography \" (1964), nor Redd Foxx, of party records royalty, invented the word-white people did that, Mooney consistently reminded us. Yet those elder comedians, whose blistering humor augmented the nineteen-fifties and sixties bustle of civil rights, revolutionized its usage in standup. (Mooney writes, of Gregory, \"He says that every time he hears the word, it's like an advertisement for his book.\") Following their precedent, Mooney and Richard Pryor , the latter tired of his Cosby cosplay, latched on to \"nigger\" at a mutually formative period in their comedy. They'd first met-where else?-at a party, in 1968, and Pryor wanted some of Mooney's stuff. Mooney worked on Pryor's material, becoming something more than a muse; he co-wrote \"Live on the Sunset Strip\" and other comedy albums, along with Pryor's works in film and television. It's possible that Pryor would have achieved greatness without him, but it sure wouldn't've sounded the same.\n\nIn those earlier days, Mooney had only recently returned from Army service in Germany. He was spared Vietnam, but was invested in fighting it-he performed alongside Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland in an antiwar improv show called \"FTA\" (Fuck the Army). He was working back-to-back gigs for rent money. He began working out his voice in Beverly Hills, at Ye Little Club, Joan Rivers 's little jazz lounge, where comics tested their stuff. It became Mooney's lab. He liked his sets to unsettle the white constitution, especially regarding that two-syllable word. \"It's forbidden to them, but allowed to us. Ain't too many things like that. It's liberating,\" he wrote in the memoir. \"Black people laugh out of their recognition of street language, but white folks laugh out of sheer anxiety.\"\n\nThe Mooney act that introduced me to his standup is \"Analyzing White America,\" his special from 2002, though I realize this dates me. In it, between his usual impertinent bits, Mooney plays a placid-though not guileless-talk therapist, easing latent racism out of white patients while dressed, interestingly, in a red-and-blue ensemble reminiscent of Jacques Cousteau. Mooney kept an eye on style, never doubting his own good looks. During the standup portions of \"Analyzing White America,\" he is seated and cozy in loose-fitting all black, a black beanie atop his bald head. An echo of his superfly days-a large photo of a young Mooney in a black brimmed hat, peering over round-framed glasses-hangs in the corner behind him. It was an apt staging for a special that included commentary on the fresh tragedy of 9/11 alongside versions of old Mooney staples. Like most good comedians, Mooney was constantly revising. One bit, which also appears on his 1993 comedy album \"Race,\" describes the divergent responses that a white serial killer and a Black serial killer would receive in court:\n\n\"Crazy white man, why did you wake up and kill everybody on your\nblock?\"\n\n\"I'm twelve different personalities.\"\n\n\"Twelve different people? How unusual, we'll have to study this.\"\n\n\"Crazy nigga, why'd you wake up and kill everybody at BET or your\njob?\"\n\n\"Because I'm twelve different personalities.\"\n\n\"Oh, really, nigger? Well, pick who you want to be because some nigga's going to jail.\"\n\nIn the earlier version of the joke, it's the identity of the judge that changes. \"Nigga judges,\" Mooney says, would take no shit from white killers. The later version knows better.\n\nBy the time \"Analyzing White America\" was released, Mooney was a veteran, the maestro of race comedy (which today we might simply call \"comedy\"). His jokes had filled the mouths of Foxx (\"Sanford & Son\"), Chevy Chase (\"Saturday Night Live\"), and of \"The Richard Pryor Show\" alumni such as Robin Williams, Tim Reid, and Sandra Bernhard. He'd worked as a writer on \"In Living Color\" and played Junebug, the \"nigger-club\"-hopping father of race-naïve Pierre (Dela) Delacroix (Damon Wayans), in Spike Lee 's \"Bamboozled\" (2000), a role that took an ennobling, if parochial, view of Mooney's continuity with the mainstream. But it was his role on \"Chappelle's Show\" that re-canonized him, bringing him into center frame as the living, nonchalant \"Godfather of Comedy.\" In my favorite sketch, \"Mooney at the Movies,\" the comedian pitches a new film, taking inspiration from \"The Last Samurai,\" starring Tom Cruise. \"Hollywood is crazy,\" he says. \"Maybe they'll produce my film, 'The Last Nigga on Earth,' starring Tom Hanks.\"\n\nMooney's comedic style involved swift, tight, and insular calls and responses, with him in the roles of both ventriloquist and dummy, a critic of his own impressions. He bent the art of mimicry to face-stretching extremes, and smirked at his own dare. Black people were frequent subjects, but whites, his other people-\"I think just like white folks, I'm just like them,\" he says at the end of \"Analyzing White America\"-were a special prey. White people assume they must be fascinating, to be so often scrutinized, but Mooney only ever let on a faint amusement. Contrary to so much \"whiteness studies,\" Mooney's comedy asserts that white people are in fact devastatingly easy to understand. They are imbeciles and grinning simpletons, whining and slavering in their hysteria-but never harmless.\n\nThe burden of being a Black comic in Hollywood wore Pryor down and nearly got Chappelle, but Mooney did not crack, or maybe just the once, when he briefly retired the N-word, after Michael Richards really cracked . (Then again, Mooney was felled by a heart attack, one of the Blackest ways to die in white America.) His way of making race the joke, without any illusions about a joke's redemptive power, has been taken up by countless comics of subsequent generations, to varying effects. In a performer like Katt Williams, it takes the form of a volatility that's not always compatible with profitability. In an act like \"Key & Peele,\" it's evidence of the new mass appeal of a certain kind of race comedy. In both cases, a debt to Mooney is owed.\n\nIt's uncomfortable to admit that our memory of Mooney might have been fonder (if less truthful) had he passed a few years earlier. In 2019, a former bodyguard of Pryor's named Rashon Khan alleged, in a taped interview, that Mooney had molested Pryor's son, Richard Pryor, Jr. The next day, Pryor, Jr., confirmed that he'd been a victim of rape as a teen-ager, though he didn't name a perpetrator. At the time, news of the allegations-which Mooney denied-flooded my Twitter timeline. Since then, they've faded from memory, as these things tend to do. There have been no follow-ups or further investigations. Yet there is already enough to tarnish Mooney's legacy, and cast a different sort of pall on our loss of him. How grim to imagine that the Pryor son (like Pryor himself) lived with that variety of trauma, because of a comic whom so many younger ones unmistakably imprinted upon.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

During the standup portions of \"Analyzing White America,\" he is seated and cozy in loose-fitting all black, a black beanie atop his bald head. An echo of his superfly days-a large photo of a young Mooney in a black brimmed hat, peering over round-framed glasses-hangs in the corner behind him. It was an apt staging for a special that included commentary on the fresh tragedy of 9/11 alongside versions of old Mooney staples. Like most good comedians, Mooney was constantly revising. One bit, which also appears on his 1993 comedy album \"Race,\" describes the divergent responses that a white serial killer and a Black serial killer would receive in court:\n\n\"Crazy white man, why did you wake up and kill everybody on your\nblock?\"\n\n\"I'm twelve different personalities.\"\n\n\"Twelve different people? How unusual, we'll have to study this.\"\n\n\"Crazy nigga, why'd you wake up and kill everybody at BET or your\njob?\"\n\n\"Because I'm twelve different personalities.\"\n\n\"Oh, really, nigger? Well, pick who you want to be because some nigga's going to jail.\"\n\nIn the earlier version of the joke, it's the identity of the judge that changes. \"Nigga judges,\" Mooney says, would take no shit from white killers. The later version knows better.\n\nBy the time \"Analyzing White America\" was released, Mooney was a veteran, the maestro of race comedy (which today we might simply call \"comedy\"). His jokes had filled the mouths of Foxx (\"Sanford & Son\"), Chevy Chase (\"Saturday Night Live\"), and of \"The Richard Pryor Show\" alumni such as Robin Williams, Tim Reid, and Sandra Bernhard. He'd worked as a writer on \"In Living Color\" and played Junebug, the \"nigger-club\"-hopping father of race-naïve Pierre (Dela) Delacroix (Damon Wayans), in Spike Lee 's \"Bamboozled\" (2000), a role that took an ennobling, if parochial, view of Mooney's continuity with the mainstream. But it was his role on \"Chappelle's Show\" that re-canonized him, bringing him into center frame as the living, nonchalant \"Godfather of Comedy.\" In my favorite sketch, \"Mooney at the Movies,\" the comedian pitches a new film, taking inspiration from \"The Last Samurai,\" starring Tom Cruise. \"Hollywood is crazy,\" he says. \"Maybe they'll produce my film, 'The Last Nigga on Earth,' starring Tom Hanks.\"\n\nMooney's comedic style involved swift, tight, and insular calls and responses, with him in the roles of both ventriloquist and dummy, a critic of his own impressions. He bent the art of mimicry to face-stretching extremes, and smirked at his own dare. Black people were frequent subjects, but whites, his other people-\"I think just like white folks, I'm just like them,\" he says at the end of \"Analyzing White America\"-were a special prey. White people assume they must be fascinating, to be so often scrutinized, but Mooney only ever let on a faint amusement. Contrary to so much \"whiteness studies,\" Mooney's comedy asserts that white people are in fact devastatingly easy to understand. They are imbeciles and grinning simpletons, whining and slavering in their hysteria-but never harmless.\n\nThe burden of being a Black comic in Hollywood wore Pryor down and nearly got Chappelle, but Mooney did not crack, or maybe just the once, when he briefly retired the N-word, after Michael Richards really cracked . (Then again, Mooney was felled by a heart attack, one of the Blackest ways to die in white America.) His way of making race the joke, without any illusions about a joke's redemptive power, has been taken up by countless comics of subsequent generations, to varying effects. In a performer like Katt Williams, it takes the form of a volatility that's not always compatible with profitability. In an act like \"Key & Peele,\" it's evidence of the new mass appeal of a certain kind of race comedy. In both cases, a debt to Mooney is owed.\n\nIt's uncomfortable to admit that our memory of Mooney might have been fonder (if less truthful) had he passed a few years earlier. In 2019, a former bodyguard of Pryor's named Rashon Khan alleged, in a taped interview, that Mooney had molested Pryor's son, Richard Pryor, Jr. The next day, Pryor, Jr., confirmed that he'd been a victim of rape as a teen-ager, though he didn't name a perpetrator. At the time, news of the allegations-which Mooney denied-flooded my Twitter timeline. Since then, they've faded from memory, as these things tend to do. There have been no follow-ups or further investigations. Yet there is already enough to tarnish Mooney's legacy, and cast a different sort of pall on our loss of him. How grim to imagine that the Pryor son (like Pryor himself) lived with that variety of trauma, because of a comic whom so many younger ones unmistakably imprinted upon.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The History That James Baldwin Wanted America to See\n\nOn March 16, 1968, James Baldwin walked to the podium at a fund-raiser, at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel, to introduce Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Baldwin had recently arrived in Los Angeles from New York, after Columbia Pictures had bought the rights to Alex Haley's \" The Autobiography of Malcolm X \" and asked Baldwin to write the script. Though eager, he had ended up fighting desperately to bring his story of Malcolm to the screen. Baldwin wanted Billy Dee Williams to play the lead, but the studio had other actors in mind. There were even rumors that someone had suggested a darkened Charlton Heston.\n\nThe fund-raiser was meant to replenish the coffers of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (S.C.L.C.) and to help fund King's latest project, the Poor People's Campaign. King wanted to make the case for massive direct action, in Washington, D.C., on behalf of the country's impoverished. To do so, he would need to marshal greater financial resources than ever before. Desegregating lunch counters didn't cost much, but ending poverty would cost the nation billions of dollars.\n\nKing found that many who once supported his desegregation efforts were less than enthusiastic about his agenda on jobs and poverty. The idea of occupying the nation's capital with poor people scared many activists-even some on the board of the S.C.L.C. For others, such as Bayard Rustin, a trusted adviser to King since the days of the Montgomery bus boycott, such an act of civil disobedience courted violence and threatened to turn even more white Americans against the civil-rights agenda. Rustin wanted the S.C.L.C. to focus on electing Democrats to political office, not on building a tent city or staging sit-ins at congressional offices.\n\nHow Baldwin ended up at the fund-raiser is unclear, although Marlon Brando, who organized it, may have invited him; the two were close. In any case, Baldwin had not been expecting to introduce King, and his short speech said little about the leader. Instead, he told a brief story about the promise of the early days of the civil-rights movement, a promise that was betrayed by the country. \"What Rosa Parks was saying in Montgomery, in 1956, and what the Negroes were saying in their march . . . the country did not want to hear or did not hear,\" Baldwin told the audience. \"And as time rolled on and kids, including people like Stokely Carmichael, were being beaten with chains, going to jail, marching up and down those dusty highways, trying to change the conscience of this country, still nobody heard and nobody really cared.\" Baldwin's speech was all about the wall of white supremacy that stood in the way of fundamental transformation. His was an effort to jog the memory and, by extension, the morality of the audience, by telling a different story about what happened to a movement on the brink of failure.\n\nWhen King reached the podium, he did not acknowledge Baldwin specifically, and instead offered a generic thanks to all those who had spoken before him. It was only later that the two men conferred privately. \"We sat down in a relatively secluded corner and tried to bring each other up to date. Alas, it would never be possible. . . .\" Baldwin recalled in his book \" No Name in the Street ,\" from 1972. \"We had first met during the last days of the Montgomery bus boycott-and how long ago was that? It was senseless to say, eight years, ten years ago-it was longer ago than time can reckon.\"\n\nBaldwin's general sense of the encounter was that King was a bit skeptical of him. Although Baldwin had known King since his first trip to the South, in 1957, and had worked beside him over the years, he felt that King was discomfited by his presence. \"Martin and I had never got to know each other well,\" he wrote. \"Circumstances, if not temperament, made that impossible.\" In 1963, King was caught on tape, by the F.B.I., expressing concern about Baldwin. He didn't want to appear on television with the writer, he said, because Baldwin \"was uninformed regarding his movement.\" To King, Baldwin was not a civil-rights leader; he was just one celebrity, among many, willing to lend his star power to the movement. It's not impossible to imagine, too, that Baldwin's queerness unsettled him.\n\nBy the time of the fund-raiser, the distance between the two men had been widened by Baldwin's sympathies for the militancy of the younger generation. He was in Hollywood, after all, writing a screenplay on Malcolm X. And, just a month earlier, Baldwin had hosted a birthday party and fund-raiser for Huey P. Newton, the jailed leader of the Black Panther Party. In 1968, King felt intense pressure from such radical groups, and from recent shifts in the political climate. The nation had seemed to turn its back on his moral vision. Writing in The New York Review of Books, Andrew Kopkind, a white journalist of the New Left, declared that King had been \"outstripped by his times.\" A young black woman, who supported Carmichael's Black Power philosophy, had even accused King of selling out the Selma movement, as he and other members of the S.C.L.C. board arrived for a meeting in Washington, D.C.\n\nBaldwin had long seen this turn against King on the horizon. In 1961, he had written an article for Harper's Magazine titled \"The Dangerous Road Before Martin Luther King.\" In it, he noted how King's voice had changed from the heady days of the bus boycott, and detailed the challenges that King was destined to face as a black leader in a revolutionary time. \"He was more beleaguered than he had ever been before, and not only by his enemies in the white South,\" Baldwin wrote. \"Three years earlier, I had not encountered very many people-I am speaking now of Negroes-who were really critical of him. But many more people seemed critical of him now, were bitter, disappointed, skeptical.\"\n\nBaldwin argued that King had to confront the meaning of a new, uncompromising spirit in the movement. Leaders like him were being challenged by their children, who rejected the underlying premise that made \"the traditional black leader\" necessary in the first place. As Baldwin put it, \"These young people have never believed in the American image of the Negro and have never bargained with the Republic, and now they never will. There is no longer any basis on which to bargain.\"\n\nEven in 1961, Baldwin had sensed that these young people might have a point. By 1968, when he gave his speech in Anaheim, he saw clearly how the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, a few years earlier, might offer white America the sense of self-congratulation that Black Power was now denying it. He knew that the civil-rights movement could easily be conscripted into the story of how Americans, in their inherent goodness, had perfected the Union. The history being made could be bent in service of the lie. For Baldwin, that lie had to be challenged at its root-which is why, perhaps, he devoted his introduction to telling a true story of the movement.\n\nSurprisingly, after Baldwin had finished speaking, King gave a speech that echoed Baldwin's account. It wasn't a story of American triumphalism. Instead, King expressed concern that the movement was losing the battle for the soul of the nation. He conjured, without a hint of nostalgia, a history of people acting heroically against the odds, a history full of disappointment and trauma. He did not mince words: America was a decidedly racist country. \"The problem can only be solved when there is a kind of coalition of conscience,\" he said. \"Now I am not sure if we have that many consciences left. Too many have gone to sleep.\"\n\nLike Baldwin, King struggled with America's commitment to the belief that white people mattered more, and to the lie that made that belief palatable. \"I must honestly confess that I go through those moments of disappointment when I have to recognize the fact that there aren't enough white persons in our country who are willing to cherish democratic principles over privilege,\" he said. \"But I'm grateful to God that some are left.\" As King brought his speech to a close, he tried, once more, to reach for the promise of America, vowing that the country would one day move forward because, \"however much she strays away from it, the goal of America is freedom.\" His sombre tone betrayed his words.\n\nThe importance of history had been in full view for both Baldwin and King just a few weeks earlier, at a Carnegie Hall event, in New York City, celebrating what would have been the hundredth birthday of W. E. B. Du Bois, the great African-American intellectual and the co-founder of the N.A.A.C.P. Du Bois, after seven decades of fighting for racial justice in the United States, had given up on America and died, in exile, in Accra, Ghana, on the eve of the March on Washington, in 1963. Although Baldwin had been working on an essay about Du Bois, he chose the occasion at Carnegie Hall to read a recently published piece, \"Black Power.\" Here, at this celebration of Du Bois, who dedicated his life to exposing America's lies, Baldwin sought to shift the balance of concern from criticism of militancy among young black people to an honest assessment of the conditions that made such a turn necessary.\n\nKing disagreed with the rhetoric and symbolism of Black Power. He found no use for what he called a \"mystique of blackness\" or \"the angry militant who fails to organize.\" But he, too, was a student of Du Bois's work, and he understood what Du Bois taught regarding \"our tasks of emancipation.\" \"One idea he insistently taught,\" King said in his speech at the event, \"was that black people have been kept in oppression and deprivation by a poisonous fog of lies that depicted them as inferior, born deficient, and deservedly doomed to servitude to the grave.\"\n\nKing's remarks at Carnegie Hall, like his remarks in Anaheim, were shadowed by a note of despair. The country was in turmoil. \"Negroes have heavy tasks today,\" he said. \"We were partially liberated and then reënslaved.\" Although black people had been fighting for freedom \"for more than a hundred years,\" the only thing that was \"explicitly certain is that the struggle for it will endure.\"\n\nBaldwin and King would be together one last time, at a fund-raiser in New York City. Baldwin didn't have a suit for the occasion, so he ran out to have one fitted. Later, he returned to California to work on the Malcolm X film, the direction of which he was still debating with studio executives. On the night of April 4, 1968, Baldwin was sitting by his swimming pool with Billy Dee Williams, listening to an Aretha Franklin record, when the phone rang. It was his friend David Moses. \"Jimmy,\" Moses said. \"Martin's just been shot. He's not dead yet, but it's a head wound, so . . .\" Baldwin dropped the phone and wept. A few days later, he wore his new suit to King's funeral.\n\nBaldwin was hardly naïve about the human capacity for evil, especially in white folk. \"If you're a Negro, you're in the center of that peculiar affliction,\" he said, \"because anybody can touch you-when the sun goes down. You know, you're the target of everybody's fantasies.\" But what shocked him was that white America had killed someone who espoused love, an apostle of nonviolence. King's death revealed the depths of white America's debasement and the scope of black America's peril. \"Perhaps even more than the death itself, the manner of his death has forced me into a judgment concerning human life and human beings which I have always been reluctant to make,\" he wrote. \"Incontestably, alas, most people are not, in action, worth very much; and yet, every human being is an unprecedented miracle. One tries to treat them as the miracles they are, while trying to protect oneself against the disasters they've become.\"\n\nIf King was the preacher, Baldwin was the poet, and he sought to account for his confusion by gathering up the pieces-of himself, of black folk-buried beneath the disaster that was the country. That work kept his despair at arm's length. To be sure, King's death, just like those of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and all the others, did not stop time. White people did not stop being white people. Two days after King's murder, the Black Panther Bobby Hutton was killed by Oakland police officers. Later, police rioted in Chicago, during the Democratic National Convention. The nastiness of the white world kept coming, and it gave black politics-and Baldwin's voice-an edge. King's death had revealed the bitterness at the bottom of the cup. What Baldwin saw on that dangerous road that led to King's death, in Memphis, was the difficult question of whether or not the country had the courage to confront its demons. Could America tell itself the truth about how it had arrived at this moment? And did it have the moral stamina to surrender the comfort of its lies?\n\nIn July of 1968, just a few months after King's assassination and against the backdrop of American cities burning, Baldwin gave an interview to Esquire . He set the tone of the exchange from the very start:\n\nQ. How can we get the black people to cool it?\n\nA. It is not for us to cool it.\n\nQ. But aren't you the ones who are getting hurt the most?\n\nA. No, we are only the ones who are dying fastest.\n\nThe editors did not seem to grasp how the moral burden of America's nightmare rested not on the black people rioting in the streets but on the white people who held tightly to the belief that they were somehow, because of the color of their skin, better than others. These people, Baldwin argued, had to see themselves otherwise. New laws, gestures of sympathy, and acts of racial charity would never suffice to change the course of the country. Something more radical had to be done; a different history had to be told. \"All that can save you now is your confrontation with your own history . . . which is not your past, but your present,\" Baldwin said. \"Your history has led you to this moment, and you can only begin to change yourself by looking at what you are doing in the name of your history.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2017, James Fields, Jr., a twenty-year-old self-proclaimed neo-Nazi from Kenton, Kentucky, floored the gas pedal of his 2010 Dodge Challenger and roared down a narrow street full of anti-racist protesters, during the \"Unite the Right\" rally, in Charlottesville, Virginia. Heather Heyer, who was raised in nearby Ruckersville, was in the crowd. According to people who knew her, Heyer, thirty-two, had spent much of her life \"standing up against any type of discrimination.\" As Fields's speeding car sent shoes, cell phones, and bodies flying into the air, Ryan Kelly, a photographer for the Daily Progress, captured the carnage. Heyer is framed between a man falling behind the car's back bumper, one Air Jordan-clad foot twisted horribly in the air, and the tattooed torso of a white man in mid-somersault. She is leaning to the side as the muscle car hits her and plows through the crowd. Heyer died at the scene, and dozens more were injured. Fields was eventually convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe occasion of this violence was a bitter battle over American history and how we ought to remember it. In March, 2016, Wes Bellamy, Charlottesville's vice-mayor and a member of its city council, advocated for the removal of Confederate monuments to Robert E. Lee and Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson. Zyahna Bryant, a high-school freshman in Charlottesville, joined Bellamy's effort. She circulated a petition demanding the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in a local park and submitted it to the council. The council agreed to remove the statue by a vote of three to two.\n\nThen, in 2017, all hell broke loose. Emboldened by the election of Donald Trump , who had often and overtly appealed to white identity, local white nationalists saw an opportunity to exploit the council's decision. The nationalists believed that the actions of the council were an assault on white people. In their view, the soldiers of political correctness had disfigured and distorted American history, in general, and Southern history, in particular. Their outrage prompted the \"Unite the Right\" rally, the largest gathering of white nationalists and neo-Nazis in recent memory. That day ended with Fields's murderous drive on Fourth Street.\n\nIt is telling that such brutality broke out over a fight regarding the symbols and uses of American history. As both Baldwin and King insisted, each in their own way, America is an identity that white people will protect at any cost, and the country's history-its founding documents, its national heroes, its claim to be a moral force in the world-is the supporting argument that underpins that identity. This history is inseparable from the nation's built environment; both monuments and the ways in which communities are spatially organized reinforce it. When King declared that the country's moral vision had been clouded by \"a poisonous fog of lies,\" and when Baldwin said in Esquire that we needed to look at what we are doing in the name of our history, both were arguing that this history, the story we tell ourselves about what the country is, shapes the world we make going forward.\n\nThe debate over Confederate monuments makes this plain. For white nationalists, the Confederacy represents a triumph of a certain understanding of America, in which the superiority of white people in all social, political, and cultural arrangements is enshrined. From that perspective, open-air tributes to white supremacy make sense. The more complex question is what we do with those who are willing to condemn neo-Nazis but who still claim Confederate statues as part of their \"heritage.\" These are the people for whom Judge Richard E. Moore, of the Charlottesville Circuit Court, ruled, in April, 2019, that the Confederate statues must remain in the area. \"While some people obviously see Lee and Jackson as symbols of white supremacy, others see them as brilliant military tacticians or complex leaders in a difficult time,\" Moore wrote in his decision.\n\nMoore was presenting a different narrative about the statues. After Charlottesville, though, American historians made clear that the monuments were not, in fact, erected as contemporaneous memorials of the Civil War. Most were built many years later, either between the eighteen-nineties and the first decades of the twentieth century, when most of the Confederate veterans began to die, or in the nineteen-fifties, when the demand for racial equality intensified. They were, in other words, monuments to an ideology, physical representations of the \"Lost Cause\" in public space. They insisted on the false claim that the Civil War centered not on slavery but on the heroic defense of the Southern way of life.\n\nBlack people challenged these monuments even as they were being built. In \" Black Reconstruction in America ,\" from 1935, Du Bois exposed the lies at the heart of that era's historiography, unmasking the influential works of the political scientist John W. Burgess and the historian William A. Dunning. The Dunning School, the first generation of trained historians to write about Reconstruction, told the story of the period as one of extensive overreach of federal power and the corruption of northern carpetbaggers; Dunning viewed the granting of political rights to former slaves as a monstrous mistake. Du Bois cast scorn on this attempt to write history as \"pleasant reading for Americans.\" For him, the Confederate statues represented the triumph of Dunning's sensibility. The history that justified their construction banished, once and for all, the horrors of slavery, and left American identity safe and secure.\n\nNearly a century later, we are still trying to transcend such \"pleasant reading.\" Three days after the display of white supremacy in Charlottesville, the President held an infamous press conference in Trump Tower. He blamed \"both sides\" for the violence, and went on to flatly reject the idea of removing Confederate statues, employing a not-so-deft piece of moral relativism: \"George Washington was a slave owner. . . . So will George Washington lose his statues? . . . How about Thomas Jefferson? . . . He was a major slave owner.\" For Trump, celebration of the Confederacy-a region that committed treason to defend the institution of slavery- was American history. By playing on the knowledge that Washington and Jefferson were, to most Americans, unimpeachable, he sought to suggest that there was an argument for Lee, too, and to imply that taking down statues of the general was a slippery slope which would somehow unravel our most basic assumptions about America. His then chief of staff, General John Kelly, agreed, giving an interview, on Fox News, in which he said that protests of the statues showed \"a lack of appreciation of history, and what history is.\"\n\nTrump's and Kelly's understanding of history is precisely what Baldwin critiqued in 1968. But Baldwin also insisted that such lies might enable us, if we're honest, to tell the story of America differently. Trump, for all his bluster, asked a necessary question: What do we do with George Washington? For the President, this question was simplistic, binary: Do Washington's statues stay up or come down? But that's not how history works. We might ask, instead, what the story of slavery and Reconstruction-or of Washington and Jefferson-looks like when it neither glosses over the cruelty of this country nor rejects its potential for betterment.\n\nSomething like this question confronted the community of Princeton University, where I teach, in November, 2015. That month, the Black Justice League, a student activist organization on campus, staged a thirty-three-hour sit-in at the president's office. The action was part of a national student movement in support of anti-racism protests at the University of Missouri. In one of the Black Justice League's many demands, the students requested that the administration \"publicly acknowledge the racist legacy of Woodrow Wilson,\" rename the Wilson residential college and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and remove a mural of Wilson in one of the school's dining halls.\n\nThis demand cut to the heart of Princeton's self-understanding. Wilson was the president of the university from 1902 to 1910; much of what the school is, as a serious institution of higher learning, has been attributed to him. But the students wanted the university to complicate the story it told itself about Wilson, to acknowledge what his racist legacy meant to its black students, and to consider how that legacy, represented in public space, devalued them. There was indignity, they argued, in sleeping or eating in a building named after someone who thought you an inferior human being.\n\nSpurred by the students' protest, Princeton's president, Christopher Eisgruber, and the school's board of trustees established a committee to reëxamine the ways in which the university commemorated Wilson. Scholars, biographers, and members of the school community were invited to contribute to the conversation. Nell Painter, an emerita professor and the author of \" The History of White People ,\" spoke to the heart of the matter. \"It's all about the questions we ask,\" she said. \"The questions have changed. I mean, the questions always change. That's why we keep writing history.\"\n\nIn the end, Princeton chose not to remove Wilson's name from the buildings, but it did agree to deepen its story of Wilson. Signage around campus and within dormitories now gives a fuller sense of Wilson's segregationist views, and of Princeton's exclusionary history. The school also agreed to diversify representation across the campus. One of the administration's most important decisions was to rename West College, which houses the dean of the college and the undergraduate admissions office, after Toni Morrison, who taught for many years at the university.\n\nThe issue is far from resolved. Black students at Princeton aren't interlopers. They are not guests on campus or beneficiaries of charity who should be grateful to the school. They are, unlike in Wilson's day, an integral part of the community. And, like all students on campus, they should feel a sense of possession of the university. Much more work needs to be done, but their protest brilliantly forced the university to reassess its past in the full light of its current values.\n\nTheir protest might also help us think about Trump's and Kelly's view of \"what history is.\" As a first principle, history cannot be equated with comfort, nostalgia, or a fixed arc of progress. We need to get the facts right; otherwise, we are trading only in what Du Bois called \"lies agreed upon.\" In particular, we can't elide the facts that complicate how we might see a historical figure or event. Washington held slaves, and he didn't treat them very well. Jefferson wrote brilliantly about democracy, and he also owned slaves, exploited Sally Hemings, the enslaved mother of his children, and wondered aloud if black people were biologically inferior. The record shows this to be true.\n\nAnd yet the facts alone aren't enough. What we do with them, the kinds of questions we ask about them, and for what ends, matter. For some, the fact that Washington and Jefferson owned slaves disqualifies them as moral exemplars. For others, the men may have been wrong in owning slaves, but that fact stands alongside other, more admirable aspects of their lives. William Dunning's interpretation of Reconstruction was different from Du Bois's. Each of these interpretations reveals something about what is valued, and about how the past as told speaks to the present. Our appeals to history can never be entirely objective; they aim, just as often, to clarify our commitments today.\n\nThis is why, in moments of revolution or profound cultural shifts, one of the first things that people remove are symbols of old values. Many of Lenin's and Stalin's statues, for example, had to fall. Since the murder of George Floyd , in May, by a white police officer, Confederate monuments across the country have been either toppled or removed. But it's telling that Robert E. Lee continues to stand tall in Charlottesville, where Heyer died. We have the facts straight, and know what values Lee represented, but there remains, no matter the protests, disagreement on what story should be told. As Baldwin put it, in \"No Name in the Street,\" \"One may see that the history, which is now indivisible from oneself, has been full of errors and excesses; but this is not the same thing as seeing that, for millions of people, this history . . . has been nothing but an intolerable yoke, a stinking prison, a shrieking grave.\" If white people in America choose to accept the lie, Baldwin argued, others would never be free to reject it. And rejecting the lie was, for him, the precondition to progress.\n\nThis is not an easy conclusion to accept. One of the unique features of American nationalism is how closely interwoven the idea of America is with the identity of the white people who live in it. For those who cling to this idea, the fear is that admitting the evils of slavery, or the continued harms of oppression, will make the idea of America-and they themselves-irredeemable. They would rather find safety in the lie. But if the condition of our love for country is a lie then the love itself, no matter how genuine, is a lie. The idea may be irredeemable. That does not mean we are, too.\n\nIn August, 1965, Baldwin published an essay in Ebony called \"The White Man's Guilt.\" It had been a difficult year. Malcolm X was assassinated in February. In March, the world witnessed the brutality of Alabama state troopers attacking protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma. And, on August 11th, the Watts riots exploded across Los Angeles, largely in response to violence by the police. In his essay, Baldwin demanded a confrontation with a history that white America desperately avoided. \"White man, hear me!\" he wrote. \"History, as nearly no one seems to know, is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us.\"\n\nAn honest encounter with the past, then, had everything to do with the kinds of people we understood ourselves to be and the kinds of people we aspired to become. Baldwin wanted to free us from the shackles of a particular national story, so that we might create ourselves anew. For this to happen, white America needed to shatter the myths that secured its innocence. \"People who imagine that history flatters them,\" he wrote, \"are impaled on their history like a butterfly on a pin and become incapable of seeing or changing themselves, or the world.\" Trump and his followers stand in a long lineage of such people, who use a certain understanding of the past to reinforce the injustices of the present.

      "text": "The History That James Baldwin Wanted America to See\n\nOn March 16, 1968, James Baldwin walked to the podium at a fund-raiser, at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel, to introduce Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Baldwin had recently arrived in Los Angeles from New York, after Columbia Pictures had bought the rights to Alex Haley's \" The Autobiography of Malcolm X \" and asked Baldwin to write the script. Though eager, he had ended up fighting desperately to bring his story of Malcolm to the screen. Baldwin wanted Billy Dee Williams to play the lead, but the studio had other actors in mind. There were even rumors that someone had suggested a darkened Charlton Heston.\n\nThe fund-raiser was meant to replenish the coffers of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (S.C.L.C.) and to help fund King's latest project, the Poor People's Campaign. King wanted to make the case for massive direct action, in Washington, D.C., on behalf of the country's impoverished. To do so, he would need to marshal greater financial resources than ever before. Desegregating lunch counters didn't cost much, but ending poverty would cost the nation billions of dollars.\n\nKing found that many who once supported his desegregation efforts were less than enthusiastic about his agenda on jobs and poverty. The idea of occupying the nation's capital with poor people scared many activists-even some on the board of the S.C.L.C. For others, such as Bayard Rustin, a trusted adviser to King since the days of the Montgomery bus boycott, such an act of civil disobedience courted violence and threatened to turn even more white Americans against the civil-rights agenda. Rustin wanted the S.C.L.C. to focus on electing Democrats to political office, not on building a tent city or staging sit-ins at congressional offices.\n\nHow Baldwin ended up at the fund-raiser is unclear, although Marlon Brando, who organized it, may have invited him; the two were close. In any case, Baldwin had not been expecting to introduce King, and his short speech said little about the leader. Instead, he told a brief story about the promise of the early days of the civil-rights movement, a promise that was betrayed by the country. \"What Rosa Parks was saying in Montgomery, in 1956, and what the Negroes were saying in their march . . . the country did not want to hear or did not hear,\" Baldwin told the audience. \"And as time rolled on and kids, including people like Stokely Carmichael, were being beaten with chains, going to jail, marching up and down those dusty highways, trying to change the conscience of this country, still nobody heard and nobody really cared.\" Baldwin's speech was all about the wall of white supremacy that stood in the way of fundamental transformation. His was an effort to jog the memory and, by extension, the morality of the audience, by telling a different story about what happened to a movement on the brink of failure.\n\nWhen King reached the podium, he did not acknowledge Baldwin specifically, and instead offered a generic thanks to all those who had spoken before him. It was only later that the two men conferred privately. \"We sat down in a relatively secluded corner and tried to bring each other up to date. Alas, it would never be possible. . . .\" Baldwin recalled in his book \" No Name in the Street ,\" from 1972. \"We had first met during the last days of the Montgomery bus boycott-and how long ago was that? It was senseless to say, eight years, ten years ago-it was longer ago than time can reckon.\"\n\nBaldwin's general sense of the encounter was that King was a bit skeptical of him. Although Baldwin had known King since his first trip to the South, in 1957, and had worked beside him over the years, he felt that King was discomfited by his presence. \"Martin and I had never got to know each other well,\" he wrote. \"Circumstances, if not temperament, made that impossible.\" In 1963, King was caught on tape, by the F.B.I., expressing concern about Baldwin. He didn't want to appear on television with the writer, he said, because Baldwin \"was uninformed regarding his movement.\" To King, Baldwin was not a civil-rights leader; he was just one celebrity, among many, willing to lend his star power to the movement. It's not impossible to imagine, too, that Baldwin's queerness unsettled him.\n\nBy the time of the fund-raiser, the distance between the two men had been widened by Baldwin's sympathies for the militancy of the younger generation. He was in Hollywood, after all, writing a screenplay on Malcolm X. And, just a month earlier, Baldwin had hosted a birthday party and fund-raiser for Huey P. Newton, the jailed leader of the Black Panther Party. In 1968, King felt intense pressure from such radical groups, and from recent shifts in the political climate. The nation had seemed to turn its back on his moral vision. Writing in The New York Review of Books, Andrew Kopkind, a white journalist of the New Left, declared that King had been \"outstripped by his times.\" A young black woman, who supported Carmichael's Black Power philosophy, had even accused King of selling out the Selma movement, as he and other members of the S.C.L.C. board arrived for a meeting in Washington, D.C.\n\nBaldwin had long seen this turn against King on the horizon. In 1961, he had written an article for Harper's Magazine titled \"The Dangerous Road Before Martin Luther King.\" In it, he noted how King's voice had changed from the heady days of the bus boycott, and detailed the challenges that King was destined to face as a black leader in a revolutionary time. \"He was more beleaguered than he had ever been before, and not only by his enemies in the white South,\" Baldwin wrote. \"Three years earlier, I had not encountered very many people-I am speaking now of Negroes-who were really critical of him. But many more people seemed critical of him now, were bitter, disappointed, skeptical.\"\n\nBaldwin argued that King had to confront the meaning of a new, uncompromising spirit in the movement. Leaders like him were being challenged by their children, who rejected the underlying premise that made \"the traditional black leader\" necessary in the first place. As Baldwin put it, \"These young people have never believed in the American image of the Negro and have never bargained with the Republic, and now they never will. There is no longer any basis on which to bargain.\"\n\nEven in 1961, Baldwin had sensed that these young people might have a point. By 1968, when he gave his speech in Anaheim, he saw clearly how the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, a few years earlier, might offer white America the sense of self-congratulation that Black Power was now denying it. He knew that the civil-rights movement could easily be conscripted into the story of how Americans, in their inherent goodness, had perfected the Union. The history being made could be bent in service of the lie. For Baldwin, that lie had to be challenged at its root-which is why, perhaps, he devoted his introduction to telling a true story of the movement.\n\nSurprisingly, after Baldwin had finished speaking, King gave a speech that echoed Baldwin's account. It wasn't a story of American triumphalism. Instead, King expressed concern that the movement was losing the battle for the soul of the nation. He conjured, without a hint of nostalgia, a history of people acting heroically against the odds, a history full of disappointment and trauma. He did not mince words: America was a decidedly racist country. \"The problem can only be solved when there is a kind of coalition of conscience,\" he said. \"Now I am not sure if we have that many consciences left. Too many have gone to sleep.\"\n\nLike Baldwin, King struggled with America's commitment to the belief that white people mattered more, and to the lie that made that belief palatable. \"I must honestly confess that I go through those moments of disappointment when I have to recognize the fact that there aren't enough white persons in our country who are willing to cherish democratic principles over privilege,\" he said. \"But I'm grateful to God that some are left.\" As King brought his speech to a close, he tried, once more, to reach for the promise of America, vowing that the country would one day move forward because, \"however much she strays away from it, the goal of America is freedom.\" His sombre tone betrayed his words.\n\nThe importance of history had been in full view for both Baldwin and King just a few weeks earlier, at a Carnegie Hall event, in New York City, celebrating what would have been the hundredth birthday of W. E. B. Du Bois, the great African-American intellectual and the co-founder of the N.A.A.C.P. Du Bois, after seven decades of fighting for racial justice in the United States, had given up on America and died, in exile, in Accra, Ghana, on the eve of the March on Washington, in 1963. Although Baldwin had been working on an essay about Du Bois, he chose the occasion at Carnegie Hall to read a recently published piece, \"Black Power.\" Here, at this celebration of Du Bois, who dedicated his life to exposing America's lies, Baldwin sought to shift the balance of concern from criticism of militancy among young black people to an honest assessment of the conditions that made such a turn necessary.\n\nKing disagreed with the rhetoric and symbolism of Black Power. He found no use for what he called a \"mystique of blackness\" or \"the angry militant who fails to organize.\" But he, too, was a student of Du Bois's work, and he understood what Du Bois taught regarding \"our tasks of emancipation.\" \"One idea he insistently taught,\" King said in his speech at the event, \"was that black people have been kept in oppression and deprivation by a poisonous fog of lies that depicted them as inferior, born deficient, and deservedly doomed to servitude to the grave.\"\n\nKing's remarks at Carnegie Hall, like his remarks in Anaheim, were shadowed by a note of despair. The country was in turmoil. \"Negroes have heavy tasks today,\" he said. \"We were partially liberated and then reënslaved.\" Although black people had been fighting for freedom \"for more than a hundred years,\" the only thing that was \"explicitly certain is that the struggle for it will endure.\"\n\nBaldwin and King would be together one last time, at a fund-raiser in New York City. Baldwin didn't have a suit for the occasion, so he ran out to have one fitted. Later, he returned to California to work on the Malcolm X film, the direction of which he was still debating with studio executives. On the night of April 4, 1968, Baldwin was sitting by his swimming pool with Billy Dee Williams, listening to an Aretha Franklin record, when the phone rang. It was his friend David Moses. \"Jimmy,\" Moses said. \"Martin's just been shot. He's not dead yet, but it's a head wound, so . . .\" Baldwin dropped the phone and wept. A few days later, he wore his new suit to King's funeral.\n\nBaldwin was hardly naïve about the human capacity for evil, especially in white folk. \"If you're a Negro, you're in the center of that peculiar affliction,\" he said, \"because anybody can touch you-when the sun goes down. You know, you're the target of everybody's fantasies.\" But what shocked him was that white America had killed someone who espoused love, an apostle of nonviolence. King's death revealed the depths of white America's debasement and the scope of black America's peril. \"Perhaps even more than the death itself, the manner of his death has forced me into a judgment concerning human life and human beings which I have always been reluctant to make,\" he wrote. \"Incontestably, alas, most people are not, in action, worth very much; and yet, every human being is an unprecedented miracle. One tries to treat them as the miracles they are, while trying to protect oneself against the disasters they've become.\"\n\nIf King was the preacher, Baldwin was the poet, and he sought to account for his confusion by gathering up the pieces-of himself, of black folk-buried beneath the disaster that was the country. That work kept his despair at arm's length. To be sure, King's death, just like those of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and all the others, did not stop time. White people did not stop being white people. Two days after King's murder, the Black Panther Bobby Hutton was killed by Oakland police officers. Later, police rioted in Chicago, during the Democratic National Convention. The nastiness of the white world kept coming, and it gave black politics-and Baldwin's voice-an edge. King's death had revealed the bitterness at the bottom of the cup. What Baldwin saw on that dangerous road that led to King's death, in Memphis, was the difficult question of whether or not the country had the courage to confront its demons. Could America tell itself the truth about how it had arrived at this moment? And did it have the moral stamina to surrender the comfort of its lies?\n\nIn July of 1968, just a few months after King's assassination and against the backdrop of American cities burning, Baldwin gave an interview to Esquire . He set the tone of the exchange from the very start:\n\nQ. How can we get the black people to cool it?\n\nA. It is not for us to cool it.\n\nQ. But aren't you the ones who are getting hurt the most?\n\nA. No, we are only the ones who are dying fastest.\n\nThe editors did not seem to grasp how the moral burden of America's nightmare rested not on the black people rioting in the streets but on the white people who held tightly to the belief that they were somehow, because of the color of their skin, better than others. These people, Baldwin argued, had to see themselves otherwise. New laws, gestures of sympathy, and acts of racial charity would never suffice to change the course of the country. Something more radical had to be done; a different history had to be told. \"All that can save you now is your confrontation with your own history . . . which is not your past, but your present,\" Baldwin said. \"Your history has led you to this moment, and you can only begin to change yourself by looking at what you are doing in the name of your history.\"\n\nOn August 12, 2017, James Fields, Jr., a twenty-year-old self-proclaimed neo-Nazi from Kenton, Kentucky, floored the gas pedal of his 2010 Dodge Challenger and roared down a narrow street full of anti-racist protesters, during the \"Unite the Right\" rally, in Charlottesville, Virginia. Heather Heyer, who was raised in nearby Ruckersville, was in the crowd. According to people who knew her, Heyer, thirty-two, had spent much of her life \"standing up against any type of discrimination.\" As Fields's speeding car sent shoes, cell phones, and bodies flying into the air, Ryan Kelly, a photographer for the Daily Progress, captured the carnage. Heyer is framed between a man falling behind the car's back bumper, one Air Jordan-clad foot twisted horribly in the air, and the tattooed torso of a white man in mid-somersault. She is leaning to the side as the muscle car hits her and plows through the crowd. Heyer died at the scene, and dozens more were injured. Fields was eventually convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe occasion of this violence was a bitter battle over American history and how we ought to remember it. In March, 2016, Wes Bellamy, Charlottesville's vice-mayor and a member of its city council, advocated for the removal of Confederate monuments to Robert E. Lee and Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson. Zyahna Bryant, a high-school freshman in Charlottesville, joined Bellamy's effort. She circulated a petition demanding the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in a local park and submitted it to the council. The council agreed to remove the statue by a vote of three to two.\n\nThen, in 2017, all hell broke loose. Emboldened by the election of Donald Trump , who had often and overtly appealed to white identity, local white nationalists saw an opportunity to exploit the council's decision. The nationalists believed that the actions of the council were an assault on white people. In their view, the soldiers of political correctness had disfigured and distorted American history, in general, and Southern history, in particular. Their outrage prompted the \"Unite the Right\" rally, the largest gathering of white nationalists and neo-Nazis in recent memory. That day ended with Fields's murderous drive on Fourth Street.\n\nIt is telling that such brutality broke out over a fight regarding the symbols and uses of American history. As both Baldwin and King insisted, each in their own way, America is an identity that white people will protect at any cost, and the country's history-its founding documents, its national heroes, its claim to be a moral force in the world-is the supporting argument that underpins that identity. This history is inseparable from the nation's built environment; both monuments and the ways in which communities are spatially organized reinforce it. When King declared that the country's moral vision had been clouded by \"a poisonous fog of lies,\" and when Baldwin said in Esquire that we needed to look at what we are doing in the name of our history, both were arguing that this history, the story we tell ourselves about what the country is, shapes the world we make going forward.\n\nThe debate over Confederate monuments makes this plain. For white nationalists, the Confederacy represents a triumph of a certain understanding of America, in which the superiority of white people in all social, political, and cultural arrangements is enshrined. From that perspective, open-air tributes to white supremacy make sense. The more complex question is what we do with those who are willing to condemn neo-Nazis but who still claim Confederate statues as part of their \"heritage.\" These are the people for whom Judge Richard E. Moore, of the Charlottesville Circuit Court, ruled, in April, 2019, that the Confederate statues must remain in the area. \"While some people obviously see Lee and Jackson as symbols of white supremacy, others see them as brilliant military tacticians or complex leaders in a difficult time,\" Moore wrote in his decision.\n\nMoore was presenting a different narrative about the statues. After Charlottesville, though, American historians made clear that the monuments were not, in fact, erected as contemporaneous memorials of the Civil War. Most were built many years later, either between the eighteen-nineties and the first decades of the twentieth century, when most of the Confederate veterans began to die, or in the nineteen-fifties, when the demand for racial equality intensified. They were, in other words, monuments to an ideology, physical representations of the \"Lost Cause\" in public space. They insisted on the false claim that the Civil War centered not on slavery but on the heroic defense of the Southern way of life.\n\nBlack people challenged these monuments even as they were being built. In \" Black Reconstruction in America ,\" from 1935, Du Bois exposed the lies at the heart of that era's historiography, unmasking the influential works of the political scientist John W. Burgess and the historian William A. Dunning. The Dunning School, the first generation of trained historians to write about Reconstruction, told the story of the period as one of extensive overreach of federal power and the corruption of northern carpetbaggers; Dunning viewed the granting of political rights to former slaves as a monstrous mistake. Du Bois cast scorn on this attempt to write history as \"pleasant reading for Americans.\" For him, the Confederate statues represented the triumph of Dunning's sensibility. The history that justified their construction banished, once and for all, the horrors of slavery, and left American identity safe and secure.\n\nNearly a century later, we are still trying to transcend such \"pleasant reading.\" Three days after the display of white supremacy in Charlottesville, the President held an infamous press conference in Trump Tower. He blamed \"both sides\" for the violence, and went on to flatly reject the idea of removing Confederate statues, employing a not-so-deft piece of moral relativism: \"George Washington was a slave owner. . . . So will George Washington lose his statues? . . . How about Thomas Jefferson? . . . He was a major slave owner.\" For Trump, celebration of the Confederacy-a region that committed treason to defend the institution of slavery- was American history. By playing on the knowledge that Washington and Jefferson were, to most Americans, unimpeachable, he sought to suggest that there was an argument for Lee, too, and to imply that taking down statues of the general was a slippery slope which would somehow unravel our most basic assumptions about America. His then chief of staff, General John Kelly, agreed, giving an interview, on Fox News, in which he said that protests of the statues showed \"a lack of appreciation of history, and what history is.\"\n\nTrump's and Kelly's understanding of history is precisely what Baldwin critiqued in 1968. But Baldwin also insisted that such lies might enable us, if we're honest, to tell the story of America differently. Trump, for all his bluster, asked a necessary question: What do we do with George Washington? For the President, this question was simplistic, binary: Do Washington's statues stay up or come down? But that's not how history works. We might ask, instead, what the story of slavery and Reconstruction-or of Washington and Jefferson-looks like when it neither glosses over the cruelty of this country nor rejects its potential for betterment.\n\nSomething like this question confronted the community of Princeton University, where I teach, in November, 2015. That month, the Black Justice League, a student activist organization on campus, staged a thirty-three-hour sit-in at the president's office. The action was part of a national student movement in support of anti-racism protests at the University of Missouri. In one of the Black Justice League's many demands, the students requested that the administration \"publicly acknowledge the racist legacy of Woodrow Wilson,\" rename the Wilson residential college and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and remove a mural of Wilson in one of the school's dining halls.\n\nThis demand cut to the heart of Princeton's self-understanding. Wilson was the president of the university from 1902 to 1910; much of what the school is, as a serious institution of higher learning, has been attributed to him. But the students wanted the university to complicate the story it told itself about Wilson, to acknowledge what his racist legacy meant to its black students, and to consider how that legacy, represented in public space, devalued them. There was indignity, they argued, in sleeping or eating in a building named after someone who thought you an inferior human being.\n\nSpurred by the students' protest, Princeton's president, Christopher Eisgruber, and the school's board of trustees established a committee to reëxamine the ways in which the university commemorated Wilson. Scholars, biographers, and members of the school community were invited to contribute to the conversation. Nell Painter, an emerita professor and the author of \" The History of White People ,\" spoke to the heart of the matter. \"It's all about the questions we ask,\" she said. \"The questions have changed. I mean, the questions always change. That's why we keep writing history.\"\n\nIn the end, Princeton chose not to remove Wilson's name from the buildings, but it did agree to deepen its story of Wilson. Signage around campus and within dormitories now gives a fuller sense of Wilson's segregationist views, and of Princeton's exclusionary history. The school also agreed to diversify representation across the campus. One of the administration's most important decisions was to rename West College, which houses the dean of the college and the undergraduate admissions office, after Toni Morrison, who taught for many years at the university.\n\nThe issue is far from resolved. Black students at Princeton aren't interlopers. They are not guests on campus or beneficiaries of charity who should be grateful to the school. They are, unlike in Wilson's day, an integral part of the community. And, like all students on campus, they should feel a sense of possession of the university. Much more work needs to be done, but their protest brilliantly forced the university to reassess its past in the full light of its current values.\n\nTheir protest might also help us think about Trump's and Kelly's view of \"what history is.\" As a first principle, history cannot be equated with comfort, nostalgia, or a fixed arc of progress. We need to get the facts right; otherwise, we are trading only in what Du Bois called \"lies agreed upon.\" In particular, we can't elide the facts that complicate how we might see a historical figure or event. Washington held slaves, and he didn't treat them very well. Jefferson wrote brilliantly about democracy, and he also owned slaves, exploited Sally Hemings, the enslaved mother of his children, and wondered aloud if black people were biologically inferior. The record shows this to be true.\n\nAnd yet the facts alone aren't enough. What we do with them, the kinds of questions we ask about them, and for what ends, matter. For some, the fact that Washington and Jefferson owned slaves disqualifies them as moral exemplars. For others, the men may have been wrong in owning slaves, but that fact stands alongside other, more admirable aspects of their lives. William Dunning's interpretation of Reconstruction was different from Du Bois's. Each of these interpretations reveals something about what is valued, and about how the past as told speaks to the present. Our appeals to history can never be entirely objective; they aim, just as often, to clarify our commitments today.\n\nThis is why, in moments of revolution or profound cultural shifts, one of the first things that people remove are symbols of old values. Many of Lenin's and Stalin's statues, for example, had to fall. Since the murder of George Floyd , in May, by a white police officer, Confederate monuments across the country have been either toppled or removed. But it's telling that Robert E. Lee continues to stand tall in Charlottesville, where Heyer died. We have the facts straight, and know what values Lee represented, but there remains, no matter the protests, disagreement on what story should be told. As Baldwin put it, in \"No Name in the Street,\" \"One may see that the history, which is now indivisible from oneself, has been full of errors and excesses; but this is not the same thing as seeing that, for millions of people, this history . . . has been nothing but an intolerable yoke, a stinking prison, a shrieking grave.\" If white people in America choose to accept the lie, Baldwin argued, others would never be free to reject it. And rejecting the lie was, for him, the precondition to progress.\n\nThis is not an easy conclusion to accept. One of the unique features of American nationalism is how closely interwoven the idea of America is with the identity of the white people who live in it. For those who cling to this idea, the fear is that admitting the evils of slavery, or the continued harms of oppression, will make the idea of America-and they themselves-irredeemable. They would rather find safety in the lie. But if the condition of our love for country is a lie then the love itself, no matter how genuine, is a lie. The idea may be irredeemable. That does not mean we are, too.\n\nIn August, 1965, Baldwin published an essay in Ebony called \"The White Man's Guilt.\" It had been a difficult year. Malcolm X was assassinated in February. In March, the world witnessed the brutality of Alabama state troopers attacking protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, in Selma. And, on August 11th, the Watts riots exploded across Los Angeles, largely in response to violence by the police. In his essay, Baldwin demanded a confrontation with a history that white America desperately avoided. \"White man, hear me!\" he wrote. \"History, as nearly no one seems to know, is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer merely, or even principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us.\"\n\nAn honest encounter with the past, then, had everything to do with the kinds of people we understood ourselves to be and the kinds of people we aspired to become. Baldwin wanted to free us from the shackles of a particular national story, so that we might create ourselves anew. For this to happen, white America needed to shatter the myths that secured its innocence. \"People who imagine that history flatters them,\" he wrote, \"are impaled on their history like a butterfly on a pin and become incapable of seeing or changing themselves, or the world.\" Trump and his followers stand in a long lineage of such people, who use a certain understanding of the past to reinforce the injustices of the present. Baldwin's vision demanded a reckoning with this understanding-not to posit the greatness of America but to establish the ground upon which that greatness could be built.\n\nIn his reflections on King, Baldwin wrote that we were witnessing the death of segregation, and that the question was how long and how expensive the funeral would be. If only he knew. More than fifty years later, we are still marching in the procession and fighting in the streets. A world is dying, but we have been slow to put it in the grave, and the costs are mounting. How many of our loved ones are rotting in prisons and jails? How many are breaking their backs trying to make ends meet? And how many souls have been darkened from the effects of America's original sin? True freedom, for all Americans, requires that we tell a better story, a true story, about how we arrived here. It is time to bury that old Negro, and the white people who so desperately need him, and to finally begin again.\n\nThis essay was drawn from \" Begin Again: James Baldwin's America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own ,\" which will be published, by Crown, in June.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Obama's Parting Gift: The Power Not to Fear White Racism\n\nThe only Inauguration I have attended, and probably the only one I ever will attend, was Barack Obama's first, eight years ago. My wife and I were nearly broke, but we gathered money from the life insurance left by my mother, who had died of lung cancer six weeks before the election. We wrapped our California kids, ages five and three, in a million layers of clothing and hats, filled thermoses with soup and hot chocolate, shared hand-warmers among us, and packed as though we were braving the Arctic tundra. The temperature in Washington was in the twenties, and we were outside for eight hours. It must have been uncomfortable. Our kids must have suffered. Their mom and I must have bickered. But I don't remember it that way. I remember laughing a lot and holding gloved hands. I remember taking turns hoisting our children on our shoulders, and our son waving a flag with Michelle's and Barack's faces on it. I remember the Metro car, packed with the bodies of strangers, breaking out into impromptu choruses of \"We Shall Overcome.\"\n\nWe felt hope that day. But that hope was the flip side of the terror, anguish, and frustration we had felt every single day before, living in a country that, for centuries, systematically abused many of its people, and then punished those people for trying to regain their humanity. To be black in America is a wild and endless assault on the senses. You can spend every day fighting off your spiritual and intellectual extinction.\n\nFor much of my childhood, I lived in a small, mostly white town along Appalachia, in the Rust Belt. By seventh grade, I spent days fighting with kids who called me nigger and nights secretly wishing I was white so that I wouldn't have to. The message arrived early that blackness was, for some reason, something bad, something that made people hate me, something that made people angry. When I was twelve, a white man drove by in a car and threw a milkshake at me as I rode a skateboard. Blackness, I learned, was so hateful that it made adults assault random children. It was as if I had a disease that made other people want to hurt me.\n\nAnd so I grew up afraid of racists. Even when I was safely at home, there was an unspoken idea that just outside the door there were men made of fire and hate who would laugh to see me suffer. When white friends talked road trips, I made up excuses. When race became the topic, I waited quietly for it to change. This is how racism is designed to work, of course: it's a form of terrorism and mind control that seeks to will you into subservience, to make you afraid to advocate for your own humanity.\n\nWhen we attended Obama's Inauguration, we were high on the hope that there might be an end to all of this. We had always more or less trusted our government to protect us from foreign threats. Now it seemed that we might trust it to protect us from domestic ones, too.\n\nAnd then we watched as Obama, in the early days of his Administration, treaded delicately in the thorny bramble of race, taking steps that pierced his flesh and drew blood. After the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., was arrested for trying to break into his own home, Obama chided the Cambridge police; his approval ratings, particularly among white voters, dipped severely . It would not be the last time he would wrongly calibrate the fervor of white America's sensitivity around race. For eight years, we watched him trying to thread the impossible needle, searching for a message that would resonate evenly with a nation of people who seemed increasingly estranged from one another. The deaths of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, John Crawford, Tamir Rice, Rekia Boyd, Sandra Bland, and others bubbled up into a movement of protests. Soon, the idea that black lives mattered was branded by some as a terrorist threat; talk of race wars slithered to daylight from the damp crevices of American consciousness.\n\nDuring the Obama years, many Americans became angrier, more defensive, and more afraid. The rise of Donald Trump, built on the message that there are barbarians at the gate, is a testament to that. But for me these eight years have had the opposite effect. I was more afraid at the beginning. My joy at Obama's Inauguration could only exist because white racism had terrified me for decades, and I hoped that Obama would be my protector.\n\nHe couldn't be. America's illness is bigger than him. Nonetheless, his Presidency had a surprising effect on me: it changed my sense of what racism is. Obama was impeccable as a President and a politician: deeply informed, thoroughly prepared, intelligent, and forthright. He treated his job with a seriousness befitting the office. I did not agree with many of his policy decisions. But I believed that he undertook them with integrity, and with a conviction that they would yield the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n\nAnd still he was called names and branded by the opposition as a failure. His citizenship and religion were called into question. Republicans in the House and Senate preferred to nearly tank the country rather than appear to be in league with him. Newscasters vociferously questioned his fitness for the job. These reactions moved beyond the terrifying and into the cartoonish. White racism, which I used to take so seriously, came, more and more, to seem childish and pitiful to me.\n\nMeanwhile, Barack and Michelle Obama-cool, collected, fiercely loyal to each other-have reflected back to me my own capacities. Representation does, in fact, matter. When I was alone among white kids, I wondered if I had any power or beauty within me. With Michelle and Barack in the White House, I knew I did.\n\nI still consider my own destruction daily. I think about doomsday scenarios and potential horrors to come. But I do not fear them. I am clear on what my worth is and what the worth of each person is. I no longer hope to avoid arousing the demons of racism-I know that such an awakening is an unavoidable result of affirming my own humanity. And there is no longer a scenario, under any President, or any Administration, in which I would refuse to do that. I have a family whom I love, and I know the difference between right and wrong.\n\nWhen Barack Obama first campaigned for President, he ran on hope. But hope, I have come to feel, is only needed by the fearful. What his Presidency left me with is power.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How Donald Trump, the Leader of White Grievance, Gained Among Hispanic Voters\n\nEight years ago, at the dawn of the Donald Trump era, Toni Morrison spoke for many liberals when she described his election as a reaction to the \"collapse of white privilege.\" In an essay called \" Making America White Again ,\" published in this magazine, Morrison argued that in the aftermath of Barack Obama's Presidency many white people felt driven to \"keep alive the perception of white superiority.\" And she lamented \"how eagerly so many white voters-both the poorly educated and the well educated-embraced the shame and fear sowed by Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis vision of Trump as the leader of an aggrieved white America took hold broadly during the early years of his term, boosted by the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, scarcely six months after he took office. Some of the marchers, who objected to the removal of a monument to Robert E. Lee , were carrying Confederate flags, and some were wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats. After a counter-protester was run over and killed by a man who had praised both Trump and Adolf Hitler, Trump delivered remarks that helped define his Presidency. \"You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides,\" he said. (He also added a qualifying follow-up: \"I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists-because they should be condemned totally.\")\n\nThe idea that Trump was a white nationalist in disguise was horrifying to his opponents, but it was also seductive, because it made him seem like a fringe character, the kind of politician who might inspire a multiracial coalition of decent folks to rise up against him. Especially, perhaps, Latinos, since invective against Hispanic immigration was so central to Trump's 2016 campaign . Instead, in his second run for the Presidency, Trump improved his performance among Hispanic voters: according to a Pew study , he lost that group by thirty-eight points in 2016, but only twenty-one points in 2020. The data seem to suggest that Joe Biden was elected President that year only because Trump underperformed among one group in particular: non-Hispanic whites.\n\nThis week, the notion of Trump as the leader of a distinctively white movement became harder to defend. Although exit-poll data can be unreliable, there are signs that, in his extraordinary comeback, he continued to assemble a coalition that is not unusually white but, rather, unusually nonwhite, by the standards of the recent Republican Party. For instance, Trump became the first Republican in more than a century to win Starr County, along the Mexican border in Texas, which is almost entirely Hispanic; he did similarly well throughout the state's majority-Hispanic border counties. It is possible that Trump also made gains among Black voters, who remain a much more reliable Democratic constituency, but we don't yet have dispositive data. One theory is that Trump does better among non-college-educated voters over all, including nonwhite ones; this argument is consistent with both his popularity among some traditionally non-Republican constituencies and his unpopularity among members of the cultural élite, including some former Republicans .\n\nLink copied\n\nAs the results rolled in on Tuesday night, the racial diversity of the Trump coalition was discussed across the cable-news spectrum. \"What we've heard from both campaigns is that Donald Trump is doing a little bit better with African Americans, especially African American men, than he did last time,\" Jake Tapper said on CNN, a little after ten o'clock, as Democrats were starting to fret. \"It's clear now that Donald Trump has picked up key support among Hispanic voters,\" Michele Norris, of MSNBC, said about an hour later, as the camera showed grave-looking Harris supporters at Howard University. \"Long term, Democrats are going to have to think about-they're losing their coalition,\" Katie Pavlich said on Fox News, at eleven-thirty-seven, by which point Trump's supporters were ready to celebrate.\n\nConsidering the tumult of the past four years, it was striking how little the Presidential candidates talked about race this year, at least explicitly. In this abbreviated campaign, unlike in 2020 , Kamala Harris seemed intent on avoiding the subject. And although, in campaigns past, political arguments about crime have often been interpreted as veiled appeals to racial identity , Trump tends to talk as if most American crime is the fault of immigrant groups-Haitian migrants, perhaps, or Venezuelan gangs. Claims like these are insulting to those immigrant groups, but they are also flattering to a broad range of Americans, who can imagine themselves as part of a diverse country where all the locals are basically well behaved.\n\nLate in the campaign, during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, one of his opening acts, the antagonistic comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, threatened to disrupt this state of affairs. He made a joke about Puerto Rico being a \"floating island of garbage,\" which for a time became the campaign's top story. Nicky Jam, a reggaetón star from the island, un-endorsed Trump (\" Puerto Rico se respeta ,\" he said-\"Respect Puerto Rico\"), and Democrats traded hopeful stories about Puerto Rican voters on the mainland who were angrily turning against Trump. But, like so many things that happened during the campaign, this didn't seem to matter much: Osceola, a majority-Hispanic county in Florida with a large Puerto Rican population, swung from a fourteen-point Biden victory in 2020 to a narrow Trump victory this year.\n\nIt's possible, maybe likely, that Trump's second term will bring a new series of statements or policies that reinvigorates our old arguments about racism in America, and that gives fresh ammunition to critics who view him as a white supremacist in disguise, or perhaps not in disguise. It is true, too, that what it means to be white in America has changed over time; perhaps Trump's coalition will help Americans rethink the assumption that \"white\" and \"Hispanic\" are mutually exclusive categories, and will boost a new version of the old white identity. But, as far as we can tell, Trump's America is a place that is more polarized by education than it used to be and less polarized by whiteness and non-whiteness-by race, broadly understood. This switch, if it holds, may be bad for Democrats, at least in the short term. But if one party no longer represents whiteness so specifically, isn't that good for America? ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

But not everyone wants it on their street.\n\nby Alvin Chang\n\nThere's a small town in Minnesota called Worthington. It's a place that fascinates sociologists.\n\nIn the 1980s, Worthington was on its way to becoming a ghost town, like many other white, blue-collar communities.\n\nBut in 1989, the local pork processing plant added 650 jobs and attracted new workers, many of Mexican descent, by giving them one free week of lodging and food.\n\nBy the early 1990s, about 5 percent of the town's population was Mexican. People told their friends and family about these jobs, and more and more Hispanic workers came to Worthington - a phenomenon called chain migration.\n\nBy 2010, more than one in three residents were Hispanic.\n\nWorthington is so fascinating to sociologists because it shows a new type of migration - one they say they've never seen before. Traditionally, immigrants from Latin America and Asia live in gateway cities like San Francisco, New York, and Miami. But now, Cornell University sociologist Dan Lichter said, \"You've got these different population groups that are spreading out in ways we haven't seen in the past.\"\n\nPart of it is nonwhite Americans leaving urban enclaves and going to the suburbs. It's a fulfillment of the traditional American dream - a path European immigrants took in past generations to leave poor, segregated neighborhoods that relegated them to a lower social class.\n\nThe other part is new immigrants going directly to the suburbs and other traditionally white areas, like Worthington.\n\nBut this isn't a story about what minorities have done. It's about how many white people have reacted to increasing exposure to nonwhite populations, who are following in their footsteps and pursuing the traditional American dream. The reaction is not always articulated or even intentional; in fact, most people say they want to live in a diverse and integrated community; they, too, have the dream that no one will be judged by the color of their skin.\n\nBut data shows that as minorities move into suburbs, white families are making small and personal decisions that add velocity to the momentum of discrimination. They are increasingly choosing to self-segregate into racially isolated communities - \"hunkering down,\" as Lichter likes to call it - and preserving a specific kind of dream.\n\nA few years ago, researchers conducted an experiment in which they took a group of about 200 white people and primed some of them with different news articles. When the respondents were reminded about America's growing diversity, they showed more bias against black people.\n\n\"These findings are consistent with a concept known as Group Threat Theory, which is the idea that when minority groups grow in size or power, the majority group feels threatened,\" wrote Washington University researcher Allison Skinner.\n\nIt plays out in broader polls too.\n\nA recent PRRI survey showed that half of Republicans - and one in three Americans - believe more racial diversity would have a negative impact on America:\n\nA growing number of people are worried about the country becoming majority minority, including one in three Trump supporters.\n\nAnd more than half of white Americans believe the country's \"way of life\" needs to be protected against foreign influences. About 84 percent of Trump supporters feel that way.\n\n\"People like Trump were able to exploit exposure to race, now that all these areas are exposed,\" Lichter said.\n\nThe phrase \"way of life\" is imprecise, and perhaps it could indicate an allegiance to vague terms like freedom and liberty. But coded in the context is the assumption that our American culture is static - that what we have now, even though this differs for everyone, is more American than what outsiders can bring.\n\nThis type of migration is perhaps the inevitable outcome of a diversifying nation that takes pride in its specific narrative of upward mobility. Starting in the 1970s, Asians and Latin Americans began arriving to the US in large numbers. Now most public school children are nonwhite. By 2020 , most children will be nonwhite. And by 2045 , most people in America will be nonwhite.\n\nBut in most communities, white families haven't overtly resisted.\n\nFor example, in the Los Angeles suburb of San Marino, a large number of Chinese families began moving in - and despite some underlying unrest, there wasn't much coarse rhetoric about race, according to Columbia University sociologist Merlin Chowkwanyun. Rather, more white families moved out, fewer moved in - and by 2005 there were stories like this one in the local paper where a white mother lamented :\n\nI know [my daughter] can do it, get good enough grades, so it doesn't bother me. But to hear her say she can't win [a social chair] election because Asians vote for Asians, that bothers me.\n\nIn Worthington, rumors cropped up that the town had become dangerous, even though crime data shows it wasn't any more dangerous than similarly sized towns.\n\nThese are the kinds of passive tensions that have cropped up with this new trend of migration. There is, however, a small community of people who are taking this in-group favoritism and developing it into a more nativist ideology. The most concise and unfiltered expression comes from former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz, who said a few months ago , \"I don't want to become you. I don't want to speak your language. I don't want to celebrate your holidays. I sure as hell don't want to cheer for your soccer teams.\"\n\nWhile this crude expression of nativism is less common, though perhaps on the upswing, it is a sentiment that has been historically engineered into the fabric of this nation - with xenophobic immigration laws, with discriminatory housing laws, with Jim Crow laws, with slavery. There's less overt discrimination now, but we're still at the mercy of this segregating momentum that our past has inflicted upon us. It still decides where we live and whom we live with.\n\nA few years ago, researchers invited a handful of Illinois residents to talk to them about where they lived.\n\nOn one side of the table was a researcher. On the other side was a resident. And in between, on a table, was a simple map of the Chicago metropolitan area.\n\nThe residents talked about how they ended up living where they do now. They talked about the neighborhoods they've been to and ones they haven't. And usually, without prompting, they talked about race.\n\nResidents would point to an area they've never been before, an area in the outer suburbs, and assume it was a white and wealthy area. They'd do the same with the inner city but assume it was a poor black area. Without any real evidence, there was a mental map built into the city's geography.\n\nWatching all of this behind a window was University of Illinois sociologist Maria Krysan. This was part of an experiment she was doing for an upcoming book.\n\nWhat makes her research unique is her fascination with the process of where we end up living, and not just the outcome.\n\nRecent migrations patterns don't necessarily show the same kind of \"white flight\" we saw in the 1960s, where a neighborhood's demographic shifts drastically in just a couple of years because white people leave. Rather, Krysan said, \"In the last several decades, the demographic characterization is less about the flight - less about whites fleeing a certain type of neighborhood - and more about decisions that people make when looking at where they're going to move next.\"\n\nOne thing she's found when she asked Chicago-area residents about their housing search is that people of all races say they want to live in a relatively diverse, integrated neighborhood.\n\nWhen it comes time for the housing search, black and Latino residents look in neighborhoods that are as diverse as they say they want.\n\nWhite residents \"give a socially acceptable answer in the abstract,\" Krysan said, but they end up searching and living in much less diverse areas.\n\nWhat this shows is that it's not black and Latino people who are self-segregating into neighborhoods - a myth that is often perpetuated, Krysan said. Rather, it's white residents who say they want more diversity but end up looking in less diverse areas.\n\nKrysan found similar results when she gave nearly 800 adults in Cook County, Illinois, a diagram of a neighborhood and asked them to fill out their ideal racial and ethnic mix.\n\nThen she asked residents to construct a neighborhood in which they would feel least comfortable.\n\nWhat she found was that people, on average, wanted a specific kind of diversity.\n\nFor example, white residents said their ideal neighborhood was about half white, with other racial groups filling out the rest of the community. But the neighborhood they least desired had a lot more African Americans and Arab Americans.\n\nThe primary reason white respondents said they'd be uncomfortable in their least desired neighborhood was poor neighborhood quality - especially crime. A close second was cultural differences and concerns. One white respondent told the researchers:\n\nIf this were the neighborhood makeup, you could almost be certain that it would be lower income, higher crime, worse school. Not because of inherent characteristics of these people, but people of these backgrounds have a lower socioeconomic status and opportunity for education. Also I am just not used to ... it would be a culture shock. Just like moving into any new culture. It is difficult in general to see people that don't look like them.\n\nThere's certainly an amount of segregation caused by poverty, which is more rampant in communities of color. But research by Indiana University sociologist Samuel Kye found that even in middle-class suburbs, a strong presence of minority groups causes white families to stop moving in. This has caused segregation in Asian and Latino suburbs to actually get worse in the past 25 years, and segregation in black suburbs to stay high.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, white suburbanites reacted very differently to minorities, specifically black people, moving into their neighborhoods. Some communities prevented minorities from moving into their town with various housing and legal maneuvers. Chowkwanyun, the Columbia sociologist, said in virtually every suburban newspaper in that era, there were reports of confrontation and violence when a black person moved in.\n\nThis is where recent minority suburbanization differs from black suburbanization of past generations: When Chowkwanyun studied California's San Gabriel Valley, where Asian Americans became a large part of the population, he said he could find few overt conflicts.\n\nRather, it was a passive reaction. When white families moved out, they were more often replaced by Asian households, which is in line with what much of the research tells us about other similar suburbs.\n\nResearch led by Lichter, the Cornell sociologist, shows that in the past 25 years, the segregation between white people and minorities hasn't changed much within cities; racial groups are still very separate, though slightly less so. What has changed, though, is how segregated one town is from another.\n\nWhite families are increasingly self-segregating themselves in new ways - and it's largely in the form of their moving decisions. Lichter's research shows white households are now moving to what sociologists call the \"exurbs\" - gated communities, unincorporated housing developments, and the countryside. This is why the only communities in the US that have seen significant white growth are places that were already predominantly white.\n\n\"You've got one group of white Americans who are comfortable with diversity and integrating with minorities, including blacks and Hispanics and Asians,\" he said, \"and another America that is hunkering down in overwhelmingly white areas in overwhelmingly white places - and you see them moving further out.\"\n\n\"There are new forms of segregation taking place here, where a lot of this is motivated by what whites do - the white reaction to minority growth, rather than what minorities themselves are doing,\" Lichter said. \"The exposure of whites to minorities is just at a standstill, even though these communities have become more diverse. Whites are leaving these areas that are diversifying.\"\n\nEven when predominantly white suburbs are surrounded by diverse communities, other research shows white families aren't as comfortable moving into those nearby areas .\n\nAnd even when white families live in relatively diverse suburbs or urban neighborhoods, the one place integration has to be faced head on is in traditional public schools, where catchment areas determine where your child goes.\n\nIn a place like North Carolina, white families are using charter schools to escape this system . And as a whole, studies show that charter schools have created more segregation than traditional schools. It can be a tool to integrate schools, but that's not what's happening - white children who choose to go to charter schools are choosing to go to predominantly white schools, and black children to a predominantly black one. In short, charter schools are being used by some as a self-segregation tool.\n\nAnd it's contributed to the increasing rate of predominantly black and Hispanic schools with high poverty levels.\n\n\"They just want to keep with their own spaces, and not go beyond that,\" said Casey Cobb, a University of Connecticut education researcher. \"That's a vehicle that allows them to continue to do that. Their preferences are being allowed to play out.\"\n\nThis is what is exceedingly clear: Many white families in America, many of whom have ancestors who fulfilled the journey of the American dream, want to live in a certain type of community and want their kids to be educated in a certain type of school. It's often not malicious, not overt, and not articulated. It's just the broad pattern of how white Americans move about this land, and perhaps that's the definition of a privilege that is increasingly being called out.\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn't always leave room for racial and ethnic minorities to do the same.\n\nOne of the first things I said to Maria Krysan, the University of Illinois sociologist, was that her research gave me hope.\n\nThe reason is that it breaks down why people move to certain places, and it's not necessarily because they explicitly don't want to be around other racial groups.\n\nIn the experiment I described before, where she had researchers talk to residents using a map as a conversational object, Krysan said she was fascinated by how people talked about places they'd never even been to.\n\nIt points to this mental map that everyone has of their surroundings - and often, she says that knowledge comes from social networks, lived experiences, and the media. These things aren't always accurate. We're more familiar with some places, which makes our perception of them more accurate.\n\nThis builds on research she did on people in the Chicago area, where she asked people of different races if they knew anything about various neighborhoods.\n\nThe reason she asked this question was because, as she says, \"It's very hard to move to a place if you've never heard of it.\"\n\nWhat she found was that white respondents had a blind spot for neighborhoods that were diverse, even if they were majority white. Meanwhile, African Americans were less likely to know about far-flung suburbs.\n\nIf you've ever moved in your life - or 17 times, in my case - this makes perfect sense. Krysan said, \"If my friends all look like me, their knowledge is about places where people like me live.\"\n\nSure, research seems to show that some white families just don't want to live near too many minorities. But a certain amount of this appears to be about being conscious of the systemic racism of the past that separates us by socioeconomic class, by social networks, and by where we live.\n\nPart of the reason white people may not be looking for housing in neighborhoods that are as diverse as they say they want might be because they just don't know about these areas or have inaccurate preconceptions about them.\n\nIt's this societal momentum that this country spent a lot of money and effort engineering - one that's discriminatory and xenophobic. That's why housing advocates celebrated the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the Fair Housing Act can be used to \"affirmatively further fair housing.\" In other words, it said public policy should proactively promote racial integration.\n\nMany opponents believe this is governmental overreach. Trump's nominee for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, said this would allow the government to do \"social engineering.\"\n\nTo that, housing advocate Erin Boggs says: \"We have already been socially engineered. We're living in a socially engineered environment because of our history.\"\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. said the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice - and it's something Obama has espoused often during his presidency. But the arc seems rigged so far the other way, and not just in depth but in breadth. It seems segregation is like a strong wave - and if you don't swim against the tide, if you do nothing, then we go backward.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAntiracism work continues in 2021, but the events of January 6 prove that fighting bigotry is a journey.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\n2020, marked by a deadly pandemic and rampant police brutality that took the lives of Black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, was devastating, to say the least. But there were glimmers of hope: Both of those horrors caused a portion of white Americans to finally realize, and maybe even accept, that racism is the root cause of many of America's moral failures.\n\nBut then came 2021, and the president made his most successful attempt yet in his long history of stirring up white violence : On January 6, throngs of Trump supporters, many of them white, unmasked themselves as insurrectionists and stormed the Capitol, leading to the death of five people, besmirching what's left of American dignity, and putting democracy in serious danger. Many Americans expressed shock about what happened in the capital city - they didn't see it coming. They didn't think that people were going to go to such extreme lengths as scaling the Capitol and potentially threatening the lives of lawmakers to uphold the white status quo. It was as if all anti-racism work went out the window.\n\n\"I think for many Black folks, Latinx folks, Native folks, and for many Jewish Americans - Americans who've been on the receiving end of white supremacist terror - this wasn't shocking because we've lived with this violence our whole lives,\" Ibram X. Kendi, author of the book How to Be an Antiracist and founding director of Boston University's Center for Antiracist Research, told Vox.\n\nBut while Kendi believes the next administration needs to make America understand that violence is part of its story, he is also hopeful that people will do their own work in their anti-racism journeys and build organizations that can bring about change.\n\n\"I actually believe that you have to believe an anti-racist society is possible in order to bring it about,\" he said.\n\nI talked to Kendi about whether America is just destined to be a racist nation, why white Americans aren't out protesting to dismantle white supremacy, and if it's ever too late to be anti-racist. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nWhat were your immediate thoughts when you learned of the coup at the Capitol last Wednesday?\n\nWhat happened on January 6 is in many ways the pot of white terror boiling over - and that had been building for some time, certainly in earnest after the election of Barack Obama. Certainly, even more so when the president of the United States was heating that pot, day in and day out.\n\nMany of us were quick to acknowledge the truth that if these people were Black Lives Matter activists, they would have certainly been treated differently. There was clearly an uncoordinated police effort. We saw police beat up protesters across a number of cities in America, from DC and Philadelphia to Portland. What's your reaction to this difference in treatment?\n\nOne study found that 93 percent of the demonstrations between late May and late August were peaceful. And of the 7 percent that turned violent, it was not necessarily the demonstrators being violent but the police being violent toward peaceful demonstrators. I say that to say, despite almost every demonstration being peaceful, there still was a pretty significant police response to Black Lives Matter demonstrations in almost every city and state where they occurred.\n\nBy contrast, the greatest domestic terrorist threat of our time is white supremacists. From my understanding, the local Capitol Police assumed that this demonstration wouldn't turn into an insurrection and wouldn't turn violent. To me, it just flies in the face of all evidence. Those demonstrations that were almost uniformly peaceful last year, that were anti-racist, there was typically a massive police presence. But for those who are part of a group that is the greatest domestic terrorist threat of our time, it was assumed that those demonstrations would be peaceful, so there wasn't a police force of the same scale.\n\nDuring those Black Lives Matter protests, we saw a mass of white people suddenly get invested in anti-racism - taking to the streets, buying books, your books like How to Be an Antiracist , Stamped From the Beginning, and Antiracist Baby . How has that impacted the response to the insurgency, or hasn't it?\n\nI do think that because of the demonstrations last year, because of the number of people who actually did read a number of anti-racist books, that when those of us who study racism pointed out the white privilege on display in the Capitol, pointed out the racist double standard, in many ways people saw that in real time, and became outraged as a result.\n\nAnd I think also because of the vivid contrast to the awesome amount of state power that came down on the heads of anti-racism demonstrators, even from the president of the United States himself , it couldn't have been more polar opposite from these terrorists sacking the US Capitol while Congress was there to carry out democracy. This is one of the greatest contradictions that has ever been put on display in American history.\n\nBased on people's reaction to the insurrection - shock that this was happening in America - what does white America still not understand or acknowledge about racism?\n\nBecause of the racist ideas that many white Americans still hold, it becomes almost impossible for them to see white people as terrorist threats - as the primary terrorist threat - and as the people who are making their nation unsafe, the people who are attacking democracy. Racist ideas tell us that white people are nonviolent. That white people are champions of freedom. That white people are the ones who save nations. And so the way in which people have constructed whiteness, and even their identity, or even the identity of white people, prevents them from seeing this white terrorist threat for what it is.\n\nWhy do you think white people aren't out protesting racism and white supremacy in mass numbers still? If white people are seeing they're treated differently by the police, why aren't they using their privilege to take to the streets to protest right now?\n\nI have no idea. I mean, I know there are many white folks, just like there's certainly many Black folks and other folks of color, who are still sort of shell-shocked. I suspect white people may be more likely to be shell-shocked by the events at the Capitol. I think for many Black folks, Latinx folks, Native folks, and for many Jewish Americans - Americans who've been on the receiving end of white supremacist terror - this wasn't shocking because we've lived with this violence our whole lives. What I'm hoping is after those folks who somehow denied this as part of America get over their shock, that we'll take to transforming this country.\n\nSpeaking of people who say this isn't America - including President-elect Joe Biden, whose first response to the coup was to say that it didn't represent who we are - why do elected officials continue to tell this lie? Even the four living former US presidents all stepped in to say the insurrection didn't represent America. These kinds of statements have come out after other events, including mass shootings, and #ThisIsNotUs trended on Twitter after the deadly Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in 2017.\n\nDenial is the heartbeat of America. At every point in history, Americans refused to look at themselves for who they truly were. Americans have tried to take these ugly sides of America outside of the American project and say these people, or this incident, or this type of politics is not who we are, as opposed to saying, yes, this is precisely who we partially are, but we want to be better, we want to be different. Instead, Americans have denied it outright, denied its existence, and then we wonder why the cancer continues to spread.\n\nAnd do you see this tactic as something to unify the nation? Wouldn't the best tactic be to tell the truth?\n\nI think that the reason why politicians, typically centrist Republicans and Democrats, say this is because they believe this is what older white swing voters want to hear. These elected officials do not believe that these white swing voters can handle the truth, so they keep feeding them denial. But at the same time, they are critiquing Trump for feeding his base red meat that's full of lies.\n\nIt's believed among many Democratic analysts that the key to winning the presidential election is winning these white swing voters. I disagree. But these are the types of questions we need to be asking, because we have to be honest with the American people.\n\nDo you think what happened on January 6 is the end of this type of political violence, a regime taking its last shot - or is this the start of a new kind of political violence in this modern era?\n\nHistory will tell us whether January 6 transformed America and even American politics in the way 9/11 did. What I hope is that it does. That it causes us to overcome our denial and that Americans become serious about rooting out this terrorist threat and holding the people who attacked the citadel of America accountable. But even rooting out what is radicalizing these people - which is racism, white supremacy, patriarchy, sexism, homophobia, and fascist ideas - that's absolutely critical.\n\nFor the incoming administration, what specific steps do you think Biden and [Vice President-elect Kamala] Harris must take to help lead America down a path of anti-racism?\n\nBiden and Harris can decide from a political standpoint that they are going to support the types of policies and practices that can eliminate racial inequity and injustice - even if those types of policies and practices are not popular with white people broadly or not popular with white swing voters or even maybe not popular with some segments of people of color - that the popularity and even the politics of the proposals are less important than the results.\n\nThat's what we've never had. We've never had a president or an administration that stated, \"We are going to support the anti-racist policies and practices that can eliminate racism once and for all.\" There's always been this worry about what white people are going to think or how white people are going to react or that there will be potential white opposition at the polls. I can understand that they're elected officials, but on the other hand, either you want to become an FDR or an Abraham Lincoln, or you don't. Meaning, either you want to make the hard decisions that can leave a permanent blueprint on the United States or you'll make the easy ones and fade from history.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nAnd what about the role of apologies here? Do you think that politicians should apologize for their complicity in the past with white supremacy and racism and how the government continues to conduct violence against certain citizens?\n\nIbram X. Kendi\n\nIn my book How to Be an Antiracist , I talk about how \"racist\" isn't a fixed category. It isn't who a person is, it's what a person is being. And I encourage everyone, in the way I did to myself, to admit those times in which we were being racist, to overcome our own individual denial in the way we overcome our national denial. Because that's the first step in being anti-racist. To be anti-racist is to admit the times we've been racist.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nAnd is that as simple as saying, \"I participate in and benefit from racism\"?\n\nIbram X. Kendi\n\nIf you are a public official, particularly a white public official, coming out and publicly stating that will encourage other people, particularly white people, to do it. If you're an ordinary American, I'm less concerned with you posting that on your social media page or telling all your friends than you truly believing that and going on this anti-racist journey yourself. That's what it's really about: We acknowledge our past so we can transform ourselves.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nDo you think the anti-racism movement that blew up last year is already dead or has at least petered out? I'm asking that based on what we see happening with President Trump, what we saw happen on January 6, what's being planned for the days leading up to Biden's inauguration, and the fact that white people aren't exactly activated or know what do to about white supremacy right now.\n\nIbram X. Kendi\n\nI think it's very much alive, and I think the hard part of movement-building is not what is happening or not. Another part of movement-building is what's happening away from the cameras and the streets. I'm talking about the building of relationships and the building of organizations, the plotting and planning for power and policy change. And that's certainly happening behind the scenes right now through many different individuals and organizations.\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nDo you ever get defeatist and think that America is destined to be a racist nation, that white supremacy is not something we can overcome?\n\nIbram X. Kendi\n\nI actually believe that you have to believe an anti-racist society is possible in order to bring it about. I suspect there are times in which I have the defeatist thoughts, but I am constantly trying to work toward overcoming those and focusing on believing that change is possible. Because how are we going to bring about change if we don't believe it's possible?\n\nFabiola Cineas\n\nWhat new advice, or even repeated advice, do you have to people who are serious about being an anti-racist in 2021 and beyond?\n\nIbram X. Kendi\n\nMy advice is that being anti-racist is a journey. It's not something you declare that you are. It's something you strive to be, just like it's going to be a journey trying to transform this country. I just want to encourage us all to be a part of that journey, because hopefully that's the pulse of history right now, to really transform our country and ensure that January 6 never happens again. If we don't root out racism, we are bringing on another January 6.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nApparently, we can't even trust these justices to follow their own very recent precedents.\n\nThe Court decided an identical case two years ago.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIncreasing diversity could make America a more hostile place.\n\nby Brian Resnick\n\nIn August 2008, the Census Bureau released a report that predicted a seismic shift in American demographics: By 2050, minorities would make up more than 50 percent of the population and become the majority .\n\nWhen Yale psychologist Jennifer Richeson heard about the report on NPR, she remembers thinking, \"This is probably freaking somebody out.\"\n\nBy \"somebody,\" she means white people.\n\nRicheson's studies on interracial interactions had taught her that when people are in the majority, the sense of their race is dormant. But the prospect of being in the minority can suddenly make white identity - and all the historical privilege that comes with it - salient. And, she guessed, the prospect of losing majority status was likely to make people (perhaps unconsciously) uneasy.\n\n\"The point is that people who think of themselves as not prejudiced (and liberal) demonstrate these threat effects.\"\n\nIn other words, she wondered if white people would read the news of a coming \"minority majority\" shift as a threat, a \"threat\" powerful enough to change their thoughts and behavior.\n\nIn the years since, Richeson has tried to answer this question with a trove of experimental research. What she's found is both unsettling and crucial to understanding politics in the era of President Donald Trump.\n\nHer research - and the research of many other social scientists studying the rise of Trump, Brexit , and other examples of nationalistic backlash around the world - points to how the politics of inclusion will be challenged in the days ahead.\n\nPerhaps one day social scientists will figure out how to get people of different backgrounds to live among one another and not be afraid. But for now, the perceived \"threat\" of demographic change is making voters fearful and, in turn, giving power to politicians who implicitly or explicitly stoke that fear. It's a troubling problem crying out for an answer.\n\nAfter the census report came out, Richeson and Maureen Craig, a graduate student working under her (now a psychology professor at NYU), set up a simple experiment .\n\nFirst, they had a group of white participants read a bit of text summarizing the census report heralding the minority-majority shift.\n\nThe results suggest \"a sense of a zero-sum competition between groups is activated\"\n\nThat was the experimental condition. Then they had a second group of white participants read about demographics as they currently exist.\n\nThe first round of results was troubling : White participants who read about demographic change showed greater preference for their own racial groups - they were more likely to respond to statements like \"I would rather work alongside people of my same ethnic origin\" in the affirmative. The paper, published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, also found that the experiment made white participants feel less warm toward members of other races.\n\nThis effect has been replicated in other labs. For instance, a study led by psychologist H. Robert Outten reported nearly identical findings in both Americans and Canadians . Outten's paper also found that the exposure increased white sympathy for other whites, and increased feeling of fear and anger toward minorities.\n\nThe results suggest that \"a sense of a zero-sum competition between groups is activated,\" Craig tells me. When people hear about the rise of one group, they automatically fear it will mean a decline in their own.\n\nTo be clear: It's wrong to conclude from these studies that deep down, all white people harbor extreme animus. The psychologists do not see it that way. On average, Craig says, people in her studies report tolerant attitudes toward minorities. \"We're saying that there's a [small] relative difference, and that difference is leading toward more negative attitudes,\" she says. The effects they find are small in effect size, but consistent.\n\n\"The point is that people who think of themselves as not prejudiced (and liberal) demonstrate these threat effects,\" Richeson says.\n\nYou can think of the results like this: Fear of outsiders is a chord that can be struck in some of us. Some politicians exploit this, and Trump most certainly did when he said that undocumented Mexican immigrants, refugees, and people from Muslim countries ought to be feared and barred from entering our country.\n\nIt's not just racial attitudes that shift when whites are exposed to the demographic data. Political attitudes shift too. And this can, in part, explain why Trump found an audience with his nationalistic rhetoric.\n\nIn another paper, published in Psychological Science , Richeson and Craig found that exposure to the census report nudged participants to be more conservative on a variety of policies. What's interesting here is that the policies weren't necessarily race-related. Participants became more conservative on topics like affirmative action and immigration, as well as on defense spending and health care reform.\n\nThe threat of demographic change - and the loss of status that comes with it - provokes a broad sense of wanting to hunker down. A similar thing happens when psychologists remind people of their mortality . Psychologists find the threat of death makes people more conservative, and more wary of others too.\n\nAnd it's not that conservatives are becoming more conservative. White people of all political backgrounds in America become more conservative in these experiments.\n\nBut why would a self-avowed liberal change her political position just because of a line from a census report? Richeson and Craig are pretty sure the answer is that these white people feel threatened.\n\nRicheson and Craig ran a version of the experiment where participants were told that even though the minority-majority switch was coming, the social order would continue to be the same. White Americans would still come out on top in American society.\n\nIn that condition, the effect disappeared. \"And that's how you know it's status threat\" fueling the effect, Richeson says.\n\nShe doesn't know how that threat will increase or diminish in the population in the coming years. The feeling of threat could even decrease. \"People may have seen electing [Trump] as an intervention that will stave off the status and cultural shifts they are concerned about,\" she says.\n\nBut then, that's concerning too: We can't neutralize the threat of demographic change at the cost of minorities.\n\nWhat's compelling about this line of research is that it suggests not only do people change their attitudes, but they also change their behavior in response to demographic threat.\n\nMaria Abascal, a sociologist at Brown University, found in an experiment that white participants who are exposed to information about Hispanic population growth will donate less money to black people. Think about this for a second: When hearing about the rise of one minority group, participants in the study were stingier toward an unrelated minority group. That means the growth in the Hispanic population is causing an anxiety that generalizes into a broad sense that white people's status needs to be reinforced. (The information about Hispanic population growth did not change the behavior of the black participants in the study.)\n\nAnd right before the election, a paper led by Brenda Major at UC Santa Barbara found that exposure to demographic change increased support - to a small degree - for Trump (and not the other Republican presidential candidates) among whites who highly identified with their racial groups.\n\n\"Among very highly identified Whites ... the racial shift reminder shifted them one point more likely to vote for Trump on a 7 point scale - from about a 2.5 to about a 3.5,\" Major explains in an email. \"Of course, Democrats were still less positive toward and intended to vote for Trump less than Republicans did, but the group threat pushed them both in that direction. Why Trump and not the other Republican candidates? I think because Trump's rhetoric was and is most hostile toward people who aren't White.\"\n\nOutside of psychology labs, there's compelling evidence that Trump's win was linked, in part, to white anxiety about a changing world. Racial attitudes were a strong predictor of Trump support in the lead-up to the election. \"Republicans who scored highest on racial resentment were about 30 percentage points more likely to support Trump than their more moderate counterparts in the bottom quartile of the party in racial conservatism,\" Michael Tester, a UC Irvine political scientist, explained to the Washington Post.\n\nAll these results are troubling. And they're troubling because the forces dividing Americans along racial lines may only grow stronger in the Trump era.\n\nVox's Alvin Chang has reported on another disturbing trend : that white America is slowly segregating itself from diverse communities. It's a story, he writes, about:\n\n... how many white people have reacted to increasing exposure to nonwhite populations, who are following in their footsteps and pursuing the traditional American dream. The reaction is not always articulated or even intentional; in fact, most people say they want to live in a diverse and integrated community; they, too, have the dream that no one will be judged by the color of their skin.\n\nBut data shows that as minorities move into suburbs, white families are making small and personal decisions that add velocity to the momentum of discrimination. They are increasingly choosing to self-segregate into racially isolated communities.\n\nSo as the country diversifies, white Americans are increasingly choosing to live among each other. But demographic change will keep charging ahead. White Americans will learn about the changes, but they won't have the opportunities to make the intensive face-to-face contact necessarily to assuage their fears.\n\nThere's one study that shows it's possible to meaningful reduce prejudice in the real world. And for that opinion change to happen, it requires going door to door and having voters talk about their real lived experience, and their own memories of feeling marginalized. It isn't easy. But with contact, it's possible.\n\n\"My biggest concern about all of this is if we're going to really build a multiethnic, interfaith democracy, we can't have these levels of racial polarization\"\n\nIt's not just Richeson and Craig who worry that increasing diversity might make America a more hostile, less compassionate place.\n\n\"I think that diversity, immigration, and multiculturalism are right at the heart of the sociological problem in Western democracies, along with the new and pernicious role of social media,\" psychologist Jonathan Haidt recently told Vox's Sean Illing. \"So long as we are all immersed in a constant stream of unbelievable outrages perpetrated by the other side, I don't see how we can ever trust each other and work together again.\"\n\nHaidt continued:\n\nAs multiculturalism is emphasized more and more, there emerges a reaction against it on the right, which is attractive to the authoritarian mind and also appeals to other conservatives. And this, I think, is what has happened, this is what Trump is about - not entirely, of course, but certainly this is a big factor.\n\nElsewhere, researchers find that mere exposure to marginalized groups of people backfires when it comes to progressive policymaking. A recent study in PNAS ( Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ) found that when experiment participants walked past an actor dressed up like a destitute homeless person, they were less willing to support redistribution of income through a \"millionaire's tax\" on a questionnaire. \"I do think it could be the case that, for an affluent individual, seeing someone who is poor reminds you of your wealth and perhaps makes you more protective of it,\" Melissa Sands, the author of that study, tells me in the email.\n\nThe big question the researchers cannot yet answer is this: How does the country keep growing more diverse without these fears coming to an even more dangerous boil?\n\n\"My biggest concern about all of this is if we're going to really build a multiethnic, interfaith democracy, we can't have these levels of racial polarization,\" Richeson says. \"We really need to understand the many identity threats that are happening here. Both for White Americans and for the many racial minorities that are feeling very threatened by a Trump presidency, what this means for all kinds of racial progress. ... How do we come together given this demographic split? it's terrifying for us.\"\n\nRicheson says she doesn't have the answers. No one does. But she hopes to look for them in some research projects over the next several years. \"If we can understand the mechanism giving rise to what we are seeing in the world, then we can address it,\" she says.\n\nIn addition to lab studies, Richeson says her colleagues in the field are planning trips out into America, to learn from white people and understand how they feel about demographic change. The goal is to find a way to frame the change in a way that's nonthreatening, or communicate messages that build multiracial coalitions. (Richeson wonders if poor white voters will better identify with poor black voters when reminded of their shared economic hardships, for instance.)\n\nOne last thing to note: The US Census projections are based on arbitrary ideas of race . None of this matters if the census changes its definition of who it considers to be white. For instance, the 2008 report considered biracial people to be part of the coming \"minority majority.\" If the census redefines what it means to be \"white,\" then the possibility of a minority majority may go away.\n\nThe \"threat\" is dependent on who you consider part of your team. If the labels change, so may the feelings of threat. \"This term 'majority minority' has absolutely no meaning,\" Richeson says.\n\nUnless we let it.\n\n\"It's horrible that things are devolving as much as they are in terms of intergroup harmony,\" Richeson says. \"But what that says to me is our work is all the more important.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nSwole of body, swole of mind.\n\n﻿Lab-grown blood could save tens of thousands of lives. Is it possible?\n\nThe one allergy treatment to rule them all, explained.\n\nDon't buy the hype about \"de-extinction.\"\n\nTrump's crackdown on foreign students and scientists will do irreparable harm to the country.\n\nKennedy is targeting our best defense against the dentist.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "James Baldwin's faith in America\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nEddie Glaude Jr. on why Baldwin thought the idea of white America was irredeemable - but the country wasn't.\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nIf I could bring back from the dead any American writer and ask them to describe the country they see today, it would be James Baldwin, the great 20th-century essayist and novelist.\n\nI don't know what the Black experience is like in America, but I can say that no writer made it as visceral or vivid for me as Baldwin. He had a rare combination of raw literary talent and intellectual honesty that made him uniquely equipped to communicate an alien reality to someone like me, a white kid growing up in the South.\n\nAs it happens, Baldwin, who would have turned 96 this Sunday, has been in the news these past few years. The writer Ta-Nehisi Coates has invoked him as a model; he was the subject of a widely praised 2017 documentary ; and his novel If Beale Street Could Talk was adapted into a feature film in 2018.\n\nObviously, no one is raising Baldwin from the dead, but we now have maybe the next best thing: a book about Baldwin from Princeton African American studies professor Eddie Glaude Jr. It's called Being Again: James Baldwin's America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own and the book is part memoir, part biography, and part political essay. It's Glaude's attempt to process what's happening right now through Baldwin's eyes.\n\nI reached out to Glaude to talk about Baldwin's conception of America and how it can speak to this moment. This is a long and honest discussion about the contradictions of the American project and why racial progress is both real and illusory at the same time. It is also, I hope, a clarifying exchange on the moral dilemmas at the heart of this challenge. There are no easy answers in any of this, but, in a strange way, the unanswerability of the questions is a reminder that we're all figuring out how to navigate this moment together.\n\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nWhat was Baldwin's greatest insight into this country? What did he see more clearly than anyone else?\n\nI've never been asked that question before. The easy answer is that he saw that America was constantly telling itself lies. It refused to look itself squarely in the face. In some ways, America had refused to face its fears, refused to look at its own self-conception.\n\nBaldwin said that Black people are the rejected sons and daughters of America. He put it this way once, and I'm paraphrasing here: There's a level of barbarity and psychological fracture when you're selling your own child. You know that's your child on the auction block. For Baldwin, that takes us to a deep level of neurosis, of psychosis at the heart of the country that requires exploring. So I think his insight was in recognizing this psychological wound that's at the heart of the American project.\n\nWhat were the lies he thought America kept telling itself?\n\nIn 1964, Baldwin wrote an essay entitled \"The White Problem.\" He has this formulation that says, \"The people who settled the country had a fatal flaw. They could recognize a man when they saw one. They knew he wasn't anything else but a man, but since they were Christian and since they had already decided that they came here to establish a free country, the only way to justify the role this chattel was playing in one's life was to say that he was not a man. But if he wasn't, then no crime had been committed. That lie is the basis of our present trouble.\"\n\nSo this idea of dehumanization is at the heart of this capitalist enterprise called slavery. Then built around it is this elaborate discourse that accounts for my intelligence, my passions, and my capabilities. And then we tell stories about what we have done not only to these people but to other people around the world that protect our innocence. Then we distort anything that threatens to reveal the lie of our innocence.\n\nSo this is at the heart of this self-conception of the United States as the redeeming nation.\n\n\"People are complaining about taking down monuments, but our entire built environment is a monument to a deeper racial ideology\"\n\nThere's so much going on there and we'll get to it, but I want to weave in what you think as we work through what Baldwin thought. So let me ask you this: When you look at this moment we're in, and I mean the whole damn thing - the pandemic, the racial reckoning, the economic crisis - what stands out to you the most? What's the unifying thread tying all of this unrest together?\n\nThe country is broken. It's built on a bankrupt ideology. There's a reason why we're not responding to the pandemic in a certain sort of way, because we've lived for over 40 to 50 years with an ideology that has said that big government is bad, that any sane intervention in the economy is an intrusion on our liberty. So that's the first thing.\n\nEver since 9/11, there's only been a certain portion of the country bearing the sacrifice for what we've experienced, for the forever wars. All of us aren't asked to sacrifice. Even when it comes to wearing a mask, we're too selfish. We invoke liberty as a defense instead of acting responsibly on behalf of one's fellows. It's a broken culture and a broken ideology.\n\nWhen Trump started campaigning in 2015, my biggest worry is that he would uncork resentments that had been festering beneath the surface for decades. On the one hand, maybe it's necessary to bring these deep problems into the light in order to deal with them; on the other hand, it feels like the norms and constraints holding this experiment together have cracked apart.\n\nI'm curious how you think about this paradox.\n\nFirst off, I think that's absolutely right. The post-civil rights consensus has been broken, just like the post-World War II consensus about global governance has been broken. Part of what the post-civil rights consensus entailed was that you could racially dog-whistle. You could mobilize racial resentments for political ends, but you couldn't do it in such a way that would spark full-blown racial wars. The cultural wars involved, in part, appealing to these resentments.\n\n[This has been] the undertow of American politics, from Reagan's run in '80 to George H.W. Bush's Willie Horton ads and right on down the line. Race has been mobilizing white resentments for a long while. Trump has put aside the dog whistle and grabbed a foghorn. So he appeals to them explicitly, and he's brought those people who were initially banished to the margins of our body politic into the center of politics.\n\nBaldwin fell into despair, especially after MLK's assassination, but he never completely lost faith in his home country, right? He still believed a moment of true freedom was possible, what he called the New Jerusalem.\n\nYeah, but I don't think he was ever optimistic. He might've been hopeful, but not optimistic. But even that hope was blue-soaked. He was never naive about the capacities of white folk in this country. Jimmy makes a crucial distinction between white people and people who happen to be white.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nA white person is someone who's invested in the value gap and is fine with how advantage and disadvantage is distributed along those lines. So a world that values white people more than others is a world that invests in that particular identity and the way in which the world is organized and arranged.\n\nSomeone who happens to be white is someone who is not invested in that, but understands how the language of whiteness comes to them as natural as the love of their mother.\n\nThis is what the writer Wendell Berry talks about in The Hidden Wound . He's Kentucky-born. He knows that racism comes to him like language. But just the fact that he knows it and that he's engaged in the ongoing work of trying to deconstruct it and deconstruct the world that has been organized in light of it says that he's that dude. So the difference is whether you're someone who's invested in an identity of whiteness or someone who understands the dynamics of that identity and is trying to build a more just world in spite of it.\n\nBaldwin eventually concluded, for reasons you just hinted at, that \"white Americans had to save themselves.\" What did he mean by that?\n\nBaldwin's revolutionary inversion is to flip the white man's burden. The white man's burden becomes the Black man's burden. That's when he says, \"I'm not the N-word. Never have been.\" The question is, why did you need to invent the N-word? Once you understand why, then maybe we can get off this damn hamster wheel. He didn't say it that way, but you get what I mean. The point is that, \"I'm not the N-word. You invented the N-word. We need to figure out why you invented the N-word. Until we do that, I'm going to give that N-word back to you. You must be the N-word.\" That's the revolutionary move.\n\nIn the early stages, the second move was to say, \"Well, since that's the case, we got to help them understand themselves differently. We have to love them into viewing themselves otherwise,\" because otherwise we bear the brunt of this way of understanding themselves. But by the time MLK is assassinated, that feeling is gone.\n\nThen the question is, we only have a finite amount of civic energy, so do we use that energy trying to convince people who hold noxious views about race not to hold them? Or do we spend our energy trying to build a world where those views have no quarter to breathe? It's the latter that I think he's invested in. We can still build a New Jerusalem. We can still do the work of trying to build a more just world. But that's not going to involve me having to compromise with these folk, and I don't want to do that anymore. Because every time we compromise, somebody, namely us, we have to bear the brunt of the compromise.\n\nThe move you make in the book, and the move Baldwin eventually makes, is that there's an idea of America defined by whiteness that simply isn't salvageable and we've got to get clear about that before we can do anything else.\n\nYes! I say that the idea of white America is irredeemable, but that doesn't mean that we are. There's nothing about the idea of an America that is defined by whiteness that we can salvage.\n\nIn the book, I'm trying to sever this idea of American identity from this idea of whiteness. Because they're so intrinsically linked, when we tell the truth about the country, people think everything is going to collapse - that we're no longer distinctive in some sort of way if we don't tell the story in the way in which we've told it. I think Jimmy is trying to insist that by confronting our ghastly failures, we can be otherwise. There's this wonderful line he said in 1962: \"We are in deeper trouble than we think: The trouble is in us.\"\n\nThere's a tension I struggle with and I want to be honest about it here. I'll do it by reading something you wrote in the book: \"I hoped one day white people here would finally leave behind the belief that they mattered more. But what do you do when this glimmer of hope fades, and you are left with the belief that white people will never change - that the country, no matter what we do, will remain basically the same?\"\n\nDo you really think the country has remained the same?\n\nIt all depends on what we mean by that. The throughline of American history is the value gap. So what does it mean to believe that white people matter more than others in the context of slavery? It's very different than what it would mean in the context of Jim Crow, which is very different from what it would mean in the context of the industrialized cities, or in context of the first Black president. In each instance, there's going to be an element of progress, but if that valuation evidences itself in dispositions and practices, then it's still a throughline. Until we uproot it and the habits it produces, we're basically the same.\n\nThat helps clarify my own thinking on this. The simple way to talk about this is to say that the arc of this country is clearly moving, however unevenly and awkwardly, in the direction of progress. But the deeper question you're posing is, are our underlying values changing in any fundamental way, or are the manifestations of those values just taking on new - and undoubtedly better - forms? And if we don't uproot the value structure, the thing that brings this ugliness into being remains untouched.\n\nThat's exactly right. This is what I mean when I say our progress is still laced with lies. Because we're not getting to the core. We're not getting to the heart of the problem. So in these moments, like we're in now, they want us to tinker around the edges and not get to the heart of the problem. I keep saying over and over again we have to figure out how to be together differently. We can't be mysteries anymore to each other. We can't live like this.\n\nPeople are complaining about taking down monuments, but our entire built environment is a monument to a deeper racial ideology. The highway systems in Chicago and New York are monuments to a particular racial ideology. So I think you're absolutely right. This is why Jimmy always understood the problem to be a moral one. This is why he understood the justification for Black power. He fully understood that the problem at the heart of all of this is rooted in valuation and the dispositions that follow from them.\n\n\"I say that the idea of white America is irredeemable, but that doesn't mean that we are\"\n\nPart of the frustration with these conversations, not ours but these conversations more generally, is that they often get bogged down in this false choice between acknowledging the obvious progress and considering the problem solved or recognizing those victories without turning away from the root of the problem.\n\nA lot of folks view racial justice and racial equality as a philanthropic enterprise. It's something that they can give to us. It almost reveals that at the heart of their conception of racial justice is charity, as opposed to justice. So part of what we have to do is to understand that frame as part of the problem. Racial justice is not something that you give to other people. It's instantiated in the social arrangements, the way in which we imagine standing in right relation with one another. It's a world defined by non-domination.\n\nSo people often ask me, \"What else can I do? How can I help?\" Commit yourself to building a more just world. Let's do that. Once we get past the philanthropic model, we need to start getting at the heart of the matter. I had to watch my son deal with this. My dad had to watch me deal with this. His dad had to watch him deal with this. His dad had to teach him how to deal with this. People are saying it's all better, but I can go back generations and see Black people witnessing this public ritual of Black grief and suffering. Somebody had to bury their child because of what? \"Oh, look how far we've come!\"\n\nSo part of our challenge is not to fall into the trap of this American insistence on gratitude and congratulations.\n\nBaldwin believed that telling the truth about ourselves - really telling the truth - could release us from our past and make space for a new story about who and what we are as a country. What did he think that story would look like? Did he even get that far? Did you get that far?\n\nThere's a line that he wrote when he resigned from the editorial board of Liberator . [Liberator was an American socialist magazine that ran from 1918 to 1924.] It's a line that almost moves me to tears every time I say it. He wrote, \"I want us to do something unprecedented, and that is to be able to create a self without the need for enemies.\" Right? \"To create a self without the need for enemies.\" What would a world look like with that as its cornerstone?\n\nI've never seen it.\n\nExactly. But that's Baldwin's idea of a New Jerusalem. Where we try to stand in right relation with one another, where we can see each other. Not in the name of some sentimental humanism that says we're all the same. No, that's not what he's saying. Because we all got this funkiness in us. It's the dark cellar of who we are. But that's actually the bridge. Our suffering is the bridge. But how do we see each other so that we can be together for real? That to me is the ground for the world that I would love to inhabit. What it would look like in its details? I'm not sure. We would have to build it first.\n\nYou say that we'll have to decide, once and for all, whether we will truly be a multiracial democracy. Do you believe, in your heart of hearts, that we will answer in the affirmative?\n\nNot really, to be honest. Our history tells me that we won't do very well. In the moments that we've had something of this magnitude in front of us, we've taken steps forward while still doubling down on the value gap. The cornerstone of America's carceral state is the same old value gap, and it's just hard to imagine a true public infrastructure of care in this country. After all, we just doubled down on ugliness .\n\nSo our past doesn't fill me with optimism, and it didn't fill Baldwin with optimism either. But I also believe this: Wherever human beings are, we have a chance. Because we're not just simply disasters - we're also miracles.\n\nBut if this project we're all involved in is truly Sisyphean, if we're just going to keep rolling the boulder of equality up the hill only to watch it tumble back down to the ground, what's the point?\n\nWe have to conclude that the end is not the issue. What's at the heart of this is not the end but the process. The struggle itself becomes the source of meaning.\n\nThat's very existentialist.\n\nExactly, but it's true. It's the beautiful struggle, right? When there's no guarantee of the outcome, the fight itself becomes the motivation. But wherever human beings are, we have a chance. Things are fucked up, we all know it, but as Samuel Beckett said, \"Fail, fail again, fail better.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nApparently, we can't even trust these justices to follow their own very recent precedents.\n\nThe Court decided an identical case two years ago.

      "text": "\"Rural America\" doesn't mean \"white America\" - here's why that matters\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhat our conversation about \"rural America\" is missing.\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nThe media often conflates rurality and whiteness in this country. But this is a false - and misleading - narrative.\n\nRoughly one-fifth of rural residents in this country are people of color, and their interests and political views are as diverse as they are. When coverage of rural areas dismisses or otherwise ignores this fact, actual political consequences follow: The specific concerns of certain communities simply fall out of view.\n\nMara Casey Tieken, a professor of education at Bates College, studies the impact of race in rural communities. Last month, she penned a column for the Washington Post decrying our (bipartisan) tendency to treat rural America as a racial and political monolith.\n\n\"In defining rural white America as rural America,\" she wrote, \"pundits, academics and lawmakers are perpetuating an incomplete and simplistic story about the many people who make up rural America and what they want and need.\"\n\nI reached out to Tieken to dive deeper into the problem she highlighted in that column. Media discourse about rural America, she told me, does not track with her experiences in these communities. So I asked her what we get wrong, why it matters, and what we can do about it.\n\nHere's what she told me.\n\nHow \"rural America\" became a euphemism for \"white America\"\n\nCommunities of color in general have been marginalized from policymaking and from media depictions, so that's obviously part of the story.\n\nI think policymakers that represent white communities have disproportionately more power than policymakers representing rural communities of color. We have a long history of marginalizing rural communities of color, and one of those [strategies] is gerrymandering, and so there's not the same kind of political representation on a state or national level.\n\nI think the problem also becomes self-perpetuating because what gets covered is rural white America, so that shapes how people think about rural America, and those are the stories that get told over and over again.\n\nThe common stereotypes of rural America\n\nThere tend to be two overwhelming stereotypes that shape how people think about rural America. One of those is the Andy Griffith fantasy, in which rural America represents a simpler, better time, a very romanticized image of history. Then there's this other portrayal, which is kind of the Deliverance , backwoods redneck model. So two very opposite portrayals - one is romanticized, and the other is backward.\n\nThe common thread with both of those is whiteness.\n\nThe material gaps between rural white communities and rural communities of color\n\nThe first thing I'll say is that we're still talking in generalities even as we get more distinct about rural white communities versus rural communities of color. A lot depends on class and geography, where you actually live in rural places. Poverty rates are higher in rural communities of color than rural white communities. Job opportunities are very different for rural communities versus rural white communities. School experiences, dropout rates or push-out rates, if you want to reframe that, are much higher for rural students of color than rural white students.\n\nWe predominantly rely on property taxes to fund our schools, and because of the relationship between race and class, that means schools that serve mostly rural communities of color often have less of a funding base, less of a tax base to draw upon. So they literally have got less resources than rural white communities.\n\nRacial segregation in rural communities is high and consequential\n\nRacial segregation is just as high in rural communities as it is in urban communities. So this matters to rural schools, of course, given the importance of property taxes and how we fund our schools. Again, schools serving rural communities of color tend to have less resources. That has all sorts of implications for how they can hire and keep teachers. Rural schools particularly struggle to hire qualified teachers.\n\nSo there are all kinds of ways in which, if you look at these big, broad indicators, it's a very different experience being part of a rural community of color versus a rural white community. A lot of the same issues you see in urban areas divided by race you see also in rural areas very distinct by race.\n\nThe deep roots of the racial divide in rural America\n\nThis goes back for centuries. Demographics and where people live - that's not accidental. That goes back to our very racialized history, and it's a direct legacy of slavery. That was a rural phenomenon. We see still people live based off where plantations were historically. Town lines still reflect that old geography. This is very much baked into the picture of the country and our physical landscape, our geography, and oftentimes a lot of people make the argument that policymakers have pitted, either intentionally or unintentionally, poor rural whites against poor rural black folks as a way to dilute power.\n\nProgressives make a political and moral mistake when they surrender rural America to Republicans\n\nIf you think about progressives who right now are trying to mobilize and think ahead to these next elections, they risk overlooking a large part of their base who they already have on board but could very easily lose if they feel marginalized.\n\nImmigration policies, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] raids, even voter ID laws that are pending in a number of states - these are not just affecting urban communities of color. They're affecting rural communities of color. The organizations and agencies that are doing some work to try and temper some of these effects risk overlooking large numbers of people who they profess to hope to serve.\n\nPeople in these communities feel ignored by the media, and for very good reasons\n\nI think when you talk to folks within these communities, they very much feel like they have been ignored and that they're pretty much alone in terms of political representation, having a voice, being a part of the media. People, the general public, pay attention to what journalists draw their attention to, and policymakers do too. If this is not seen as an urgent issue, then they won't pay attention.\n\nThere are a lot of challenges facing rural America in general but also in rural communities of color, and they might be different in a lot of ways from rural white America. Unless we get more nuanced in how we talk and how we have these conversations, those unique needs and unique strengths risk getting overlooked.\n\nOn J.D. Vance's hit book Hillbilly Elegy and how it's been used to frame the conversation about rural America\n\nI think it represents a narrative that has been very much left out of the general public conversation. He focuses on culture. I wish he had focused more on the structures that shape opportunity, but that wasn't the story he set out to tell, so I can't fault him for that.\n\nI had more of an issue with how it's been used since then to talk about rural America. It gets back to the same point. It's been held up as \"the story\" of rural America despite being focused on a particular class and a particular region of the country. It is a compelling story, but it's not necessarily representative of the entire rural American experience.\n\nHow to change the conversation and force policymakers to respond\n\nSo this is where you, as a journalist, can do something about this. Begin to widen the focus, broaden the conversation, make the discourse about rural America more complex, make it attend to issues of race. I think back to the point that journalists get to shape the conversation. I do think a large part of this is an issue of what story is being told in popular media.\n\nAnother part of the story has to do with community organizing, which is a real challenge in rural places because a lot of organizing models depend on large numbers of people, and so by definition that doesn't work well in rural areas. But there are ways to do it.\n\nIf you think back to the whole farmworkers movement, that was a movement of rural communities of color. The civil rights movement was also largely rural communities of color. So there is a history of this, and I think now it becomes the challenge of getting policymakers to respond.\n\nI end my [Washington Post] op-ed talking about organizing across lines of race but also organizing around lines of geography. We've seen this happening all over in urban areas, but it's happening in rural areas too. Wherever you are, you have to forge alliances across these lines if you want to make real change happen.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nMore inclusive definitions of ethnicity produce a more hopeful response.\n\nby Matthew Yglesias\n\nMost media coverage of America's demographic future sees the country approaching a significant tipping point over the course of the next generation, with headlines like the Associated Press's \"Census Bureau estimate: Whites won't be majority by 2044\" typical of the genre. The Census Bureau itself somewhat encouraged this kind of coverage of its 2014 demographic projections, doing things like releasing an infographic titled \"Projecting Majority-Minority: Non-Hispanic Whites May No Longer Comprise Over 50 Percent of the US Population by 2044.\"\n\nThere is, however, another way of looking at it. The very same census report projects that as far out as 2060, 68.5 percent of the population will be white. It's just that a reasonably large share of the white population will be partially descended from Latin American immigrants. A further 6.2 percent of the population will belong to \"two or more races,\" with a large share of those likely identifying at least in part as white.\n\nThe difference here is between an exclusive and inclusive definition of whiteness. It's clear that in the face of rising intermarriage rates, a larger share of the population will be at least partially descended from Asia or Latin America, while the partially black share of the population will grow at a more modest rate.\n\nBut many of these people will, like me, be of predominantly European ancestry and have skin tone and other facial features that fit comfortably within the conventional boundaries of whiteness. If you use the exclusive version of whiteness - in which anyone who's part anything is perforce not white - then you get a majority-minority America by 2044. If you use an inclusive view and let anyone who identifies as white be white, then America remains majority white indefinitely.\n\nAnd a new study from Dowell Myers and Morris Levy , a demographer and a political scientist at USC, respectively, suggests that the media's choices about how to characterize it make a real difference to people's political response to these demographic trends.\n\nIn essence, media narratives that take a narrow view of whiteness and suggest that the falling share of 100 percent Europeans in the population means the end of America's white majority generate \"much higher levels of anger or anxiety\" than alternative (and, frankly, more plausible) characterizations of the situation. The implication is that a premature rush to proclaim the end of white America, even when intended in a celebratory manner, may be fueling racial backlash politics.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways one can count up America's racial demographics, but one simple choice is whether you make people select a single racial identity (i.e., you are either Hispanic or black) while creating a catchall multiracial category for people who identify that way. This \"exclusive\" account of demographics has the convenient property of making sure the numbers add up to 100 percent.\n\nA different, \"inclusive\" account allows for the fact that a person of mixed ancestry might identify as white and as Asian and that many people who identify as Hispanic also identify as white or black or Native American. These two methods lead to very different characterizations of the present-day white share of the population, which is either an overwhelming 80 percent of the public or else a tenuous majority of 62 percent:\n\nThis effect seems to be primarily driven by allowing for Hispanic identity to overlay on a racial identification, and secondarily by the different way it treats mixed-race people.\n\nNeither characterization is exactly right or wrong, but they both capture different dimensions of the issue. And projecting them into the future leads to very different accounts of future US demographics: On the exclusive reading, the white population is going to slip below 50 percent relatively rapidly, while on the inclusive reading, that date is pushed into the distant future and may in fact never occur. And the psychological impact of hearing those different stories appears to be very different.\n\nThe researchers conducted an experiment by randomly assigning various white people to read three different faux news accounts of the Census Bureau's projections. One story simply noted that diversity was rising, a second cited the data that results from using the inclusive definition of whiteness, and a third emphasized the exclusive definition of whiteness and therefore forecast a white minority by 2044.\n\nThey then asked readers how they felt and found strikingly different responses to the different narratives. In essence, the stories that emphasized the inclusive definition made white people feel hopeful for the future, while those that emphasized the exclusive one made white people feel anxious. The diversity narrative was polarizing, generating anxiety among white Republicans but hopefulness among white Democrats for an overall hopeful reaction, though less so than the inclusive narrative.\n\nThe partisan differences here are noteworthy, but so are the similarities. The anxious reaction to the exclusive narrative was strongest among Republicans, but it's noteworthy that it exists among almost half of white Democrats as well. People who are primed to feel anxious about white people losing majority status, in other words, can't be easily written out of the Democratic Party coalition as deplorable racists without significantly shrinking the party.\n\nThe good news is that while exclusive accounts have been a more typical media narrative, inclusive ones are more likely.\n\nAs Jamelle Bouie wrote in a 2014 essay on the demographic drivers of American politics , \"ethnic identity is fluid - it shifts and changes with the circumstances of society.\"\n\nAt various times in American history, the ethnic differences between Irish and Anglo-Scottish people or between immigrants from northwestern Europe and those from the south or east have loomed very large. But over time, Jews, Slavs, Italians, Irish, and others \"became white\" through a joint process of assimilation of minority groups into mainstream culture and accommodation by the mainstream of divergent practices.\n\nOnce upon a time, the Catholic religion was broadly regarded as vaguely un-American. And as recently as my grandparents' lifetime, pizza was covered in the New York Times as an exotic ethnic food that required a more detailed description than we would give these days to tacos or pad thai.\n\nEspecially in light of the high intermarriage rates, it seems extremely likely that a similar process will continue into the future and America's demographic trajectory will look more like the inclusive narrative than the exclusive one.\n\nThese days, lots of white people would say their background is Italian and English or Irish and German rather than one or the other, but they also wouldn't see themselves as belonging to an exotic \"mixed ethnicity\" category. It's simply the case that in American society, it's common for people to be able to trace their ancestry in more than one direction.\n\nIn the future, the same basic reality is likely to apply to people who have one grandparent from Cuba (like me!) or China just as much as it does to people with one grandparent from the Czech Republic.\n\nOne thing this means, as Bouie's essay argued, is that the Republican Party's status as the party for white people is probably more tenable over the long term than a lot of contemporary takes argue. But the other thing it means is that white Americans don't need to fear that the country is on the verge of some kind of racial tipping point. The country is unquestionably changing, but it's always changed over time.\n\nSomewhat ironically, though, media narratives that emphasize the tipping point idea fuel backlash politics that, in turn, probably harden ethnic dividing lines and make the process of mutual accommodation more difficult.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow demographic change is fracturing our politics.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama held up change as a beacon, attaching to it another word, a word that channeled everything his young and diverse coalition saw in his rise and their newfound political power: hope . An America that would elect a black man president was an America in which a future was being written that would read thrillingly different from our past.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump wielded that same sense of change as a threat; he was the revanchist voice of those who yearned to make America the way it was before, to make it great again. That was the impulse that connected the wall to keep Mexicans out, the ban to keep Muslims away, the birtherism meant to prove Obama couldn't possibly be a legitimate president. An America that would elect Donald Trump president was an America in which a future was being written that could read thrillingly similar to our past.\n\nThis is the core cleavage of our politics, and it reflects the fundamental reality of our era: America is changing, and fast. According to the Census Bureau, 2013 marked the first year that a majority of US infants under the age of 1 were nonwhite. The announcement, made during the second term of the nation's first African-American president, was not a surprise. Demographers had been predicting such a tipping point for years, and they foresaw more to come.\n\nThe government predicts that in 2030, immigration will overtake new births as the dominant driver of population growth. About 15 years after that, America will phase into majority-minority status - for the first time in the nation's history, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the population.\n\nThat cross will come in part because America's black, Hispanic, Asian, and mixed-race populations are expected to grow - indeed, the Hispanic and Asian populations are expected to roughly double, and the mixed-race population to triple. Meanwhile, the non-Hispanic white population is, uniquely, expected to fall, dipping from 199 million in 2020 to 179 million in 2060. The Census Bureau minces no words here: \"The only group projected to shrink is the non-Hispanic White population,\" they report.\n\nThis isn't just a statement about the future; it's a description of the present. The economist Jed Kolko notes that the most common age for white Americans is 58, for Asians it's 29, for African Americans it's 27, and for Hispanics it's 11 . A new report out of the University of Wisconsin Madison's Applied Population Lab found that white births are now outnumbered by white deaths in 26 states, up from 17 in 2014 and four in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, America's foreign-born population is projected to rise from 14 percent of the population today to 17 percent in 2060, 2 percentage points above the record set in 1890. The rise has been staggering in its speed: As recently as the 1970s, America's foreign-born population was under 5 percent.\n\nThe country's gender dynamics are also in flux. Hillary Clinton was not just the first female presidential candidate to win the popular vote but the first to be nominated by a major political party. Women now make up 56 percent of college students, and are 8 percentage points more likely than men to have earned a bachelor's degree by age 29.\n\nDemographers can and do disagree over whether these projections will hold. Perhaps Hispanic whites will begin identifying simply as whites in the coming years, much as the Irish became white in the 20th century. Race is what we make of it, and what we make of it shifts and mutates.\n\nAnother way to say that is it's often our perception of race and power that matters. In that case, though, most Americans feel the browning of America is happening even faster than the demographers report. Back in 2013, the Center for American Progress, PolicyLink, and the Rockefeller Foundation surveyed Americans and found that the median participant believed the country was 49 percent nonwhite; the correct answer was 37 percent.\n\nI spent months talking with politicians, social psychologists, and political scientists about what happens in moments like this one, moments when a majority feels its dominance beginning to fail. The answer, attested to in mountains of studies and visible everywhere in our politics, is this: Change of this magnitude acts on us psychologically, not just electorally. It is the crucial context uniting the core political conflicts of this era - Obama and Trump's presidencies, the rise of reactionary new social movements and thinkers, the wars over political correctness on campuses and representation in Hollywood, the power of #MeToo and BlackLivesMatter, the fights over immigration.\n\nDemographic change, and the fears and hopes it evokes, is one of the tectonic forces shaping this era in American life, joining income inequality and political polarization in transforming every aspect of our politics and culture. But to understand what it is doing to us as a country, we need to begin by understanding what it does to us as individuals.\n\nIn 2014, psychologists Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson analyzed the responses of 369 white, self-identified political independents who had completed one of two surveys. Half of the participants received a survey that asked them whether they knew that California had become a majority-minority state - which is to say, a state where whites no longer made up more than 50 percent of the population. The others read a survey devoid of demographic information.\n\nThis was a gentle test of an unnerving theory: that the barest exposure to the concept that whites were losing their numerical majority in America would not just make whites feel afraid but sharply change their political behavior. The theory proved correct. Among participants who lived in the western United States, the group that read that whites had ceded majority status were 11 points likelier to subsequently say they favored the Republican Party.\n\nIn a follow-up study , Craig and Richeson handed some white subjects a press release about geographic mobility, while others read one explaining that \"racial minorities will constitute a majority of the U.S. populace by 2042.\" The group that read the racially tinged release \"produced more conservative views not only on plausibly relevant issues like immigration and affirmative action, but also on seemingly unrelated issues like defense spending and health care reform.\"\n\n(It's worth noting that these dynamics cut in the other direction too: A 2016 study by Alexander Kuo, Neil Malhotra, and Cecilia Hyunjung Mo split a sample of Asian-American college students into two groups. One group was subjected to a staged microaggression during the study - their US citizenship was doubted by the researcher managing the experiment. The incident increased support for Democrats by 13 percentage points.)\n\nPerhaps the most striking experiment in this space was conducted by Harvard political scientist Ryan Enos. He attempted something rare in social science: an actual test of what seeing more diversity in our everyday surroundings does to our political opinions. His explanation of both the experiment and its results is worth reading:\n\nI sent Spanish speakers to randomly selected train stations in towns around Boston to simply catch the train and ride like any other passenger. I focused on stations in white suburbs. The intent was to create the impression, by subtle manipulation, that the Latino population in these segregated towns was increasing.\n\nBefore and after sending these Spanish speakers to the train platforms, I surveyed passengers on the platforms about their attitudes about immigration. After being exposed to the Spanish speakers on their metro lines for just three days, attitudes on these questions moved sharply rightward: The mostly liberal Democratic passengers had come to endorse immigration policies - including deportation of children of undocumented immigrants - similar to those endorsed by Trump in his campaign.\n\nEnos goes on to note that his findings match what we saw in 2016: The biggest gains Donald Trump made over Mitt Romney's performance \"were in the places where the Latino population had grown most quickly. ... For example, Luzerne County, adjacent to Scranton, Pennsylvania, had experienced an almost 600 percent growth in its Latino population between 2000 and 2014, and, after decades of voting Democrat in presidential elections, gave Trump 12 percentage points more votes than it had given to Romney in 2012.\"\n\nSo here, then, is what we know: Even gentle, unconscious exposure to reminders that America is diversifying - and particularly to the idea that America is becoming a majority-minority nation - pushes whites toward more conservative policy opinions and more support of the Republican Party.\n\nWhat happens when the exposure isn't so subtle?\n\nWhen Obama was elected in 2008, there was much talk of America moving into a post-racial moment. But as Michael Tesler shows in his powerful book Post-Racial or Most-Racial?: Race and Politics in the Obama Era , the mere existence of Obama's presidency further racialized American politics, splitting the two parties not just by racial composition but by racial attitudes.\n\nWhat Tesler proves is that in the Obama era, attitudes on race drove attitudes on almost everything else, in a way that's unique in recent American politics. The black-white divide in support for Obamacare was 20 percentage points larger than the black-white divide over Bill Clinton's similarly controversial proposal, for instance.\n\nBut it wasn't just health care. Party identification became significantly more divided by race. Perceptions of the economy became significantly more divided by race. Even perceptions of the president's dogs became more divided by race - shown pictures of the Obamas' dog Bo, more racially resentful Americans liked the dog better when told it was a picture of Ted Kennedy's dog Splash.\n\n\"There's no doubt that there's some folks who just really dislike me because they don't like the idea of a black President,\" Obama said. \"Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I'm a black President.\"\n\nYou might assume, seeing all this, that the reason for the racialization of American politics under Obama's presidency was that Obama, being African American, discussed racial issues and put forward race-conscious policies more often than past president. You'd be wrong. \"According to content analyses conducted by political and communication scientists, Barack Obama actually discussed race less in his first term than any other Democratic president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" writes Tesler.\n\nObama's presidency didn't force race to the forefront of American politics through rhetoric or action but through symbolism: Obama himself was a symbol of a changing America, of white America's loss of power, of the fact that the country was changing and new groups were gaining power. That perception wasn't incorrect: In his 2012 reelection campaign, Obama won merely 39 percent of the white vote - a smaller share than Michael Dukakis had commanded in 1988. That is to say, a few decades ago, the multiracial Obama coalition couldn't drive American politics; by 2012, it could.\n\nThe changes that led to Obama's presidency are everywhere in our culture. We live in an America where television programs, commercials, and movies are trying to represent a browner country; where Black Panther is a celebrated cultural event and #OscarsSoWhite is a nationally known hashtag; where NFL players kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and pressing 1 for English is commonplace.\n\nThere's a reason why, when the Russians wanted to sow division in the American election, they focused their social media trolling on America's racial divisions.\n\nWhite voters who feel they are losing a historical hold on power are reacting to something real. For the bulk of American history, you couldn't win the presidency without winning a majority - usually an overwhelming majority - of the white vote. Though this changed before Obama (Bill Clinton won slightly less of the white vote than his Republican challengers), the election of an African-American president leading a young, multiracial coalition made the transition stark and threatening.\n\nThis is the crucial context for Trump's rise, and it's why Tesler has little patience for those who treat Trump as an invader in the Republican Party. In a field of Republicans who were trying to change the party to appeal to a rising Hispanic electorate, Trump was alone in speaking to Republican voters who didn't want the party to remake itself, who wanted to be told that a wall could be built and things could go back to the way they were.\n\n\"Trump met the party where it was rather than trying to change it,\" Tesler says. \"He was hunting where the ducks were.\"\n\nAshley Jardina is a political scientist at Duke University who studies racial identity. In her 2014 dissertation The Demise of Dominance: Group Threat and the New Relevance of White Identity for American Politics , she argues that generations of scholars have taken African-American and Hispanic and Asian identity seriously but assumed there was no such thing as white identity. The conventional wisdom was that \"because of their numerical majority and political dominance, whites do not, by and large, possess their own sense of racial identification, and they do not feel consciously compelled to protect some sense of group interest.\"\n\nJardina argued - and, in a series of experiments, proved - that this was wrong. White political identity is \"conditional.\" It emerges in some periods and is absent in others. The periods it emerges in are periods like this one.\n\n\"When the dominant status of whites relative to racial and ethnic minorities is secure and unchallenged, white identity likely remains dormant,\" she writes. \"When whites perceive their group's dominant status is threatened or their group is unfairly disadvantaged, however, their racial identity may become salient and politically relevant.\"\n\nYou'll notice the language Jardina uses is careful and probabilistic. \"Racial identity may become salient,\" not will become salient. When we spoke, she took pains to emphasize that none of this is inevitable. \"There are a lot of incentives for elites across the political spectrum to try and stoke identity in the first place,\" Jardina told me. \"Donald Trump has done a great job on this.\" Then she added, a bit ruefully, \"My dissertation reads sort of like a playbook.\"\n\nBut \"it depends a lot on how politicians decide to take advantage,\" she continued. \"There's an opportunity for politicians to think about how they're going to organize politics around identity. I don't think it's inevitable that race will be the defining cleavage.\"\n\nDifferent politicians could make different choices. In 2012, Mitt Romney chose to run a campaign mainly based on economic identity, pitting his vision of the heroic entrepreneur against Obama's emphasis on the screwed-over worker. Perhaps future Republicans will return to similar themes, and American politics will calm.\n\nPerhaps. But another way of looking at that era is that someone like Trump was becoming more and more inevitable. Many of these same forces were thrumming through American politics in 2012 - indeed, Trump was amassing power in the Republican Party by championing birther conspiracy theories. The background context of conservative politics was becoming more racialized in response to Obama and the changes he represented.\n\nIn 2009, for instance, Rush Limbaugh went on the air to tell his listeners:\n\nHow do you get promoted in a Barack Obama administration? By hating white people, or even saying you do, or that they're not good, or whatever. Make white people the new oppressed minority, and they are going along with it, because they're shutting up. They're moving to the back of the bus. They're saying I can't use that drinking fountain, okay. I can't use that restroom, okay. That's the modern day Republican Party, the equivalent of the Old South, the new oppressed minority.\n\nIn 2012, on the eve of the election, Bill O'Reilly, then the top-rated cable news anchor in the country, sat down to tell his viewers What It All Meant:\n\nBecause it's a changing country; the demographics are changing. It's not a traditional America anymore. And there are 50 percent of the voting public who want stuff, they want things. And who is going to give them things? President Obama. He knows it, and he ran on it. And, whereby 20 years ago President Obama would have been roundly defeated by an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney, the white establishment is now the minority.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss these comments as the over-the-top rantings of pundits, but Limbaugh and O'Reilly's views are widely shared. A 2016 Public Religion Research Institute poll found that 57 percent of whites agreed that \"discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.\" A 2017 GenForward poll of white millennials found 48 percent agreed with a similar statement, showing that the sentiment isn't confined, or even concentrated, among older whites.\n\nYou can think of politics as a market and powerful, primal fears like these as representing a market opportunity. Eventually, someone was going to come along and give the people what they want. If Trump hadn't done it in 2016, another politician would have in 2020, or 2024. The pressure was just going to keep building.\n\nThere is an explanation we prefer for all this; an explanation that accounts for the turmoil of our politics without forcing us into uncomfortable conversations about race, power, and resentment. That explanation? It's the economy, stupid.\n\nAs the argument goes, the financial crisis, the rise of automation, the wreckage of globalization, the pain of the Great Recession, the shocking rise in inequality - all of that was more than enough to upend our politics; you don't need to reach for racialized explanations. So a bitter debate has erupted since the 2016 election between those who blame our politics on economic anxiety and those who see a country riven by racial resentment . In its aftermath, a popular synthesis has emerged: Economic anxiety activated racial resentment, which means, comfortingly, that a better economy would calm our divisions.\n\nThe best evidence we have suggests this gets the relationship largely backward. In their forthcoming book Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America , political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler, and Lynn Vavreck analyze reams of data and show that racial resentment activated economic anxiety, rather than the other way around:\n\nBefore Obama's presidency, how Americans felt about black people did not much affect their perceptions of the economy. After Obama, this changed. In December 2007, racial resentment - which captures whether Americans think deficiencies in black culture are the main reason for racial inequality - was not related to whites' perceptions of whether the economy was getting better or worse, after accounting for partisanship and ideology. But when these exact same people were re-interviewed in July 2012, racial resentment was a powerful predictor of economic perceptions: the greater someone's level of racial resentment, the worse they believed the economy was doing.\n\nThis is unnerving data, as we tend to imagine the economy as a rare subject on which objective facts, rather than group conflicts, drive opinions. Sadly, no. Sides, Tesler, and Vavreck analyzed polling on economic sentiment and found that \"Republicans in the highest income quintile, those making more than $100,000 per year, were actually slightly less satisfied than Democrats in the lowest income quintile, those making less than $20,000 per year.\"\n\nThis was borne out in the election's aftermath. Trump's election led to a remarkable 80-point jump in economic confidence among Republicans, and a 37-point fall among Democrats.\n\nThe economy since Trump took office has mostly shown the same trends from the final years of Obama - job growth, in fact, has been slightly slower - but his coalition's confidence has continued to soar, even as they live under much the same economy that so depressed them in 2016. Indeed, new data collected by Tesler shows that the most racially resentful are now the most economically optimistic.\n\nNone of this takes away from the fact that economic anxiety is real, or that more broadly shared economic growth would be good for our politics. But it does suggest economic anxiety cannot explain away our political or cultural divisions.\n\nIndeed, Trump himself is proof of this: He calls the economy under his watch \"a miracle,\" but that has not led him toward a gentler stance on immigration or less concern over NFL players kneeling to protest police brutality. A better economy would be good for the country because a better economy would always be good for the country. But it will not allow us to vault over the difficulties of a diversifying country.\n\nThere's a story Jennifer Richeson, the Yale psychologist responsible for some of the studies discussed above, likes to tell about the building she works in.\n\n\"My lab is an old engineering building and there's exactly one women's bathroom,\" she says with a laugh. \"No one noticed that, or at least no faculty members did.\" And then, slowly, Yale began adding women to the department, and they noticed it. They complained. \"When new people show up, they notice new things and start asking questions and begin making demands,\" she says.\n\nThere's been an obsessive interest in recent years in conflicts over political correctness. Tune in to Fox News on any given night and you'll find yourself dropped into a controversy on some liberal arts college somewhere. The connective tissue of the intellectual dark web - the anxiety that has made a coalition of new atheist Sam Harris, conservative pundit Ben Shapiro, Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, comedian Joe Rogan, Quillette editor Claire Lehmann, and others - is fear that the boundaries of acceptable discourse are being narrowed, that PC culture and identity politics are choking free speech. There's a whole subgenre of punditry arguing that Trump's rise is a regrettable, but predictable, backlash to political correctness , and thus the blame for his emergence properly belongs to campus activists and Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nThese fears can seem bizarre at first glance. Given all the other things available to worry about in the world, who cares what happened at this or that college? But the speed with which these clashes go viral on Twitter and Facebook, the enthusiasm with which they're covered on cable news and traffic-hungry websites and celebrated podcasts, all of it reflects the reality that something deeper and more fearful in us is being activated. These are proxy wars for bigger, more fundamental concerns over the direction of the culture.\n\nWhat can you say without being criticized? Protested? Punished? What are the lines, and who gets to decide where they're drawn? When have students gone too far, when have speakers gone too far, and whose job is it to punish infractions?\n\nTrump himself harnessed these sentiments during the campaign. \"I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,\" he said. \"I've been challenged by so many people, and I don't, frankly, have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time, either.\"\n\nMuch of this debate has played out under false pretenses. The idea that college campuses have ever been bastions of free speech is a fiction. In October 2017, Sean Decatur, the president of Kenyon College, noted that American colleges have always believed the regulation of civility and behavioral norms to be part of their mandate. He quoted Kenyon's statement of student responsibilities from the 1960s, which warned that any behavior that \"offends the sensibilities of others (whether students, faculty members or visitors) ... will result in disciplinary action ... vulgar behavior, obscene language or disorderly conduct are not tolerated.\"\n\nThis was, he continued, \"far stricter than anything that 21st-century critics of higher education see as a product of 'political correctness.'\" So what's changed? The answer, Decatur suggested, is who gets to decide what counts as offensive behavior:\n\nThe demographics of elite, residential colleges has changed drastically in the last 50 years and, as a result, the definition of civility has begun to change. There are many, including myself, who see the act of whites dressing in blackface as a disrespectful act. Reminding students of the norms of civil, respectful behavior, including refraining from blackface, is in line with the actions of colleges historically. What has changed is not the expectation that colleges define norms for civility, but rather the definition of civility.\n\nThere are behaviors on college campuses in general, and at Kenyon in particular, that may have passed a standard for civility 50 years ago - when the institution was all-male and almost all-white - that would not be considered civil today.\n\nIt is easy to read that as pure progress, but for those who dominated the discourse before, it represents real loss, and for everyone involved, it carries confusion and upheaval. New lines are being drawn, but no one is quite sure where they are or who is doing the drawing. The power to define the boundaries of acceptable behavior and polite discourse is profound, and right now, it is contested.\n\n\"I call it the democratization of discomfort,\" says Richeson. \"There were whole swaths of people uncomfortable all of the time. Now we're democratizing it. Now more people across different races and religions feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nOn all sides, the debate over PC culture is really about the core questions of not just politics but life: Whose grievances get heard? Who gets to be referred to by the names and labels and pronouns they choose? Who has the power to grant respectability, and who has the power to take it away?\n\nIt's become common to mock students demanding safe spaces, but look carefully at the collisions in American politics right now and you find that everyone is demanding safe spaces - the fear is not that the government is regulating speech, but that protesters are chilling speech, that Twitter mobs rove the land looking for an errant word or misfired joke.\n\nIn our eagerness to discount our opponents as easily triggered snowflakes, we've lost sight of the animating impulse behind much of politics and, indeed, much of life: the desire to feel safe, to know you can say what you want without fear.\n\nThe dynamic driving the fights on campuses is also driving broader collisions in our culture and politics.\n\nAs America changes, so too do the issues America chooses to confront, and the ways it chooses to confront them. In 1996, as President Bill Clinton swept to reelection, the Democratic Party platform included a section on immigration that sounds as if it could have been released by the Trump administration today:\n\nToday's Democratic Party also believes we must remain a nation of laws. We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. For years before Bill Clinton became President, Washington talked tough but failed to act. In 1992, our borders might as well not have existed. The border was under-patrolled, and what patrols there were, were under-equipped. Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again.\n\nPresident Clinton is making our border a place where the law is respected and drugs and illegal immigrants are turned away. We have increased the Border Patrol by over 40 percent; in El Paso, our Border Patrol agents are so close together they can see each other. Last year alone, the Clinton Administration removed thousands of illegal workers from jobs across the country. Just since January of 1995, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported.\n\nFast-forward to the 2016 Democratic Party platform: Another Clinton was running for president, but the party was much more reliant on Hispanic votes.\n\nDemocrats believe we need to urgently fix our broken immigration system - which tears families apart and keeps workers in the shadows - and create a path to citizenship for law-abiding families who are here, making a better life for their families and contributing to their communities and our country ... we will defend and implement President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans executive actions to help DREAMers, parents of citizens, and lawful permanent residents avoid deportation. We will build on these actions to provide relief for others, such as parents of DREAMers. ...\n\nWe believe immigration enforcement must be humane and consistent with our values. We should prioritize those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities, not hardworking families who are contributing to their communities. We will end raids and roundups of children and families, which unnecessarily sow fear in immigrant communities.\n\nIn 1996, white voters were more closely split between the two parties, the Hispanic vote was smaller, and both parties were more skeptical of immigration. In 2016, white voters were concentrated in the Republican Party, Hispanic voters were far more powerful, and this cut a political schism in which Democrats became friendlier to immigrants and Republicans nominated Trump.\n\nThis is a dynamic Tesler describes well. \"In the post-civil rights era, Democrats needed to maintain their nonwhite base without alienating white voters,\" he said. \"So their incentive was silence. And Republicans needed to win over white voters without appearing racist. So their incentive was to speak about race in code. The shifts now have made it so Democrats' incentive is to make explicitly pro-racial equality appeals and Republicans now have an incentive to make more explicit anti-minority appeals.\"\n\nTake that idea and extend it out into the coming decades of American politics. The Democratic Party will not be able to win elections without an excited, diverse coalition. The Republican Party will not be able to win elections without an enthused white base. Democrats will need to build a platform that's even more explicit in its pursuit of racial and gender equality, while Republicans will need to design a politics even more responsive to a coalition that feels itself losing power.\n\nThis dynamic is behind much of the frustration about \"identity politics.\" When a single group dominates the political agenda, their grievances and demands are just coded as politics, and the vast majority of policy is designed in response to their concerns. But that changes when no one group can control the agenda but many groups can push items onto it; then the competition between identity-based groups becomes visible. And it becomes particularly visible to the group that's traditionally dominated the agenda and believes that their issues reflect what politics is supposed to be about and other groups' concerns represent special pleading.\n\nThe experience of losing status - and being told that loss of status is part of society's march to justice - is itself radicalizing. In 2006, Nyla Branscombe, Michael Schmitt, and Kristin Schiffhauer published a fascinating paper called \" Racial attitudes in response to thoughts of White privilege .\" They found that priming white college students to think about the concept of white privilege led them to express more racial resentment in subsequent surveys. The simplest way to activate someone's identity is to threaten it, to tell them they don't truly deserve what they have, to make them consider that it might be taken away.\n\nRecently, I was in Los Angeles, interviewing Mayor Eric Garcetti . I asked him how, in a diverse polity, he dealt with the tensions of what some call identity politics and what some just call politics. His answer? Talk less, act more.\n\n\"I came in here as mayor,\" he replied, \"and I looked at the boards and commissions that I appointed about 300 people to oversee our departments. And within six months, I made them, for the first time, over 50 percent women. I think it was 53 or 54 percent women. And then we could get back to business.\"\n\nPerhaps that's the answer. But imagine that at the national level, attempted by the first female president, with a polarized media looking for conflict. Many would celebrate it. Others would see discrimination, threat, loss. Think back to Limbaugh saying, \"How do you get promoted in a Barack Obama administration? By hating white people.\" Think of Jordan Peterson labeling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's efforts to promote gender equality a \"murderous equity doctrine.\"\n\nThe world is not zero-sum, but it is sometimes zero-sum. A world in which 50 percent of government appointees are female is a world in which fewer are male. Those losses will be felt, and fought. Powerful social movements will arise to protect what is being taken, to justify the way things were before. The quickest path toward social calm would be to leave these inequities untouched, but even if that were desirable - and it's not - it will be impossible as historically marginalized groups gain the power to demand their share of the American dream.\n\nAs we navigate these sensitivities, we can do so with more or less care. Richeson believes it would be wise for demographers to stop using terms like \"majority-minority America\" - after all, whites will still be a plurality, and what good can come of framing America's trajectory in a way that leaves the single largest group feeling maximally threatened? It sounds like \"a force of nonwhite people who are coming and they are working as a coalition to overturn white people and whiteness,\" Richeson said, laughing. \"That's a problem!\"\n\nRicheson's research shows that if you can add reassurance to discussions of demographic change - telling people, for instance, that the shifts are unlikely to upend existing power or economic arrangements - the sense of threat, and the tilt toward racial and political conservatism, vanishes. The problem, she admits, is, \"we can't say, 'Don't worry, white people, you'll be okay and you'll get to run everything forever!'\"\n\nThe other problem is that the conversation about, and the experience of, a browning America will not be driven by demographers and social psychologists; it will be driven by ambitious politicians looking for an edge, by political pundits looking for ratings, by outrageous stories going viral on social media, by cultural controversies like Gamergate and Roseanne Barr getting fired .\n\nTo say American politics is in for turbulence is not to say we are in for dissolution. A majority of Americans - though not of Republicans - believe the browning of America is a good thing for the country. And we have watched states like California and Texas transition into majority-minority status without falling to pieces. Politicians able to articulate a vision of this future that is inclusive, inspiring, and nonthreatening - the mixture Obama sought in 2008 - will reap massive rewards.\n\nBut as Obama found after he was elected, leadership in this era requires delivering for diverse coalitions, and taking sides in charged cultural battles, and thus becoming part of the very conflict you're trying to calm. The cycle of unity giving way to conflict, of hope about the future activating fear about the present, is likely to continue. And as long as much of the country feels threatened by the changes they see, there will be a continuing, and perhaps growing, market for politicians like Trump.\n\nSubscribe to The Ezra Klein Show on iTunes , or wherever you get your podcasts!\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIjeoma Oluo on the \"perfect storm\" that finally engaged white America on racism.\n\nby Emily Stewart\n\nFor much of America to wake up to the realities of systemic racism and police brutality, the context had to be extreme; the violence had to be prolonged - more than eight minutes of a black man suffering, a knee on his neck, saying he can't breathe. The cameras had to not only be rolling, but the officer had to look directly at it without caring he was being filmed, or apparently worried that he was risking his own health in the middle of a pandemic. And an audience had to be watching, pleading \"to let him breathe.\" All over a $20 bill .\n\n\"Violent white supremacy doesn't rest,\" says Ijeoma Oluo, speaker and author of the book So You Want to Talk About Race .\n\nBut for many white Americans, this idea of active white supremacy is not one they have ever thought about before. Amid George Floyd's death and the protests it has inspired over the past two weeks, the country is waking up. The issues demonstrators are pushing against aren't new - especially to black, brown, and indigenous people who have experienced them their entire lives. But the diverse and widespread outrage over them we're seeing right now is. Polls show swift and significant shifts in attitudes about police violence toward people of color.\n\nBut the conversation about racism in America, especially for those new to it, is uneasy and imperfect. Oluo knows: She dedicates much of her time talking about how to talk about race, as the title of her book suggests.\n\nShe and I recently spoke about her views on the current moment, the Black Lives Matter movement, and what it will take to create lasting change. It's not inevitable that the protests will fade quickly - the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott lasted for 381 days - but it's vital to have conversations now while the energy is high about what happens next.\n\nWe also talked about what it means to get educated on racism and to do the work and what isn't helpful when it comes to solidarity. For example, those black boxes on Instagram last week - not the best idea.\n\n\"Be wary of anything that allows you to do something that isn't actually felt by people of color,\" Oluo said. \"I always ask myself when I'm trying to do solidarity work, can the people I'm in solidarity with actually feel this? Can they spend this? Can they eat this? Does this actually help them in any way? And if it doesn't, let it go.\"\n\nAnd those looking to help need to focus on more than police brutality. Racism factors into so many parts of the cultural fabric - education, work, housing, and much more. That requires attention, too. \"It's not just that we deserve to not be killed,\" Oluo said. \"We deserve to thrive in this country, just like everyone else.\"\n\nOur conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nJust to start off, how are you feeling in this moment?\n\nI'm exhausted, honestly. It's been a lot, and I'm preparing to do more. I think that right now we are tired and scared and sad and a little excited to see some steps toward real change, and I'm kind of holding all of that in me right now. But mostly, I'm very, very exhausted.\n\nIs this a moment in your mind? Is this something different that's happening right now?\n\nI would say it's definitely a moment that we have not seen in at least 30 years, as far as a nationwide movement for change, where we're actually starting to see some cities paying attention and seeing a shift in the national conversation about racism, systemic racism, and police brutality in America. What will come? I don't know if it will lead to something different than what we've seen, but it is different this time.\n\nWhat's different?\n\nRight now, it's really been a perfect storm. We haven't seen protests in all 50 states where you could have a day where every state, and then multiple countries around the world, are joining in to say that black lives matter, to say that enough is enough. We haven't seen that in a very long time.\n\nWhat's happening right now - when you have people who are already tired and scared and worried about the pandemic that we've been in - is that not only did it hit the black community especially hard to see that violence in the midst of this pandemic that's coming for us, but to also see that violent white supremacy doesn't rest. Police will still take the time and risk their own health to take the life of a black person.\n\nIt also shocked the rest of the country to realize this is how ingrained it is. It is this ingrained, when everyone is supposed to be staying home, when we should all have bigger things to worry about, that a supposedly fraudulent $20 bill will cost a black person their life.\n\nI think that we were all feeling raw. We all had less reserves, and it was just a collective \"enough.\" It's been enough for a lot of us for a very long time, but I'm still glad to see so many people coming out in solidarity.\n\nHow is the conversation about race different from in the past? Ten years, five years, even two years ago?\n\nWhen I started writing, \"Black Lives Matter\" wasn't a phrase that was even said. I remember desperately getting people to just recognize why they should care about this. And Black Lives Matter itself was a movement just trying to say that we deserve to live. And a large segment of the American population that was still struggling with, \"Is Black Lives Matter the thing to say?\" have set that aside now. They're saying okay, there is a problem, we're not going to argue whether this is something we should be saying. We're moving past that. And that is new. There are, of course, still some people who love to shout, \"All lives matter.\" But I used to run into well-meaning people asking, why do I have to say this? They're not asking that question anymore.\n\nThat's new, because it allows us to start talking strategy.\n\nWhen I wrote my book, I remember talking in a chapter about police brutality and reform. My book is kind of an introduction to race, and I am so encouraged to see people move so far past that to be talking about what it means to defund, to completely restructure how we keep communities safe and healthy. I love seeing people who maybe a year ago thought reform was the way ago now saying, wait a minute, what if we imagine a whole system that doesn't rely on criminalization, that doesn't have a certain amount of brutality built into it as the thing we put up with to feel safe?\n\nThat is what is encouraging to me, seeing people move past, \"Is this a big deal?\" to \"What is the best way to tackle it?\"\n\n\"Violent white supremacy doesn't rest\"\n\nA lot of white people seem to have been caught by surprise by the realities of police brutality and racism. Why do you think that is?\n\nOur culture still frames racism as something that lies fully within the hearts and minds of racist white people. It's racism if you hate, and therefore if we can just find the few people who hate people of color, who hate black people, then we could solve racism if we could just solve them. What that means is that the everyday fear and heartbreak and stigmatization that we deal with in this country is largely ignored.\n\nYou don't see after-school specials on racism that talk about the ways in which teachers don't think you wrote your paper because you did really well on it, or how people with their hair in braids are seen as less professional. These are not issues that people think of when they think racism. When I give talks, when I say someone's a racist, what do you think? And people say, \"The Klan.\"\n\nFor people to realize that it had to be so bad in our police forces, it wasn't just the act. It wasn't just the fact that the way George Floyd was killed was so shocking. It was the fact that things had to be so bad that all four of those officers knew that they would be completely fine to murder someone long and painfully in front of cameras, in front of a live audience. What it spoke to was not just those officers, it spoke to an entire culture. You can't say it's a few bad apples at that point. That's where a lot of that shock is coming from.\n\nIt's frustrating. I know that I'm frustrated, and I'm hearing from so many other black people who are so frustrated at getting phone calls from white people they've known for a long time saying they had no idea. And you think, \"Why weren't you listening to me? I've been saying this the whole time. I'm a human being with words who can say that this is what's happening.\"\n\nHad it just been one officer, it wouldn't have been as shocking. But to see four officers participate in this, in front of an audience, knowing they were being recorded, was really what showed that this goes deep. This is a systemic issue in a way that people who don't have to worry about the system of policing had [not seen].\n\nSo when we see white people rallying en masse against racism now and in support of Black Lives Matter, do you think it really is just seeing George Floyd's murder? Or what do you think is happening, that these protests are now finally very diverse?\n\nI think that's part of it. It really did shock the conscience of people in ways it hasn't before.\n\nIt's important to note for the black community, for the indigenous community, it was not just George Floyd. It was the accumulation of Breonna Taylor and all these other beautiful black and indigenous lives that have been taken.\n\nIt's also white people are seeing other people say something, speaking out, protesting. And they're saying, \"I can do it, too.\" And it's contagious. People forget that this sort of resistance is a social activity - it's not a fun social activity, but it is a social activity. It is a collective movement, and it does cause more people to come out.\n\nI do think people have more time. We can't overestimate the impact of a lot of people being out of work, having time to get out there with protests and talk about this.\n\nOur social connections to people via the internet are sustaining us in a way that hasn't happened in the past, because we can't see people in person. Therefore, we're talking about these things in a way that we weren't before. We're not going out to a bar; we're talking about the social issues of the day on social media. And I think that's also contributing to it. I hate to use the phrase perfect storm, but it took a perfect storm of events to really engage white America in a way that hasn't happened before.\n\nSo what is your advice to those white people who want to talk about race right now?\n\nRight now, you need to be running two tracks at the same time.\n\nYou have to be running your track of education, asking why didn't I know about this? Why wasn't I doing something sooner? Where am I lacking? What words are confusing me? Start reading up and start learning.\n\nAt the same time, look at being of use. Look at what your local protest leaders and resistance leaders are doing. Do they need donations? Do they need masks? Do people need certain messages amplified? Start looking at conversations you can be having in your cities, your towns, your school districts, in your offices to bring those issues forward.\n\nIt's not just that we deserve to not be killed. We deserve to thrive in this country, just like everyone else.\n\nLook how you can be of use to the people who have been struggling for justice and for black, indigenous, and people of color to really thrive in this country. Ask how you can help make sure that it's something people actually want and can feel.\n\nIt's not just money, but if you can, give money to causes. But give your time. Amplify voices. Open doors. If someone's saying they're having trouble at your office talking about the issue of race, can you add your voice to back that person up? If your school board is not talking about the ways in which their disciplinary systems are set up, or talking about getting police out of schools, that is something that you can bring up. And you can bring your friends in. Start looking at how you can be of use, and then also, at the same time, keep your personal education going.\n\n\"It's important to note for the black community, for the indigenous community, it was not just George Floyd. It was the accumulation of Breonna Taylor and all these other beautiful black and indigenous lives that have been taken.\"\n\nWhat should people avoid when talking about race?\n\nIf you are a white person, right now is not the time to go seek out the most racist person and try to tell them they're an awful person and argue with them - not because they don't need to know that, because I think that open racism should always be met with resistance and pushback, but because our time is precious and you need to be doing actions.\n\nThere's something really performative about saying, \"I spent all my day today arguing with my Trump-loving uncle.\" I, as a black person, don't know your Trump-loving uncle. I don't feel that - the only reason why I know is because you posted that you did it. It does not help my life.\n\nI hear from a lot of people saying, \"I've never been black, but this happened to me, so I know what it's like.\" Don't minimize the experiences of black and indigenous people with state violence by comparing it to the time that someone didn't like you or you were accused of doing something you didn't do. Recognize that you will never fully know what it's like to live under white supremacy as a black and indigenous person in this country. You will just have to believe us, and you just have to take us at our word and fight with us. Don't try to make it about you. Don't try to make it about your pain and your journey, and keep your energies focused on where you can be of use to the struggle and to the movement that's happening right now.\n\nWhen you talk about the question of being performative on social media, I'm curious about your thoughts on Blackout Tuesday , when people were posting black boxes on social media to show solidarity. Is that helpful?\n\nIt's not helpful; it actually harms things. And I think it's an important conversation to have.\n\nThis is very similar to me to the whole safety pin debacle after Trump's election [where people put a safety pin on their clothes to signify they opposed acts of religious and racist violence and abuse in the wake of his victory]. What it is is people who are looking for something quick that they can do to feel like they've done something.\n\nThese are not things that black people come up with. When I'm thinking, what would help me feel safe in this country? It's not \"I wish everyone's Instagram squares were black.\" I can't feel that. Especially when coupled with the disengagement - people do this performative gesture and then disengage. People aren't even open to the feedback of why that's not helpful or what they could be doing to be helpful.\n\nBe wary of anything that allows you to do something that isn't actually felt by people of color. Be wary of things that are purely symbolic; they are not helpful. We are not dying because of lack of symbolism in this country, so question who benefits from that. If what you think is, oh, it made me feel better, then you're the one who's benefiting from it.\n\nStay away from those things and question them, because that energy does take away. The time we had to spend arguing about this, to spend getting the word out, all of these PSAs [saying] take your squares down because nobody can actually see real Black Lives Matter protests - that energy could have gone toward amplifying a useful message, and it's a waste of time. And when we waste time, we lose lives, so it's not trivial.\n\nJust always be aware. I always ask myself when I'm trying to do solidarity work, can the people I'm in solidarity with actually feel this? Can they spend this? Can they eat this? Does this actually help them in any way? And if it doesn't, let it go.\n\nOnce these protests slow down, do you expect white people to keep doing the work?\n\nI hope that they can. I think it's important to recognize that there are people out there who have been doing work for 10, 15, 20 years and will continue to do it even when the story is the protests are over. The work has continued and will continue, regardless of how many people are standing next to the people doing the work.\n\nIf we are going to sustain this, we have to start talking about what it means to sustain. We have to start digging into our history and figuring out how the Montgomery bus boycott lasted a year, how we had Freedom Summer. How did we have all of these long, sustained protests and activities that brought about real change? What did they do? What tactics did they use to keep people going? What was the support system?\n\nAnd we need to start looking at that now while the energy's high and ask what it would look like to hold cities accountable to keep pushing toward change, what connections we need to make, how to support people doing the work, how to rotate people in and out so that people don't burn out. We need to have those conversations now while the energy is high. A lot of people are just assuming it will go away, and so planning to keep it going is important.\n\nWhat should the work look like?\n\nIt's really important to watch what's happening in Minneapolis right now, and Los Angeles, and New York, with the defunding and the allocating of funds from the police system and into communities. We need to invest in that and look at our own cities and towns and see what we can do right now to demilitarize our police and take some of those funds and resources and put them back into the communities that have been so harmed.\n\nIt's also really important right now to see who's been doing this work. Look in your city, in town - anywhere you have people of color, someone has been doing that work. Ask, \"How can I invest in that work?\" Let's not reinvent the wheel.\n\nWhat we're hearing right now, the changes that are being pushed, are things that activists have been asking for for a very long time. It's not new; they're not new ideas. The plans are in place. We just need people to put their excitement behind it. It's a little less sexy to go to the old head activists and ask what they've been doing, but that's what we actually have to do.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAEI's Tim Carney discusses how social breakdown killed the American dream on The Ezra Klein Show.\n\nby Jane Coaston\n\nIn the wake of the 2016 election, Tim Carney, a commentary editor at the Washington Examiner and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, began traveling across the country and poring through county-level data in an attempt to understand the forces that led to Donald Trump's victory. The culprit, he argues, is not racism or economic anxiety; it's the breakdown of social institutions.\n\nIn his new book, Alienated America: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse , Carney posits that for centuries religious (and other private) institutions formed a much-needed social glue that kept communities together. That social glue, however, has decayed in recent decades, creating a void of despair, alienation, and frustration in so-called Middle America. Donald Trump did not offer a compelling way to solve these problems, but he was the only candidate willing to name them - and in 2016, that was enough.\n\nI sat down with Carney on The Ezra Klein Show to discuss this thesis. We also talk about why white evangelicals love Trump so much, how communities of color have responded differently to institutional loss than white communities, the appeal of Bernie Sanders, how Trump's reelection strategy will differ from his 2016 campaign, and much more.\n\nA lightly edited excerpt from our discussion follows. You can listen to our whole conversation on The Ezra Klein Show .\n\nIn Alienated America you look county by county at areas that Trump won during the primaries and find that these areas tended to be those that lack opportunities for civic engagement. In some of these places, folks would go out and work in oil fields where there are lots of jobs and lots of money, but they lacked strong civil society. So, support for Trump was not necessarily about money; it was about a lack of civic togetherness.\n\nThat's exactly right. There were lots of things that I thought were confusing in trying to analyze where working middle-American suffering comes from and where Donald Trump came from. I thought the answers that were flawed were the ones that just looked at materialistic explanations.\n\nHaving money is very correlated with success in life. You're less likely to get addicted to drugs if you're in a place that has more money. If you yourself have more money, you're more likely to get married, you're more likely to self-report happiness. But what I'm trying to argue is that that's not because of the money itself. In the book, I point to middle class, heavily religious places in Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Salt Lake City, where you don't have to be really rich; you don't have to have a college degree to be plugged into that. So I think we're being overly materialistic if we assume that the struggles with the working class are just material and cultural deprivation.\n\nThe individuals who originally got on that Trump train - those who never voted before until Trump jumped in the race - weren't necessarily the ones who were [materially] suffering the most, but they were living in places that were [socially] collapsing. That's what Alienated America is about. The social cohesion and social trust of where you live is a key to having the good life.\n\nYou talk about going to some of the very early primary States and seeing how the people who were helping Trump win weren't connected to other people. They felt as if their country had left them behind. There was a lot of talk about how they don't trust their neighbors and they have to keep a gun by the front door. What did they think Trump would change or do about that?\n\nTo reiterate, I'm not talking about the people who chose Trump over Hillary. I'm talking about the people who had never voted before and now they are waiting for four hours outside of a rally outside in Milwaukee. What was motivating these people?\n\nAs I was finishing up the book, I played back my earliest interview. In it, I asked the guy, \"you're wearing a hat and a scarf that say Make America Great Again. What's not great about America?\" I thought he was going to say something about immigrants or trade or the sexual revolution or whatever. But he said something along the lines of, \"Well, when I was a kid, we had Memorial Day parades and all the Boy Scouts and all the Girl Scouts and all the Little Leagues would walk down and pant American flags in the cemetery in town.\"\n\nThat later became the thesis of my book: The American dream seems dead to him because where he lives now, outside of Charlotte, is a place that doesn't have strong community. The same sort of thing that draws people to Bernie Sanders - people wanting to be involved and connected and organized. I think a lot of voters just wanted somebody just to say \"the American dream is dead, and those guys who in Washington are ripping you off.\"\n\nI was thinking about how much of conservatism in some ways is inherently reactionary - and when I say this word I don't mean it negatively. I mean the idea of \"standing athwart history yelling stop.\" Is that what his voters expect from Trump?\n\nI do think that's some of it. It's easy to just focus on the policy issues and just to look at immigration or trade. But I think that that's the surface. I use the image in the book of the first domino. The first domino has already fallen: China's already sort of taken all of our jobs. The factory's already closed down.\n\nBut if you think that that's the beginning and the end, then you're missing the problem. Go to Uniontown, Pennsylvania, which used to be a steel town and see that the factory isn't the only thing that closed down. The coffee shop where the factory workers went closed down. The Methodist church closed down. The Catholic church consolidated with a parish in a different county. The owners of the local bar can't stay open more than two nights a week. So people don't have that many places to come and gather.\n\nTrump can't bring back the factory. But they see the closure of the factory as a first domino that's led to a collapse of their community. And Trump is the only one saying this whole thing has been bad while Marco Rubio would say, some of this is bad but trade generally is good. Trump was most willing to curse the changes that have led to real suffering in these people's lives. And white working-class guys - the sons of the people who had the factory jobs 30 years ago - really are struggling,\n\nWhen I spoke to Chris Arnade, who wrote the book Dignity, he raised the point that for white working-class voters, their response to a political downturn for them has been to vote for a Trump or a Pat Buchanan or a Ron Paul; black working-class folks drop out of voting altogether. There was a really great New York Times piece from Milwaukee right after the 2016 election that reiterated this point. Based on the work that you've done, why do you think that different working-class communities deal with political and cultural and societal downturns differently?\n\nThere's going to be a million reasons, but one thing to keep in mind is that the white working-class voter mostly did drop out. If you remember, the best post-2012 analysis was by Sean Trende who wrote about the missing white voter. Most of the reason Romney lost was because working-class whites who weren't really attached to religious institutions from Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa stayed home. Had they voted, it's possible Romney would have won some or all of those states. So I would argue that a lot of the white working-class vote had started tuning out [of politics].\n\nA lot of what I do is bar reporting. And one place that I was skipping for years were the roadside country bars because I would pull over, start talking about the economy, try to gently bring it over toward politics, [and] universally people would say \"Politics is a bunch of BS. I don't vote, and I'm not going to talk about it.\" In 2016, [it was] \"politics is a bunch of BS; that's why I'm voting for Donald Trump.\" There was this disaffected white population that was pushed totally away from politics. And these people in Pennsylvania weren't voting for Pat Toomey for Senate, but they were voting for Donald Trump.\n\nWhat I would say is that Hillary Clinton certainly was not the candidate who was going to bring the disaffected working-class black voter. Whether Bernie or Biden is, is an excellent question. Biden's excellent performance in polls of black voters early on is promising, and I do see Bernie turning out lots of people who wouldn't vote if he weren't on the ballot.\n\nYou can listen to the full episode by subscribing to The Ezra Klein Show on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nA conversation with Sen.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"I think it's important to say it's a social crisis.\" - J.D. Vance, author of \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nIn June, a Yale Law School graduate and Silicon Valley executive born in the backwater Appalachian region published a book about the white working class in America. Titled Hillbilly Elegy , the book could not have come at a more fortuitous time.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a divisive presidential campaign, J.D. Vance's meditation on the anxieties of the white working class was desperately needed.\n\nThere are several cleavages in this election, but none more significant than race and education. According to a July Pew Research Center poll , Trump leads Clinton among non-college-educated whites 57 percent to 36 percent. A September ABC News/Washington Post poll showed an even more lopsided margin, with Trump leading by 59 points among this group.\n\nAs my colleague Dylan Matthews noted last month, Trump's constituency extends well beyond the poor and white working class, but there's no question that the racial and cultural fault lines run deep in this election.\n\nThe question is, why now? What is it about this year and this candidate that proved so combustible?\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why Trump has appealed to what Vance calls the \"Hillbilly demographic.\" Some of it is racial animus, some of it is cultural paranoia, and some of it has to do with economic angst. Truth is, Trump's popularity isn't reducible to any one thing. But understanding what's happening in the poorest corners of white America is certainly instructive.\n\nWhich is why Hillbilly Elegy is such an important book.\n\nVance's is a unique voice. He offers a tough but sympathetic glimpse into a pocket of white America that is too easily lampooned in popular culture, and he does it as only someone who's lived in that world can.\n\nI reached out to Vance on Wednesday to talk about his book, what he learned about the rural South and the white working class, and how Trump aligns with the story he tells in Hillbilly Elegy .\n\nOur conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.\n\nI've tried to understand - really understand - why a subset of white Americans feel so alienated. For obvious reasons, nobody wants to hear about how hard a bunch of white people have it, but there's a genuine social crisis occurring in pockets of white America, and you've put your finger on it in this book.\n\nI think it's important to say it's a social crisis, because it isn't just economic. In our mainstream political discourses we very often want to focus on the material part, and that's important, that's definitely a significant chunk of what's going on. But at the end of the day when you look at these communities, the thing that worries me the most isn't the fact that it's hard for them to find good jobs, although that does worry me.\n\nWhat worries me is that virtually every other social indicator in these communities is going in the wrong direction, from the mortality rates to the family dissolution rates, even the incarceration rates.\n\nWhen we think of incarceration rates, we tend to think it's a problem for black Americans, and for obvious reasons. It's a very good thing that in recent years the incarceration rate for black Americans has been going down, but it's been going up for white Americans . And I think that's just another variable that you have to look at in this community. It's indicative of a broader problem.\n\nAs you argue in the book, it's revealing that working-class whites are the most pessimistic group in America, despite suffering less poverty than other groups. Clearly something else is going on here, and even if you're someone who isn't sympathetic to the plight of these communities, it's still important to understand what's happening.\n\nYes, that's exactly right. If you look at the average wealth or the average income of the white working class versus the black working class or the Latino working class, you still see that white Americans are doing better. Things haven't been great, but they're still doing better in relative terms than those other groups.\n\nAnd yet the level of economic pessimism, the cynicism about whether your kids will have a better life than you had, it's much worse among the white community than it is among any other pocket of the country. And I think that's really revealing. It suggests that people are seeing something on the ground that isn't necessarily captured by just income and employment statistics.\n\nWell, surely something is happening on the ground that isn't captured by these conventional metrics, but I think some of this resentment is manufactured by the media in different ways at different levels.\n\nIs it your sense that people in these communities feel like the national media is just blind, or, perhaps worse, indifferent to what's happening there? Which is why they respond to alternative forms of conservative media that feed on their discontent.\n\nYes, I would say that people feel that the press is either indifferent or, when it does deign to look at the problems of white America, it does so in a pretty condescending and judgmental way. So the gist of what you hear in a lot of these communities is that it's not just that the media doesn't care, it's that the media thinks we're all a bunch of dumb rednecks.\n\nAnd I think that impression is a little overblown, but I also think it comes from a very real place. I've spent a big chunk of my life around coastal elites, and there is a sense among these people that there is a big pocket of the country that is just morally deteriorating and is not especially deserving of sympathy.\n\nAwareness of this breeds resentment. I think it produces a kind of feedback loop where you feel resentful, and then the media tells your story so you feel even more resentful. And it just constantly feeds back into the sense that you're sort of detached from the broader country, a country you care a lot about and you still have lot of pride in. But it feels fundamentally divided into two camps, the camp of people like you and the camp of people who look down on people like you.\n\nI grew up in the South. I know the culture. I hated it when I lived there but I've come to appreciate its charms since leaving. One thing that's clear to me now, as a Southerner living on the East Coast, is how contemptuous the political class is of hillbillies, to borrow your phrase.\n\nWhite people in the South and in rural America know this, and it's a big reason for their hatred of all things \"elite.\" It's why they love a guy like Trump, who's a trust fund baby billionaire but he flaunts every aristocratic convention you can imagine. He's loud, tacky, anti-intellectual, crude.\n\nI'm convinced Trump is completely full of shit, but he is, as Michael Moore said recently, a kind of \"fuck you\" to the elites.\n\nYes, I'm not sure I can really add to that. I think you're exactly right. The sense that I get is that people are really animated by this feeling that they are looked down upon by the coastal elite of the country. You hear it in country music songs, you hear it on Fox News, you hear it on conservative radio.\n\nThe constant theme that's running through the sort of cultural memory of this group of people is that for the past 20 or so years, mainstream culture has looked down on you. And so you start to build counter-narratives and counter-institutions to defend against this perception.\n\nAnd that's really where I think a lot of this alienation and a lot of these new media enterprises come from. It's not that these things came out of thin air. My sense is that they were really set by the alienation Middle America feels toward mainstream culture.\n\nSo where do you come down on this question of what's actually animating Trump supporters: ethno-nationalism or economic grievances? My sense is that it's not reducible to a single variable, though ethno-nationalism is a bigger factor than a lot of people care to admit.\n\nWell, my view is that it's pretty complicated, and I would say the most frustrating part about this conversation about what animates Trump supporters is the feeling that people are being treated as two dimensional: It's either these people are driven exclusively by cultural or racial resentment or they have this economic anxiety and that's really driving them to Trump.\n\nHe's collected millions of votes, and the people who are voting for him are voting for him for very particular reasons - and yes, some of it is economic anxiety, and yes, some of it is racial resentment. But if those are the only two things that we're thinking about and we're ignoring that this entire community is struggling in a lot of the ways that we've talked about - the drug addiction, the family breakdown, the rising mortality rates and so forth - then I think we're ignoring a very significant problem in the country.\n\nWe're also ignoring the fact that people are complex moral actors who make decisions for relatively complex reasons. And that failure to recognize the complexity of what's driving the Trump phenomenon is just another thing that makes people think the media doesn't understand them and is merely condescending to them.\n\nI think that's mostly right. Look, the fact that the median household income of the average Trump primary voter is $72,000 tells you that the Trump phenomenon is about much more than economic grievances.\n\nI suspect I'm less charitable than you in terms of ascribing justifiable motives to some of these Trump voters, but I absolutely take your larger point that this is complex and we should avoid reducing people to caricatures.\n\nThere's this study by an economist Jonathan Rothwell that came out recently, and one most of the most interesting findings is that Trump supporters were more likely to be working class and more likely to live in lower employment areas, but they weren't struggling economically relative to the rest of population\n\nSo they were maybe lower income relative to other Republicans, but they weren't low income relative to the rest of the country. But if you really dig in, you find that Trump supporters are more likely to be veterans, more likely to have lower indices of social capital, more likely to be living in areas with rising mortality rates.\n\nWhat frustrates me, in terms of how studies like that are reported on, is that we miss what they actually reveal, which is that Trump supporters are absolutely struggling, but they're not struggling in a way that's captured by traditional income statistics.\n\nSo I'm curious to hear how you think about class. Political theorists have generally held that the most important division in society is between the rich and the poor. It seems to me that poor white people and poor black people have more in common than, say, rich and poor white people do.\n\nBut these shared cultural and economic interests are constantly eclipsed by racial divisions. Any thoughts on why that is?\n\nI think in terms of cultural similarities you're definitely right, and that was one of the great geniuses of SNL 's \"Black Jeopardy\" sketch. If you drill into the narratives that are very popular in each of these groups, they're actually not all that different.\n\nI think because of politics, race and class are often subsumed into the same category of blackness. It's been the case for a very long time that if you say poor person, a lot of people immediately think of a black person or of a minority. Obviously this is terrible for black people because most of them are not poor, and it's terrible for white people because a very large segment of them are poor.\n\nSo politics needlessly muddies the waters?\n\nThere's no doubt politics muddies the waters. To think of class as its own unique segment, you would need poor black Americans and poor white Americans to really work together. But because of the politics that exist in this country, poor white Americans have gravitated toward the Republican Party, mostly for cultural affiliation reasons of the sort we just talked about.\n\nI think poor black Americans have gravitated toward the Democratic Party in the past 40 years because that's the party that has promised to tear down the most legal barriers to black advancement.\n\nSo my sense is that because poor black folks and poor white folks are not on the same side of the political divide, it's very hard to see these classes in a way that doesn't get swallowed into political conversation.\n\nWould you say that the Republican Party has cynically exploited poor white people for political gain?\n\nI don't know that I would say cynically exploited. My sense is that truly poor white people probably don't vote that much. And lower- and middle-income and working-class white Americans have gravitated toward the Republican Party for both good and bad reasons. But I don't think there are people dealing secretly in back rooms figuring out how to pit the poor white against the poor black.\n\nMy inclination would be to say that people tend to follow their individual political incentives, and for the past the past 30 or so years the Republicans have offered an economic story that you may not agree with, but at least up until the George W. Bush administration, produced relatively positive economic outcomes when both Republicans and Democrats were in office.\n\nMy sense is that where Trump really comes from is that over the past 10 or 15 years, working-class white Americans have increasingly felt that the economic policies of the Republican Party haven't been serving them especially well. Maybe they haven't been destructive, but they certainly haven't been that helpful.\n\nWell, I'd say that while the Republicans may have offered a nice \"story,\" it's the policies of the Democrats that have aided working-class voters the most. But that's probably another discussion.\n\nLet me ask you this: How Democrats can engage white working-class voters in a way that connects, that doesn't feel inauthentic or contrived or patronizing.\n\nIt's going to be really hard unless Democrats spend more time in the geographies that working class white Americans actually live. There was this really interesting article by Alec MacGillis in the New York Times a couple of days ago in which he talked about the rising geographic segregation in the United States and how very few Democrats are living in Republican-majority areas. To win these folks back, you have to be their neighbors, you have to understand their attitudes.\n\nYou have to identify with them on a level that isn't patronizing, and to do that you have to actually know them. And increasingly what we have is two countries, a Republican country and a Democratic country, and the two groups don't talk to each other.\n\nSo Democrats have to spend more time with these voters and they have to recognize that the Democratic Party really has become the party of coastal elites.\n\nThe last theme I wanted to touch on with you is agency. You talk a lot about this in the book, and I think it may be the most important part of it.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but you seem to be saying that surrendering to structural or economic narratives is dangerous and counter-productive. By that I mean you acknowledge that much of the poverty and disorder in the poor white community has to do with the hallowing out of the economy, but you shy away from identifying that as a prime causal factor for what's gone wrong in these communities.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nIt's not that I don't care about the role of structure. I think it's reasonably well understood how structural conditions impact social life. My concern is that we understate or overlook moral agency in these discussions.\n\nThe reason that I'm worried about focusing on structural narratives to the exclusion of everything else is that people are responsive to the message that their culture gives to them. And if the message that your culture gives to you is that you have no chance, you have no hope, why work hard because even if you work hard you're not going to get ahead, I think that's very self-destructive to kids who grew up like I did.\n\nAnd I always bring this back to the example of my grandmother, who was a classic blue-dog Democrat who really recognized that life was unfair in a significant way. But she also drilled into me that I still had some measure of control. She would say, yes, life is unfair, but don't be one of those people who think the deck is stacked against them.\n\nI think it's really important that, as a community and as a broad American culture, we both recognize the ways that life can be unfair to poor people, but also really fight that impulse that says there's nothing that you can do, there's no hope, life is so unfair that you can't possibly get ahead.\n\nBecause I do believe that such narratives destroy the capacity for kids like me to control their lives to the extent that they can control it.\n\nWhat do you think conservatives fail to understand about structure?\n\nI think conservatives fail to recognize that a lot of the things that they see as bad decisions or as a consequence of some moral failing exist in a cultural context. Often it's about kids growing up and learning how to behave in a certain way out of necessity, in order to survive their circumstances.\n\nConservatives sort of fail to recognize that some of the habits and the attitudes that you pick up when you grow up poor, however bad they appear from the outside, they're necessary for your survival when you're on the inside.\n\nAnd so I would like conservatives to spend a little less time moralizing and a little more time thinking about ways to help counteract some of the effects of the culture in which poor kids grow up.\n\nWhat do liberals fail to understand about culture?\n\nIn some ways I feel like people on the left are so unwilling to place moral blame on the poor for some of their decisions that they completely ignore the way that poor people actually grow up and the way that they actually conduct their lives.\n\nYou don't have to think that a poor kid who grew up in dirt poverty in rural Appalachia is to blame for their circumstances to recognize that a lot of the habits that that kid picked up along the way are going to be very destructive in terms of raising a family or going to college or being successful in the workplace.\n\nThere's this sort of weird detachment from the actual lives that people live, and I just think liberals have to get a little bit more comfortable talking about what it is that's different about that poor kid, not just his material circumstances but also the attitudes and the expectations that he developed in the first 15 to 20 years of his life growing up in poverty, and how can we counteract it.\n\nThat has to be part of the conversation on the left.\n\nYou write that public policy can help, but that these are fundamentally cultural problems that have to be solved endogenously.\n\nCulture is amorphous and resistant to change, so I wonder where that leaves us in terms of lifting people out of poverty and bridging the various divides?\n\nWell, I hope it leaves us with the realization that there is a problem. Certainly that's what I hope readers of the book conclude, especially the people from my community who read it.\n\nThis is a problem that government can help with, but it can't be the only solution to a number of these issues. So where I would like to think it leaves us is that each individual actor in a community is going to have a different view on how to address some of these problems.\n\nAn individual parent should pick up the book and think maybe the way I'm interacting with my kid is causing a lot of problems down the road and maybe I should try to do it a little bit better. Maybe a social worker picks up the book and says, this is the reality of how these folks are living, maybe this changes how I approach my work. Maybe a church pastor picks up the book and says look, it's really problematic that there are so few poor kids in our churches, but there are a ton of upper- and middle-income kids in our churches - maybe I need to go out and minister to the least of these as Christ said.\n\nI think that the reaction that each individual person is going to have is going to be a little bit different. But I hope that the takeaway from the book is that we have a pretty significant problem in this country and we have to recognize the nature of the problem.\n\nThen perhaps we can fix it.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Buttigieg says white Americans \"can't be defensive\" when talking about race\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  July 16, 2019 / 3:31 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg, one of the two-dozen Democrats running for president, believes hesitation by some white Americans to speak frankly and openly about race and socioeconomic privilege is a major roadblock in elusive efforts to enact comprehensive criminal justice reform and address racial disparities in the U.S.\n\n\"I think the challenge for white America is to realize that we can't be defensive about this,\" the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told CBS News in an interview Sunday.\n\n\"When somebody is saying that we are benefitting from living in a system that creates privileges associated with systemic racism, we can't kind of retreat into this idea that, 'We're being personally attacked, so we're not going to want to talk about that.' Or that, 'Hey these were distant historic problems, we can't be held accountable for dealing with that,'\" he said. \"No.\"\n\nButtigieg said he's concerned about the long-term effects of inaction when it comes to racial inequality in America.\n\n\"I am worried that in different ways we may not be able to imagine, in the 21st century, if these inequalities keep getting worse, then that could once again threaten to unravel the American project,\" he said.\n\nThe millennial mayor and veteran of the war in Afghanistan also weighed in on President Trump's widely condemned racist tweets about four progressive congresswomen of color. \"It's racist and it fundamentally misunderstands America,\" he said.\n\nDespite impressive fundraising numbers, the openly gay Midwestern mayor has struggled to make significant inroads among communities of color - a key constituency in Democratic primaries. In an effort to appeal to those communities, he recently released \"The Douglass Plan,\" an ambitious proposal named for the famous 19th century abolitionist to invest in communities of color and try to dismantle systemic racism.\n\nBack home in South Bend, several events have strained Buttigieg's relationship with the city's African American community. He still faces tough questions for firing the city's African American police chief in 2012, and last month he was strongly criticized by some of South Bend's minority residents for his handling of an incident in which a city police officer killed an African American man. That officer, Sgt. Ryan O'Neill, resigned on Monday .\n\nDuring the first Democratic debate, Buttigieg conceded he has not done enough to diversify the city's police force.\n\nThe following transcript of the discussion between Buttigieg and CBS News political correspondent O'Keefe on race and criminal justice has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nED O'KEEFE: Thank you Mr. Mayor for doing this. Let's talk about some stuff that's going on today or that's in the news right now. I imagine you've seen what the president tweeted earlier today some of your Democratic colleagues in Congress today saying essentially they should go home to where they came from. Obvious outrage from a lot of Democrats about that but curious your reaction to his decision to once again interject in party politics and to say what he said.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, it's wrong, it's racist and it fundamentally misunderstands America. One of the reasons we set up this country, one of the things we celebrate in freedom and democracy of the United States is you can criticize your president. You can criticize the ways in which the country falls short of its values.\n\nAnd that makes you more, not less, loyal to this country whether we're talking about naturalized citizens or many of the people he was talking about who were born right here in the U.S. When you become a citizen, you are an American and questioning somebody's Americanness because they disagree with you - is about one of the most un-American things I can think of.\n\nED O'KEEFE: In the plan you released last week - the Frederick Douglass Plan - you had alluded to that white Americans especially have to talk about systemic racism.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's right.\n\nED O'KEEFE: President may have just presented you a great opportunity to do so, but why is that conversation perhaps more important for white people to have?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, for too long this has been talked about as a kind of specialty issue, something that people of color talk about and something that white politicians talk about with people of color and not the rest of the time. Systemic racism is something that diminishes all of us.\n\nOf course its worst effects are for its victims, but our entire country is held back through the inequality and the mistrust that it creates. The mistrust of institutions. The mistrust of a country that has not served everyone equally, and I am not just talking about far off historic harms like slavery. I'm talking about housing, unemployment and criminal justice discrimination that is taking place in our lifetimes, in living memory.\n\nAnd I think the challenge for white America is to realize that we can't be defensive about this. When somebody is saying that we are benefitting from living in a system that creates privileges associated with systemic racism, we can't kind of retreat into this idea that, \"We're being personally attacked, so we're not going to want to talk about that.\" Or that, \"Hey these were distant historic problems, we can't be held accountable for dealing with that.\" No.\n\nThe force that has come closest across American history to actually ending America was white supremacy. That was the Civil War. And I am worried that in different ways we may not be able to imagine, in the 21st century, if these inequalities keep getting worse, then that could once again threaten to unravel the American project. The levels of inequality we're seeing - much of it driven by racial inequality - are something that very few countries can survive intact.\n\nAnd if we don't all come together to deal with this - not as an issue for some, but as an issue for us all - then I worry that the entire American project will be weighed down.\n\nED O'KEEFE: You say that this is a conversation that white people need to have and not be defensive about it. That's going to be music to the ears of black, Latino, Asian people in this country who, as you said, you know, obviously want to hear about this and believe it to be true.\n\nIt's going to be a tougher sell though among white Americans who think things are fine. Or, why are they talking about this again? Or the gentleman that you had an interchange with a few weeks ago who suggested that if black people just stop committing crimes, there won't be a problem. I mean, that's what you're up against if you try and have this conversation.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: But we've got to have this conversation because time's running out. The reality is we can't separate the chaos of our politics, the division, the wrongfulness coming from the White House but also through our communities from all the pernicious effects of systemic racism. As long as this is two different countries for people of different races, which, if you look at the statistics on things from life expectancy to income to experiences, even for the exact same offense with the criminal justice system, it really is like two countries.\n\nAs long as that happens, then we don't have the strength of being one country. And if you want to know whether this impacts you, white or not, think about the fact that foreign adversaries are now using racial inequality and division as a national security weakness, pitting Americans against each other over this and treating it as a wedge that can weaken America. And they're right, this is a deep weakness in an otherwise strong, and robust American system. It's why we got to deal with it in our lifetime.\n\nAnd what we've learned the hard way is just taking a racist law and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to bring about equality. These things don't wash themselves out of the system without intentional action. They actually get worse. For the same reasons that a dollar saved because of interest grows over time, so does a dollar stolen. And many of these wrongs that started a long time ago are only going to get worse with time if we don't make the investments in home ownership, in education, in health equality, in a better criminal justice reform system, in helping with entrepreneurship to create more jobs, and by the way, if black entrepreneurs are thriving, they're creating more jobs for people of color and more jobs for all of us.\n\n[...]\n\nED O'KEEFE: You released this Douglass Plan. And you know that a lot of the chatter has been, \"Well, interesting guy, raised a lot of money, doing well in the polling, but struggling to win over black and brown voters.\"\n\nSo you release this plan, and then what? What happens next? How do you build up that support?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all I've got a responsibility to communicate about that plan. I believe it is the most comprehensive plan put forward in this campaign on how to make sure we lift up the conditions and opportunities for black Americans. But it's still my job to go out and share that idea.\n\nThere's a broader issue though, which is that I still need to work to get known in a lot of communities. And that's certainly true when you're new on the scene and you are not yourself from a community of color. It's certainly true in reaching out to black and brown voters who often want to know what you're made of in a way that takes time to explain. But I'm committed to doing that work, that's why we're reaching out to various groups, both in terms of big public appearances. And when the cameras are off, having smaller conversations with activists, with pastors, with residents.\n\nMaking sure that in the same way that it worked at home. For me to put in the quantity time that got the kind of support I needed to get reelected with help from the black community in South Bend. That that will serve me well winning the nomination too.\n\n[...]\n\nED O'KEEFE: One of the aspects of your Douglass Plan, I meant to ask about. You're essentially, correct me if I'm wrong, pushing to reduce incarceration rates by 50 percent.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's right.\n\nED O'KEEFE: There are some studies that have looked into what you are proposing, others have suggested this as well, that means you'd either have to release violent offenders or you're somehow tabulating state and local incarcerations which wouldn't be under federal control. So how do you get to 50 percent?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: So I believe that federal leadership can reduce those incarcerated at the state level and local level pretrial as well as what's happening federally. And we've got to do all of the above in order to meet this goal. The bottom line is, research tells us that we can and should have lower incarceration and that that will not be associated with an increase in crime. After all, if incarceration made everyone safe, we'd be the safest country in the world because we're pretty much the most incarcerated.\n\nBut it does mean that we work with states and localities, by the way, many of which are trying to do this, but don't have the resources. And again, we see this in my area of the Midwest, where you have highly successful, very promising programs for alternatives to incarceration. Drug diversion programs, for example. But there are long waitlists and backlogs because they don't have the resources to do it. The Federal Government should be helping because there's also a return to investment in making sure people are not incarcerated and when they leave, reintegrated successfully. We have learned that it is simply false that a tax cut for the wealthy will pay for itself. But it is absolutely true that having fewer people incarcerated pays for itself in the long run.\n\n© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Two symbols of strength a block away from each other - yet worlds apart.\n\n\"To witness the memory of Harriet Tubman, I would never say that things have not changed at all,\" said Crystal Fleming, an author and professor of sociology at New York's Stony Brook University. And yet, \"We are here with police cars everywhere and streets blocked off because there are uprisings for the same movement that she was a part of.\"\n\nAnd, like so many, Fleming is bearing witness to a national reckoning. \"To see all that we are still seeing in 2020, it should devastate you. It should make you question everything that you have been taught. It should make you question what it means to be a human being.\"\n\nQuestions with uncomfortable answers and truths, for a country reeling from a pandemic that disproportionally claims black and brown lives; record unemployment for people of color; and protests stemming from the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis - the latest death of a black man at the hands of law enforcement officers.\n\nFleming said, \"I feel the collective anguish of centuries and generations of black people who have had to survive this and have had to deal with people celebrating these myths of what our country is, right? The myth that this is a country of freedom, when we know that we have been unfree for so long.\"\n\nA native of Memphis, Tim Wise is an anti-racism activist and the author of \"White Like Me.\"  He told correspondent Maurice DuBois, \"White America in particular has a long storied history of waking up briefly to this stuff and then hitting the snooze button and going back to bed.\"\n\nHe says it's called \"white privilege.\"\n\n\"So, if people of color are being stopped and frisked and racially-profiled, those of us who are white, who may be doing the very same thing, are not under suspicion, are not stopped, are not frisked or not profiled, and are not arrested,\" he said.\n\nWise says for white Americans, the standards are different ... and at times, so is the outcome.\n\n\"I was thinking about this when Ahmaud Arbery was tracked down and killed by those men in Georgia because they thought that because he had been on a construction site, you know, that somehow he was up to no good,\" Wise said. \"I've gone on construction sites other than my own homes many times. When I was teenager, I went on them regularly to smoke weed, to drink underage. I doubt very seriously that I would've been arrested. And I certainly would not have ended up dead in the street.\"\n\n\"I'm going to tell them there's an African American man threatening my life!\"\n\nWhite privilege also played out in Central Park recently, when Amy Cooper called the police because Chris Cooper, an African American bird-watcher, had asked her to put her dog on a leash.\n\nShe called 911 : \"I'm being threatened by a man in the Ramble. Please send the cops immediately!\"\n\n\"I think it probably happens every day,\" said Alyshia Gálvez, a professor who lives near Central Park. She told DuBois white people weaponize their privilege.\n\n\"I move through institutions, I've moved through academic institutions and universities, without anyone questioning whether I deserve to be there, [or] whether I earned my spot there,\" Gálvez said. \"And I know that my students, my colleagues of color, my friends have been questioned as to whether they earned their place.\n\n\"To have to justify the place that you've earned is a tax that I don't pay.\"\n\nBut it is for people like Mark Whitaker, a media executive who was also the first black editor at Newsweek Magazine. \"I've had that experience a lot of, you know, walking into a store and, like, people looking at me: 'Are you a shoplifter or, you know, whatever?'\"\n\nDuBois - who, like Whitaker, is a father - said, \"To me, it's the most heartbreaking thing on Earth to tell these young beautiful boys that people who don't even know them hate them. 'The talk.'  It's what we have to do. This is reality. But it's the worst thing ever.\"\n\n\"My dad gave my brother and me the talk,\" said Whitaker. \"And his term was 'lippy.' He said, you know, 'Never get lippy with a police officer under any circumstances, even if you think you're in the right and they're in the wrong.'\"\n\nWhat is happening now has played out for decades. And, Whitaker said, it's often the same event that triggers it: \"Every single major episode of racial unrest, what people call riots, that we remember in recent history - with the exception of the ones that happened after Dr. King was shot - started with a police incident. Harlem in 1964; Watts in 1965; Atlanta and Cleveland in 1966.\n\n\"It is, you know, our original sin as a country, and one that I think, you know, probably we will always be wrestling with, frankly,\" he said.\n\nSo, what's next? Crystal Fleming says if change has to be made, it must come from within: \"Maybe in recognizing the humanity and the dignity of this black person, you can come to recognize a bit more about your own human dignity.\"\n\nDuBois said, \"There are people with good will in their heart who say, 'I've been privileged. I've lived this life. What can I do?'\"\n\nTim Wise replied, \"It might be the place that we work. It might be the schools that our kids attend. It might be the social circles within which we run, And in all of those spaces, we can stand up and fight for equity.\"\n\nThe question to ask yourself, said Wise, is, \"What kind of country do you wanna live in?\"\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Gabriel Falcon.

Beirich is the director of Southern Poverty Law Center 's (SPLC) Intelligence Project, which monitors hate group activity online. \"We've never seen their ideas penetrating the mainstream the way they are. I would say most Americans don't realize how much of this there is.\"\n\nIt's been a little over a week since neo-Nazis marched in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting \"Jews will not replace us.\" In the intervening days, debate has raged over just how America's national conversation has become a real-time discussion of white supremacy and its place in the U.S., muddied by President Trump's ambiguity on the matter. The groups in question -- who openly espouse racist views and have felt newly emboldened since the recent presidential campaign -- find themselves pushing into the mainstream.\n\nDokoupil traveled to Alabama for \"CBSN: On Assignment\" to speak with Beirich, before heading to Boston for last weekend's rally.\n\nThe flashpoints of this debate have been, for once, out in the open -- manifesting as public protests and counter-protests in the streets of major cities. Saturday saw a so-called \"free speech\" protest on Boston Common , organized by right-wing elements but dwarfed by its anti-supremacy counter-protest from the left. A similar, if smaller, pair of gatherings clashed in a shouting match in Laguna Beach, California.\n\nThe nation witnessed what's considered one of the largest white supremacy marches in decades as hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Charlottesville. During the rally, a car rammed into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer . All this against a backdrop of a national debate around the rights and wrongs of maintaining statues that celebrate the Confederacy.\n\nThe SPLC estimates that there are currently more than 900 hate groups -- organizations with beliefs that attack an entire group of people -- operating in the country. Many of these hate groups subscribe to the ideals of white supremacy.\n\nIn fact, Beirich says the number of hate groups has doubled over the past two decades -- a trend that appears to follow the impact minorities, financial crisis and political elections have on society.\n\nAccording to the SPLC, there's a new generation of so-called white nationalism being run by millennials. Matt Heimbach , one of the main organizers of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, is the face of this movement.\n\n\"Well, we have energy, I think, because Donald Trump's election showed that the majority of white American's social, working class America believes in sovereignty,\" Heimbach told \"CBSN: On Assignment.\"\n\nHeimbach represents a minority who feel strongly that \"white America\" is under growing threat. A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that Trump voters are more likely to believe that discrimination against whites is worse than discrimination against any other group. In the aftermath of Charlottesville, white supremacists feel re-energized. Their goal: to infiltrate the mainstream.\n\nHeimbach, along with many other self-proclaimed white supremacists, deny that the Holocaust ever happened. He says his intent is to create an all-white nation -- excluding African-Americans, Jews and homosexuals.\n\nStarting this fall, Heimbach will begin recruiting candidates to run in local elections. At this time, he claims about 1,000 people have joined his political party.\n\n\"We're going to be running through our local school board, for county council,\" he said. \"Being able to have an influence in the community to show nationalists can have better governments than the two broken political parties.\"\n\n© 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Column: Sorry, Self-congratulatory America: You're Not Post-racism\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nNovember 18, 2008 / 7:21 AM EST / UWIRE.com\n\nThis story was written by Eryk Salvaggio, The Maine Campus\n\nYou see, here's a secret about earnest and clueless white people like me: We keep a list of things that prove how un-racist we are, just in case it ever comes up. Of course, it's ridiculous to do this -- keeping a stack of evidence that absolves us of racism is like taking the name of every stranger we pass, just in case we ever need an alibi for a potential massacre.\n\nSo, I should be embracing the idea of post-racial America. But it seems to me that the depth of racism's imagined decline depends wholly on the color of your skin.\n\nLet me begin by offending 99.3 percent of Maine's population: Stop pretending a white person can understand what racism feels like. We all have a story about how we were discriminated against once because we were fat, or skinny, or felt weird when we hung out on a train with a bunch of black people and they laughed at how nervous we were, but it's not the same.\n\nRegardless of the facts of American society today, there is a dramatic history of institutionalized racism in America. White folks like to think it ended in 1972. But even then, 77 percent of whites were against \"intermarriage.\"\n\nWhatever your non-race-based discrimination story is -- unless you're gay -- that's the difference. You might get harassed by drunk kids, but you are not surrounded by monuments dedicated to people who nonchalantly believed you were too genetically inferior to vote or own land.\n\nWill white America take those monuments down? Of course we won't. Why? Because frankly, most white people think racism is boring. They're done discriminating, they mock racists and they're sick of it coming up. We can declare racism doesn't exist because overt racism doesn't -- and in case you don't believe us, we have that massive secret list of black comedians we like. That's how we tear down traces of our racist past: We buy every season of \"Chappelle's Show.\"\n\nDoes it matter if white America decides it is \"post-racial\"? I wish it were that simple, but I can only be sick of racism because I am privileged. Race never factored into any part of my life, my culture, my opportunities. No laws ever told me where I could eat. I don't see brand names that made early profits by reducing my great grandfather to the same status as a mule. For many, that residue lingers perpetually in the air, an odious reminder of oppression tucked into the banalities of daily life. For me, it's a comfortable cotton shirt or a pack of cigarettes.\n\nWe can respond that \"It's not my fault, and so-and-so should get over it,\" but that's not empathy. It doesn't make you a racist, but it isn't empathy, and to lack empathy is to ignore a piece of another's humanity. And denying humanity is, essentially, oppressive. It is a subtle and passive act. No one ever schedules a lack-of-empathy rally, and so it is hard to accept the notion that our boredom with racism is itself a form of passive racism: It's the type of argument that makes the bored-with-racism crowd angry. They point to the most radical of black thinkers and say, \"I'm supposed to tuck the 'AIDS-is-a-CIA-conspiracy' into my cultural rainbow?\" Well, no. Empathy doesn't mean abdicating the ability to reason. It's the ability to honestly negotiate a common understanding of how we each got to be who we are.\n\nEmpathy, on both sides, can bridge this diide, and it may be the last step America needs to take. Ultimately, you can't ask white kids to help fix what they don't see as \"their\" problem. We don't see ourselves as discriminating. Our grandparents? Sure. But the kids today? No way. Racism is no longer pure discrimination. The problem of racism is foreignness: The idea of \"them\" and \"us,\" the vast cultural gap that we are desperate to fill and so terrified of talking about. Ignoring it by \"post-racializing\" the world isn't going to close that gap. Empathy will.\n\nTo paraphrase Martin Luther King, Jr: We have learned to judge a man by the content of his character and not by the color of his skin. We have made real the promises of democracy. But can we say we are truly living on the solid rock of brotherhood?\n\n\"Creating change and making the world better is not always easy, and you will probably find in your life that it is more comfortable to ignore injustices that don't affect you directly,\" Barack Obama recently wrote in a letter to an 8-year-old supporter of his campaign. \"Don't take that comfortable road.\"\n\nMake no mistake: Barack Obama has torn down a racial barrier -- but has not abolished inequity in the process. He is in a unique position to bring about a dialog that can reconcile the two sides of the divide. But that isn't the president's job. It's ours.\n\nUWIRE.com\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "DiCaro: Dear White America, It's Not On Colin Kaepernick To Solve Racial Inequality\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nSeptember 23, 2016 / 11:03 AM CDT / CBS Chicago\n\nBy Julie DiCaro--\n\n(CBS) It's been nearly a month since 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality, igniting a firestorm that largely saw white Americans arguing for form over substance. In the early days of the national Twitter war we call \"debate\" these days, much of white America complained that, while they didn't disagree with the point Kaepernick was trying to make, they disagreed with the way he went about doing it.\n\nThough, it should be noted, I never saw an actual suggestion for what Kaepernick could have done as a less-intrusive form of protest. Close his eyes? Take a knee in his mind? Silently change the words to the anthem in his own head?\n\nEither way, this argument was swiftly and effectively dispatched by none other than the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., with an assist from The Nation's Dave Zirin:\n\nWhat (critics of Kaepernick) have in common is that they are 2016 textbook examples of Martin Luther King Jr.'s searing description of \"the white moderate\" in \" Letter From a Birmingham Jail ,\" when he wrote, \"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action'; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a 'more convenient season.'\"\n\nIn the month since Kaepernick's protest began, more than 15 black Americans have died during contact with the police, a white officer has been charged with first-degree manslaughter and the general public finally seems to be getting the message that Kaepernick's message matters more than how he chooses to convey it. After all, had Kaepernick simply chosen to speak out against racial inequality at his locker after games or outside the confines of football altogether, it's unlikely we'd be having this national conversation about race. And, to be sure, there are those who would criticize Kaepernick for speaking out in the locker room, too.\n\nAnd yet, the narrative surrounding Kaepernick in recent days has switched from \"how dare he disrespect the troops!\" to a more insidious and insincere demand:\n\nMaybe instead of being disrespectful the players protesting will actually step up and do something for their cause\n\nJust like Ray Lewis said \"Do something\" don't just donate money. Actually go and do something about it\n\nthose things make a difference. Kneeling has done nothing but create a larger divide\n\nPoint is Julie...he needs to draw up how to determine what change is.  As of now it's just a vague statement.\n\nThese are conversations that I've taken part in recently on Twitter, but debates to this effect are taking place online all day long. The complaint now is that Kaepernick hasn't done enough by drawing attention to a national emergency. He isn't doing a enough by donating a $1 million to local charities that work toward racial equality . It isn't enough for him to talk about race relations intelligently and thoughtfully every time he's asked. No, now it's on Colin Kaepernick to draw up a concrete plan to end conflict between the police and the black community.\n\nGranted, I wasn't alive when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, but I don't recall reading about demands for her to also draft legislation ending Jim Crow laws in the South. I hope no one called for the Freedom Riders to come up with a comprehensive, written plan to end racism in America. I hope it was enough for Americans that Susan B. Anthony campaigned tirelessly for women's right to vote. She wasn't required to actually draft and enact the 19th Amendment.\n\nThere's a faction of white America that's constantly moving the goalposts when it comes to how black America is allowed to be heard. Protesters in Ferguson, Dallas, Minneapolis and Charlotte have all been derided as \"thugs\" and admonished to express themselves peacefully. Yet a black man taking a knee during an NFL game isn't peaceful enough, either. Across the country, high school students are being admonished for refusing to stand for the pledge or taking a knee during the national anthem in solidarity with their friends of color. What other power does a high school student have to disrupt the establishment and call attention to their grievances? Would we prefer they walk out of class and assemble in protest? I have no doubt many Americans would find that distasteful, as well.\n\nWhat is it, exactly, that we value, white America? Is it order, form, ceremony and obedience to the way life has always been? Or is it a multicultural society in which we listen to each other and strive to move forward together, no matter how different our life experiences may be? The hard truth is that it's not the job of Kaepernick or black America to solve racial inequality. It's on us, White America. It's on the cultural heirs of a society that systemically oppressed black Americans for hundreds of years, the fallout from which we're still stuck with today. We have to demand that our schools, our government and our police do better. We must demand we all do better.\n\nSo if your take is that Colin Kaepernick has been disrespectful, hasn't done enough, isn't doing enough to end racism in America, maybe take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself what you've done to help.\n\nJulie DiCaro is an update anchor and columnist for 670 The Score.

      "text": "Why White People Like Barack Obama\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJanuary 30, 2007 / 11:34 AM EST / The New Republic\n\nThis column was written by Peter Beinart .\n\nAs it happens, Llewellyn wasn't talking about Red Hook. He was talking about his cousin, Colin Powell - whose prospective presidential bid enjoyed mass white support roughly a decade ago. Like the employers in Red Hook, whites discriminated in Powell's favor because he challenged their negative stereotypes of blacks. First, he had succeeded in a respected white institution: the military. Second, he was the child of immigrants, a man whose family history highlighted America's opportunities, not its racism. Third, he wasn't ideologically radical. And, fourth, he didn't look or sound stereotypically black. No one was blunter about this than Powell himself. Asked in 1995 to explain his appeal to whites, he volunteered that \"I speak reasonably well, like a white person,\" and, visually, \"I ain't that black.\"\n\nBarack Obama would never put it that way. But he surely understands the uncomfortable subtext behind the adoration being showered upon him by white America. Obama, too, succeeded at a prestigious white institution: Harvard Law School. He, too, is a child of immigration, able to declare in his 2004 Democratic convention speech - in words that could have come from Michael Dukakis or Joe Lieberman (but not from a descendant of slaves, without heavy irony) - that \"in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.\" And he, too, doesn't sound or look too black. Fifteen years ago, a State University of New York political scientist named Nayda Terkildsen doctored photos of a fictitious gubernatorial candidate to make him lighter- or darker-skinned and then showed them to Kentucky focus groups. \"The dark-skinned black candidate,\" she noted, \"was evaluated much more harshly than his lighter skinned peer.\" Powell knew what he was talking about.\n\nIn U.S. politics, as in Red Hook, there are no \"good\" blacks without \"bad\" blacks. In the mid-'90s, reporters frequently compared Powell with Jesse Jackson: a man who fit all the stereotypes he defied. Today, it probably helps Obama that Al Sharpton, with his 2004 presidential run, became the \"president of black America.\" For many white Americans, it's a twofer. Elect Obama, and you not only dethrone George W. Bush, you dethrone Sharpton, too.\n\nBut being the \"good\" black is tricky. The more whites love you, the more you must reassure your own community that you are still one of them. And the more you do that, the more you jeopardize your white support. In 2002, when the highly articulate, light-skinned, Yale-educated Cory Booker ran for mayor of Newark, New Jersey - becoming a darling of the white press - incumbent Sharpe James used that support against him, tarring him as inauthentically black. Last fall, when the well-spoken, light-skinned, St. Albans-educated Harold Ford Jr. ran for Senate in Tennessee, his family's political prominence in the Memphis black community made such accusations impossible. But it was those very connections - to a family viewed negatively by many whites - that may have cost him the race.\n\nFor Obama, walking the tightrope is a little easier. Unlike Booker, Obama's African American wife, his connection to the black church, and his work as a community organizer give him racial credibility. But, unlike Ford, he has no obvious ties to Jackson/Sharpton style \"bad\" blacks. And, compared with Powell, he benefits enormously from changes in the political climate. The first big change is the collapse of crime as a political issue. In the 1980s and early '90s, Democrats had to adopt ultra-hard line stances on crime to reassure anxious white voters. And blacks had to go even further. Had Obama run for president in 1992, he would have had do to something akin to Bill Clinton's infamous execution of mentally retarded murderer Ricky Ray Rector - which would have hurt him with blacks. Today, by contrast, he can largely oppose the death penalty with hardly anyone seeming to mind.\n\nThe second big change is welfare reform, which has significantly de-racialized the debate over taxing and spending. Because of welfare reform, the percentage of whites saying \"poor people have become too dependent on government assistance\" has dropped markedly. That's good news for all Democrats, but especially for Obama, who would be particularly vulnerable to suspicions that he was trying to redistribute money from whites to blacks.\n\nBut Obama doesn't merely benefit from the decline of racially saturated issues like welfare and crime. He also benefits from the fact that, as racial polarization has declined, religious polarization has increased. When the culture war was primarily about race, black candidates were inherently divisive (and when they tried to reach out, they risked seeming insufficiently black). Today, however, it is white liberals who seem divisive, because they are perceived as secular. Black liberals, by contrast, are considered authentically devout, and, thus, bridge-builders. In the '80s, it would have been virtually impossible for a black candidate with substantial black support to credibly promise to span America's cultural divide. Today, it is at the heart of Obama's appeal.\n\nDoes this mean that U.S. politics have transcended race? Not at all. In a presidential campaign, as in Red Hook, blacks must still defy white stereotypes to succeed. What has changed is that defying those stereotypes doesn't require moving as far to the right. That's hardly utopia, but it's progress. And, for Obama in 2008, it may be enough.

The president, she said, \"was speaking to African Americans saying, 'I get what you get.' And he was speaking to white Americans, trying to explain. It was a new role for him.\"\n\nThe president's remarks on Friday were some of the most extensive of his presidency on the subject of race, and they were very personal. He spoke about the sort of negative experiences that are common for young African-American men -- some of which he said he has personally experienced. \"There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping at a department store, and that includes me,\" he said. \"Those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.\"\n\nDavid Ignatius of the Washington Post called it \"an honest speech on many different levels,\" adding, \"I thought it showed a kind of leadership that so often with this reticent president, I felt was missing.\"\n\nAt the same time, said Michael Scherer of Time magazine, Mr. Obama is \"very aware of his own limits in pushing national conversation forward.\"\n\nGerald Seib of the Wall Street Journal said he doesn't expect the president to make a habit of turning to his personal experiences to help drive forward a national dialogue on race. \"He doesn't want to be the African-American president, he wants to the president who is African American,\" he said. \"I think he wants to pick the right spots.\"\n\nScherer the next step for the African-American community is moving from a conversation about race to achieving results for the community. \"You talk to pastors in the black churches, there is a lot of enthusiasm right now for really seizing this moment to do that,\" he said.\n\nStephanie Condon is a political reporter for CBSNews.com.\n\n© 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.

Our group, Vanguard America, promotes a revival of America which will come from its founding people. Our organization is functioning nationwide and is organized well in many states, Vanguard Texas being one of the most notable examples. This means of recruitment has proven to be successful, as many who share our beliefs hold them in secret on these campuses.\n\nCampuses are important because they represent both our main demographic of younger White Americans, and because they are so full of Marxist, anti-White propaganda disguised as education.\n\nThe posters were official material from our site, and were hung up by people associated with our organization.\n\n© 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "William Cohen on Trump's \"disheartening\" response to Charlottesville\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nAugust 18, 2017 / 6:00 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nPresident Trump's rhetoric in the days following last Saturday's violence in Charlottesville, Va. , was \"very discouraging\" and \"disheartening,\" former Clinton defense secretary and former Republican senator William Cohen told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" podcast.\n\n\"It's very discouraging to have the president fail to distinguish between those who are carrying torches\" and other protesters, Cohen said of the president's reaction to mayhem spurred by white supremacists and neo-Nazis last weekend. \"Years ago - the '20s, '40s, - they were wearing hoods and carrying the torches. They were burning black churches carrying those torches -- lynching, setting churches on fire with African-Americans trapped inside.\"\n\nIn his initial reaction to the chaos in Charlottesville, Mr. Trump did not specifically condemn the KKK, neo-Nazis or white supremacists who were largely perpetuating the violence that killed one and injured dozens of others. Two days later in a televised statement from the White House, the president adjusted his approach.\n\n\"Racism is evil,\" he said. \"And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal.\"\n\nThe next day, however, at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York City, the president said there was blame to go around on \"both sides\" in Charlottesville, and although he said it was a \"horrible moment\" in American history, stopped short of unequivocally putting the white nationalist groups on a different moral plane than other protesters.\n\n\"I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I'm saying is this - you had a group on one side and you had a group on the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch.\"\n\n\"It was disheartening to hear the president not distinguish between those who are holding up the flag of Hitler, who are calling for the displacement of Jews,\" Cohen, who served as a Republican senator from Maine from 1979-97, said. \"To see the president fail to distinguish the level of hate that is being promoted by those who are carrying those flags and are arguing for an all-white society and all-white America.\"\n\nCohen, who also served as President Clinton's defense secretary from 1997-2001, joined CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett and Political Director Steve Chaggaris during another jam-packed news week in Washington. Originally on the agenda: North Korea and the implications of President Trump's tough rhetoric.\n\nAs critical as Cohen is of Mr. Trump's reaction to Charlottesville, Cohen does find that Mr. Trump is correct in his attitude that China must do more to stop North Korea.\n\n\"I think the president is correct that the Chinese have more to do. They can in fact squeeze the North Koreans to the point where they could almost break them,\" he said. \"We could work out these disagreements if we sat down and said let's find a way to peacefully re-unite the peninsula.\"\n\nCohen does, however, have a problem with Mr. Trump's \"fire and fury\" rhetoric toward North Korea.\n\n\"You cannot out-trash talk Kim Jong Un. You just reduce yourself to his level,\" he said. \"If the North Koreans think he's bluffing, they'll continue to up the ante. If the Chinese think he's bluffing, they will continue not to put enough pressure on. So if you say something, mean it. And if you say something like that, you'd better be prepared to carry it out. \"\n\nFor more from Major and Steve's conversation with William Cohen, download this week's podcast on iTunes , Stitcher , Google Play , or Spotify .

      "text": "Biden played key role in pushing US to take hardline stances on crime in 1990s, and now he's apologizing as 2020 looms\n\nAs former Vice President Joe Biden mulls a potential 2020 presidential run, he's apologizing for his past stances on criminal-justice issues.\n\nIn a speech on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Washington, the former vice president acknowledged the detrimental impact of his approach to crime in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n\"You know I've been in this fight for a long time. It goes not just to voting rights. It goes to the criminal justice system,\" Biden said at the National Action Network's Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast. \"I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried.\"\n\nBiden helped write an infamous 1994 crime bill - the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. That bill is widely pointed to as one of the driving factors of mass incarceration in the US , as well as the disproportionate number of people of color who've ended up behind bars for drug-related crimes.\n\nSome experts contend the impact of the bill, which was signed into the law by former President Bill Clinton, i s overblown. But Biden's involvement on criminal justice issues goes well beyond the bill, which already represents an easy point of attack if he runs for president.\n\nHere's the national 1989 speech Sen. Joe Biden gave where he attacked President Bush 41 for being soft on crime and drugs, & demanded more prosecutions & prison for drug dealers & *users*: led not only to the 1994 Crime Bill but major escalation of the Drug War & Penal State: pic.twitter.com/sg36rV30Zz\n\nWithout specifically naming the 1994 bill on Monday, Biden said the decisions that were made in that era \"trapped an entire generation.\"\n\n\"It was a big mistake when it was made,\" Biden said.\n\nIn an apparent reference to sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine, he added, \"We were told by the experts that 'crack, you never go back,' that the two were somehow fundamentally different. It's not. But it's trapped an entire generation.\"\n\nThe vice president went on to say that \"white America\" needs to do more to address and recognize systemic racism.\n\n\"There's something we have to admit - not you - we, white America, has to admit, there's still a systematic racism and it goes almost unnoticed by so many of us,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden was less conciliatory about the 1994 crime bill in his 2017 memoir, \"Promise Me, Dad,\" in which the former vice president contended the legislation helped put 100,000 police officers out on the streets and drove down escalating rates of violent crime across the country.\n\nSimilarly, in a 2016 interview with CNBC, Biden said he was \"not at all\" ashamed of his role in supporting the bill and said it \"restored American cities.\"\n\n\"In fact, I drafted the bill,\" Biden said at the time. \"And by the way, we talk about this mostly in terms of Black Lives Matter. Black lives really do matter, but the problem is institutionalized racism in America.\"\n\n\"There are things I would change,\" he added on the 1994 bill. \"But, by and large, what it really did: It restored American cities.\"\n\nDespite his efforts and involvement in criminal justice reform with the Obama administration, Biden's past statements on this bill and his overall record on criminal justice could haunt him if he ends up running in 2020.\n\nAs a senator, Biden spearheaded the Democratic Party's war on crime and drugs. He drafted or co-sponsored legislation that created the federal \"drug czar,\" mandatory minimum sentencing for marijuana, and the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Time , Biden said, \"I am not only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar, but I'm also the guy who spent years when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of [the Senate Foreign Relations Committee] trying to change drug policy relative to cocaine, for example, crack and powder.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's husband's record on crime as president was damaging to her 2016 campaign for president, despite efforts to apologize. Biden, if he runs, is poised to face just as much criticism if not more so on this issue.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump won't condemn white supremacists or Vladimir Putin - and the 2 are closely linked\n\nPresident Donald Trump has faced heavy criticism for denouncing violence \"on all sides\" rather than explicitly condemning white supremacism in the wake of last weekend's deadly rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,\" Trump said at a press conference on Saturday. \"On many sides.\"\n\nThe comments were celebrated by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, who rejoiced in the president's refusal to call them out by name.\n\n\"He refused to even mention anything to do with us,\" wrote Andrew Anglin, founder of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist website Daily Stormer. \"When reporters were screaming at him about White Nationalism he just walked out of the room.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to unambiguously condemn the white supremacists who organized and marched at Friday's \"Unite The Right\" rally, which continued into Saturday, reminded many of his reluctance to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Your 5000th reminder,\" tweeted Republican strategist and fierce Trump critic Rick Wilson. \"Donald Trump will go to Twitter war with anyone who displeases him. Except Putin, Nazis, and white-supremacists.\"\n\nTrump's bromance with Putin reached new heights last week when he thanked the Russian leader for ordering cuts to the US embassy's staff in Moscow. But his flirtations with Putin, as with the white nationalists who form a core part of his base, predate his rise to the presidency.\n\nWhether Trump feels an ideological connection to Putinisim or white nationalism - which are closely linked - is not totally clear. Just as Putin has used nationalism and a return to \"traditional values\" to consolidate power, Trump may have fanned the flames of xenophobia before and during his campaign to rile a predominantly white base that was already susceptible to racist rhetoric and a hatred of globalization.\n\nIn the US, the rise of the alt-right as a crusade against establishment politics coincided with Trump's political ascendance and was aided heavily by far-right news outlets like Breitbart, which was called \"a platform for the alt-right\" by Trump's chief strategist (and former Breitbart CEO) Steve Bannon.\n\nBoth Trump and his nationalistic base, however, appear to have found a natural ally in Russia's current zeitgeist, which perceives the US as a globalist, imperalist power working on behalf of liberal elites.\n\n\"Objectively, Trump's behavior mirrors Putin's behavior,\" Robert Amsterdam, an American lawyer who was once detained by Putin and formerly represented Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, said in an interview earlier this year. \"The substantive areas of agreement between Putin and Trump, and between Bannon and Putin's aides, are really significant.\"\n\nWhite supremacy - manifested frequently as anti-Semitism - is inextricably linked to the worldview of many alt-right admirers of Putin's Russia.\n\nDavid Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who told reporters on Saturday that white-nationalist protesters were working to \"fulfill the promises of Donald Trump,\" has traveled to Russia several times to promote his book \"The Ultimate Supremacism: My Awakening on the Jewish Question.\"\n\nThe book has been sold openly in the main lobby of the State Duma (Congress) for the equivalent of about $2.\n\nWhite supremacist Matthew Heimbach, who said he identifies as a member of the alt-right, told Business Insider in an interview late last year that \"Putin is supporting nationalists around the world and building an anti-globalist alliance, while promoting traditional values and self-determination.\"\n\n\"I really believe that Russia is the leader of the free world right now,\" added Heimbach,who was slated to speak at the \"Unite The Right\" rally.\n\nHeimbach, whose Traditionalist Workers Party was deemed an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center , pushed back against claims that he is anti-Semitic. But he said he believes \"the organized Jewish community\" is heavily involved in \"supporting movements that want to destroy nationalism.\"\n\nHe also described the US' current foreign policy as aggressive and imperialistic, and criticized NATO's military buildup in eastern Europe as an example of how the US is trying to promote a \"global conflict\" with Russia.\n\nTrump, too, has warned that a hawkish Congress has forced the US' relationship with Russia to an \"all-time and very dangerous low.\" He also criticized NATO, calling it \"obsolete,\" and was slammed by Jewish organizations across the country for failing to mention Jews in a statement commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nFor Heimbach, Putin's brand of orthodoxy, which opposes same-sex marriage, abortion, and globalism, \"is the last institution standing for traditional values.\" And he's happy to see Putin working hard to export those values, even if that may be perceived as meddlesome and globalist in its own right.\n\nTrump has hardly been a crusader for traditional social values. But he has never condemned Putin's many human rights abuses, at one point going as far as to tell former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that the United States \"kill[s] people, too.\"\n\nAlt-right leader Richard Spencer, the head of the white nationalist think tank the National Policy Institute, has similarly argued that the US should dispense with its globalist policies by pulling out of NATO and resetting its relationship with Russia. Spencer helped organize last weekend's white nationalist protests.\n\nKevin MacDonald, who gave a speech at Spencer's NPI in late November about how \"Jews remade America in their interests ... to make white America comfortable with massive non-white immigration and its own dispossession,\" has written that the \"demonization of Russia in Western media and political circles\" is a Jewish campaign to undermine Putin.\n\nPreston Wiginton, a white supremacist from Texas who sublets Duke's Moscow apartment when he travels to Russia, has written that his \"best friends\" in Russia - \"the only nation that understands RAHOWA [Racial Holy War]\" - are \"leading skinheads.\"\n\nSpencer's ties to Russia, which he has called the \"sole white power in the world,\" go deeper. He was married until October to Russian writer and self-proclaimed \"Kremlin troll leader\" Nina Kouprianova, whose writing under the pen name Nina Byzantina regularly aligns with Kremlin talking points.\n\nThe webzine Spencer founded in 2010 called Alternative Right accepted contributor pieces from Aleksandr Dugin, the far-right, ultra-nationalist politician who encouraged Putin's incursion into Ukraine and whose work has been translated into English by Byzantina on her blog . (It does have a caveat: \"The views of the original author do not necessarily reflect those of the translator.\")\n\nDugin also recorded a speech titled \"To My American Friends in Our Common Struggle\" for a nationalist conference organized by Heimbach last year in California, and has been a guest on InfoWars - a far-right radio show hosted by conspiracy theoriest Alex Jones, who said on Sunday that \"a lot of KKK protesters are \"Jewish actors\" who look like the \"cast of Seinfeld\" with their hoods on.\n\n\"Your reputation's amazing,\" Trump told Jones when he was a guest on InfoWars in December 2015. \"I will not let you down.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "As police violence comes under more scrutiny, Black parents say they're still giving their kids 'The Talk' about dealing with cops\n\nRonnie Dunn was four years old when he was first called a racial slur.\n\nHe had climbed up a tree with his neighbors, who were white, when their aunt yelled out of a window for them to get back inside the house and to \"never let her catch them playing with\" Black children again, referring to them as \"n-----s.\"\n\n\"I, being a child, had no idea what had been said, and neither did my playmates - we all just froze,\" Dunn said. \"But from the tone of her voice, we knew something was wrong.\"\n\nDunn returned to his house where he \"fumbled\" while trying to explain the incident to his mother. He remembered her demeanor changing before she lifted him into her arms, carried him to the living room, and sat him on her lap. She used a children's Bible book with a \"European image of Jesus on the cover, sitting on a boulder surrounded by multiracial children\" to introduce her youngest son to racism, Dunn said.\n\nThat was in 1965. Dunn is now an associate professor of urban studies at Cleveland State University, who vividly recalls feeling \"burdened\" by the \"disturbing\" realization that he was \"being judged unfairly.\"\n\n\"It damages your self-esteem to grasp at such a young age that you are somehow viewed as less than other people because of something that's beyond your control,\" Dunn said.\n\n\"Racism has a profound impact on the psyche of both Black and white children because it instills a sense of racial inferiority in Black children\" while teaching white children that they're society's \"preferable aesthetic,\" he added.\n\nThis grim ritual has been a part of Black families for generations. Dubbed \"The Talk,\" it involves parents educating their children about how and why the color of their skin will impact their lives and preparing them for inevitable encounters with police.\n\nAnd, according to Denisse Weil Ross, who has a 9-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter, the sobering conversations can traumatize parents as well.\n\nGeorge Floyd died on May 25, handcuffed and pinned facedown by three Minneapolis police officers . A bystander captured his final moments in a video that prompted conversations about racism and police brutality.\n\nThree days later, Ross' son walked into his parents' room while CNN was airing footage of Floyd's death. Ross wasn't able to change the channel in time so she looked on in horror as her child \"watched the part with the officer's knee on his neck and George Floyd screaming out,\" she said.\n\nAt first, he didn't fully comprehend what had happened, Ross said, but that changed after a few hours of processing the violence he had witnessed.\n\n\"The whole day he was just asking questions: 'Why did it happen? Did that man do something wrong? Did he steal something? Why did the policeman do that? Isn't the policeman supposed to help? Is the policeman in trouble?'\" Ross said.\n\nSo her husband talked to their child about racism and issues with policing in the United States.\n\nBoth parents wept that evening.\n\nMuffy Mendoza told Insider that deep-seated racial injustice in the US has forced Black parents to develop this way of speaking to their children.\n\nOver hundreds of years, white supremacists have used slavery, lynchings, police violence, and systemic inequities to maintain control over and terrorize Black Americans. \"The Talk\" has existed in different versions across each era and will continue to be necessary unless there's a substantive and sustained change in society as we know it, according to Mendoza, the executive director of a Pittsburgh-based support group for parents of color called Brown Mamas .\n\nMendoza, whose three children are 11, 12, and 18 years old respectively, described the conversation as a \"blatant\" look at the Black experience in this nation. She began her conversation with her eldest son by letting him know that \"this is not his fault - this is the American system.\"\n\nWhite supremacists will unjustly label Black people \"whether they're wearing a hoodie, whether they're walking on this side of the road or running on that side of the street, whether they're a drug addict, or whether they're a dad trying to go out and get something for their kids,\" Mendoza said.\n\nHaving \"The Talk\" means \"you name it all and you don't beat around the bush,\" according to Ross.\n\nRoss explained to her son that \"unfair and unjust things are still happening,\" so there's still work to be done to continue in the footsteps of Black changemakers like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks. Although people might mistreat him, she asked her child to be careful and conduct himself in a way that keeps him safe.\n\n\"We want them to come home. Everything comes out of that. We do it so that they won't be killed, so that they can survive - that's the baseline,\" Ross said.\n\nRight now, her son is young and always accompanied by an adult. When he becomes older and that changes, Ross is considering taking him to the local police station near their home in the San Francisco Bay Area and introducing him to the officers.\n\n\"That humanizes my son to the police,\" she said, adding that she would like to tell the officers, \"I just want to make sure you know that this is my son. This is his name. He's going to be in the neighborhood playing. He is a good boy.\"\n\nRoss is also certain that her children will get pulled over by police once they're older and driving by themselves. So she plans to teach them practical strategies, like keeping their hands where the officer can see them, not making any sudden movements, answering all questions, and seeking permission even to get their car registration and insurance information out of the glove compartment.\n\nThey will also be told \"not to be sassy or argumentative, but to act with a tremendous amount of caution,\" she said.\n\nNia Rhodes Jackson grew up in Queens, New York, as the daughter of a Black studies professor.\n\nIt was common knowledge that Black people would have to \"work harder, longer, stronger to get the same recognition as a white person,\" but that was \"juxtaposed with the knowledge that they were capable\" of greatness, just like the people that came before them and whose shoulders they stood on, she said.\n\nBut, neither she nor her husband, who grew up in Brooklyn, were given water or Nerf guns to play with. They understood early on that only white children could play with such toys. They also knew which neighborhoods they were welcome in and which to avoid.\n\nThey \"came of age\" in the 1980s, which were marred by several high-profile racial crimes in New York: The deaths of Michael Griffith , Willie Turks , and Yusef Hawkins as well as the wrongful convictions of five teenagers for gang-raping and almost killing Trisha Meili in Central Park.\n\nThat meant walking a straight and narrow path to succeed in life.\n\nToday, Rhodes Jackson lives in Connecticut with her husband and four children - two girls, ages 14 and 10, and two boys, ages 7 and 3 - and finds herself guiding her oldest child the same way.\n\n\"I've told her, 'I don't want you walking into a store with people if they're being noisy. I don't want you to be accused of something,'\" she said. \"And so I don't think that that coaching by Black parents has changed in all these years.\"\n\nRhodes Jackson hasn't yet had that conversation with her sons, but it weighs on her mind.\n\n\"There's times when I look at my son and I think to myself, 'Well, right now everybody thinks you're cute and innocent. At what point will they think you're a threat?'\" she said.\n\nBlack men are stereotyped as criminals and Black women are viewed as aggressive and angry, but Black families are still the ones having \"The Talk,\" even though white supremacists are responsible for these discriminatory views, according to Mendoza.\n\n\"It should not be on the parents of the oppressed and the children of the oppressed to have 'The Talk' to try to de-escalate the emotions and physical reactions of white supremacists who we might just meet in everyday interactions,\" she said. \"Why is this even something that we are having to engage in?\"\n\nSheena Anderson-Francis, who also lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, has home-schooled her 8-year-old son for the last year. She worries constantly when he's not around her, even if he's with friends or at classes.\n\n\"There is a certain sense of anxiety and stress that resides within our bodies all the time,\" she said about Black mothers. \"It's a kind of consciousness about whether somebody is going to be disrespectful to our children because they are Black.\"\n\nShe likened the worry that plagues Black parents to generational post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"It makes me sad as a Black mother that I have to have these kinds of conversations with my son because, in a way, it strips away his innocence,\" she said. \"I want him to believe in the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny and have that magical kind of childhood that other children can have. But, in a way, I rob him of that by having these very real conversations with him, which I feel like I can't not have.\"\n\nHer own childhood in Atlanta was \"dynamic\" and \"enriched\" by Black history, she said.\n\nSo when she moved to California, Anderson-Francis said she was \"offended by people\" who didn't want to acknowledge race or teach their children about it.\n\nThat's something only a white person can say, she added, because \"people are going to see my son and they're going to know he's Black and certain implicit biases are going to come up.\"\n\n\"So why are we not talking about race and why shouldn't we accept cultural differences?\" Anderson-Francis asked.\n\nRhodes Jackson agreed, adding that it upsets her when people claim to be \"colorblind.\"\n\n\"You should love me and my blackness versus erasing my blackness to love me,\" she said. \"Don't say you didn't see color - say you saw it and you loved it.\"\n\nAccording to Rhodes Jackson, there's a limit to how much Black people can \"give voice\" because, in the end, white people need to be the ones that want to change.\n\n\"Women marched and fought for the vote, but, ultimately, they didn't have the vote. Men had to vote to give women the vote,\" she said.\n\nThe same logic applies to race relations as well.\n\n\"Black people can rally, can protest, can dialog, can write, can create art, but it has to be the person that is acting from the stance of supremacy that says, 'I understand I have to change the dynamic,'\" Rhodes Jackson said. \"While that change is going on, I still have to have certain conversations with my kids because I have to do everything in my power to try to arm them to exist in the world that they're in. My job is to keep my kids alive.\"\n\nDunn said also that Blacks cannot solve racism.\n\n\"That takes whites,\" he said. \"Whites will have to solve that. We can work along with them.\"\n\n\"The Talk\" is a result of Blacks being forced to \"adjust to racism for survival,\" he said, whether it was during the Jim Crow era of \"Don't do this or that when in the presence of whites\" to today's discussions about police violence.\n\nAcknowledging this \"unfair burden,\" Dunn said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the present moment in history.\n\nFloyd was not the first Black man whose death was caught on video. However, more people are being exposed to the underbelly of society today because of cell phones, social media, and the pandemic, which made it so \"everything was at a standstill and there weren't any national distractions,\" Dunn said.\n\nThere was no part in the \"horrific video\" of Floyd's death that suggested that the police officers were afraid for their lives, \"and yet, we have this casual snuffing out of a Black man's life over eight minutes and 46 seconds,\" he added.\n\n\"So now white America is being confronted with this reality that they can't rationalize or justify,\" Dunn said. \"And now they are the ones who have to have a talk with their young child who was home and witnessing this.\n\n\"Now they have to have 'The Talk' and explain how that can happen in our society.\"\n\nJump to"

But Samantha Bee thinks there hasn't been enough focus on what they got right.\n\n\"Five weeks ago, the Democrats lost the presidential election, the Senate election, the House election, the Supreme Court, and the will to live,\" Bee said on Monday's episode of TBS's \"Full Frontal.\" \"Democrats are now officially in the wilderness. In some cases, literally . They're acting like any desperate party lost in the wilderness would, by attacking and eating each other.\"\n\nRecently, a New York Times article suggested that the Democrats' focus on \"identity politics\" was a reason why much of white America voted against Democratic candidates.\n\nBut Bee doesn't buy the idea at all. She believes \"identity politics\" is the \"dismissive term\" for civil rights.\n\n\"Okay, one, white male is an identity. And, two, the only way white racism is a phantom is that its most iconic uniform is literally a ghost costume,\" the host said as a photo of a KKK rally appeared on the screen.\n\nAccording to Bee, Democrats have been blinded by their recent losses so much that they can't see what is right about the party. And, of course, the Republican pundits aren't helping matters.\n\n\"Stop it! Come on, Democrats,\" Bee said. \"There's losers' Stockholm syndrome and then there's taking your talking points from [Fox News host] Steve Doocy and pals.\"\n\nDemocrats are starting to believe everything that's being said of them, Bee argued. Pundits claimed the Democrats didn't talk about the economy and jobs enough during the election.\n\n\"I think Hillary [Clinton] did mention jobs, which Americans might have known if the news media had been doing theirs,\" Bee said, as numerous clips of Clinton talking about jobs during campaign rallies played.\n\nIn fact, Bee referred to a Washington Post report saying that voters in every swing state preferred Clinton to Trump on economic matters.\n\n\"Look, Democrats, I know you're having a rough time,\" Bee said in the segment's close. \"But if your panic over a loss makes you abandon both your principles and the people who actually vote for you, then you'll be in the wilderness for a decade, or until Trump's camp sells the wilderness to oil companies.

      "text": "A former NFL player has been freely tweeting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories amid a wave of celebrities spreading similar hate\n\nFormer NFL player Larry Johnson has joined the growing group of celebrities with huge followings sharing anti-Semitic falsehoods and beliefs.\n\nOn Sunday, Johnson, who has more than 147,000 Twitter followers, tweeted an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that there is a \"Jewish cabal\" involved in human trafficking, murder, pedophilia, human sacrifice, and child torture. Specfiically, Johnson said that this imagined \"Jewish cabal\" performed better in those areas than African-Americans, calling that a racial disparity he was \"proud\" of.\n\nJohnson was a running back for the Kansas City Chiefs from 2003 to 2009, the Cincinnati Bengals in 2009, the Washington Redskins in 2010, and the Miami Dolphins for a portion of the 2011 season.\n\nIn 2017, Johnson told The Washington Post that he has struggled with erratic behavior, and that he believed it was due to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) , the brain disease that has afflicted many former and current football players. The disease is untreatable and affects people with repeated brain trauma .\n\nThe former football player has been sharing beliefs associated with the Black Hebrew Israelites movement for at least a year, often writing that Jews have stolen their religion. In December 2019, he wrote that people discrediting the movement were just \"whining about Jewish converts not being the chosen people of God almighty.\"\n\nBlack Hebrew Israelites believe that they are the chosen people and the original Israelites. The movement follows the belief that the Old Testament, or the Torah, is about them, rather than Jews, and that the transatlantic slave trade decimated their religion. In a tweet on Sunday, Johnson called the Bible \"an archived history about Hebrew Israelites.\"\n\nBlack Hebrew Israelites believe that they are reclaiming their culture and religion that was left behind. Extremist factions of the movement, which is not affiliated with Judaism, consider Jews to be \"fraudulent,\" and often hold anti-white and anti-LGBTQ beliefs.\n\nThe movement is not inherently discriminatory against Jews. But there are \"smaller detachments of a larger, non-racist faith,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) , which tracks extremism in the US.\n\nThe SPLC has labeled certain factions of the movement as hate groups . \"They mostly trade in anti-Semitism; they view Jews as impostors,\" Heidi Beirich, the director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, told The New York Times in 2019, but added that the movement does not tend to inspire violent acts like other groups the organization categorizes as hate groups. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Jewish non-governmental agency that fights hate, has also labeled certain sects of the movement as hate groups.\n\nJohnson's tweets also echo the beliefs of the Nation of Islam, which is also designated as a hate group by the SPLC . He's defended the organization's leader, Louis Farrakhan, who \"blames Jews for the slave trade, plantation slavery, Jim Crow, sharecropping and general black oppression,\" according to the SPLC . In 1990, while giving a speech in Chicago, Farrakhan said \"a small handful\" of Jews \"control the movement of this great nation, like a radar controls the movement of a great ship in the waters.\" Those proclamations have continued in recent years: \"I'm not an anti-Semite. I'm anti-Termite,\" he said in a 2018 tweet. (Twitter later removed the tweet, as it violated the platform's policy against \"language that dehumanizes others on the basis of religion,\" The Forward reported at the time.)\n\nOn Monday, Johnson posted photos of orthodox Jews wearing prayer garments along with verses from the New Testament in an apparent effort to discredit Jewish traditions.\n\nIn response to criticism, Johnson has doubled down.\n\nWhen one person tweeted that a \"high-profile former athlete tells his 146k followers via a verified account that 'the Jewish cabal' performs well at 'ritualistic child torture'\" and suggested that Twitter needed to improve its policies, Johnson replied with laughing emojis.\n\n\"I'd tell it to your face if you prefer,\" he wrote.\n\nSeveral followers replied to that tweet showing support for Johnson and thanking him for \"fighting the fight.\"\n\nJohnson's anti-Semitic tweets have also included Holocaust denial, tweeting on July 7 that \"Red Cross records say otherwise\" in response to the Auschwitz Memorial's tweet about the death of a young boy in a Nazi concentration camp. The tweet appeared to reference an easily debunked conspiracy theory that has gone viral on social media , alleging that the Red Cross had documents to show that fewer than 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust.\n\nSix million Jewish people died in the Holocaust. Hundreds of thousands of others, including Roma, non-Jewish Poles, Soviet civilians, and people with disabilities, were also killed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi party, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum .\n\nJohnson has also spread misinformation about pedophilia and sex trafficking that is not directly related to Jews. \"TikTok rivals the security risk of an Pedophile Trafficking Cult,\" he said in a tweet on Tuesday.\n\nJohnson's podcast, \"Sight To The Blind,\" which often spreads misinformation and anti-Semitic rhetoric, was recently suspended by its distributor Audioboom. In response to his suspension, Johnson said \"the whiny cry babies heard I was talking about their religion they jacked from the Israelites,\" and added that his shows are \"backed up.\"\n\nAudioboom's director of operations and communications Jenny Khodai told Insider that Johnson was an independent podcaster using their platform. \"His content contravened our terms of use and we moved quickly to suspend him from the platform,\" Khodai said.\n\nA representative for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Jewish non-governmental agency that fights against hate, told Insider that Johnson's content is a \"clear violation\" of Twitter's guidelines. \"It's disturbing to see that this content has not been removed and we implore Twitter to review this decision through the lens of its own hateful conduct policies. Social media platforms need to be more responsive to the concerns of civil society and must prioritize these concerns over metrics of engagement,\" the representative said.\n\nNeither Johnson nor Twitter immediately responded to Insider's request for comment.\n\nJohnson has inserted himself into the controversies of other celebrities bashing Jews.\n\nOn July 7, after DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles posted a quote on his Instagram story that said Jews would \"extort\" and \"blackmail\" America, Johnson defended Jackson - even after Jackson apologized for his post. \"Jews want to paint that 'Anti-Semitic' speech brush really wide to instill fear in you WHITE AMERICA,\" Johnson said. In his tweet, he also referenced Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam.\n\nSteven Jackson , a former NBA player and ESPN analyst, also defended Jackson's Instagram story. \"He was trying to educate himself, educate people, and he's speaking the truth. Right? He's speaking the truth. You know he don't hate nobody, but he's speaking the truth of the facts that he knows and trying to educate others,\" he said in an Instagram video, according to ESPN .\n\nBoth Nick Cannon and Ice Cube have shared similar anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. On his podcast, \"Cannon's Class,\" which was also posted to YouTube, Cannon said that Black people were the \"true Hebrews,\" and therefore couldn't be anti-Semitic themselves. (Johnson has made similar statements on Twitter .) After ViacomCBS announced that the company would end its longrunning association with Cannon, the host and comedian apologized for his comments. \"This is only the beginning of my education,\" he said in a July 15 tweet .\n\nRapper and actor Ice Cube tweeted on June 6 an image of white men who were caricatured as stereotypes of Jews playing with money on a board game held up by Black people. \"F--K THE NEW NORMAL UNTIL THEY FIX THE OLD NORMAL,\" Ice Cube said.\n\nA 2018 report from the ADL found that anti-Semitic sentiment has thrived on Twitter.\n\nThere was an average of 81,400 tweets that expressed anti-Semitic beliefs between January 2017 and January 2018, the ADL found. The organization also reported a 12 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the US in 2019 compared with the previous year.\n\nAs anti-Semitism appears to be on the rise in the US, there's evidence that general conspiracy theory rhetoric is increasing as well.\n\nConspiracy theories have been thriving on social-media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. An April report published in the Harvard Kennedy School's Misinformation Review found that conspiracy beliefs related to COVID-19 are \"widespread.\"\n\nIn particular, the QAnon conspiracy theory, which alleges that there is a deep-state cabal of elites trying to destroy President Trump, has spread to mainstream spaces. Jackson, Cannon, Ice Cube, and Johnson did not specifically reference QAnon, but their conspiracy theories echoed the common conspiracy theory theme of a secret cabal controlling the world.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "America's first Black billionaire got rich from founding BET. He shares the moment he knew he'd made it.\n\nIt took less than five minutes in a conversation with Robert L. Johnson, the first Black billionaire in the US , to realize the reason my bank account hasn't reached six figures yet: I'm simply not focused on how to make a return on the money I earn each day.\n\nAfter speaking with Johnson, I now know, without a doubt, that multimillionaires and billionaires just think differently than we thousandaires do.\n\nJohnson is the founder of Black Entertainment Television, the first Black-owned company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Launched in 1980, BET went public in 1991 and was sold to Viacom 10 years later in a $3 billion deal.\n\nThe acquisition made Johnson and his former wife, Sheila Johnson, who cofounded BET , billionaires. He said it also made many former employees who had purchased BET stock financially successful.\n\nBut BET isn't his only success story. Because of his hotel-investment company, RLJ Lodging Trust, he's one of only a few Black founders with public companies. His portfolio includes men's fashion, content streaming, auto dealerships, 401(k) management services, and more.\n\nJohnson has made many sound business decisions and will tell you, as many wealthy people will, that success is not about money - it's about impact. In an interview with Business Insider, he described the journey that turned him into a billionaire and gave me his best bits of business wisdom.\n\nThe following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWho are your professional heroes?\n\nAs far as the kind of people who believe in you and motivate you, without question, it has to be John Malone .\n\nHe's a dynamic, highly successful, multibillionaire businessman who was involved in the early founding and development of cable television distribution and programming.\n\nHe believed in me enough to put $500,000 into the first business I started, BET, and became a friend/father figure and advisor to me. He decided to stay on the board of the company for 20 years and allowed me to use his credibility when I went to other people seeking support and involvement in BET .\n\nHe had such a reputation that when I would mention he was my partner, it would bring me high attention. They'd say, if he's willing to be in business with you - we respect him, and therefore we respect you or what you're trying to do with him.\n\nOf course, I also think of my parents, who kept me on a certain pathway when I began to doubt myself. Then my friends - Michael Jordan and I have been friends forever, and we share the same kind of character traits. We like people, we want to help people, and we're competitive in our own way of doing things.\n\nThere are also people like Tom Baltimore , who was my partner when I started the hotel company and still a great friend of mine to this day. We could create opportunities for other African Americans to be in fields of endeavor that they may not have had the opportunity to be in.\n\nWhat is the best advice you've ever received, and how did it impact your business or career?\n\nThe best advice I've ever received actually came from John Malone . When he wrote me that first check, I'd never run a business before. His advice was simple: \"Get your revenues up, and keep your costs down.\"\n\nThat was my business-school instruction: Manage your business to reduce your costs, control your costs, and increase your income and your revenue. That was it.\n\nWhat is the worst advice you've ever received?\n\nI've never had bad advice. There may be some advice I got that I didn't understand, but there's no such thing as \" worst advice \" if you're going to be a businessperson.\n\nIt's about what you do with the advice that people give you. If the person believes in you and you believe in yourself, you should be able to take that advice and use it to move ahead.\n\nHave you ever received bad suggestions or encountered people who didn't have your company's best interest at heart? How did you discern those things?\n\nIn most cases, people who believe in themselves don't get into those kinds of discussions.\n\nSomeone trying to misdirect you or who doesn't believe in your vision - I call those naysayers, people who don't believe that you can do what you say you want to do. But that's rare, and you can spot those people a mile away. Don't spend a lot of time with them.\n\nBut sometimes people are just giving their honest advice. Early on, some people wanted me to call BET \"Urban Television\" because \"urban\" was, I'd argue, considered a softer way of saying Black. They thought it might make white America more embracing if \"Black\" wasn't thrown in their face and might make cable operators more comfortable.\n\nOthers thought BET should've been called Black Educational Television. Those are judgment calls. You have to be focused enough on your own vision of what's in the business' best interest.\n\nBased on my research, there are very few Black-owned companies on the NYSE. Does that surprise you?\n\nNo, it doesn't. I'd probably call it disappointing that there aren't more Black businesses taking advantage of being listed on the exchange . It's simply a way to raise capital to grow your business.\n\nWhen we became the first Black public company, the people who invested were just workers. They had a chance to come with me. When the company was sold for billions, they were able to turn their small investment into millions of dollars.\n\nCan you recall the moment you knew you'd \"made it\"?\n\nWhen John Malone showed his confidence in me and wrote me a check to start the business. When somebody says they're willing to take a risk with you, at that point, you've got to say, \"I made it.\"\n\nAt the same time, \"making it\" is not measured in dollars. Most wealthy people I know don't walk around waving in the air, \"Oh, look how rich I am,\" because they know that's not why you go on this journey.\n\nWhat has been the best and worst part of your professional journey before launching your first publicly traded company?\n\nPursuing what you believe in is a journey, and you never get to the end of it. BET speaks for itself. I think some people feel that Black companies should always be Black-owned, therefore, by definition, they can't be publicly owned. And so by being public, maybe BET set an example, even though there's nothing wrong with being a privately held Black-owned company .\n\nBut if somebody were to ask me, \"What's the biggest achievement you made in terms of business?\" it may not be BET. But because of BET, I've now created a company called Portability Services Network. Its sole purpose is to help Black American workers, particularly low-wage workers, keep their money in the 401(k) management system.\n\nFinally, what's your best tip on how to attract investors?\n\nIf you're going to be successful, first and foremost, you must believe in yourself .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The Rockies' Ian Desmond announced he is sitting out the MLB season with a powerful message about inclusion in the US and baseball\n\nColorado Rockies outfielder Ian Desmond announced on Instagram that he'll be sitting out the 2020 MLB season with a powerful essay.\n\nDesmond, a two-time All-Star, said he is sitting out to be with his family during the COVID-19 pandemic, but shared a message about inclusion in baseball and the U.S.\n\nIn the essay, Desmond recalled how baseball has shaped his life, both good and bad. Desmond, who is biracial, recalled one of his Little League teams shouting \"White Power\" before games, with two of his Black teammates sitting in silence.\n\n\"I had the most heartbreak and the most fulfillment right there on those fields - in the same exact place,\" Desmond wrote. \"I felt the hurt of racism, the loneliness of abandonment, and so many other emotions. But I also felt the triumph of success. The love of others. The support of a group of men pulling for each other and picking one another up as a team.\n\n\"I got to experience that because it was a place where baseball could be played by any kid who wanted. It was there, it was affordable, and it was staffed by people who cared.\"\n\nDesmond wrote about a 12-year-old boy named Antwaun he met through the Washington Nationals youth academy. Desmond wrote that Antwaun could barely read or write, his family was poor, and he had witnessed violence as a young kid. Desmond wrote that Antwaun was shot to death when he was 18 years old.\n\n\"Meanwhile, my kids fly all over the country watching their dad play. They attend private schools, and get extra curriculum from learning centers. They have safe places to learn, grow, develop. But ... the only thing dividing us from Antwaun is money.\"\n\nDesmond said youth education should be the No. 1 focus in America.\n\nDesmond then criticized the culture of baseball, saying MLB still has problems with inclusion at all levels and that baseball's culture is based on \"white rules.\"\n\nHe referred to an old quote about making baseball better for future generations and skewered the current state of the game.\n\n\"If what Dick Lee knew to be true remains so - that baseball is about passing on what we've learned to those who come after us in hopes of bettering the future for others - then it seems to me that America's pastime is failing to do what it could, just like the country it entertains.\n\n\"Think about it: right now in baseball we've got a labor war. We've got rampant individualism on the field. In the clubhouse we've got racist, sexist, homophobic jokes or just flat-out problems. We've got cheating. We've got a minority issue from the top down. One African-American GM. Two African-American managers. Less than 8% Black players. No Black majority team owners.\n\n\"Perhaps most disheartening of all is a puzzling lack of focus on understanding how to change those numbers. A lack of focus on making baseball accessible and possible for all kids, not just those who are privileged enough to afford it.\"\n\n\"The golden rules of baseball - don't have fun, don't pimp home runs, don't play with character,\" Desmond continued. \"Those are white rules. Don't do anything fancy. Take it down a notch. Keep it all in a box ... If we didn't foce Black Americans into White America's box, think of how much we could thrive.\"\n\nDesmond's post received widespread praise online.\n\nDesmond said while he is not playing, he will focus on getting youth baseball \"back on track\" in his hometown of Sarasota, Florida.\n\nDesmond's entire post can be found below:\n\nOn my mind.\n\nA post shared by  Ian Desmond (@i_dez20) on Jun 29, 2020 at 6:53pm PDT Jun 29, 2020 at 6:53pm PDT\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Sheriff's Deputy Jay Baker's press conference on the Atlanta spa shootings was a master class in victim blaming\n\nOn Tuesday evening a shooter killed eight people - six of whom were Asian women - during a violent killing spree at three Atlanta-area spas.\n\nBut you'd be hard-pressed to understand that based on the press conference given by Capt. Jay Baker of the Cherokee Sheriff's Office on Wednesday morning. During the event, Capt. Baker spoke extensively about what suspect Robert Aaron Long - who was charged with eight counts of murder - told him was his apparent motivation for the killings.\n\nLong, Baker said, admitted to the crimes but said that they were \"not racially motivated\" - despite the fact that all three businesses targeted were Asian-owned and six out of eight victims were Asian women.\n\nThe attack comes amid a significant increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans.\n\nLong has not yet been charged with a hate crime, but Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN she believed hate crime charges would be \"appropriate, but I will defer to the prosecutors to make that determination.\"\n\nCapt. Baker said Long denied he'd committed a hate crime.\n\n\"He did take responsibility for the shootings. He said that early on once we began the interviews with him. He claims that these, and as the chief said, this is still early, but he does claim that it was not racially motivated.\"\n\nThe distinction matters because a hate crime designation imposes additional minimum sentencing. In Georgia, it adds an additional six to 12 months to a sentence.\n\nInstead, Baker said, \"He apparently has an issue, what he considers sex addiction and sees these locations as something that allows him to go to these places, and it's a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate. Like I said, it's still early on, but those were comments that he made.\"\n\nLet's stop right there to break down what Long is saying, and what Baker's parroting of Long's statements assumes.\n\nBy publicly repeating Long's statement about sex addiction, Baker subtly intimates that the victims were sex workers, something that has not been publicly confirmed. (And something that, if confirmed, should in no way be used to blame these women for their own deaths.)\n\nHe repeats without questioning the suspect's motives, gives credibility to the notion that the suspect felt victimized by the \"temptation\" and lost control.\n\nBaker took advantage of the natural privilege police officers are given in situations like this; they're treated as if they're neutral parties in these stories, without prejudices or biases when it comes to the victims or the perpetrators.\n\nBut that shouldn't be a given, especially not in the case of Baker, who was revealed on Wednesday to have promoted T-shirts blaming the COVID-19 pandemic on China.\n\nBaker went on at length to offer a humanizing interpretation of the suspect's behavior.\n\n\"It sounds to me like these locations, he sees them as an outlet for him,\" Baker said. \"That it's something that he shouldn't be doing and an issue with porn, and that he was attempting to take out that temptation.\"\n\nHe also minimized the gravity of the shootings by saying that Long was simply \"fed up\" and having a \"very bad day.\"\n\n\"When I spoke to the investigators, they interviewed him this morning and they got that impression, that, yes, he understood the gravity of it. And he was pretty much fed up and kind of at the end of his rope. And yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did,\" Baker said.\n\nBaker's tack reflects a common thread in coverage of white male perpetrators - that mental illness caused them to commit the crime, removing a layer of culpability from them.\n\n\"When perpetrators of violence are people of color, journalists, politicians and many citizens treat their violence as natural, expected,\" Jonathan Metzi at the Washington Post wrote in 2017. \"But when shooters are white men who kill white victims, politicians like Trump, and indeed many other facets of white America, reach for the notion of an unstable, angry, isolated person driven to mass murder.\"\n\nThat's as true now, as it was then.\n\nBut, Dr. Natasha Bhuyan wrote for the American Association of Family Physicians ,\"blaming mental illness only serves to further stigmatize patients who have mental health issues as inherently dangerous.\" The same could be said of blaming video games , or in this case, sex addiction.\n\nYou need only look at the cases of Elliot Rodger , Dylann Roof, or Adam Lanza to see a history of decoupling responsibility from white mass shooters, despite the fact that the majority of mass shooters are white men.\n\nAs Ishena Robinson at The Root wrote, \"It's deeply disturbing whenever we are reminded how far into the realms of inhumane, unbelievable behavior that defenders of whiteness will go to diminish, explain away and understate that very heinous behavior.\"\n\nRobert Aaron Long was having a \"really bad day,\" according to Capt. Jay Baker. Long's \"really bad day\" cost eight people their lives.\n\nJump to"

Gillian Laub/National Geographic hide caption\n\nFelyssa Ricco stands outside the house in Hazleton, Pa., where she lives with her mother and stepfather, Kelly and Jesse Portanova. In addition to flying Old Glory and other flags, such as \"Don't Tread on Me,\" the Portanovas sometimes fly the Confederate flag, saying it's a way of standing up to those who believe it shouldn't be displayed or who want to disregard America's history.\n\nIn its Race Issue , National Geographic magazine examines the state of race relations in the United States, including an acknowledgment of the racism that permeated its own pages for decades . Among the magazine's contributors this month: Michele Norris, former host of NPR's All Things Considered .\n\nNorris currently runs The Race Card Project , in which she asks people to send in their thoughts on race in just six words. When she began the project in 2010, Norris assumed she'd hear mostly from people of color. She was wrong.\n\n\"I think what happened, is people felt that they had an entry into a conversation that wasn't always welcome to them,\" Norris tells NPR's Sarah McCammon. \"White Americans - in very large numbers - bought into the project and decided to share their stories.\"\n\nIn her National Geographic story, Norris digs into some of the feelings that white Americans have expressed. Her story focuses on the town of Hazleton, Pa. In the year 2000, the population of Hazleton was more than 95 percent white; today it's more than half Latino.\n\nOn change being uncomfortable, no matter where it's coming from\n\nWhen people talked about it, it was often the notion of suddenly being outnumbered - that's a word that I heard over and over and over again. Going to the doctor's office and suddenly looking around and realizing that everybody else is Hispanic. Going to the local Walmart ... and realizing that, \"Boy, the things they're selling in the produce aisle are different,\" or \"There's a whole aisle where everything is in two languages, and I never noticed that before.\" ... \"Suddenly it feels like this community that I knew so well\" - so what they were saying is that they don't feel like it's \"theirs\" anymore. ...\n\nAnd that coupled with economic changes, with jobs disappearing. And that coupled with - you know, the cultural things in a town that has had a very strong immigrant population for decades. There were people from Italy, and people from Ireland, and people from Germany and Montenegro and Slovakia and Slovenia, and they all had their traditions. And suddenly they have to make space for newcomers who come in.\n\nAnd that has happened throughout decades in America, but when the newcomers are brown, and when the newcomers speak a different language, and when the newcomers are less interested in assimilating in the same way and suddenly speaking English - they want to hold on to their old culture or they want to hold on to their old language ... suddenly the word \"immigrant\" when it's spoken now doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nOn race as subtext\n\nThey wouldn't necessarily say \"those brown people,\" or \"those Latino people.\" There would often be sort of proxy for that - \"the food is different, the music is different, the town feels different.\" There was a large \"threat\" narrative - safety is a big issue here. People felt like, with the changing community, the crime rate had increased, or that they just didn't feel as safe as they used to.\n\nIn some cases it was for a good reason - someone had literally driven a car into their restaurant, or someone had had a wallet taken. In a lot of cases, though, the fear was based on something in the abstract, not something that had actually happened to them - but the fear that if they did go downtown that bad things would happen, or if they did go to the mall that it no longer was as safe as it used to be.\n\nOn the generational shift\n\nThere was a difference in the way that people who were more advanced in years talked about it, than the kids. Because the kids are in probably the most diverse environment - they all go to the same schools, they play on the same sports teams, they cheer together on the cheerleading squad, to some degree they socialize with each other. ... They had a sort of more direct approach to talk about some of these things than people who still lived in communities where they lived and worshipped among people who looked like them or had a similar background. ...\n\nI remain optimistic, and yet I'm pragmatic. And so I know that when we say that race is perhaps an easier concept for young people ... it's easier, but it's not easy. It's not yet easy. And a mistake that's often made is thinking that because they ... inherited this incredible degree of integration that was completely foreign to just one or two generations ahead of them, that all the problems have been solved. That's not true. ...\n\nI think future is still something that we should be optimistic about, but it might take two, three, four generations before some of this gets easier. And it's not just because of demographics and race, it's also because of the economic tumult that we're facing, and it's also because of technological tumult - I mean, people's jobs are being replaced in large part by technology, and that creates a certain degree of vertigo. So it's not one thing. There are a lot of onions in that stew.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

He's with us.\n\nA tense weekend after civil rights leader and Rep. John Lewis called the president-elect an illegitimate president. To some it's symbolic of a greater racial tension in the U.S. Sociologist, activist and minister Michael Eric Dyson has a fiery call to action for white America. To stop violence against black Americans. To acknowledge Black pain. This hour On Point: race relations in America with Michael Eric Dyson.\n\nMichael Eric Dyson , sociology professor at Georgetown University. Author of the new book, \" Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon To White America .\" Contributing opinion writer for the New York Times and contributing editor at the New Republic and ESPN's the Undefeated. ( @MichaelEDyson )\n\nNew York Times : A Cry From the Heart: Michael Eric Dyson Addresses Race Head-On - \"his is a book that will anger some readers, especially those who reject Dyson's central premise: that if we want true racial equality in America, whites themselves must destroy the enduring myths of white supremacy. Even sympathetic readers might mistake this extraordinary work for merely a catalog of white sins.\"\n\nWashington Post : A sermon on the unbearable whiteness of America - \"Dyson recounts what he calls the stages of white grief, pulled out whenever white Americans fear their dominance is threatened. They plead ignorance of black life and suffering; appropriate black culture; or simply deny, rewrite or dilute America's racial history. So please don't show up with tales about the economic insecurity of the white working class; for Dyson, the 2016 election was entirely about the revenge of whiteness, 'how it is at once capable of exulting in privilege while proclaiming it is the least privileged of identities . . . and how it howls in primal pain at being forgotten while it rushes to spitefully forget and erase all suffering that isn't its own'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVox : If you want the truth about racism, listen to the Sessions hearing, not just Obama's farewell -- \"It's jarring to think that Obama's farewell will likely be followed by the appointment to attorney general of a man who was behind the times with respect to race decades before a black president even seemed like a remote possibility.\"\n\nThis program aired on January 17, 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"

There's a long history in mainstream politics of stoking anxiety about America becoming less white.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST: After the mass shooting that took place here on Saturday, authorities are saying that the alleged shooter posted a hate-filled anti-immigrant screed online. He is a 21-year-old white man from the suburbs of Dallas. And police believe he authored the document that was posted on the web just before the rampage. The screed, or manifesto, talks about, quote, \"the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\" Gene Demby from NPR's Code Switch podcast is with us this morning. Hi there, Gene. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So what do you think this attack here in Texas tells us about our country right now? DEMBY: Well, as some of our colleagues at NPR have reported, the language in that manifesto is remarkably similar to the language the president himself has used. He's talked about immigrants, especially from the southern border, as invaders many times. And just to zoom out a little bit, there was a big public opinion poll from the Public Religion Research Institute last year, and it posed to respondents a question about the country's changing demographics. Now, about 60% of Republicans thought that the U.S. becoming a majority nonwhite country by 2045 would be mostly negative. So if that's a position held by most of the voters in one of the two major parties, it's clear that this feeling about the browning of America is not some fringe political position. And to be clear, I'm not suggesting that the people who feel this way want to commit violence to that end. But this anxiety over America becoming less white, that's a common powerful strain in our mainstream politics right now. GREENE: But it seems like, we should note, that President Trump came out and did not just condemn violence. He condemned white supremacy yesterday when he was speaking about the violence that we've seen. So what should we make of that? DEMBY: So it's actually surprising that it's notable that he's done that - right? - because it's not controversial. It's almost perfunctory for public officials to condemn explicitly racist violence after it happens. And that's been key. So the consensus that white supremacy is a destructive force in American life - that's a relatively recent phenomenon. It's a fragile consensus. And it's one of the most significant achievements of the civil rights movement, which is why it's so important when leaders affirm it and which was one reason why his response to Charlottesville, that there were good people on both sides, was so striking. And so now the president has shifted back to the sort of pro forma condemnation that comes after incidents like this. But there's the border wall - right? - and now the detention facilities on the border, all of which structurally reinforce this fear of brown invaders again with legitimate policy and law. GREENE: Well - and Democrats have gone so far as to say that the president's words actually have incited violence in this country. Is that a fair argument? DEMBY: I mean, you know, causality is really tricky here. And just, you know, for the record, the alleged shooter said that his views predate President Trump's election. But, you know, there's all this research that shows a significant surge in reported hate crimes across the country since President Trump's election. But, again, it's important for us to remember that this is not new, that white nationalist violence is part of the history of American politics. Like, during Jim Crow, there were 4,000 lynchings in the United States. And the lynchings themselves were an extralegal expression of this official policy position, which was that black people should be inferior and that black people should stay in their place. And one of the reasons that anti-lynching legislation was a nonstarter in Washington - were reluctant to pick a political fight with Southern lawmakers and with Southern voters. As a practical matter, white nationalism was politically disadvantageous to confront because it was too popular. And so this dynamic of officially sanctioned white nationalism existing next to grizzly extralegal white nationalist violence, that's always been with us.

GREENE: But it seems like, we should note, that President Trump came out and did not just condemn violence. He condemned white supremacy yesterday when he was speaking about the violence that we've seen. So what should we make of that? DEMBY: So it's actually surprising that it's notable that he's done that - right? - because it's not controversial. It's almost perfunctory for public officials to condemn explicitly racist violence after it happens. And that's been key. So the consensus that white supremacy is a destructive force in American life - that's a relatively recent phenomenon. It's a fragile consensus. And it's one of the most significant achievements of the civil rights movement, which is why it's so important when leaders affirm it and which was one reason why his response to Charlottesville, that there were good people on both sides, was so striking. And so now the president has shifted back to the sort of pro forma condemnation that comes after incidents like this. But there's the border wall - right? - and now the detention facilities on the border, all of which structurally reinforce this fear of brown invaders again with legitimate policy and law. GREENE: Well - and Democrats have gone so far as to say that the president's words actually have incited violence in this country. Is that a fair argument? DEMBY: I mean, you know, causality is really tricky here. And just, you know, for the record, the alleged shooter said that his views predate President Trump's election. But, you know, there's all this research that shows a significant surge in reported hate crimes across the country since President Trump's election. But, again, it's important for us to remember that this is not new, that white nationalist violence is part of the history of American politics. Like, during Jim Crow, there were 4,000 lynchings in the United States. And the lynchings themselves were an extralegal expression of this official policy position, which was that black people should be inferior and that black people should stay in their place. And one of the reasons that anti-lynching legislation was a nonstarter in Washington - were reluctant to pick a political fight with Southern lawmakers and with Southern voters. As a practical matter, white nationalism was politically disadvantageous to confront because it was too popular. And so this dynamic of officially sanctioned white nationalism existing next to grizzly extralegal white nationalist violence, that's always been with us.

Now, about 60% of Republicans thought that the U.S. becoming a majority nonwhite country by 2045 would be mostly negative.

      "text": "Is White, Working Class America 'Coming Apart'?\n\nBy\n\nNPR Staff\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nAccording to the libertarian social scientist Charles Murray, America is \"coming apart at the seams.\" Class strain has cleaved society into two groups, he argues in his new book Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010: an upper class, defined by educational attainment, and a new lower class, characterized by the lack of it. Murray also posits that the new \"lower class\" is less industrious, less likely to marry and raise children in a two-parent household, and more politically and socially disengaged\n\nBy focusing solely on whites, Murray says, he is trying to correct the assumption that these are markers of the American racial divide. The class divisions transcend race.\n\nBy Murray's calculations, the upper class is 20 percent of the white population. The working class is 30 percent. Over the past 50 years the two groups have branched away from each other culturally and geographically. The \"educated class,\" Murray tells NPR's Robert Siegel, has developed distinctive tastes and  preferences in a way that is new in America, evinced in everything from the alcohol they drink and the cars they buy to how they raise their children and take care of themselves physically.\n\nAdded to that, spatial segregation has resulted in \"ZIP codes that have  levels of affluence and education that are so much higher than the rest  of the population that they constitute a different kind of world,\" he says.\n\nThe economic and social balkanization is potentially very pernicious.\n\n\"The  people who run the country have enormous influence over the    culture,  politics, and the economics of the country. And increasingly,    they  haven't a clue about how most of America lives. They have never     experienced it. They don't watch the same movies, they don't watch  the    same television shows - they don't watch television at all, in  many    cases - and when that happens, you get some policies that are pretty far out of whack.\"\n\nMurray's findings proved counterintuitive, at least to the political narrative that characterizes the affluent classes as liberal and secular. It turns out that they are actually the group most likely to get and stay married. They go to church and synagogue more often and feel more strongly affiliated with their religion than the white working class. They are the keepers of \"traditional\" American values.\n\nCharles Murray is the author of Real Education and The Bell Curve, co-authored with the late Richard Herrnstein, among other books. He lives in Maryland. Peter Holden hide caption\n\nNor are they overwhelmingly liberal. The upper middle class in Murray's findings only \"tilt\" leftward, no more than that.\n\nThere used to be many more points of connection between the upper and lower classes, Murray maintains. Consider the lodges, so important in the late 19th and early 20th century. \"The Elks and the Moose took people in from all social classes, and people were proud of that,\" he says.\n\n\"And also you have the 1800s, and Alexis de Tocqueville saying that the funny thing about America is that the opulent classes take great care in talking to the members of the lower classes every day and keep in close touch with them.\"\n\nEven in 1923, a time of great social and religious division, there was still more class intermingling, for the simple reason that most successful people had working- or middle-class roots.\n\n\"When you get to Eisenhower's Cabinet in 1952, it was called nine millionaires and a plumber in the popular press,\" he says. \"But those nine millionaires were the sons of farmers and merchants.\"\n\nMurray calls for more interaction between the classes; specifically, he'd like upper-middle-class Americans to \"drop their nonjudgmentalism and start preaching what they're practicing.\"\n\nThey \"are getting married and staying married. They work like crazy. They do better going to church. [They should] just say that, 'These are not choices we've made for ourselves. ... These are rich, rewarding ways of living.' \"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "'A Chosen Exile': Black People Passing In White America\n\nBy\n\nKaren Grigsby Bates\n\nDr. Albert Johnston passed in order to practice medicine. After living as leading citizens in Keene, N.H., the Johnstons revealed their true racial identity, and became national news. Historical Society of Cheshire County hide caption\n\nDr. Albert Johnston passed in order to practice medicine. After living as leading citizens in Keene, N.H., the Johnstons revealed their true racial identity, and became national news.\n\nSeveral years ago, Stanford historian Allyson Hobbs was talking with a favorite aunt, who was also the family storyteller. Hobbs learned that she had a distant cousin whom she'd never met nor heard of.\n\nWhich is exactly the way the cousin wanted it.\n\nHobbs' cousin had been living as white, far away in California, since she'd graduated from high school. This was at the insistence of her mother.\n\n\"She was black, but she looked white,\" Hobbs said. \"And her mother decided it was in her best interest to move far away from Chicago, to Los Angeles, and to assume the life of a white woman.\"\n\n\"Her mother really felt that this was the very best thing she could do for her daughter,\" Hobbs continued. \"She felt this was a way to offer opportunities to her daughter that she wouldn't have living as a black woman on the South Side of Chicago.\"\n\nA scene from Imitation of Life , a 1934 film starring Fredi Washington playing a black woman who passes as white. Wikimedia Commons hide caption\n\nIn California, the young woman passed as white. She married a white man, and they had children who never knew they had black blood. Then, one day, years later, her phone rang.\n\nIt was the woman's mother with distressing news: Her father was dying, and she needed to return home immediately to tell him goodbye.\n\nThe cousin replied, \"I can't. I'm a white woman now.\"\n\nShe missed her father's funeral, and never saw her mother or siblings again.\n\nHobbs was haunted by the story, and constantly went back to it in her mind. It made her realize that all the tales she'd heard about passing over the years involved the gains that people expected for leaving their black identity behind. But through her research, she came to understand there was another, critical part of the experience:\n\n\"To write a history of passing is to write a history of loss.\"\n\n'Who Are Your People?'\n\nLoss of self. Loss of family. Loss of community. Loss of the ability to answer honestly the question black people have been asking each other since before Emancipation: \"Who are your people?\"\n\n\"The family jokes, the oral history every family has, and repeats and passes down,\" Hobbs muses, \"those things are lost to people who pass.\" She figured if she had a passing story in her family, there must be many other families who did, too.\n\nHobbs began writing about passing for her doctoral dissertation, and was encouraged to turn it into a book. The dissertation became A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in America . It's a history of passing told through the lens of personal stories.\n\nOnce Hobbs began researching, the stories came thick and fast. There was New Yorker Theophilus McKee, who'd chosen to live as a white man for all of his adult life. That's until he stepped forward to claim a huge inheritance as the only colored descendant of Negro Civil War veteran Col. John McKee. His claim and the court fight with his biracial siblings made national news.\n\nThere's the story of Harry S. Murphy, who was assigned as a ROTC cadet to the University of Mississippi by a commander who assumed Murphy was white. \"For a year, Harry had a ball at Ole Miss,\" Hobbs laughs. \"He ran track, dated white girls and was known as a terrific dancer.\" Years later, the university fought to keep James Meredith from registering as its first black student, Harry Murphy gleefully broke the news: \"Ole Miss was fighting a battle they had no idea they'd lost years ago.\"\n\nThen there's the sad tale of Elsie Roxborough, a beauty from a distinguished Detroit family who became the first black girl to live in a dorm at the University of Michigan. She tried acting in California, then moved to New York to live as a white woman. When her disapproving father refused to support her, Roxborough - then known as Mona Manet - committed suicide. Her grieving and equally pale sister passed as a white woman to claim the body, so Roxborough's secret wouldn't be given away. Her death certificate declared she was white.\n\nA Bend Back Toward Community?\n\nHobbs says one of the things she learned as she delved deeper into her research was that passing was not a solitary act. It required other people who were willing to keep your secret, and a community that was willing to let you go and look the other way, even when it hurt.\n\nIn 1952, Jet magazine published an article predicting that passing was on the wane, at least for solvent black folks. \"Most economically-sound Negroes who could 'pass' prefer being high-class Negroes to low-class whites,\" it opined.\n\nJet had jumped the gun a bit: Passing did not become passé for many more years. It's mostly viewed as a practice that belongs to a more sharply segmented racial past. The rise of a more diverse America, and a growing multicultural movement that insists on people's right to recognize all of their ethnicity, has helped racial passing pass into history.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "< 'A Chosen Exile': Black People Passing In White America\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, HOST: The act of passing is a little understood part of our nation's troubled history with race. From the days of slavery to the civil rights movement and beyond, some lighter skinned African-Americans escaped the often brutal realities of racism by creating new lives as white people. Now, Stanford historian Allison Hobbs explores their stories in a new book titled \"A Chosen Exile: A History Of Racial Passing In American Life.\" Karen Grigsby Bates, of NPR's code switch team, has this report. KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, BYLINE: Perhaps the most enduring image of passing came from the 1934 movie \"Imitation Of Life.\" In it, a young light-skinned girl, Peola Johnson, yearns to escape the stigma of race, even if it means abandoning her family. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"IMITATION OF LIFE\") FREDI WASHINGTON: (As Peola Johnson) I'm not black. I'm not black. I won't be black. GRIGSBY BATES: When Peola grows up, she runs away from the Negro college she was attending to live life in a new city, as a white woman. She has a job that would've been closed to her if she'd acknowledged her colored blood. Her heartbroken mother dies soon after. Historian Allison Hobbs says too much of the story of passing is focused on what was gained - new jobs, new freedoms - rather than what was left behind. ALLISON HOBBS: I started to realize that writing this history of passing is really writing a history of loss. GRIGSBY BATES: So Hobbs devoted 10 years of research to this part of the story. We're in Hobbs' office at Stanford University, where the walls are hung with pictures of black Americans throughout history. She's flipping through a huge notebook stuffed with stories of fair-skinned black people who passed as white. But the true inspiration for Hobbs' book came from her own family's history. Several years ago, a favorite aunt told her about a distance, very fair cousin, whose mother forced her to leave her hometown in the 1930s and move to Los Angeles to live as a white woman. HOBBS: Her mother really felt that this was the very best thing that she could do for her daughter. She felt that this was a way of offering her daughter opportunities and a new life that she wouldn't be able to have if she lived as a black woman on the south side of Chicago. GRIGSBY BATES: So the cousin moved to California, passed, married a white man and raised children who knew nothing of their black heritage. About a decade later, her phone rang. The woman's father was dying and her mother wanted her to return home to see him one last time. HOBBS: Our cousin says I can't come home. I can't go back. I'm a white woman now. And there's just no turning back. GRIGSBY BATES: The cousin missed her father's funeral and never saw her mother, or her siblings, again. Hobbs was haunted by this story of gaining whiteness while losing family. HOBBS: And it made me think about all of the families that likely have a story like this. GRIGSBY BATES: Her research found many - people like Elsie Roxborough from a distinguished black Detroit family, who left to live as white in New York - something noted in the local black press - and Harry S. Murphy who had attended the University of Mississippi in 1945 for an entire year as a cadet in a military program because a commanding officer assumed Murphy was white. HOBBS: In 1962, when James Meredith was integrating Ole Miss, Harry S. Murphy said that Ole Miss was fighting a battle that they had no idea that they had lost years ago. GRIGSBY BATES: There were people who passed for work and returned to their black lives in their private hours, their employers none the wiser. And others who left everyone and everything they knew forever. But some African-Americans who passed reversed themselves later, like the Johnstons, a prosperous family in New Hampshire that, after 10 years of living as white, grew tired of the lie and publicly declared themselves Negro in 1949. Hobbs says the Johnstons became a national story. HOBBS: This is after World War II. And this is a moment when there's a sense that perhaps integration is on the horizon. So a lot of the newspapers that covered this story were looking at the Johnstons as being kind of emblems of the integrationist era. GRIGSBY BATES: True integration wouldn't occur for decades. The civil rights movement removed de jure segregation that was often the catalyst for many people's decision to pass. Later, black pride would make the practice de classe. And the continuing evolution of multiculturalism in America would seem to make passing irrelevant. HOBBS: I'm sure it still exists because, certainly, there are still benefits that accrued to being white. But I think that it's important to kind of locate the practice of passing within the particular political and economic and social conditions of the time period. GRIGSBY BATES: Hobbs' hopes her book helps people understand that most black people who passed during this painful period didn't want to be white. They just wanted to be free.

HOBBS: In 1962, when James Meredith was integrating Ole Miss, Harry S. Murphy said that Ole Miss was fighting a battle that they had no idea that they had lost years ago. GRIGSBY BATES: There were people who passed for work and returned to their black lives in their private hours, their employers none the wiser. And others who left everyone and everything they knew forever. But some African-Americans who passed reversed themselves later, like the Johnstons, a prosperous family in New Hampshire that, after 10 years of living as white, grew tired of the lie and publicly declared themselves Negro in 1949. Hobbs says the Johnstons became a national story. HOBBS: This is after World War II. And this is a moment when there's a sense that perhaps integration is on the horizon. So a lot of the newspapers that covered this story were looking at the Johnstons as being kind of emblems of the integrationist era. GRIGSBY BATES: True integration wouldn't occur for decades. The civil rights movement removed de jure segregation that was often the catalyst for many people's decision to pass. Later, black pride would make the practice de classe. And the continuing evolution of multiculturalism in America would seem to make passing irrelevant. HOBBS: I'm sure it still exists because, certainly, there are still benefits that accrued to being white. But I think that it's important to kind of locate the practice of passing within the particular political and economic and social conditions of the time period. GRIGSBY BATES: Hobbs' hopes her book helps people understand that most black people who passed during this painful period didn't want to be white. They just wanted to be free.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"IMITATION OF LIFE\") FREDI WASHINGTON: (As Peola Johnson) I'm not black. I'm not black. I won't be black. GRIGSBY BATES: When Peola grows up, she runs away from the Negro college she was attending to live life in a new city, as a white woman. She has a job that would've been closed to her if she'd acknowledged her colored blood. Her heartbroken mother dies soon after. Historian Allison Hobbs says too much of the story of passing is focused on what was gained - new jobs, new freedoms - rather than what was left behind. ALLISON HOBBS: I started to realize that writing this history of passing is really writing a history of loss. GRIGSBY BATES: So Hobbs devoted 10 years of research to this part of the story. We're in Hobbs' office at Stanford University, where the walls are hung with pictures of black Americans throughout history. She's flipping through a huge notebook stuffed with stories of fair-skinned black people who passed as white. But the true inspiration for Hobbs' book came from her own family's history. Several years ago, a favorite aunt told her about a distance, very fair cousin, whose mother forced her to leave her hometown in the 1930s and move to Los Angeles to live as a white woman. HOBBS: Her mother really felt that this was the very best thing that she could do for her daughter. She felt that this was a way of offering her daughter opportunities and a new life that she wouldn't be able to have if she lived as a black woman on the south side of Chicago. GRIGSBY BATES: So the cousin moved to California, passed, married a white man and raised children who knew nothing of their black heritage. About a decade later, her phone rang. The woman's father was dying and her mother wanted her to return home to see him one last time. HOBBS: Our cousin says I can't come home. I can't go back. I'm a white woman now. And there's just no turning back. GRIGSBY BATES: The cousin missed her father's funeral and never saw her mother, or her siblings, again. Hobbs was haunted by this story of gaining whiteness while losing family. HOBBS: And it made me think about all of the families that likely have a story like this. GRIGSBY BATES: Her research found many - people like Elsie Roxborough from a distinguished black Detroit family, who left to live as white in New York - something noted in the local black press - and Harry S. Murphy who had attended the University of Mississippi in 1945 for an entire year as a cadet in a military program because a commanding officer assumed Murphy was white.

GRIGSBY BATES: So Hobbs devoted 10 years of research to this part of the story. We're in Hobbs' office at Stanford University, where the walls are hung with pictures of black Americans throughout history. She's flipping through a huge notebook stuffed with stories of fair-skinned black people who passed as white. But the true inspiration for Hobbs' book came from her own family's history. Several years ago, a favorite aunt told her about a distance, very fair cousin, whose mother forced her to leave her hometown in the 1930s and move to Los Angeles to live as a white woman. HOBBS: Her mother really felt that this was the very best thing that she could do for her daughter. She felt that this was a way of offering her daughter opportunities and a new life that she wouldn't be able to have if she lived as a black woman on the south side of Chicago. GRIGSBY BATES: So the cousin moved to California, passed, married a white man and raised children who knew nothing of their black heritage. About a decade later, her phone rang. The woman's father was dying and her mother wanted her to return home to see him one last time. HOBBS: Our cousin says I can't come home. I can't go back. I'm a white woman now. And there's just no turning back. GRIGSBY BATES: The cousin missed her father's funeral and never saw her mother, or her siblings, again. Hobbs was haunted by this story of gaining whiteness while losing family. HOBBS: And it made me think about all of the families that likely have a story like this. GRIGSBY BATES: Her research found many - people like Elsie Roxborough from a distinguished black Detroit family, who left to live as white in New York - something noted in the local black press - and Harry S. Murphy who had attended the University of Mississippi in 1945 for an entire year as a cadet in a military program because a commanding officer assumed Murphy was white. HOBBS: In 1962, when James Meredith was integrating Ole Miss, Harry S. Murphy said that Ole Miss was fighting a battle that they had no idea that they had lost years ago. GRIGSBY BATES: There were people who passed for work and returned to their black lives in their private hours, their employers none the wiser. And others who left everyone and everything they knew forever. But some African-Americans who passed reversed themselves later, like the Johnstons, a prosperous family in New Hampshire that, after 10 years of living as white, grew tired of the lie and publicly declared themselves Negro in 1949. Hobbs says the Johnstons became a national story. HOBBS: This is after World War II. And this is a moment when there's a sense that perhaps integration is on the horizon. So a lot of the newspapers that covered this story were looking at the Johnstons as being kind of emblems of the integrationist era. GRIGSBY BATES: True integration wouldn't occur for decades. The civil rights movement removed de jure segregation that was often the catalyst for many people's decision to pass. Later, black pride would make the practice de classe. And the continuing evolution of multiculturalism in America would seem to make passing irrelevant. HOBBS: I'm sure it still exists because, certainly, there are still benefits that accrued to being white. But I think that it's important to kind of locate the practice of passing within the particular political and economic and social conditions of the time period.

      "text": "< Michele Norris On The Anxiety Of White America And Her Optimism For The Future\n\nSARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: In the same issue of National Geographic, there's a piece by Michele Norris. She's the former host of this show who now runs The Race Card Project, in which she asked people to send in their thoughts on race in just six words. When she began the project in 2010, Norris assumed she'd hear mostly from people of color. She was wrong. MICHELE NORRIS: I think what happened is people felt that they had an entry into a conversation that wasn't always welcome to them. And it was a place where they could say things that you don't generally say out loud. And so people of all races pulled up to the table. But white Americans, in very large numbers, bought into the project and decided to share their stories. And here are some examples - (reading) white not allowed to be proud. Gay but at least I'm white. Hated for being a white cop. Abuse was invisible because I'm white. Other races resent us white people. Most white people are not racists. White people do not own racism. I unpack my white privilege daily. MCCAMMON: Norris digs into some of these feelings in her story \"The Rising Anxiety Of White America.\" It focuses on the town of Hazleton, Penn. Since the year 2000, it's gone from being more than 95 percent white to more than half Latino. That change makes some of the white residents uncomfortable. NORRIS: When people talked about it, it was often the notion of suddenly being outnumbered. That's a word that I heard over and over and over again - going to the doctor's office and suddenly looking around and realizing everybody else is Hispanic, going to the local Walmart and realizing, boy, the things that they're selling in the produce aisle are different. Or there's a whole aisle where everything is written in two different languages, and I never noticed that before. Or the people who are checking me out when I go to buy lumber or groceries, they're different. And suddenly people are speaking Spanish. And suddenly it feels like this community that I knew so well - is what they were saying - is that they don't feel like it's theirs anymore. And that coupled with economic changes, with jobs disappearing - and that coupled with the cultural things in a town where you had a very strong immigrant population for decades, you know. There were people from Italy and people from Ireland and people from Germany. And they all had their traditions. And suddenly they have to make space for newcomers who come in. But when the newcomers are brown and when the newcomers are less interested in assimilating in the same way and suddenly speaking English - they want to hold onto their old culture, and they want to hold onto their old language - suddenly the word immigrant doesn't have the same ring to it. MCCAMMON: Michele Norris, as you've had these conversations with white people about the discomfort they feel about the change they see around them, how much did they seem to, in their own minds, connect that discomfort to issues of race? NORRIS: It was interesting because they wouldn't necessarily say those brown people. There would often be sort of proxy for that. You know, the food is different. The music is different. The town feels different. There was a large threat narrative. I mean, people felt like, with the changing community, the crime rate had increased - or that they just didn't feel as safe as they used to. In some cases, it was for a good reason. Someone had literally drove a car into their restaurant. Or someone had had a wallet taken. In a lot of cases though, the fear was based on something in the abstract - not something that had actually happened to them. And there was a difference in the way that people who were more advanced in years talked about it than the kids. MCCAMMON: I do want to ask about the next generation because you do talk about that a bit. And I feel like, in general, a lot of these discussions about race seem to sometimes almost end with platitudes that the next generation will be more enlightened, more colorblind or at least more comfortable with difference. Do you share that hope? Or is that in some way a naive hope? NORRIS: Well, I am optimistic by nature. And yet I'm pragmatic. And so I know that when we say that race is perhaps an easier concept for young people, it's easier, but it's not easy. In fact, there's a body of social research that suggests that young people, despite inheriting this world that is so much more diverse, still sometimes cling to values that their parents had or that their parents' parents had. And yet I think the future is still something that we should be optimistic about. But it might take two, three, four generations before some of this gets easier. And it's not just because of demographics and race. It's also because of the economic tumult that we're facing. And it's also because of technological tumult. I mean, people's jobs are being replaced in large part by technology. And that creates a certain degree of vertigo. So it's not one thing. There are a lot of onions in that stew.

She's the former host of this show who now runs The Race Card Project, in which she asked people to send in their thoughts on race in just six words. When she began the project in 2010, Norris assumed she'd hear mostly from people of color. She was wrong. MICHELE NORRIS: I think what happened is people felt that they had an entry into a conversation that wasn't always welcome to them. And it was a place where they could say things that you don't generally say out loud. And so people of all races pulled up to the table. But white Americans, in very large numbers, bought into the project and decided to share their stories. And here are some examples - (reading) white not allowed to be proud. Gay but at least I'm white. Hated for being a white cop. Abuse was invisible because I'm white. Other races resent us white people. Most white people are not racists. White people do not own racism. I unpack my white privilege daily. MCCAMMON: Norris digs into some of these feelings in her story \"The Rising Anxiety Of White America.\" It focuses on the town of Hazleton, Penn. Since the year 2000, it's gone from being more than 95 percent white to more than half Latino. That change makes some of the white residents uncomfortable.

Do you share that hope? Or is that in some way a naive hope? NORRIS: Well, I am optimistic by nature. And yet I'm pragmatic. And so I know that when we say that race is perhaps an easier concept for young people, it's easier, but it's not easy. In fact, there's a body of social research that suggests that young people, despite inheriting this world that is so much more diverse, still sometimes cling to values that their parents had or that their parents' parents had. And yet I think the future is still something that we should be optimistic about. But it might take two, three, four generations before some of this gets easier. And it's not just because of demographics and race. It's also because of the economic tumult that we're facing. And it's also because of technological tumult. I mean, people's jobs are being replaced in large part by technology. And that creates a certain degree of vertigo. So it's not one thing. There are a lot of onions in that stew. MCCAMMON: Michele Norris is the author of \"The Rising Anxiety Of White America\" in the April issue of National Geographic and a former NPR host. Thank you so much for joining us. NORRIS: It is great to be back here. Thanks so much. (SOUNDBITE OF ALOE BLACC'S \"WITH MY FRIENDS\") Copyright © 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Since the year 2000, it's gone from being more than 95 percent white to more than half Latino. That change makes some of the white residents uncomfortable. NORRIS: When people talked about it, it was often the notion of suddenly being outnumbered. That's a word that I heard over and over and over again - going to the doctor's office and suddenly looking around and realizing everybody else is Hispanic, going to the local Walmart and realizing, boy, the things that they're selling in the produce aisle are different. Or there's a whole aisle where everything is written in two different languages, and I never noticed that before. Or the people who are checking me out when I go to buy lumber or groceries, they're different. And suddenly people are speaking Spanish. And suddenly it feels like this community that I knew so well - is what they were saying - is that they don't feel like it's theirs anymore. And that coupled with economic changes, with jobs disappearing - and that coupled with the cultural things in a town where you had a very strong immigrant population for decades, you know. There were people from Italy and people from Ireland and people from Germany. And they all had their traditions. And suddenly they have to make space for newcomers who come in. But when the newcomers are brown and when the newcomers are less interested in assimilating in the same way and suddenly speaking English - they want to hold onto their old culture, and they want to hold onto their old language - suddenly the word immigrant doesn't have the same ring to it. MCCAMMON: Michele Norris, as you've had these conversations with white people about the discomfort they feel about the change they see around them, how much did they seem to, in their own minds, connect that discomfort to issues of race? NORRIS: It was interesting because they wouldn't necessarily say those brown people. There would often be sort of proxy for that. You know, the food is different. The music is different. The town feels different. There was a large threat narrative. I mean, people felt like, with the changing community, the crime rate had increased - or that they just didn't feel as safe as they used to. In some cases, it was for a good reason. Someone had literally drove a car into their restaurant. Or someone had had a wallet taken. In a lot of cases though, the fear was based on something in the abstract - not something that had actually happened to them. And there was a difference in the way that people who were more advanced in years talked about it than the kids. MCCAMMON: I do want to ask about the next generation because you do talk about that a bit. And I feel like, in general, a lot of these discussions about race seem to sometimes almost end with platitudes that the next generation will be more enlightened, more colorblind or at least more comfortable with difference.

      "text": "Obama Explains Black America To White America\n\nBy\n\nFrank James\n\nPresident Obama tackled race head-on in his first on-camera response to George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Carolyn Kaster/AP hide caption\n\nPresident Obama tackled race head-on in his first on-camera response to George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.\n\nThe days are few and far between when President Obama has intentionally reminded us that he is the first African-American president.\n\nFriday was one.\n\nThe president did something no other holder of his office has ever had the life experience to do: He used the bully pulpit to, as an African-American, explain black America to white America in the wake of last week's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.\n\nAppearing unannounced before surprised reporters who were expecting the White House press secretary, it was Obama - \"the bridge\" as New Yorker editor David Remnick has called him - trying to span a divide. It was Obama trying to help white Americans comprehend black America's reaction to the Martin-Zimmerman tragedy.\n\nTo a degree, it was reminiscent of the widely hailed Philadelphia speech Obama made during the 2008 presidential campaign to explain American racial realities during the controversy over the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.\n\nFor that moment, Obama's bridge went two ways as he explained whites to blacks and blacks to whites. That speech found Obama standing between two races as the son of a black African father and white American mother and translating for each side.\n\nNot so with Friday's remarks: They were one way. The president focused on why so many African-Americans have reacted as if they were gut-punched from the time they first learned of the circumstances surrounding the shooting until the verdict. He made no attempt to explain whites to blacks.\n\nTo whites who have insisted the case wasn't about race, the president explained why so many blacks disagree. In a powerful reminder of his unique place in history, he cited his own personal experience as an African-American.\n\nYou know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that - that doesn't go away.\n\nThere are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.\n\nWhile other presidents have had their common-man stories of hardship or challenge, this is first time a president has been able to tell this particular story of being a minority who was racially profiled.\n\nOr the story of the head of the Justice Department, for that matter. Just days ago Attorney General Eric Holder told of how, when he was a U.S. attorney, police stopped him as he ran down a Washington street because he was trying to make it to a movie.\n\nThe president is right that it seems like almost every African-American male has at least one story about being profiled. As a teenager in New York City heading to basketball games with teammates I was twice stopped by police officers who held their guns on us because, they said, we fit the description of crime suspects they were looking for. We were walking while black.\n\nWhile he was ever Obama, gentle and cautious in his comments, the president made clear his strong disagreement with those who suggest blacks should be more concerned about violence by blacks against other blacks than by whites against blacks since the former poses the greater threat to young black males.\n\nThis made for another striking moment. Obama essentially said to white Americans \"we get it,\" but he went further. He suggested that what bothers many blacks is that too many whites act as if this violence came out of nowhere. Or if not nowhere, out of some moral or other difference in black people.\n\nWe understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.\n\nAnd so the fact that sometimes that's unacknowledged adds to the frustration. And the fact that a lot of African-American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, well, there are these statistics out there that show that African-American boys are more violent - using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain.\n\nIt's potent stuff to blame the violence in black neighborhoods on the violence and poverty tens of millions of blacks have been subjected to over the course of American history. It was Obama telling many white Americans to stop blaming the victim.\n\nObama's Friday comments very likely went some way toward satisfying many African-Americans who had wanted to hear from the president ever since the Zimmerman verdict came down - and wondered where he was. Aside from a brief written statement issued shortly after Zimmerman was acquitted, he had been quiet on the issue.\n\nConservative reaction ranged from unimpressed to scornful.\n\nFor a president who has in the past drawn significant criticism from many blacks for lecturing to African-American audiences about the need to be more responsible parents, Friday's message came from a completely different direction.\n\nInterestingly, though, in a way it came from the same place, the president's identity as African-American. As the nation's first black president, he has been in the unique position of being able to speak to black audiences about the need for greater responsibility.\n\nBut it was also that very African-Americaness that allowed him to speak so personally and honestly about the Martin-Zimmerman case and to be the bridge to whites that might help them better understand what so many blacks have been experiencing.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "ProPublica\n\nOn the southern wall of my father's living room in Maine hangs a lithograph by the social realist artist Ben Shahn. It depicts a dove, wings stretched outward, vaulted by the names of 10 victims of Alabama's racial terrorism in the 1960s.\n\nThe print was a regular topic of conversation for my father, my brother and me when I was a teenager - usually about the obligation of people born to privilege to commit themselves to justice. Titled after the Stephen Spender poem \"I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great,\" the names, in their way, became an assembly of moral ideals for us. And from time to time, I'd search online for them as a way of learning about the civil rights movement, a time and a place that, from where I sat, seemed remote, maybe even unreachable.\n\nThe names included the four girls murdered in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. Also there was Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder at the hands of Alabama state troopers is often credited with spurring the Selma-to-Montgomery marches. Among them, too, was William Moore, the postal worker murdered by segregationists in 1963 as he walked an Alabama highway on a lone protest march toward Jackson, Miss.\n\nMy self-education was, to be honest, quite cursory. And there was one name on the print, James L. Coley, that my modest efforts could produce no record of. In time, I left home, went to college, and thought little of the print, or of Coley.\n\nThis summer marks the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer, the 1964 campaign led by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee that brought hundreds of northern college students, mostly white, to register black Mississippians to vote. The anniversary has been dominated by reflections on another group of murders: Early on in the summer of 1964, segregationists killed James Chaney, a black Mississippian, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, white northerners, as they drove to a bombed Mississippi church.\n\nThe use of white volunteers had been a radical tactic: Placing themselves in harm's way beside black activists, they calculated, would help force America to reckon with the depth of its racial injustice.\n\n\"The rationale for the program was precisely that white America had to be persuaded of how bad things were, and sadly, that wasn't going to happen if it was only black Americans being victimized,\" Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman and Freedom Summer volunteer, told me recently. \"Our major purpose was, frankly, to be voluntary hostages.\"\n\nA year later, in the summer of 1965, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. Most agree that the presence of white activists - and perhaps more importantly the deaths of two of them -  helped compel the passage of the legislation. But it's not clear that Freedom Summer effectively altered what felt like the utter dispensability of black lives in the South - lives like that of the disappeared James L. Coley - so much as it reaffirmed the indispensability of white ones.\n\nIt's an uncertainty that had gnawed at my father, Stephen Wessler, for the last 50 years.\n\n\"When white activists left Mississippi,\" my father now says, \"I think the question is, did people really care about black life?\"\n\nMy parents were raised in middle class families in Massachusetts, and like many Jews of their generation who grew up on the safe white peripheries of the racial upheavals of the 1960s, they held on to a vague sense of historical kinship with black Americans. My father recalls sitting as a boy on the floor of his living room outside of Boston, beside his mother, watching Walter Cronkite report the church bombings, Moore's death, and then the murder of the three civil rights workers'.\n\n\"It was absolutely scary. Goodman and Schwerner were a lot like me - Jewish, liberal, just a little bit older,\" he told me recently. \"I felt if I'd been their age, I'd have been compelled to go to Mississippi, too.\"\n\nAs a college student in the summer of 1972, studying the civil rights movement as a proximate but still historical event, my father gained access to documents stored in the basement of an IRS building that would later become the temporary archives for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Inside box No. 21, he found a 1963 letter from William Moore, the doomed postal worker, to President Kennedy. On the letter, in which Moore wrote of his planned march from Tennessee to Jackson, was a handwritten addition from Moore:\n\n\"Should I have your brother's phone number just in case?\" Moore had scribbled, referring to protection from Robert Kennedy's Justice Department.\n\nAttached to Moore's letter was a second letter, written by President Kennedy's civil rights adviser, Lee White to the Harvard archivists:\n\n\"The letter was never answered and did not reach the president's personal attention until after Mr. Moore's death,\" White wrote.\n\nFor my father, now 63, and for many white northerners, news of the deaths of activists like Moore had sent the deep South's flames raging into white living rooms. Those flames, he said, were fanned by the sense that the federal government was doing little to stand up for blacks in the South or to force a civil rights agenda.\n\n\"It shattered my sense of democracy,\" he said of the murders and the realization that federal inaction was just as much to blame for the deaths as the blunt racism that pulled the triggers. \"And then I had to put it back together.\"\n\nAfter college, my father went to law school and took a job in the Maine Attorney General's office, where in the 1990s he lead the civil rights division, investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.\n\nThirty years after Freedom Summer, my father would tell the lawyers at the civil rights division about Moore's murder and read them the letter, and the note from White. His aim was to the underscore the need for an urgent sense of responsibility.\n\n\"If Kennedy's office had made contact with the Justice Department, and the Justice Department had told the FBI to watch over this man, Moore may not have died,\" my father would suggest to his colleagues.\n\n\"I believed,\" my dad now says, \"that if you can create physical safety and you can create the right to vote and you can get rid of de jure discrimination, things will change. But what's so clear is that that was not enough.\"\n\nAlondra Nelson, a Columbia University sociologist, has studied the history of the Black Panther Party, spawned when Freedom Summer and other non-violent efforts that appealed for an end to discrimination began to feel to many like an inadequate strategy. She said the party's work - one that challenged institutional racism in the North as well as the brute physical violence of the South - threatened many of the very liberals who'd thrown their weight behind Freedom Summer.\n\nFacing up to racism's less obvious \"tentacles\" - in workplace hiring and promotions, in school discipline, in healthcare, and in government policies from policing to sentencing to housing - \"has never been the American strong suit,\" Nelson said.\n\nMy father's recollections of his own parents spoke to this ambivalence.\n\n\"I specifically remember my parents' concern when King began about talking about socioeconomics,\" he says. \"Those were not issues that mainstream liberals wanted to talk about. It became too personal, it forced them to have to look at themselves in a much balder way.\"\n\nMy father is not sure how his parents came upon the Shahn print. It hung on their wall before he placed it on his. He knows that my grandfather, a cardiologist, had Shahn as a patient. Shahn by then was well known for his political and commercial art. The piece, then, may have been a gift from the patient. Or my grandparents may have bought it.\n\nThe print was part of a series that includes another lithograph of two hands - one black and one white - grasping one another, the white hand pulling the black hand up. Above the hand, Shahn wrote in Hebrew and English, \"Thou shall not stand idly by.\"\n\n\"Images, photos and paintings like these - they re-center white people, over and over again,\" says Martin Berger, an art historian at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who has written a book about visual depictions of the civil rights movement.\n\n\"We rarely remember the more mundane parts of the civil rights movement, black power organizing, or the many deaths that did not get covered,\" Berger says.\n\nThe series of prints by Shahn also included three simple line drawings of Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney. On the back of a copy Shahn sent to Goodman's parents a year after the murders, he inscribed the Spender poem that begins, \"I think continually of those who are truly great.\"\n\nGoodman's mother replied to Shahn and told him that, by coincidence, her son's gravestone bore the last two lines of the poem:\n\n\"Born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun\n\nAnd left the vivid air signed with their honour.\"\n\nThe disappearance of the three young men in 1964 was \"the focus of the whole country's concern,\" Walter Cronkite said on the evening news. But as the country received news that federal agents had found the three bodies, James Chaney's family held a funeral, quietly and largely out of view of the press. Dave Dennis, a leading African-American civil rights organizer in Mississippi, spoke from a pulpit before rows of mourners.  \"Hold your heads up,\" Dennis said through choking tears. \"I don't want to have to go to another memorial. I'm tired of funerals. Tired of it!\"\n\nWe rarely remember the more mundane parts of the civil rights movement, black power organizing, or the many deaths that did not get covered.\n\nAfter paying little attention to the Shahn print in my father's house for about a decade, I eventually found myself looking again for some trace of James L. Coley. With a bit more concentrated effort, it was not hard to find that Shahn had written the name incorrectly. He was referring, it appears, to a man named John L. Coley. The New York Times had reported his name as James as well in a brief mention of the September 1963 murder.\n\nColey was 20 when he was killed. An army veteran who served two years in Germany, he'd returned to Alabama and found himself at a civil rights protest following the bombing of the home of Arthur Shores, a prominent black civil rights attorney. Police and protesters were injured, news reports say. Birmingham police said at the time that Coley had pulled out a gun during the protest.\n\nEyewitnesses, including reporters, said that Coley had been unarmed, and was running from the police during the commotion. Officers shot him in his side and neck. Not far from where Coley was killed, President's Johnson's national guardsmen were on alert. They did not act.\n\nA newswire follow-up in The New York Times referenced Coley's death: \"Two nights ago Negro disorder resulted in the death of one Negro.\"\n\nIn 1992, almost three decades after Freedom Summer, my father investigated his first hate crime cases: an attack against an African American family in Portland, Maine, by white men with baseball bats; threats by white locals on Latino poultry workers in a small Maine town.\n\nHe now works as a civil rights educator and advocate in schools and with police departments.\n\n\"I see all this immense progress, and then I see people terrorizing each other, people quite reasonably afraid of the law enforcement because of bias and what they've seen happen to members of their community, just immense inequality.\"\n\nSeth Freed Wessler covers poverty and inequality for NBCNews.com .

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: The Breakdown\n\nWaste people. Rubbish. Clay-eaters. Hillbillies. Two new books that reckon with the long, bleak history of the country's white poor suggest their plight shouldn't have caught the rest of the country off guard.\n\nby Alec MacGillis\n\nHow politics and government really work, and why they don't.\n\nSometime during the past few years, the country started talking differently about white Americans of modest means.\n\nEarly in the Obama era, the ennobling language of campaign pundits prevailed. There was much discussion of \"white working-class voters,\" with whom the Democrats, and especially Barack Obama, were having such trouble connecting. Never mind that this overbroad category of Americans - the exit pollsters' definition was anyone without a four-year college degree, or more than a third of the electorate - obliterated major differences in geography, ethnicity, and culture. The label served to conjure a vast swath of salt-of-the-earth citizens living and working in the wide-open spaces between the coasts - Sarah Palin's \"real America\" - who were dubious of the effete, hifalutin types increasingly dominating the party that had once purported to represent the common man. The \"white working class\" connoted virtue and integrity. A party losing touch with it was a party unmoored.\n\nThat flattering glow has faded away. Today, less privileged white Americans are considered to be in crisis, and the language of sociologists and pathologists predominates. Charles Murray's \"Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010\" was published in 2012, and Robert D. Putnam's \"Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis\" came out last year. From opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, they made the case that social breakdown among low-income whites was starting to mimic trends that had begun decades earlier among African Americans: Rates of out-of-wedlock births and male joblessness were rising sharply. Then came the stories about a surge in opiate addiction among white Americans, alongside shocking reports of rising mortality rates (including by suicide) among middle-aged whites. And then, of course, came the 2016 presidential campaign. The question was suddenly no longer why Democrats struggled to appeal to regular Americans. It was why so many regular Americans were drawn to a man like Donald Trump.\nEqually jarring has been the shift in tone. A barely suppressed contempt has characterized much of the commentary about white woe, on both the left and the right. Writing for National Review in March, the conservative provocateur Kevin Williamson shoveled scorn on the low-income white Republican voters who, as he saw it, were most responsible for the rise of Trump:\n\nNothing happened to them. There wasn't some awful disaster. There wasn't a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence - and the incomprehensible malice - of poor white America. So the gypsum business in Garbutt ain't what it used to be. There is more to life in the 21st century than wallboard and cheap sentimentality about how the Man closed the factories down.\n\nThe truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap. Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs ... The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump's speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\n\nAnalysis on the left has been less gratuitously nasty but similarly harsh in its insinuation. Several prominent liberals have theorized that what's driving rising mortality and drug and alcohol abuse among white Americans is, quite simply, despair over the loss of their perch in the country's pecking order. \"So what is happening?\" asked Josh Marshall on his \"Talking Points Memo\" blog in December. \"Let's put this clearly,\" he said in wrapping up his analysis of the dismal health data. \"The stressor at work here is the perceived and real loss of the social and economic advantages of being white.\"\n\nThe barely veiled implication, whichever version you consider, is that the people undergoing these travails deserve relatively little sympathy - that they maybe, kinda had this reckoning coming. Either they are layabouts drenched in self-pity or they are sad cases consumed with racial status anxiety and animus toward the nonwhites passing them on the ladder. Both interpretations are, in their own ways, strikingly ungenerous toward a huge number of fellow Americans.\n\nThey are also unsatisfying as explanations for what is happening out there. Williamson, for one, mischaracterizes the typical Trump voter. As exit polls show, the candidate's base is not the truly bereft white underclass Williamson derides. Those Americans are, by and large, not voting at all, as I'm often reminded when reporting in places like Appalachia, where turnout rates are the lowest in the country. People voting for Trump are mostly a notch higher on the economic ladder - in a position to feel exactly the resentment that Williamson himself feels toward the shiftless needy. As for liberals' diagnosis that a major public-health crisis is rooted in racial envy, it fails to square with, among other things, the fact that blacks and Hispanics have hardly been flourishing themselves. Yes, there's an African American president, but by many metrics the Great Recession was even worse for minorities than for whites.\n\nTwo new books - one a provocative, deeply researched history and the other an affecting memoir - are well timed to help make better sense of the plight of struggling whites in the United States. Both accounts converge on an important insight: The gloomy state of affairs in the lower reaches of white America should not have caught the rest of the country as off guard as it has - and mobilizing solutions for the crisis will depend partly on closing the gaps that allowed for such obliviousness.\n\n\"Welcome to America as it was,\" Nancy Isenberg, a historian at Louisiana State University, writes near the outset of \"White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America.\" Her title might seem sensational were it not so well earned. As she makes plain, a white lower class not only figured more prominently in the development of the colonies and the young country than national lore suggests, but was spoken of from the start explicitly in terms of waste and refuse.\n\nFor England, the New World beckoned as more than a vast store of natural resources, Isenberg argues. It was also a place to dispose of the dregs of its own society. In the late 16th century, the geographer Richard Hakluyt argued that America could serve as a giant workhouse where the \"fry [young children] of wandering beggars that grow up idly and hurtfully and burdenous to the Realm, might be unladen and better bred up.\" The exportable poor, he wrote, were the \"offals of our people.\" In 1619, King James I was so fed up with vagrant boys milling around his New-market palace that he asked the Virginia Company to ship them overseas. Three years later, John Donne - yes, that John Donne - wrote about the colony of Virginia as if it were England's spleen and liver, Isenberg writes, draining the \"ill humours of the body ... to breed good bloud.\" Thus it was, she goes on, that the early settlers included so many \"roguish highwaymen, mean vagrants, Irish rebels, known whores, and an assortment of convicts,\" including one Elizabeth \"Little Bess\" Armstrong, sent to Virginia for stealing two spoons.\n\nOne of America's founding myths, of course, is that the simple act of leaving England and boldly starting new lives in the colonies had an equalizing effect on the colonists, swiftly narrowing the distance between indentured servant and merchant, landowner and clerk - all except the African slave. Nonsense, Isenberg says: \"Independence did not magically erase the British class system.\" A \"ruthless class order\" was enforced at Jamestown, where one woman returned from 10 months of Indian captivity to be told that she owed 150 pounds of tobacco to her dead husband's former master and would have to work off the debt. The Puritans were likewise \"obsessed with class rank\" - membership in the Church and its core elect were elite privileges - not least because the early Massachusetts settlers included far more nonreligious riffraff than is generally realized. A version of the North Carolina constitution probably co-authored by John Locke was designed to \"avoid erecting a numerous democracy.\" It envisioned a nobility of landgraves and caciques (German for \"princes\" and Spanish for \"chieftains\"), along with a \"court of heraldry\" to oversee marriages and make sure they preserved pedigree.\n\nClass distinctions were maintained above all in the apportionment of land. In Virginia in 1700, indentured servants had virtually no chance to own any, and by 1770, less than 10 percent of white Virginians had claim to more than half the land. In 1729 in North Carolina, a colony with 36,000 people, there were only 3,281 listed grants, and 309 grantees owned nearly half the land. \"Land was the principal source of wealth, and those without any had little chance to escape servitude,\" Isenberg writes. \"It was the stigma of landlessness that would leave its mark on white trash from this day forward.\" This was not just a Southern dynamic. The American usage of squatter traces to New England, where many of the nonelect  -  later called \"swamp Yankees\" - carved out homes on others' land only to be chased off and have their houses burned.\n\nThe Founding Fathers were, as Isenberg sees it, complicit in perpetuating these stark class divides. George Washington believed that only the \"lower class of people\" should serve as foot soldiers in the Continental Army. Thomas Jefferson envisioned his public schools educating talented students \"raked from the rubbish\" of the lower class, and argued that ranking humans like animal breeds was perfectly natural. \"The circumstance of superior beauty is thought worthy of attention in the propagation of our horses, dogs and other domestic animals,\" he wrote. \"Why not that of man?\" John Adams believed the \"passion for distinction\" was a powerful human force: \"There must be one, indeed, who is the last and lowest of the human species.\"\n\nBy the time the nation gained independence, the white underclass - its future dependents - was fully entrenched. This underclass could be found just about every-where in the new country, but it was perhaps most conspicuous in North Carolina, where many whites who had been denied land in Virginia trickled into the area south of the Great Dismal Swamp, establishing what Isenberg calls \"the first white trash colony.\" William Byrd II, the Virginia planter, described these swamp denizens as suffering from \"dis-tempers of laziness\" and \"slothful in everything but getting children.\" North Carolina's governor described his people as \"the meanest, most rustic and squalid part of the species.\"\n\nAccounts of this underclass as \"an anomalous new breed of human,\" as Isenberg puts it, proliferated as poor whites without property spread west and south across the country. These \"crackers\" and \"squatters\" were \"no better than savages,\" with \"children brought up in the Woods like brutes,\" wrote a Swiss-born colonel in the colonial army in 1759. In 1810, the ornithologist Alexander Wilson described the \"grotesque log cabins\" where the lowly patriarch typically stood wearing a shirt \"defiled and torn,\" his \"face inlaid with dirt and soot.\" Thomas Jefferson's granddaughter came back from an 1817 excursion with her grandfather telling of that \"half civiliz'd race who lived beyond the ridge.\" In 1830, the country even got its first \"Cracker Dictionary\" to document the slang of poor whites.\n\nAt various junctures, politicians (think Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson) turned humble roots into a mark of \"backwoodsman\" authenticity, but the pendulum always swung back. The term white trash made its first appearance in print as early as 1821. It gained currency three decades later, by which point observers were expressing horror over these people's \"tallow\" skin and their habit of eating clay. As George Weston warned in his widely circulated 1856 pamphlet \"The Poor Whites of the South,\" they were \"sinking deeper and more hopelessly into barbarism with every succeeding generation.\" Speaking of this class as a separate breed - a species unto itself - was a way to skirt the challenge it presented to the nation's vision of equality and inclusivity.\n\nIsenberg points up the tension: \"If whiteness was not an automatic badge of superiority, a guarantee of the homogeneous population of independent, educable freemen ... then the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were unobtainable.\"\n\nWith so much talk of breeds, it is no surprise that, in the early 20th century, the U.S. was gripped by a eugenics craze, which Isenberg sees as motivated by revulsion over the supposed degeneracy of poor whites, especially those in the South. State fairs held \"fitter family\" contests, Teddy Roosevelt fretted about Americans' \"germ protoplasm,\" and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. issued a ruling upholding the forced sterilization of a poor Virginian named Carrie Buck, deemed a \"moron.\"\n\nIsenberg, for all her efforts to clarify the role of class in the national culture, succumbs to a different kind of distortion herself. She is frustratingly hazy about regional distinctions within the white lower class, a blurriness that also skews some of the contemporary liberal theorizing about white despondency. As her account progresses, she focuses increasingly on the South, without squarely addressing that choice and its implications.\n\nTo zero in on the white underclass in or near slaveholding areas is, understandably, to dwell on the fraught dynamic between poor whites and enslaved African Americans and its role in the national debate leading up to the Civil War. On the one hand, opponents of slavery argued that the association of labor with servitude dulled the work ethic of poor whites. On the other, defenders of slavery claimed that being spared the lowliest toil kept poor Southern whites a step above their Northern counterparts.\n\nBut there were whole other swaths of the country where many poor whites lived without any blacks nearby to speak of - not least the broad expanse of Appalachia. Isenberg makes plain in a brief aside that she does not buy the idea, enshrined in so many books in recent years, of a separate cohort of \"Scots-Irish\" - hard-drinking, hard-scrapping brawlers from the \"borderlands\" of Scotland, northern Ireland, and northern England who, cherishing their freedom and wanting nothing to do with the coastal elites, settled up in the Appalachian hills in the mid-18th century. One such account, Grady McWhiney's \"Cracker Culture\" (1988), earns Isenberg's brisk dismissal as a \"flawed historical study that turned poor whites into Celtic ethnics (Scots-Irish).\"\n\nRegardless of the merits in that dispute, Isenberg ought to have reckoned more fully with the distinctions between poor whites in the Deep South and those elsewhere. At points, she mentions \"hillbilly\" whites (AKA \"mountaineers\" and \"briar hoppers\") as a subset of her white underclass. But at other points, she makes it sound as if all poor whites lived with blacks in their midst and, when the Civil War came, went off with varying degrees of enthusiasm to fight to maintain their superiority over those blacks. In reality, many poor whites in Appalachia avoided what they saw as the war of the slave-holding planters of the Deep South and the cavaliers of the Tide-water region of Virginia - and even created a new state, West Virginia, in their resistance. Whether or not one buys into the Scots-Irish version of events, the history of greater Appalachia is one of provincial upstarts asserting themselves against elites, not merely one of dispossessed victims.\n\nThe distinction's relevance persists today. Large areas of \"real America\" are almost entirely white. In Appalachia, that homogeneity, along with the region's populist tradition, helps explain why white voters there took so much longer to flip from Democrat to Republican than in the Deep South. This does not mean that racism is absent in these areas - far from it. But it suggests that the racism is fueled as much by suspicion of the \"other\" as it is by firsthand experience of blacks and competition with them - and that political sentiment on issues such as welfare and crime isn't as racially motivated as many liberal analysts assume. A focus on the South also eclipses places where low-income whites consist mainly of descendants of later European immigrants. (Think of the South Boston Irish, or Baltimore's Polish American dockworkers depicted in the second season of \"The Wire.\")\n\nAs Isenberg's chronicle moves into the middle of the 20th century, she offers a fascinating account of how the trailer parks built to provide housing for war-industry workers gave rise to a whole new demeaning stereotype: trailer trash. She captures the reflexively pejorative depictions of poor southern whites during the civil-rights years. And she shows how, starting in the 1970s, the new preoccupation with ethnic heritage instilled a semi-ironic pride in \"redneck\" identity. The upgraded self-image prefigured the elevation of the \"white working class\" in the years to follow.\n\nBy the time her account reaches the late 20th century, though, the social and economic texture thins. Instead, Isenberg resorts to cataloguing representations of poor whites in pop culture (Deliverance, Hee Haw, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo) and celebrity politics (Tammy Faye Bakker, Bill Clinton, Sarah Palin), and offers some fairly trite commentary on the current political scene. Isenberg's history is a bracing reminder of the persistent contempt for the white under-class, but you will have to look elsewhere for insights into why the condition of this class has taken a turn for the worse - and what its members think of themselves, and of the elites who have trashed them for so long.\n\nTo have become a memoirist when he's barely cracked 30, J. D. Vance suggests at the outset of \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,\" is \"somewhat absurd\" - except that the result couldn't be better-timed. Vance's story amounts to a one-family composite of nearly all the worrisome trends affecting poor white Americans.\n\nThe cover image of a mountain cabin is slightly misleading. Vance's family straddles \"hillbillies\" who have remained in Appalachia and those whose ancestors left for work in the Midwest and are now struggling across the postindustrial flatlands. He still has relatives in Breathitt County, Kentucky, and feels a strong bond with that place. But most of the book is set where his grandparents moved decades ago and he grew up, the small manufacturing city of Middletown, in distinctly un-hilly southwestern Ohio.\n\nUnlike Isenberg, Vance subscribes fully to the notion of the Appalachian Scots-Irish as a distinct breed of low-income Americans who have brought their pugilistic ways with them wherever they have gone. His family fits the bill to the point of straining credulity. His beloved maternal grandmother, Mamaw, once nearly killed a man who stole the family's cow. His great-uncle forced a man who made a leering comment about the young Mamaw to eat her panties at knifepoint. Later, when Mamaw got angry that her husband, Papaw, had come home drunk again, she set him on fire. (One of their daughters put out the flames.) Papaw was no slouch himself, having once apparently killed a neighbor's dog by feeding it steak marinated in antifreeze after it nearly bit Vance's mom.\n\nBut Vance, a self-described conservative who has contributed to National Review, is not offering another lurid saga of hillbilly exploits. He is trying to figure out how things went wrong for his people. \"I am a hill person. So is much of America's white working class,\" he writes. \"And we hill people aren't doing very well.\"\n\nIn Vance's story, the troubles are embodied above all in one person: his mother. After graduating high school as the salutatorian, Bev became a teenage mother, as Mamaw had also been, and embarked on a string of marriages - five, at last count. She was bright - \"the smartest person I knew\" - and drilled the importance of reading and education into her son. She checked out library books on football strategy to get him to think more deeply about the game he loved, and revamped his third-grade science project the night before it was due, just like any suburban helicopter mom.\n\nBut her marriages were riven by fighting. She drank heavily, and became addicted to the painkillers she could pilfer in her job as a nurse, and later to heroin. Vance and his older sister were raised amid an extreme form of the instability and dysfunction that Charles Murray and Robert Putnam lament: He grew up with three stepfathers, and during one two-year stretch he lived in four houses. At one low point, when he was 12, his mother was taken away in handcuffs after he fled to a stranger's house to escape a beating from her. At another point, she asked him to pee into a cup so she could use his urine to pass a drug test. \"Chaos begets chaos,\" he writes. \"Welcome to family life for the American hillbilly.\"\n\nVance survives this endless turbulence, thanks in large part to the tough love he receives from Mamaw, living nearby, who sees in him a chance to redeem her parenting failures with Bev. His grades are good enough to get him into the best state colleges in Ohio. But fearing that he isn't ready for unstructured campus life, he enlists in the Marine Corps, and gets a stint in Iraq and a large helping of maturity and perspective. After finishing his tour, he excels at Ohio State and, to his joyful amazement, is admitted to Yale Law School.\n\nWith the same appealing guilelessness that he brings to the story of his youthful ordeals, Vance describes the culture shock he experiences in New Haven. He doesn't know what to make of the endless \"cocktail receptions and banquets\" that combine networking and matchmaking. At the fancy restaurant where he's attending a law firm's recruitment dinner, he spits out sparkling water, having never drunk such a thing. He calls his girlfriend from the restroom to ask her, 'What do I do with all these damned forks?' \"\n\nHis estrangement often reflects poorly on the echelon he's joined, whose members, he says with understatement, could do a better job of \"opening their hearts and minds to\" newcomers. He is taken aback when law-school friends leave a mess at a chicken joint, and stays behind with another student from a low-income background, Jamil, to clean it up. \"People,\" he writes, \"would say with a straight face that a surgeon mother and engineer father were middle-class.\" To his astonishment, he is regarded as an exotic figure by his professors and classmates, simply by virtue of having come from a small town in the middle of the country, gone to a mediocre public high school, and been born to parents who didn't attend college.\n\nHe adapts to his new world well enough to land at a Washington, D.C., law firm and later in a court clerkship, and is today prospering as a principal at an investment firm in San Francisco. But the outsider feeling lingers - hearing someone use a big word like confabulate in conversation makes his blood rise. \"Sometimes I view members of the elite with an almost primal scorn,\" he admits. And questions nag at him: \"Why has no else from my high school made it to the Ivy League? Why are people like me so poorly represented in America's elite institutions?\" He is acutely aware of how easily he could have been trapped, had it not been for the caring intervention he received at key moments from people like Mamaw and his sister. \"Thinking about ... how close I was to the abyss, gives me chills. I am one lucky son of a bitch.\" He asks: How much of our lives, good and bad, should we credit to our personal decisions, and how much is just the inheritance of our culture, our families, and our parents who have failed their children? How much is Mom's life her own fault? Where does blame stop and sympathy begin?\n\nVance's answers read like works in progress: His passages of general social commentary could have benefited from longer gestation, and are strongest when grounded in his biography. He is well aware of the larger forces driving the cultural decline he deplores. He knows how much of the deterioration in Middletown can be traced to the shrinkage of the big Armco steel-rolling mill that, during World War II, drew so many Appalachians - including Papaw - to the town. His tales of the increasingly\nrarefied world of elite education offer good evidence for why \"many people in my community began to believe that the modern American meritocracy was not built for them.\"\n\nBut he also sees the social decline in personal terms, as a weakening of moral fiber and work ethic. He describes, for instance, working at a local grocery store, where he \"learned how people gamed the welfare system\":\n\nThey'd buy two dozen-packs of soda with food stamps and then sell them at a discount for cash. They'd ring up their orders separately, buying food with food stamps, and beer, wine, and cigarettes with cash ... Most of us were struggling to get by, but we made do, worked hard, and hoped for a better life. But a large minority was content to live off the dole. Every two weeks, I'd get a small paycheck and notice the line where federal and state income taxes were deducted from my wages. At least as often, our drug-addict neighbor would buy T-bone steaks, which I was too poor to buy for myself but was forced by Uncle Sam to buy for someone else.\n\nAs Vance notes, resentment of this sort - which surfaces again and again in his book - helps explain why voters in the world he came from have largely abandoned the Democrats, the party of the social safety net.\n\nNor is the animus new: Isenberg traces it back to the days when poor Southerners were scorned for availing themselves of the aid extended to freed slaves - and joined in the scorn as soon as they escaped the dole. \"The same self-made man who looked down on white trash others had conveniently chosen to forget that his own parents escaped the tar-paper shack only with the help of the federal government,\" she writes. \" 'Upscale rednecks' had no trouble spotting those below them in their rearview mirrors.\" In Vance's book, those \"below\" are mostly fellow whites and the resentment is not primarily racially motivated, as many liberals would have one believe of all anti-welfare sentiment.\n\nVance does not pivot from such observations to a full-blown indictment of social-welfare programs. He isn't ready to join the Republican chorus that blames the government (and specifically the black president who now heads it) for all ills. But he zealously subscribes to its corollary: The government, in his view, can't possibly cure those ills. In a summary that borders on the polemical, he exhorts the \"broad community of hillbillies\" to \"wake the hell up\" and seize control of its fate.\n\nPublic policy can help, but there is no government that can fix these problems for us ... Mamaw refused to purchase bicycles for her grandchildren because they kept disappearing - even when locked up - from her front porch. She feared answering her door toward the end of her life because an able-bodied woman who lived next door would not stop bothering her for cash - money, we later learned, for drugs. These problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else. We created them, and only we can fix them.\n\nVance's intentions here are sincere and understandable. He's tired of folks back home talking big about hard work when they are collecting checks just like the people they denigrate - tired of \"the lies we tell ourselves.\" He's fed up with the quick resort to political blame, like the acquaintance in Middletown who told him that he had quit work because he was sick of waking up early but then declared on Facebook that it was the \"Obama economy\" that had set him back. \"Whenever people ask me what I'd most like to change about the white working class,\" writes Vance, \"I say, 'The feeling that our choices don't matter.' \"\n\nHe is wrong, though, that the burden of fixing things falls entirely on his people. The problems he describes - the reasons life in Middletown got tougher for his mom's generation than it was for Mamaw and Papaw when they came north for work - have plenty to do with decisions by \"governments or corporations.\" The government and corporations have presided over the rise of new monopolies, the effect of which has been to concentrate wealth in a handful of companies and regions. The government and corporations welcomed China into the World Trade Organization; more and more economists now believe that move hastened the erosion of American manufacturing, by encouraging U.S. companies to shift operations offshore. The government and corporations each did their part to weaken organized labor, which once boosted wages and strengthened the social fabric in places like Middletown. More recently, the government has accelerated the decline of the coal industry, on environmentally defensible grounds but with awfully little in the way of remedies for those affected.\n\nEven at the edges, solutions lie within the purview of the powers that be - such as allowing Medicaid expansion to proceed in the South and expanding access to medication-assisted treatment to help people like Vance's mother get off heroin. Yes, aid should be tailored to avoid the sort of resentment that Vance felt at the grocery store. At moments, he seems to acknowledge a role for taxpayer-funded compassion. \"The best way to look at this might be to recognize that you probably can't fix these things,\" a friend who worked at the White House once told him. \"They'll always be around. But maybe you can put your thumb on the scale a little for the people at the margins.\"\n\nPerhaps you can even put your whole hand on the scale. One of the most compelling parts of Isenberg's history is her account of the help delivered to struggling rural whites as part of the New Deal. Projects like the Resettlement Administration, led by Rexford Tugwell, which moved tenants to better land and provided loans for farm improvements, brought real progress. So did the Tennessee Valley Authority, which not only spurred development of much of the South but created training centers and entire planned towns - towns where hill children went to school with engineers' kids. The New Deal had its flops. But men like Tugwell recognized that citizens in some places were slipping badly behind, and that their plight represented a powerful threat to the country's founding ideals of individual self-determination and advancement.\n\nA case can be made that the time has arrived for a major undertaking in, say, the devastated coal country of central Appalachia. How much to invest in struggling regions themselves, as opposed to making it easier for those who live in them to seek a livelihood elsewhere, is a debate that needs to happen. But the obligation is there, as it was 80 years ago. \"We think of the left-behind groups as extinct,\" Isenberg writes, \"and the present as a time of advanced thought and sensibility. But today's trailer trash are merely yesterday's vagrants on wheels, an updated version of Okies in jalopies and Florida crackers in their carts. They are renamed often, but they do not disappear.\"\n\nExcept they are now further out of sight than ever. As Isenberg documents, the lower classes have been disregarded and shunted off for as long as the United States has existed. But the separation has grown considerably in recent years. The elite economy is more concentrated than ever in a handful of winner-take-all cities - as Phillip Longman recently noted in the Washington Monthly, the per capita income of Washington, D.C., in 1980 was 29 percent above the average for Americans as a whole; in 2013, that figure was 68 percent. In the Bay Area, per capita income jumped from 50 percent to 88 percent above average over that period; in New York, from 80 percent to 172 percent. As these gaps have grown, the highly educated have become far more likely than those lower down the ladder to move in search of better-paying jobs.\n\nThe clustering is intensifying within regions, too. Since 1980, the share of upper-income households living in census tracts that are majority upper-income, rather than scattered throughout more mixed-income neighborhoods, has doubled. The upper echelon has increasingly sought comfort in prosperous insularity, withdrawing its abundant social capital from communities that relied on that capital's overflow, and consolidating it in oversaturated enclaves.\n\nSo why are white Americans in downwardly mobile areas feeling a despair that appears to be driving stark increases in substance abuse and suicide? In my own reporting in Vance's home ground of southwestern Ohio and ancestral territory of eastern Kentucky, I have encountered racial anxiety and antagonism, for sure. But far more striking is the general aura of decline that hangs over towns in which medical-supply stores and pawn shops dominate decrepit main streets, and Victorians stand crumbling, unoccupied. Talk with those still sticking it out, the body-shop worker and the dollar-store clerk and the unemployed miner, and the fatalism is clear: Things were much better in an earlier time, and no future awaits in places that have been left behind by polished people in gleaming cities. The most painful comparison is not with supposedly ascendant minorities - it's with the fortunes of one's own parents or, by now, grandparents. The demoralizing effect of decay enveloping the place you live cannot be underestimated. And the bitterness - the \"primal scorn\" - that Donald Trump has tapped into among white Americans in struggling areas is aimed not just at those of foreign extraction. It is directed toward fellow countrymen who have become foreigners of a different sort, looking down on the natives, if they bother to look at all.\n\nAlec MacGillis\n\nI have been reporting for ProPublica since 2015, most recently covering the post-pandemic schools crisis.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

ProPublica explores its origins, secret communications, history of arrests and outsize aims for an all-white America.\n\nby Carol Schaeffer and Fritz Zimmermann , special to ProPublica\n\nTracking Hate Crimes and Bias Incidents\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn the hours after the slaughter in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, a final toll emerged: 22 dead, most of them Latinos, some Mexican nationals. A portrait of the gunman accused of killing them soon took shape: a 21-year-old from a suburb of Dallas who had been radicalized as a white supremacist online and who saw immigrants as a threat to the future of white America.\n\nWhile much of the country reacted with a weary sense of sorrow and outrage, word of the mass killing was processed differently by members of Patriot Front, one of the more prominent white supremacist groups in the U.S.\n\nIn secret chat forums, some Patriot Front members embraced the spirit of the anti-immigrant manifesto left behind by the accused gunman. Others floated false conspiracy theories: the CIA was behind the murders; the accused killer was actually Jewish. Still other members cautioned that the group had its own \"loose cannons\" to worry about. It would be a bad look if the next mass murderer was one of their own.\n\nBut there was little, if any, regret over the loss of life.\n\n\"It shouldn't be hard to believe that the group facing the harshest oppression from our ruling elite are producing shooters,\" one Patriot Front member wrote. \"White men are being slowly destroyed in a way calculated to produce resentment and a sense of helplessness. Of course, some of them decide to lash out.\"\n\nSeveral Patriot Front members alerted others to the need to be careful, for the killings in El Paso would likely make the group a target of the FBI.\n\n\"Watch your backs out there,\" one wrote.\n\nPatriot Front was formed in the aftermath of the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. While many on America's far-right cheered the rally, its violence struck others as a public-relations debacle for the white nationalist brand that was sure to attract greater oversight by law enforcement.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nPatriot Front aspired to help chart a new way forward: spread propaganda espousing its version of a nascent American fascism; quietly recruit new members worried about a nation overrun by immigrants and a world controlled by Jews; avoid talking about guns or violence online, but engage in a mix of vandalism and intimidation to foster anxiety; wear masks in public and communicate secretly.\n\n\"The organization is not about its members,\" the group's leader, Thomas Rousseau, once wrote to its members in the secret chats. \"It is about its goals. Each person behind the mask is just another awoken member of the nation, who could be anyone who's had enough.\"\n\nProPublica spent several months examining the makeup and operations of Patriot Front, which records suggest numbers about 300 members.\n\nWhile the group is careful not to talk about guns online, two members in the last year have been arrested with arsenals of illegally owned high-powered rifles and other weapons. While many of the group's propaganda \"actions\" are legal exercises of free speech, its members have been arrested in Boston and Denver in recent months for acts of vandalism. In Boston, three members engaged in a nighttime propaganda effort last winter were arrested on suspicion of weapons possession and assaulting a police officer. What the group touts as political protests have felt to those targeted like acts of menace, as was the case in San Antonio, Texas, last year when Patriot Front members filmed themselves trashing an encampment of immigration activists.\n\nOne person whose establishment was targeted by Patriot Front in recent months spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing the group's return.\n\n\"Ordinarily would you call the police if somebody put a big sticker on your door? No,\" the person said. \"However, once you find out what this is all about, and who is involved, and what they are promoting? Then, yeah, now we are in hate speech space.\"\n\nTo the Southern Poverty Law Center, Patriot Front is a white hate group and a genuine criminal threat. To some of the more avowedly violent neo-Nazi groups in the U.S., Patriot Front is a laughable collection of clowns and cowards, content to chat online and put up stickers while a race war awaits.\n\nBut for law enforcement, gauging how serious a threat Patriot Front might pose is difficult. Patriot Front shares qualities both with groups engaged in real domestic terrorism and with fringe political groups.\n\nAsked about the group, the FBI issued a statement that reflected these complexities and the limitations they place on police agencies.\n\n\"When it comes to domestic terrorism, our investigations focus solely on the criminal activity of individuals - regardless of group membership - that appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion. We would encourage you to keep in mind that membership in groups which espouse domestic extremist ideology is not illegal in and of itself - no matter how offensive their views might be to the majority of society.\"\n\nRousseau, a Boy Scout and high school journalist before he founded Patriot Front, has much the same profile as the accused gunman in El Paso, Patrick Crusius: both grew up in middle-class suburbs of Dallas - Crusius in Allen, Rousseau 35 miles away in Grapevine; both were seen as unremarkable teenagers before being inculcated in their racist ideology online; both talk of a desire to reclaim America for \"true\" or \"pure\" patriots; both regard immigrants as a poisonous and present danger.\n\nIn the days after the rampage in El Paso, Rousseau told his members in the secret chats that such acts of wholesale violence were not for him. While fascist causes like Patriot Front's could survive the blowback from such killings, he said, real success for the group would come from spreading its ideology and increasing its numbers. Of the alleged El Paso shooter, Rousseau wrote in a chat, \"He'd have made more progress toward his goals by swallowing the first round in his magazine instead.\"\n\nIn the months of chats obtained by ProPublica, Rousseau is by turns amateur philosopher and historian, as well as the group's sole spokesman and its online policeman. He warns members that they will be kicked out if they don't stay busy - pasting up flyers and conducting banner drops, joining street actions and posting regularly in the chat forums. He has put together a security guide to help Patriot Front members stay anonymous. He waxes admiringly about certain far-right groups in Europe, and he sees them as a model for how to become more serious political players in the years ahead. He has the secret chats routinely deleted, and he tells members to avoid ever writing or saying anything that might later be of interest to a prosecutor.\n\n\"It should be known,\" he wrote to members recently, \"that political dissidents are subject to unjust scrutiny.\"\n\nPete Simi, a professor at Chapman University in California and an expert on white supremacists in the U.S., said Rousseau's stewardship of Patriot Front is deeply familiar.\n\n\"It is very common for the leadership of these groups to disqualify violence, while doing things that are encouraging violence,\" Simi said. \"It is part of their strategy to avoid liability, while simultaneously promoting hate. When they say they are not violent, this is a lie. They are promoting violence by their goals.\"\n\nTo gain an understanding of Patriot Front - its origins and ambitions, both the careful talk and the criminal behavior of its members - ProPublica examined hundreds of online postings, interviewed a person who infiltrated the group, obtained police records, reviewed its leader's public statements online and in a variety of far-right podcasts, collected video material recorded both by the group and members of the public, and traveled to the homes of its founder and two of the members who had recently been arrested.\n\nThe person who infiltrated Patriot Front in recent years - posting in the group's chats and accompanying it in its propaganda actions - sketched out a portrait of its members, which appear to be exclusively male:\n\nThey come from seven or eight regional \"networks,\" and the vast majority of them are recruited online; the typical member is around 25 years old and can be from blue-collar backgrounds or be working as \"white-collar tech geeks\"; many of them are gamers; few have wives or girlfriends; they can look like \"the nerdy boys that sit next to you in high school,\" but they clearly sympathize with \"right-wing terrorism.\"\n\nThe person who infiltrated Patriot Front said he applied for membership on the group's website - the one with the mission statement written by Rousseau. American democracy was dead. The government had been taken over by Jews and other \"elites.\" Land claimed by descendants of the country's original white settlers had been surrendered to immigrants of color. The dream was of a white ethnostate, in which all that was good and true and pioneering about the America of long ago could be restored.\n\nThe person who gained entrance to the group said Rousseau was one of three Patriot Front members who interviewed him on the telephone when he applied. He was asked to explain his political evolution, to say which political figures he hated and admired most, to state the circumstances in which the use of violence would be OK and to articulate the greatest threat to America. He was told Mussolini's \"The Doctrine of Fascism\" would be required reading.\n\nThe chats reviewed by ProPublica show Rousseau spends lots of time online pressing members to take part in targeting streets, parks and colleges with the group's propaganda. He and others delight in seeing their actions reflected in the SPLC's nationwide map recording acts of hate and in the media. Last spring, the group tried to stage protests in front of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's offices in multiple cities, including New York.\n\n\"One minute of action is better than 10,000 books on ideology,\" Rousseau told his members.\n\nRousseau, still a teen when he founded Patriot Front, makes clear in the secret chats reviewed by ProPublica that he is in charge, though he's happy to go without a formal title.\n\n\"The title commander gives me bad flashbacks,\" he wrote in a chat once. \"If I absolutely had to have a title, it would probably be general director. But my name works just fine for now.\"\n\nThe chats show some members regard Rousseau as a disciplined and effective spokesman for the group, and they appear to heed his repeated scoldings about preserving their anonymity.\n\n\"The enemy cannot attack you if they do not know who you are,\" Rousseau wrote.\n\nUsing the pseudonym Samuel, a member from New York expanded on the idea in response.\n\n\"I would say the biggest accomplishment of masking up is obfuscating our total numbers,\" he wrote. \"We can make them feel as if there are thousands of us when it's only a few hundred, and we could be anyone and no one. Next time they are at the CVS and see a white kid with a neat haircut, it could be us. Fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all.\"\n\nRousseau, when he isn't criticizing members who violate the ban on talking about guns or violence, can often be found policing the group's ideological thinking. Nazism, however popular among members, can't now be the goal, Rousseau said.\n\n\"This is not Germany, this is not the 1930s,\" he chastised. \"Get a grip on the fact that we're activists, not re-enactors trying to scratch some self-indulgent itch for a political fantasy.\"\n\nRousseau conducts his online leadership from the home he shares with his divorced father in Grapevine, a largely white, solidly middle-class city between Dallas and Fort Worth. ProPublica went to see Rousseau there this summer, and we found the shades drawn in every window and a rusting boat filled with fallen leaves on the property.\n\nRousseau came to the door, but he closed it quickly and would not talk. The following day, the red sports car in the driveway had been reparked, making it hard to see the lone license plate on its rear end.\n\nInterviews with people in and around Grapevine - those who went to school with Rousseau, those who participated in the Boy Scouts with him, a man who dated his mother - produced a unanimous sense of surprise that he'd started an organization committed to an all-white America.\n\nHe'd mixed easily with the diverse array of students at his high school, and while he was against gay marriage, he was regarded more as a nice, conservative boy than a threat. He wore his hair long, in braids or a bun, and was obsessed with working out and the state of his physique.\n\nAt the student newspaper, he wasn't regarded as an impressive writer, but he won a national award for editorial cartooning. Classmates saw him as a lazy student and a bit of a loner, but he had a knack for argument and a stubborn streak about never being wrong. The school had its share of racial incidents, but he was never involved and wasn't seen as condoning them.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president, some senior boys at the school made a show of chanting, \"Build a wall.\" Rousseau, for his part, was certainly an ardent Trump supporter - he wore a Make America Great Again hat and carried a Trump lunchbox. But his enthusiasm wasn't seen as menacing.\n\n\"He seemed Republican, but he didn't seem crazy, said one fellow student.\n\nTo someone who was with him in Boy Scouts, Rousseau seemed serious about the organization, and he was elected patrol leader. At the same time, Rousseau could be difficult with adults, developing what the person called an \"authoritarian defiance.\"\n\n\"I'm saddened,\" the person said of Rousseau's embrace of white supremacy.\n\nSimi, the professor at Chapman University, said enough research exists on modern-day white supremacists to develop a profile: young men, isolated and angry in some way despite their relatively privileged upbringing in middle class or affluent circumstances, and vulnerable to invitations to join up with others with similar grievances.\n\nIn years past, Simi said, groups like Patriot Front used to recruit potential new members by waiting outside schools for the last children to leave, the loners wandering off long after the final bell. Now such groups don't have to work so hard to find targets. They have the internet, Simi said.\n\n\"It is a central aspect of these groups to take the frustration and anger and combine it with the special feeling and insights of being part of a group,\" he said.\n\nRousseau, then just 18, was in Charlottesville in 2017, marching in the \"Unite the Right\" rally as a member of Vanguard America. The Anti-Defamation League calls Vanguard America a neo-Nazi group formed in 2016 that, like Patriot Front after it, was chiefly engaged in spreading propaganda. James Fields, the white supremacist convicted of murdering a young protester at the Charlottesville event, was photographed there carrying a Vanguard America shield, though he was not a member of the group.\n\nVanguard America splintered after the debacle in Virginia. Some wanted to abandon efforts to disguise their Nazi leanings and simply be brazen in their public look and violent aims. Rousseau took a different tack, and he started Patriot Front as an ostensibly more strategic, savvy, careful alternative. It would embrace more homegrown symbols - the flag, the bald eagle and patriotic language. Such shifts might attract a wider membership.\n\n\"I did go to Charlottesville. Some bad activism there,\" Rousseau wrote in one of the secret chats. \"I've done my part to learn from my mistakes.\"\n\nWhile Rousseau publicly and in the chats reviewed by ProPublica disavows violence, some Patriot Front members have shown support for a white supremacist group that embraces it: the Rise Above Movement . Eight RAM members have been arrested on charges related to violence in Charlottesville and in California .\n\n\"Gotta love RAM,\" a Tennessee member said in the chats. \"I hope they see us as 100 percent allies.\"\n\nThey train to fight. They post their beatings online. And so far, they have little reason to fear the authorities.\n\nIn the chat logs, a Patriot Front member from Texas provides a list of addresses for 11 people in prison or under house arrest, referring to them as \"POWs.\" The list includes four members of RAM, numerous men arrested for violence in Charlottesville including Fields , and an imprisoned white supremacist in California. The Texan urged Patriot Front members to write to the prisoners and provided links to send some prisoners money directly. He also listed a donation link for a fund tied to Augustus Sol Invictus, a lawyer known for defending white supremacists.\n\nLater in the chats, a member from New York shared a link to a white supremacist online fundraiser, saying proceeds would be given to a legal fund for RAM. He then chimed in that nearly $2,000 had been donated. \"When they crack down we double down and become stronger,\" he said. \"Hail Victory!\"\n\nObservers of white hate groups credit Rousseau as a talented in-fighter, and they portray his breakaway from Vanguard America as a shrewd coup.\n\nAccording to the person who infiltrated Patriot Front, Rousseau worries greatly about his members making the worst strategic mistake: carrying out an act of terrible violence. It would end his group, he has said.\n\n\"Thomas' biggest fear is someone doing something crazy,\" said the person who infiltrated Patriot Front.\n\nJakub Zak was in bed in the Chicago suburb of Vernon Hills when police, accompanied by his father, shook him awake. The police had been told that Zak, 19, was a member of Patriot Front, and that he might have a stash of illegal guns.\n\n\"He appeared nervous and tried to cover a few items on his bed as he put on his blue jeans,\" police records say.\n\nThe police, though, had a clear view of what couldn't be hidden: a gun safe meant for rifles, as well as magazines of ammunition on the bedroom floor.\n\nZak asked his father to make the police leave. His father would not.\n\n\"I advised Jakub that we would like for him to be cooperative, and explained to him cooperation goes a long way,\" one detective wrote in a formal report, dated April 2018. \"I explained to him the decision is for him to make, and he should think what is best for him.\"\n\nZak spoke with his father and then offered the code for the safe. If there were guns in the house, the police wrote, Zak's father wanted them out.\n\nThe police found a loaded 9 mm pistol and then, in a second safe, four more guns, including three high-powered semiautomatic rifles. The police records show Zak's only concern was whether he could get his case for carrying the guns back after their confiscation.\n\nWe answer questions about hate crimes and give you a kind of primer to our Documenting Hate project, now in its third year.\n\nIt is unclear when or how Zak joined Patriot Front. The initial tip sent to law enforcement identified him as a member, one who often posted in the secret chats under the pseudonym \"Hussar.\" Postings under that name - portions of which were first published by Unicorn Riot, a media organization - suggest Zak was a frequent participant in the group's propaganda efforts in the streets.\n\nOnline, Zak posted a mix of Patriot Front slogans and images - \"America: Revolution is tradition\"; \"Deport them all.\" But there was also much more explicitly violent material: a young black man lying prone on the street and about to be stomped; a Glock pistol.\n\nZak, who had no prior criminal record, ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor gun possession charge and was sentenced to probation. Whether local police referred his case, and his affiliation with Patriot Front, to any other law enforcement agency is unclear.\n\nBut the basic facts of Zak's case amount to one of the hard-to-identify, hard-to-quantify, hard-to-assess threats in the U.S. today: an enthusiastically racist young man exposed to a steady diet of like-minded white supremacists, who doesn't find it terribly hard to get his hands on dangerous weapons. Crusius, the accused El Paso killer, had no prior record; he lived with his grandparents; his mother is reported to have anonymously called law enforcement, worried once her son had bought a gun, even if it was legal; the parents of a classmate of Crusius' told a local news organization in Dallas that their son had been encouraged by Crusius to join him in a white supremacist group.\n\nIn a brief interview at their home in Vernon Hills, Zak's parents would not let him be interviewed.\n\n\"There is nothing to talk about,\" his mother said, claiming he was not a member of any white hate group. \"He is going through rough times, and he is in a better place now. I don't want to start anything. He is getting his life together and planning [for] the future.\"\n\n\"We are regular people,\" his father added.\n\nConcerns about how effectively federal authorities have been in thwarting the threat of white supremacists extends back years, covering both Democratic and Republican administrations. In recent months, though, there has been a series of arrests suggesting that federal and local authorities are being more aggressive.\n\nIn a recent report , the Department of Homeland Security took care to restate the balance law enforcement has to strike.\n\n\"The Department must take care, while addressing the scourge of violence, to avoid stigmatizing populations, infringing on constitutional rights, or attempting to police what Americans should think,\" the report said.\n\nLast February, a Patriot Front member, Joffre Cross, was arrested on gun charges in Houston. At a probable cause hearing, authorities said they got on to Cross through phone records belonging to a white supremacist in Texas who was convicted on assault charges this year.\n\nCross, 33, fits what experts see as another familiar profile for potentially violent white supremacists: a former Army soldier whose association with white supremacists dates back to his active-duty days. Disaffected former soldiers are a prime recruiting target for white hate groups, prized for their gun and bomb training and their possible access to weapons. Cross, while on active duty, was convicted on drug charges and imprisoned for five years. As part of the investigation, the authorities developed information that he was eager to secure weapons for white supremacist groups.\n\nCross, who has pleaded not guilty, was charged with felony weapons possession after police found guns and body armor in his home.\n\n\"If you don't know me,\" Cross once posted on Instagram, \"consider this your trigger warning.\" Cross and his attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCross is a regular participant on the Russian social media platform VK, whose terms of service about extremist content are not strictly enforced. His posts are rife with Nazi videos, Holocaust denial material and white supremacists beating protesters.\n\nOne post reads: \"Help more bees; plant more trees; save the seas; shoot refugees.\"\n\nIn the Patriot Front chats, Cross continued to post even after his arrest.\n\n\"We have to build a foundation that can weather any storm, anything they throw at us,\" he wrote last April. \"We just have to keep pushing.\"\n\nIt was the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend 2019 when 20 or so masked members of Patriot Front made their way onto a corner of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. They set off flares and smoke devices, delivered a short speech using a megaphone and fled. The police report said it lasted all of three minutes.\n\nBlakely Lord, a high school English teacher, managed to capture the incident on video. In brief, she called the episode \"profoundly disturbing.\"\n\n\"I chose to film because you feel helpless,\" Lord said. \"I'm a dumpy middle-aged English teacher. I'm not going to get out my sword and face them down.\"\n\nShe added, \"I do think it's a narrative people need to be thinking about: these little incidents may seem unimportant, but in the aggregate they are disturbing.\"\n\nSuch disturbances - masked flash mobs, defacing property, distributing propaganda - are the day-to-day work of Patriot Front. Screaming outside an anarchist book fair in Texas. Plastering stickers across multiple store fronts on a busy block in Denver. Parading with flares at night in a public park in Boston . Posting an \"America First\" sticker at a gay pride center in Vermont . All in the last year.\n\nMembers give one another tips about where to place posters and stickers legally, and they urge one another to wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. But in practice, Patriot Front members frequently target storefronts or places of worship, which is vandalism. Additionally, many colleges and universities, another favorite target for postering, prohibit flyers from nonstudent groups. White supremacists see campuses as a strategic location for flyering: a place to recruit potential members while attracting press coverage to amplify their propaganda .\n\nIn Columbus, Georgia, three months ago, two Patriot Front members posted flyers on and around a local synagogue, Temple Israel. \"Reclaim America,\" read one. \"Life, liberty and the pursuit of victory,\" read another. And the address of Patriot Front's website was printed at the bottom of the flyers. The temple's leadership became aware of Patriot Front's history and said it was clear the synagogue and its members were targeted because of their faith.\n\n\"To me, the sinister aspect is this particular group disguises themselves as patriots, Tiffany Broda, the temple's president, told the Ledger-Enquirer last July. \"Yet they are a hate group, a nationally recognized hate group. And though we don't want to give them publicity, we think that it's important to bring this out of the shadows.\"\n\n\"Jews have been a part of Columbus almost since the founding of our city, which is almost 200 years ago,\" Rabbi Beth Schwartz added. \"We will remain vigilant as a congregation, vigilant as a Jewish community. We don't hide our heads in fear.\"\n\nPatriot Front members make clear in their chats that such actions - almost always recorded by one of the masked members - have multiple aims: to frighten, to provide material for their own propaganda efforts on social media, and to recruit. The drive to recruit might help explain why college campuses are Patriot Front's most common targets.\n\nLate last month, Patriot Front launched what it claimed were coordinated actions to distribute flyers and stickers and posters at more than 100 campuses across the country. The group posted on Twitter what it said was evidence of success at 90 schools.\n\nMichael Loadenthal, a visiting professor of sociology at Miami University in Ohio, said Patriot Front had recently been targeting the school .\n\n\"Fascists having a public presence is organizing; this is recruitment,\" Loadenthal said, adding that the simple idea that \"white supremacists are individually radicalized people in their basement at home is wrong.\"\n\n\"They are a network,\" he said. \"No particular node is dangerous until they are.\"\n\nSimi, the professor in California, said Patriot Front had hit the campus of Chapman University three times in a single month recently. The school, he said, had set up a permanent conference dealing with the nation's southern border, and Patriot Front had singled out posted materials related to the conference to be defaced or covered up.\n\n\"People on the campus get intimidated,\" Simi said.\n\nHe said the school had to add security cameras and police protection.\n\n\"This is part of their strategy,\" Simi said of Patriot Front. \"These are things they want to happen.\"\n\nThalia Beaty and Lucas Waldron contributed to this report.\n\nFiled under:\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "ProPublica\n\nRep. John Lewis, D-Ga. , is the most iconic living veteran of the Civil Rights Movement, the sole survivor of the leaders known as the Big Six . He is the only speaker left from the pivotal 1963 March on Washington.\n\nLewis was a Freedom Rider and was among the first to launch the sit-ins, protests to integrate lunch counters and other spaces. In 1964, he traveled the country, recruiting college students to travel to the deepest South for Freedom Summer. A year later, the blood Lewis spilled in the now-infamous clash between peaceful marchers and state and local police on Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge helped propel the 1965 Voting Rights Act through Congress.\n\nGhosts of Greenwood\n\nA Brutal Loss, but an Enduring Conviction\n\nWhen Freedom Summer Landed in White America's Living Rooms\n\nAbout three weeks ago, I sat down with the congressman to talk about his role in Freedom Summer and the battles still to come as part of our series commemorating the effort's 50th anniversary. This week marks the culmination of Freedom Summer, when black Mississippians challenged Mississippi's all-white delegation at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City .\n\nToday, Lewis represents Georgia in the House of Representatives, in a seat that wouldn't have existed without Freedom Summer and the larger civil rights movement. Black and white photos of the struggle and its leaders adorn the walls of his office, turning them into a historical mosaic.\n\nAt the time we met, we could not have known that eerily similar images would soon be emerging from a small Missouri town after a white police officer killed an unarmed black teen, prompting protests and a virulent response from law enforcement that included tear gas, tanks and rubber bullets.\n\nLast night, Lewis marched with demonstrators in Atlanta who were supporting protestors in Ferguson, Mo. We were unable to speak with Lewis about the situation in Ferguson, but parts of this Q&A seem prescient in how they reveal the ways in which, despite great progress, race remains an open wound in this country.\n\nQ: You had left college to start working on civil rights. In 1964, you traveled across the country to convince other students to do the same thing. The students who ended up coming were largely white; they were leading more privileged, safe lives. How did you convince these students to give up the relative safety of where they were to come to what was one of the most dangerous places?\n\nA: During the summer of 1964, SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, along with the NAACP in Mississippi and CORE launched Mississippi Freedom Summer, to urge African Americans to become participants in the Democratic process, to register to vote. As you well know, in 1964, the state of Mississippi had a black voting age population of more than 450,000 and only about 16,000 blacks were registered to vote. Many people of color lived in fear. People had been arrested, jailed, beaten. Emmett Till had been lynched. People had been murdered. Medgar Evers had been assassinated in 1963. Mississippi was a dangerous place. I grew up in rural Alabama and Alabama was bad but we all saw Mississippi was worse.\n\nI visited Mississippi for the first time in May of 1961, going on the Freedom Rides. (I was) arrested, jailed, in a city jail, the county jail, and later taken to the state penitentiary at Parchment. I knew or had some idea of what we were getting involved with. It was dangerous, very dangerous, but we had to go there. And we convinced students, young people, religious leaders and others to support an effort and people responded.\n\nQ: What did you say, though, when you were going to visit these campuses, to convince people to leave that behind to come join the fight?\n\nA: Well, the issue of civil rights, it was the issue to deal with. We had had the March on Washington in 1963. These young people, these students, had witnessed the march and some had participated in the march. Many of these young people knew what happened in Birmingham during the spring of 1963. Bull Connor used dogs and fire hoses on children and women. So, it was not hard to convince young people, to convince students and religious leaders to come to Mississippi.\n\nThey responded. We kept saying the vote is precious, the vote is important. I had said earlier, on Aug. 28, 1963, when I spoke at the March on Washington, I made the statement after seeing an article in The New York Times concerning women in southern Africa attempting to register to vote and participate in the political process, and I said something like, \"One man, one vote is the African cry. It is ours too; it must be ours.\"\n\nAnd that became the rallying cry for the young people in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. All across America, on college campuses where we had friends of SNCC, people were wearing the buttons saying \"One Man, One Vote.\" It was on our letterhead, it was on posters, so people knew something about this idea of getting people to register to vote and they wanted to be part of it.\n\nWe knew by appealing to students and saying we need at least 1,000 students to come. And you're right the great majority of the young people were white and they came from the North. But some white Southerners participated and many black students came from southern schools and from southern communities and from places like Howard (University) and Fisk University and Tennessee State University. As a matter of fact, two Japanese students... came from Canada and worked on the summer and later became SNCC volunteers in the South. So it was black and white, Latinos and Asians that participated in the Mississippi Freedom Summer.\n\nQ: You yourself were a child of sharecroppers who sacrificed so that you could go to college. How were you able to make the decision that you were willing to leave college for a period of time to fight for civil rights?\n\nA: Well, it was important. It was important. Growing up in rural Alabama, 50 miles from Montgomery, I saw the signs and symbols of segregation and racial discrimination - I didn't like it. I had been deeply inspired by the action of Rosa Parks, the word and leadership of Martin Luther King Jr. I had heard about Emmett Till, when I was 15 years old in 1955, and I kept thinking that this could be one of my first cousins traveling from Buffalo, N.Y., to rural Alabama during the summer of 1955. So it was Emmett Till, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., the Little Rock Nine, all sort of inspired me to find a way to do something. And when I had an opportunity, had a chance, and became the chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, I made a commitment to do everything possible to end discrimination and end segregation.\n\nQ: A lot of people saw things they didn't like, and weren't able to or didn't actually do anything. What was the difference for you?\n\nA: I became as someone growing up very, very poor in rural Alabama and seeing how people were being treated simply because of the color of their skin, and I saw the signs, I saw the photographs. That said to me, \"You have to do something.\"\n\nRead the Kindle Single\n\nI heard Martin Luther King Jr. speaking on the old radio and it seemed like Dr. King was speaking directly to me, saying, \"John Robert Lewis, you too can do something. You can make a contribution.\"\n\nI met Rosa Parks, at a young age, I met Dr. King at a young age. It changed my life. And set me on a path.\n\nQ: Where did you meet them?\n\nA: I met Rosa Parks in Nashville, Tenn., as a student there in '57 at the age of 17. The next year in 1958, I met Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery in the First Baptist Church, pastored by his colleague, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy.\n\nI had sought his counsel, his help. I wrote him a letter before going off to college. I wanted to attend a little school called Troy State College, it's now called Troy University, only 10 miles from my home. I submitted my application, my high school transcripts. I never heard a word from the college. So I wrote a letter to Dr. King. I did not tell my mother and my father, any of my sisters or my brothers, or any of my teachers.\n\nDr. King wrote me back, sent me a round-trip Greyhound bus ticket and invited me to come to Montgomery to meet with him. And I remember that Saturday morning, in March of 1958, a young lawyer, a young African-American lawyer - (I'd) never met a lawyer before, black or white - a man by the name of Fred Gray.\n\nQ: I've met Mr. Gray.\n\nA: He was a wonderful man. (He) met me at the Greyhound bus station in downtown Montgomery, and drove me to the First Baptist Church... and ushered me into the pastor's study, and I saw Dr. King and Ralph Abernathy standing behind a desk. And Dr. King said, \"Are you the boy from Troy? Are you John Lewis?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Dr. King, I am John Robert Lewis.\" I gave him my whole name, and that was the beginning. I often think if it hadn't been for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I don't know what would have happened to me.\n\nAfter the discussion with him telling me what could happen if I decided to insist on going to Troy State, that my family home could be bombed or burned, they could lose the farm that they had bought by then and I went back and had a discussion with my folks, telling them that Dr. King said we may have to file a suit against the state of Alabama, against Troy State College, and what could happen. And they were so afraid they didn't want to have anything to do with it. So I continued to study in Nashville. It was in Nashville that I met a gentleman by the name of Jim Lawson, James Lawson, who became our teacher. He taught us the way of peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence. So a small group of students from Vanderbilt University, Peabody College, Fisk University, Tennessee State, Meharry Medical School, and American Baptist College met every Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m.\n\nAnd we studied what Gandhi attempted to do in South Africa, what he accomplished in India. We studied Thoreau and civil disobedience. We studied the great religions of the world. We studied what Dr. King was all about in Montgomery. And in the fall and winter of 1959, we had what we called test sit-ins at the lunch counters and restaurants. And then by February after the sit-ins started in Greensboro, N.C., Feb. 1, 1960, we started sitting in on a regular basis.\n\nAnd I was one of the early participants, one of the first participants as a matter of fact. We would be sitting there in an orderly, peaceful, nonviolent fashion waiting to be served, some black and white college students, and someone would come up and spit on us, or put a lighted cigarette out on our hair or down our backs, pour hot water or hot coffee on us, and we would look straight ahead and continue to sit. And that went on for a whole month and then on Feb. 27 I got arrested with 89 students. That was my first arrest.\n\nI got in what I call good trouble and necessary trouble and I've been getting in trouble ever since.\n\nI felt free. I felt liberated. And I couldn't turn back. So as my parents, grandparents and great grandparents had said, \"Don't get in trouble, don't get in the way.\" I got in trouble, I got in what I call good trouble and necessary trouble and I've been getting in trouble ever since.\n\nMississippi Summer just didn't happen. It was this build up. See, during early summer and late summer of 1961, almost 400 of us had gone to jail. We filled the city jail in Jackson, the county jail in Jackson, and then the state penitentiary in Parchmont. So many of these young people and religious leaders who had left Mississippi went to other parts of the country, so three years later when we started talking about Mississippi Freedom Summer, there was a reservoir of goodwill towards being involved, helping to change that state, and in doing so, we were helping to change the South.\n\nQ: I was reading some of the old SNCC material and correspondence leading up to Freedom Summer, and one of the things they'd said was all of the efforts there had failed to crack Mississippi. There was this feeling that all these things that had been tried in other places were not succeeding in Mississippi and you even said if we crack Mississippi we'll likely be able to crack the system in the rest of the country. Why was Mississippi so difficult?\n\nA: In the state of Mississippi, I think there was state-sanctioned violence against nonviolent participants in the movement. You had something there called the State Sovereignty Commission. They kept files, they kept records. People would show up at meetings, they would take down their license plates, check on them. So there was fear, a tremendous amount of fear. And we felt as (Freedom Summer organizer) Bob Moses said from time to time, we have to bring the nation to Mississippi. We have to make what Dr. King's father, Daddy King, would say, \"We have to make it plain.\" We have to put the light.\n\nMississippi was a closed society and we had to open it up. We had to put a spotlight on it. And that's what we did.\n\nQ: You said if it hadn't been for Freedom Summer, there would be no Barack Obama. Talk to me about that.\n\nA: I believe that. Mississippi Freedom Summer not only had changed the South and Mississippi, but it helped change the nation. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, that came out of Freedom Summer, the testimony of Fannie Lou Hamer, testifying before the Democratic credentials committee at the convention in Atlantic City in 1964 helped educate and sensitize America. And because of what happened in Freedom Summer, the education, the organizing effort, and sadly the murder of the three civil rights workers, it was painful. And I say to people today, these three young men were not murdered in the Middle East or Eastern Europe, Africa or Asia, or Central or South America, but they were murdered right here in America. And in a real sense, they must be looked up on as the founding fathers of a new America.\n\nWhat happened to them pricked the conscience of America, but the African-American community in the state of Mississippi probably became more politically aware, more politically assertive and more politically organized than any other group. When we went to Atlantic City it was an organized effort, people knew why they were standing up and fighting and taking that long trip, from the heart of the Delta in Mississippi, from Jackson, or other parts of the state to Atlantic City and because of that, three brave and courageous women, black women, Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie Devine, Victoria Gray, challenged the seating of the Mississippi congressional delegation. And all of that helped to educate, not just people in Mississippi and other parts of the South, but people in the nation.\n\nSelma came a year later, but Mississippi helped lay the foundation for Selma. So, if it hadn't have been for Mississippi, and Selma and Mississippi Freedom Summer, put it all together, I don't think Bill Clinton would have been elected, I don't think Jimmy Carter would have been elected. Barack Obama wouldn't be president of the United States.\n\nQ: We know that the majority of white voters did not vote for Barack Obama. He was elected by a coalition of voters of color and white voters and that in this last election, black voter participation was actually the highest of any group. It seems like there is a direct line there, that you couldn't see those levels of black voting participation if you hadn't had all of these things that we just talked about.\n\nA: It all is part of a continuum. People have been told, black people and young people wouldn't get out and vote in the last election. They kept saying they are not going to vote, they are not going to vote. And they did turn out and they did vote.\n\nBecause people understood so well that people suffered. I remember being in Ohio, the Sunday before the election... and then going to an early voting site where people were standing in line and I kept saying, \"Don't forget the three civil rights workers. Don't forget the bridge in Selma.\"\n\nAnd the young people, black and white, got it. One thing about the African-American community - I don't need to tell you this - but if you go to a state like Mississippi and then you go to a city like Chicago, so many of the families can be traced back to Mississippi. If you go to Detroit, many of the families can be traced back to Alabama. So people understand that. They get it. And a tremendous amount of the support that we received during Mississippi summer came from the African American churches based in Chicago, based in Alabama and other parts of the South. And many of the young people that had been in Mississippi during the summer of 1964 came to Selma during the spring and summer of 1965. They related to what was happening.\n\nA lot of people convinced their parents and their grandparents to cast their lot with Obama. I kept hearing people saying to me, \"My son, my daughter, my grandchildren said 'You've got to vote for Barack Obama.'\"\n\nQ: You got very fiery after the Supreme Court ruled on the Voting Rights Act last year. You, of anyone, understand the cost paid to get the Voting Rights Act passed and why it was so important. How did it feel the Supreme Court used the success of the act to rule against it?\n\nA: It was unreal. It is unbelievable. When I heard about the decision, I had a sense of righteous indignation. I wanted to cry, but the tears just didn't come.\n\nI have said on many occasions that the vote is precious. It's almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument that we have in a democratic society. And every citizen must be able to use that vote, and when they register and then vote, their vote must be counted.\n\nPeople gave a little blood and some people gave their very lives. I gave a little blood on the bridge in Selma and I almost died for the right of all of our citizens to become participants in the democratic process.\n\nToday in a state like Mississippi, because of Freedom Summer and because of the Voting Rights Act, that state has the highest number of African-American elected officials than any state. And if the state were redistricted fairly, in a democratic fashion, there would be several African-American members of the House of Representatives.\n\nWhen I heard about the decision, I had a sense of righteous indignation. I wanted to cry, but the tears just didn't come.\n\nQ: What do you mean by that, if it were redistricted fairly?\n\nA: In the state of Mississippi, as in so many parts of America, we've had gerrymandering, the drawing of the lines in a way to make it almost impossible for certain people to become elected. They are packing a large percentage of people of a certain race or color in a single district.\n\nQ: Where do efforts to rewrite the Voting Rights Act in a way the Supreme Court would find amenable stand?\n\nA: Today we have a piece of legislation pending that has been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. We don't at this time have enough members. We are going to continue to work and it is my hope that when we come back in the next congress we will be able to get that support and get it passed through committees and get it on the floor of the House and get it through the Senate.\n\nQ: What is the main thing keeping enough congressman and women from supporting it?\n\nA: I think people from the other side are somewhat reluctant to do anything before this next election. They have to get this election behind them and then (we'll) do our very best to get the great majority of members on both sides of the aisle from the House to pass it. We pass it on the House side, the Senate will follow.\n\nQ: We've seen a rise in laws considered by some to be voter suppression laws, we see what's going on with Moral Mondays in North Carolina, and other actions people see as rolling back civil rights gains. I asked my Twitter followers in light of this, what would they like me to ask you. One question I received is whether there is a need for another Freedom Summer.\n\nA: There is an ongoing need for another Freedom Summer. We need to organize, to mobilize another generation of people and not just young people, not just college students, to get out there and organize and mobilize and register and empower those who need to be registering to vote. If we fail to do it, we can go backwards. We have made too much progress to go backwards or to stand still. We must move forward.\n\nDirect action is always effective. When you see people standing up, standing in, when you see people marching in an orderly, peaceful, nonviolent fashion - and we did march in Mississippi, we did walk, we did get arrested and go to jail in an orderly, peaceful, nonviolent fashion - there is not anything more powerful than finding a way to make it plain. To make it simple.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nProPublica's Nikole Hannah-Jones has spent the last two years exploring race in America .

But the statute at the center of his administration's policy is the work of Republicans - with origins dating back all the way to World War I - albeit with substantial Democratic support along the way. Known originally as the \"Undesirable Aliens Act,\" the statute would not exist without support from, respectively, a eugenicist and a white supremacist.\n\nThe law in question was the foundation of a memo Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued in early April that laid out the administration's new, zero-tolerance policy. In the memo, Sessions instructed federal prosecutors in the southwestern United States to file criminal charges against any adults caught entering the country illegally. His order stripped officials of discretion over whether to place migrant families seeking asylum into civil proceedings, which allow families to stay together. (Court rulings limit how long the government can detain migrants in civil proceedings. There's also no guarantee they'll return for future hearing dates once they're let out, a phenomenon that has prompted the president's complaints about \"catch and release.\")\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nOn Monday, ProPublica published audio recorded at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facility in which a Border Patrol agent mocks the wails of migrant children as young as 4. Liberals and conservatives alike have condemned the policy, calling it \"cruel,\" an \"atrocity,\" and \"inconsistent with our American values.\"\n\nTop Trump administration officials have held their ground. \"We are enforcing the laws passed by Congress,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen asserted Monday. Her message echoed one Sessions had delivered to law enforcement officers in Indiana last week. \"If you violate the law, you subject yourself to prosecution,\" he said .\n\nThe federal law they say they are enforcing makes it a crime for foreign citizens to cross (or attempt to cross) the border into the U.S. anywhere other than an official port of entry. A first offense is a misdemeanor; a second unlawful entry is a felony.\n\nThe law's ancestry dates back to World War I. Till that point, U.S. immigration laws had tended to be all or nothing: either no limits at all - or blanket bans for certain groups, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act. Others were free to enter provided they weren't \"lunatics,\" polygamists, prostitutes, \"suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease,\" or so on .\n\nThe result was floods of immigrants: Between 1901 and 1910, for example, close to 9 million came to the U.S. As that happened, anti-immigrant attitudes mounted, with mass influxes from parts of Europe associated in the popular imagination with a litany of social problems, like urban poverty and squalor.\n\nProPublica has obtained audio from inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, in which children can be heard wailing as an agent jokes, \"We have an orchestra here.\"\n\nA reporter turned on the audio recording as Kirstjen Nielsen defended the Trump administration's immigration policies at a White House briefing.\n\nIn May 1918, after the U.S. had entered World War I, Congress passed a statute called the Passport Act that gave the president the power to restrict the comings and goings of foreign citizens during wartime. A few months later, however, the war ended - and with it, the restrictions on border crossings.\n\nFederal officials saw potential in the criminal provisions of the Passport Act - a maximum 20-year sentence - as a tool for deterring immigration. So prosecutors ignored the expiration of the law and continued to indict migrants under the Passport Act for unlawful entry into the U.S.\n\nAnti-immigration sentiment continued to climb and the rhetoric of the era has resonance today. One anti-immigration group at the time claimed that immigrants tended to be \"vicious and criminal\" - the \"bootleggers, gangsters, and racketeers of large cities.\" The war, Columbia University historian Mae Ngai has written, \"raised nationalism and anti-foreign sentiment to a high pitch.\"\n\nIn response, Congress began clamping down. With the Immigration Act of 1924, it capped the flow at about 165,000 people a year, a small fraction of previous levels The statute's quotas curtailed migration from southern and eastern Europe severely. Another 1924 law - the Oriental Exclusion Act - banned most immigration from Asia. At the same time, Congress made it easier to deport non-citizens for immigration violations.\n\nIn 1925, a federal appeals court put a halt to the practice of indicting migrants under the Passport Act outside wartime. But immigration officials liked what they'd seen, and by 1927, they were working on a replacement.\n\nTwo men spearheaded the effort that would lead Congress to criminalize unlawful entry into the United States. They were motivated by eugenics and white supremacy.\n\nThe first was James Davis , who was Secretary of Labor from 1921 to 1930. A Republican originally appointed by President Warren Harding, Davis was himself an immigrant from Wales who went by \"Puddler Jim,\" a reference to his job as a youthful worker in the steel mills of western Pennsylvania. At the time, the Department of Labor oversaw immigration, and Davis had grown disturbed by what he'd seen.\n\nDavis was a committed eugenicist, and he believed principles of eugenics should guide immigration policy, according to The Bully Pulpit and the Melting Pot by the historian Hans Vought. It was necessary to draw a distinction, Davis had written in 1923, between \"bad stock and good stock, weak blood and strong blood, sound heredity and sickly human stuff.\"\n\nIn November 1927, Davis proposed a set of immigration reforms in the pages of The New York Times. Among his goals: \"the definite lessening and possibly, in time, the complete checking of the degenerate and the bearer of degenerates.\" One \"phase of the immigration problem,\" Davis wrote, was the \"surreptitious entry of aliens\" into the United States in numbers that \"cannot even be approximately estimated.\"\n\nDeportation alone wasn't enough to deter illegal immigration, Davis wrote. There was nothing disincentivizing the migrant from turning around and trying again. \"Endeavoring to stop this law violation\" by deportation only, he wrote, \"is like trying to prevent burglary with a penalty no severer than opening the front door of the burglarized residence, should the burglar be found within, escorting him to it, and saying 'You have no right here; see that you don't come in again.'\"\n\nAn immigrant who enters the country unlawfully, he concluded, \"should be treated as a law violator and punished effectively.\"\n\nTo bring his vision to fruition, Davis teamed up with a senator from South Carolina. Coleman Livingston Blease, a Democrat, was \"a proud and unreconstructed white supremacist,\" UCLA history professor Kelly Lytle Hernández wrote in her 2017 book City of Inmates.\n\nMigrants from Mexico were one group whose numbers the increasingly powerful nativist elements in Congress hadn't managed to restrict. Mexican workers were key to the booming economy of the southwest. Regional employers, particularly in the agricultural sector, had successfully lobbied Congress to block any bill that would choke off their primary source of inexpensive labor. As a result, migration from Mexico soared, with many Mexicans making illegal border crossings to avoid the cost and inconvenience of customs stations.\n\nBlease saw in Davis's proposal for criminal penalties a way to advance his vision of a white America, and he believed it would bridge the gap between the nativists clamoring for quotas and southwestern congressmen resisting them. Large-scale farmers didn't mind criminal penalties, Hernández writes, so long as the law was enforced once the harvest was over.\n\nThe legislation wasn't without its opponents, as the UCLA law professor Ingrid Eagly documented in a 2010 study of immigration prosecutions. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill. The ACLU felt it was unfair and unlikely to deter migration. An immigrant \"may be quite ignorant of this law before he starts on his journey,\" the group told Congress.\n\nDespite the ACLU's objections, a Republican-controlled Congress passed Davis and Blease's bill in 1929. A Republican president, Herbert Hoover, signed it into law.\n\nThe law made it a crime to enter the United States unlawfully and, in so doing, \"created the criminalization of the border,\" Eagly said.\n\nThe statute was swiftly put to use. Between July 1929 and June 1930, according to a Department of Labor report , prosecutors brought more than 6,000 unlawful entry cases. \"It is believed that it will prove an effective deterrent,\" the report's author wrote. (In his recent memo, Sessions made similar claims about the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy.)\n\nBut the law didn't reduce migration. By 1933, the Labor Department concluded that its rosy outlook had been wrong. The 1929 law \"does not seem to have the deterrent effect expected,\" noted a Labor Department report published that year.\n\nIt blamed budget limitations and judges wary of meting out serious sentences if a defendant was going to be deported anyway.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Great Depression achieved what prosecutions and deportations had not. Immigration plunged as the labor market in the United States dried up. Prosecutions for unlawful entry dropped to about 5,000 a year, according to a 2012 examination of the law by Doug Keller in the Loyola University Chicago Law Journal.\n\nA shortage of labor during World War II prompted the U.S. to reverse course and encourage migration of temporary workers from Mexico through what it called the Bracero program. (The word refers to manual laborers in Spanish.)\n\nDespite the earlier lessons, federal prosecutors began to focus their attention on bringing unlawful entry cases against Mexican migrants to deter workers from going around the Bracero program. By 1951, there were 15,000 illegal entry and re-entry prosecutions a year.\n\nAt the same time, Congress was working to overhaul American immigration law. The effort was spearheaded by two Democrats: Sen. Patrick McCarran and Rep. Francis Walter. Both were staunch anti-Communists who saw immigration - particularly from Eastern Europe and Asia - as posing a risk that Soviet or Maoist agents would infiltrate the country.\n\nTheir law is best known for preserving a quota system that meant about 85 percent of immigration visas annually went to people from northern and western Europe. But it also made a crucial change in the unlawful entry law.\n\nIn a counterintuitive move, Congress decided to reduce the penalties for unlawful entry - to a maximum of six months in prison. (It also added a felony provision for any additional illegal entry convictions.)\n\nThe change wasn't driven by compassion or a shift away from criminalizing unlawful immigration. Rather, it anticipated the creation of federal magistrate courts that would handle the cases, according to Eagly, the UCLA law professor. A defendant facing a misdemeanor charge punishable by six months or less generally doesn't have a right to a grand jury indictment or a jury trial. Once Congress established federal magistrate courts, prosecutors could bring criminal charges against far larger numbers of defendants.\n\nA Democratic-controlled Congress passed the law in 1952, but it was vetoed by President Harry Truman. His veto message decried \"carrying over into this year of 1952 the isolationist limitations of our 1924 law.\" Congress was unmoved and overrode his veto. (In this sense, Trump is correct that Democrats bear some responsibility for the unlawful entry law that underlies his administration's new immigration policy.)\n\nThe unlawful entry statute has remained largely unchanged since 1952. In 1968, however, Congress finally passed a law establishing federal magistrate courts, allowing for a major expansion of charges under the unlawful entry law. Without the need to go through the grand jury process or deal with potential jury trials, immigration prosecutions - almost all for unlawful entry - shot up, Eagly found in her 2010 study: from 2,536 cases nationwide in 1968 to 17,858 in 1974.\n\nThe trend culminated in programs like Operation Streamline during the George W. Bush administration, in which magistrate judges along the border took simultaneous mass guilty pleas for unlawful entry. (An appeals court ended the practice in 2009.)\n\nThe use of the law hasn't been a partisan matter. The number of such cases spiked to nearly 50,000 in the last year of the Bush administration, and it stayed in that range for most of the Obama administration, according to federal government data maintained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. By 2016, the number had fallen to about 35,000 - still higher than all but the last year of the Bush administration.\n\nBut the number of unlawful entry cases fell, the TRAC data shows, during Trump's first year in office, to 27,000 . (It had begun to rise again in recent months, however, even before Sessions announced the administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy.) Convictions for immigration crimes now account for more than half of all federal criminal convictions.\n\nFiled under:\n\nIan MacDougall\n\nIan MacDougall is a contributing reporter at ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\n\"The Wire\" creator and former Baltimore Sun reporter talks about a historic public housing fight, race and what makes white people go \"batshit, batshit crazy.\"\n\nby Marcelo Rochabrun\n\nDavid Simon's new HBO miniseries \" Show Me a Hero ,\" which premiered last Sunday, is the harrowing tale of a hopeless battle. Based on a nonfiction book of the same title - written by former New York Times reporter Lisa Belkin - the show dramatizes the real fight that took place 25 years ago in Yonkers, New York, after a federal judge ordered public housing projects to be built in the wealthier (and whiter) parts of the city.\n\nMichael Brown beat the odds by graduating from high school before his death - odds that remain stacked against black students in St. Louis and the rest of the country. Read the story.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, David Simon discussed the legacy of the Yonkers crisis and what desegregation is all about. The transcript has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nYou said that you thought about this show many years ago. How has the project changed over time?\n\nVery little, sadly. We optioned this book shortly after it came out [in 1999], and we were fairly certain that the dynamic of hyper-segregation was a national dynamic, that we were not just writing a story about Yonkers.\n\nWhat do you mean by hyper-segregation?\n\nWhite people, by and large, are not very good at sharing physical space or power or many other kinds of social dynamics with significant numbers of people of color. It's been documented time and time again. There is a great book by Andrew Hacker called \"Two Nations.\" My God, it's almost a quarter century old, but it is an incredible primer on just how specific the desire of white America is to remain in a hyper-majority.\n\nThe reason we wanted [Lisa Belkin's] book was that Yonkers was a place where the housing department actually got the housing right. They didn't overwhelm the neighborhood with a massive project or hundreds of walk-up units. They were trying to do scattered-site housing for the first time, which has been this quiet revolution in public housing. It works, it doesn't destabilize neighborhoods. But you were dealing with people who were entrenched behind the same fears as previous generations....\n\nThis project kept getting bumped a little bit to the back burner but every time we bumped it, in talking about it with the HBO executives, we'd say, \"You know what, look, it just happened to Baltimore.\" They tried to do the same thing with scattered housing in eastern Baltimore County, and the white folks went batshit, batshit crazy. At every point, there was a new fresh example that the dynamic was still there, that the racial pathology was still intact. And I think it has only become more pronounced. The show was greenlit before Ferguson, before Baltimore, before Charleston.\n\nIf you had written the screenplay after these events, would you have changed anything?\n\nNo, no. First of all, \"Show Me a Hero\" is not about police violence. It's certainly not about a white racist backlash against changing demographics, which is how I would characterize the Charleston or Lafayette shootings. Part of the implied power of the piece is we are taking you back 25 years and nothing has changed!\n\nLisa Belkin wrote an op-ed in The New York Times a few days ago saying she viewed Yonkers, at the time when she was doing her reporting, as a place of hope. She expected desegregation to happen around the United States as a result. That didn't happen. The NAACP didn't pursue the same cases anywhere else.\n\nNor did the Justice Department because of horrible resources.\n\nWhy do you think that happened?\n\nBecause of how blistering Yonkers was, how insanely volatile and irrational Yonkers was. You have to remember that this case was brought at the end of the Carter administration. There wasn't a single civil rights action filed by the Justice Department from 1980 to 1988 that mattered. Reagan effectively shut down the civil rights division of the DOJ. Then you had Clinton, who was doing everything he could during the Gingrich years to maneuver to the center. The reason you didn't have aggressive use of this legal precedent under Clinton is the same reason you have those omnibus crime bills that filled up prisons as fast as we can construct them. Bill Clinton's triangulation with the political center made things like fair housing prohibitive for his political priorities.\n\nWe haven't seen any movement on this in any presidential administration until the last two years of Obama. They sort of opened the books on all their data to basically encourage the use of the Fair Housing Act to do precisely what they did in Yonkers. But notice that this is coming in the last two years of the administration, and it's coming as an administrative act.\n\nIn the show, no one really wants the housing either. The NAACP is already tired of the whole ordeal before any units were built.\n\nYou have to remember, they filed the case in ['80]. It was litigated. They are now in 1987, and they can't get the goddamn city to name a geographic site to build house No. 1...\n\nBut the truth is, the 200 units were built. They are still there, and there has been no increase in crime in those neighborhoods as a result of it. There has been no substantive decrease in the housing values in Yonkers. There was a brief dip as there was some fundamental white flight, mostly surrounding the school desegregation portion of the civil rights suit, which is a whole other can of worms.\n\nThe population in Yonkers is now probably about 56 percent white, 44 percent people of color, heavily Latino. A lot of people, with a certain amount of unknowing racial malevolence, say \"oh, look, it was 80-20 white, now it's almost 50 percent people of color. See what happens? Look at all that white flight.\" But in 25 years, the population of the New York metropolitan area has been transformed.\n\nWhat desegregation is about is not about keeping Yonkers 80-20 or 75-25. This is about the browning of America. We are becoming a less white country. The trick is, can we become more brown without destabilizing ourselves and without having gated white communities and ghettos?\n\nDid you hear from current residents as you were filming?\n\nWe talked to all the people in the book, some of whom are still living in those townhouses. I mean, did I go take a poll of random people in Yonkers? No. But every time we set up and started filming, people would come over, and we talked to people who were unrelenting in their belief that what was done was illegal and that the judge had no right to do this and that it was an affront to their freedom and their liberty. They would come and tell us that, and we'd say \"well, okay...\"\n\nDid anyone object to you filming at, for example, the actual city hall of Yonkers? Or that this could reopen wounds?\n\nNo, the mayor appeared with us in Yonkers. I'm sure there are people who didn't want to see the story made at all. But, you know, I'm not used to making shows that everyone agrees with, so I wouldn't know what that would feel like anyway.\n\nWith two episodes down, is there anything that viewers should remember, have in mind, when they watch the next two on Sunday?\n\nI certainly don't want to tell people what to watch until they watch it. Just that we were very true to the history. This is all predicated upon a 40-year history of American government at the federal, state and local level using public money to purposefully hyper-segregate our society. Poor people didn't end up all packed into housing projects in one square mile of Yonkers by accident. It was a plan. It was a plan in Chicago, in Baltimore, in Dallas and everywhere that took federal housing money since the 1930s.\n\nThe records, the history of it is in plain sight. I have nothing but contempt for anybody who says that [the racial integration of Yonkers] was social engineering by this judge. Really? You want to parse it that way? What bullshit. The social engineering begins in the 1930s, with FHA mortgages and with the first public housing monies in the New Deal. Republicans and Democrats are both complicit.\n\nThe idea that the social engineering starts at the moment that somebody might want to restore somebody to their full civil rights, 40 years into the rigged game. And that's when you object? Sorry, that's racist to begin your argument there.\n\nMarcelo Rochabrun\n\nMarcelo Rochabrun is a senior reporting fellow at ProPublica, where he covers immigration.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "ProPublica\n\nGeorgetown University history professor Michael Kazin is seated among the students for his class, \"U.S. in the 1960s.\" He has surrendered his stage today to Dorie Ladner, 72, who is talking with the class about her years in Mississippi working to desegregate buses as a Freedom Rider, and her experiences organizing Freedom Summer in 1964.\n\nThe names of many of Freedom Summer's martyrs and survivors flutter by quickly in her lecture. At least twice she mentions the name Marion Barry, an organizer in Mississippi before later becoming mayor of Washington D.C., and it seems to whiz past the students each time.\n\nGhosts of Greenwood\n\nA Brutal Loss, but an Enduring Conviction\n\nWhen Freedom Summer Landed in White America's Living Rooms\n\nA Freedom Summer Legend Looks Back\n\nA Son of Mississippi Considers His Legacy on Race\n\nNear the end of Ladner's visit, a student asks how the movement ended.\n\n\"It hasn't ended,\" says Ladner.\n\nLadner knows this in more than an academic sense. She helped coordinate a great number of the civil rights sit-ins leading up to Freedom Summer, and she participated in every major civil rights march from 1963 to 1968. Her work started in the early 1960s with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), with which she helped desegregate lunch counters and buses. She was a founding member of the Council of Federated Organizations, or COFO, the umbrella organization covering SNCC, the NAACP, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1962.\n\nHer sister, Joyce Ladner, younger by just a year, also worked with these critical civil rights organizations and built on that experience to later author a considerable block of scholarship on African-American girls and black leadership. She went on to serve as president of Howard University in D.C. in the late '90s, and then as a senior fellow in the Brookings Institution's government studies program.\n\nDorie Ladner, meanwhile, kept the spirit of Freedom Summer alive by continuing to mobilize around social justice and through her work with the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta.\n\nThe sisters are living proof that the movement hasn't ended. It's for this reason that I reached out to them to talk about how the lessons of Freedom Summer apply today, when the voting rights they fought for seem to so many to be crumbling.\n\nDorie Ladner likes to speak about the difficult choices and sacrifices she and her colleagues made to develop those sit-ins and Freedom Rides into an effective movement. One of those decisions involved drawing white activists down from the North to help with the Freedom Summer voter registration drives - a decision that some of her SNCC and COFO colleagues didn't view favorably.\n\nBut there were few alternatives, a fact Dorie's sister Joyce is quick to hammer home. Joyce said recruiting white Northerners for Freedom Summer was absolutely necessary in the face of the violence, the Klu Klux Klan, the police, the dogs, the fire hoses, the bullet that took Medgar Evers's life in front of his family - the terror.\n\n\"We were really playing guerilla warfare,\" says Joyce. \"It was like we just kept putting out fires, but the violence kept coming down harder, and it was getting harder to get people to vote.\"\n\nWhen not facing off with armed Klan members, the Ladners and their freedom fighter colleagues also had to contend with the county voter registrars, who put up any barrier they could to keep African Americans from the ballot box. They clashed with the registrars not only as activists but also as citizens trying to vote themselves. Joyce tells me she tried to vote three times, but without success.\n\n\"I couldn't pass the literacy test,\" she said.\n\nAt the time, she was a senior at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, which Dorie had attended, too, before dropping out to join the freedom struggle full time. Both were well-read, but the literacy tests weren't about comprehending words on the page.\n\n\"It's not that they were difficult, it's just that your skin color determined that you wouldn't pass,\" said Joyce. \"White people didn't have to take them. The registrars failed just about every black person who came before them. I knew I was much better educated and read than most white people in Mississippi, but the registrar was asking me thing likes how many grains of sand were in this jar.\"\n\nIt was like we just kept putting out fires, but the violence kept coming down harder.\n\nBy the end of Freedom Summer in 1964, many of their closest friends in the struggle - Lawrence Guyot , John Lewis , Fannie Lou Hamer , and others - had shed a great deal of blood in the long, often ugly campaign to have Congress finally pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The legislation put an end to the literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and many other acts of intimidation used to prevent black people from voting.\n\nBut racial discrimination didn't end. Dorie knew that it wouldn't, as she told me in a phone conversation back in February 2013. During that talk, she recalled hearing President Lyndon B. Johnson employ the civil rights slogan \"We shall overcome,\" to urge passage of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"I was cynical,\" she said. \"I accepted it, but deep down in my heart, I knew there was something about it that would not last.\"\n\nDorie's worry was not misplaced. A few months later, on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court delivered a crushing blow. In Shelby v. Holder , the court limited enforcement of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the protective clause that screened election laws for racial discrimination in formerly Jim Crow states. The justices noted that the Act was not meant to last forever, and that the country had made considerable progress in eradicating racism, particularly on the issues of the enfranchisement of black voters and the election of black officials.\n\n\"It's disappointing,\" Dorie said in a phone interview shortly after the Shelby ruling. \"But we have to mobilize. Congress is not going to do a damn thing (to change this), but the people will do something.\"\n\nWhile people of color are no longer subjected to the voting suppression devices outlawed by the Voting Rights Act, they have, over the decades, been subjected to more surreptitious maneuvers that some believe have been used to limit voting.\n\nCongress is not going to do a damn thing [...] but the people will do something.\n\nNew restrictive voting laws are slated to kick in over the next few years in 22 states that had no such things during the 2010 elections. Unless blocked by court challenges, burdensome voter identification laws requiring photo ID will take hold in North Carolina, where Section 5 might well have otherwise blocked them. A similarly restrictive voter ID law was reinstated last year in Texas , despite it being blocked by a Section 5 ruling just two years ago.\n\nIt's not just the photo ID requirements that many consider problematic. States have also passed laws to cut early voting, which black and Latino voters rely heavily upon, and to make voter registration more difficult. Most of these restrictions were passed in states that saw increases in minority turnout during the 2008 and 2012 elections. Civil rights groups are fighting the new restrictive voter laws in court in seven states: Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n\nIt promises to be a long, back-and-forth fight.\n\nOn Sept. 12, just last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reinstated a photo voter ID law in Wisconsin that could impact roughly 300,000 voters, mostly black and Latino. Meanwhile, a voter ID law passed by Texas in 2011 that some experts estimate could impact upwards of one million voters - again, mostly black and Latino - is on trial for the second time in the past three years. A legal fight over a voter ID law in Arkansas , is up next.\n\nThe Ladner sisters are well aware of all of these developments.\n\nIn 1964, the sisters pushed for whites to come help with the Freedom Summer voting-rights project, in part because they figured white activists would came some access to power.\n\nRead the Kindle Single\n\n\"Our view was that if the sons and daughters of the rich and powerful came and saw what was happening in Mississippi, they were able to call their congressmen and demand changes,\" said Joyce. \"I never had a congressman I could call.\"\n\nPressuring Congress has proven less effective these days, she says. \"Congress has been bought out. They only respond to whichever person or company is giving them the biggest campaign contribution.\"\n\nThe skepticism she holds was underscored by two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission , both of which enhanced the power of political money to influence elections.\n\n\"I'm very concerned about voter suppression today and that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act has been eradicated,\" Dorie said in her talk with the Georgetown students.\n\nIt's in such moments that Dorie likes to recall the musical group The Impressions, and the spirit at the heart of their song, \"Keep on Pushing.\"\n\n\"I will never give up this fight, and I'll do it until I die,\" she said at Georgetown. \"But it's kind of hard to have to keep doing this over and over and over again.\"\n\nThis story was co-published with Grist .\n\nBrentin Mock is the Justice Editor for Grist, where he writes about the intersections between civil rights and environmental/climate policy.

      "text": "The Fantasy of a Lily-White America\n\nI n 1970, two years and a couple days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Time magazine published a special issue on Black America . The cover was a Jacob Lawrence portrait of Jesse Jackson, against the backdrop of bright yellows and reds, seemingly poised to speak. His eyes sad, skeptical, and cautious. The special issue included an extended essay on Jackson and the shifting terrain of Black politics. Another addressed the militant and hopeful attitudes among African Americans as they recognized the unwillingness of white America \"to bend or change to accommodate black equality.\" In April of 1970, with grief still palpable, the editors of Time sought to examine the complexities of Black lives and politics in the face of the white backlash during the Nixon years. Race held center stage.\n\nBut it was an essay, \"What Would America Be Like Without Blacks,\" written by Ralph Ellison, the author of Invisible Man , and, later, published in his 1986 collection of essays, Going to the Territory , that struck a chord with me. I have been struggling with how to characterize our current national malaise, especially given the recent reporting about Donald Trump's plan to use civil rights laws to protect white people. It's easy to describe MAGA Republicans as racists or to talk about the white backlash and to decry the assault on American history and the manufactured panic around immigration. But something more fundamental about who we are as a nation (or who we refuse to be) is being revealed in this moment. Ellison maintained that \"whenever the nation grows weary of the struggle toward the ideal of American democratic equality,\" we reach for the illusion of secession- the fantasy of a lily-white America .\n\nThat fantasy, of course, involves not only the desire to rid the nation of Black and brown people, but aims to banish us and the issue of race from the nation's moral conscience. The likes of Jacob Lawrence or Ralph Ellison, for example, or even Dr. King and Jesse Jackson are reduced, by some today, to a mere footnote in the struggle for democracy. These political forces cast aside the creative tensions around race that have made the country what it is. In their hands, America's original sin is settled by the wishful effort to wash the nation clean.\n\nAnd we have seen this throughout the history of the country: from schemes during the antebellum period to send free Black people to Liberia to President Lincoln's insistence that free Blacks accept the colonization scheme because white people \"suffer from your presence\" to the lies of the Lost Cause and Redemption to American immigration law like the Immigration Act of 1924 that insisted that ours must remain a white nation to the clamoring around the border today and the bitter fights about what to teach our children in schools.\n\nThis is the tragic feature of American life: that seemingly inescapable petulance and moral fatigue that leads so many to put aside efforts to make real the promises of American democracy and, instead, find comfort and safety in the idea that this country belongs only to white people.\n\nI can imagine some of my liberal friends crying foul. That I have succumbed to cynicism-that I have forgotten about all those white people marching after the murder of George Floyd or those who voted for Obama. Actually, I am reminded of the life of Tom Watson in Georgia, who played a central role in the Georgia Populist Party and who, at one point in his life, found himself standing side-by-side with Black farmers defending them with arms only to become one of the most vicious racist in the south, or George Wallace, a moderate on race matters initially, but after losing an election declared \"I will never be out-niggered again.\" Or those in the 19 th century, like Walt Whitman, who opposed slavery but loathed the idea of Black citizens voting. Moral fatigue around the battle for racial equality in this country has often led to a retreat to the solidarity found in being white or, more modestly, in resigning oneself to the world as it is.\n\nNo matter Trump's bombast or his criminality the theater of his politics makes certain segments of white America feel good. His rallies offer a kind of catharsis and confirmation. Many who attend them are given license to express their hatreds and their fears. His popularity is not reducible to racism but born of it . He \"is like a boil bursting forth from the impurities in the bloodstream of [American] democracy.\"\n\nThreats of secession or fears of the Great Replacement that motivate so much of the vitriol behind the immigration debate all express the desire of \"getting shut\" of the problem-of ridding the country of \"the browns\" and \"the blacks\" that present a danger to the white Republic (the unwanted others who pollute our blood). That 'getting shut' isn't just about deportation, as the talk of overturning \"affirmative discrimination\" policies that disadvantage white Americans reveals, it is also about putting these people in their rightful place.\n\nIn 1970, Ellison examined this \"free-floating irrationality,\" what he called \"a national pathology.\"  The fantasy of a lily-white America showed that, deep down, most white Americans don't know who they really are. That when we think of this country apart from the distorting lens of race and racism, what comes into view is the extraordinary diversity and pluralism at the heart of America.\n\nFor Ellison, American popular culture betrays the lie that ours is a white nation. Perhaps Beyonce's country album, Cowboy Carter , does the same. From our language to our literature to our politics, the presence of diversity has given this country its distinctive pitch and frequency. To deny this is to deny who we are, leaving some susceptible to the comfort of lies that tell them they matter more than others because of the color of their skin.\n\nTrumpism, at its core, is the latest example of the fantasy of white America. We must say this explicitly and repeatedly, because it is at the root of the choice we face as a nation. That lie offers, as it always has, an easy resolution to the unsettling question of who we are as a nation. It leads some to believe they need \"illegals\" and \"niggers\" to feel fully American.\n\nSome fifty-plus years ago, Ralph Ellison worried that the nation's refusal to grasp the power of its soul -that \"expression of American diversity within unity..., the presence of a creative struggle against the realities of existence\"-would lead to a kind of \"moral slobbism\" that has always threatened to overrun this fragile experiment. We face that danger today. What is required of us, if we are to escape such a fate, is to reject the comfort of the fantasy of a lily-white Republic and, finally, discover who we really are as Americans and that will involve a full embrace of the diversity that makes this great country swing, Duke Ellington style.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Republicans Want a White Republic. They'll Destroy America to Get It\n\nW hen in a recent tweetstorm Donald Trump suggested that four Congresswomen of color leave the U.S. and \" go back \" to the \"totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,\" social media exploded. Outrage. Even some news outlets finally let go of the euphemisms and called the tweets \" racist .\" The Republicans, on the other hand, were quiet . As well they would be. The ideological demographics of the party dictated it.\n\nThe GOP's membership is nearly 90 percent white and can only envision carnage and extinction as it looks upon a rights-based, religious, racial and ideologically diverse America . Or, as Lindsey Graham had noted as early as 2012, \"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"\n\nIn short, the United States of America is not really their America. They yearn for a white republic. That's why they are fighting to recreate the days when, as Archie Bunker sang, \" Guys like us, we had it made .\" That's why they've willingly gone along with and participated in a sustained attack on the country itself, allowing it to grow weaker so that they could feel stronger.\n\nAlready, Trump and the Republicans have severely harmed the institutional heft of checks-and-balances . But they're not done. America's international reputation and influence rest on enormous economic and military strength, as well as the intangible but all-important \"soft power\" brought on by a robust democracy. All three pillars are necessary to sustain America's nearly global respect and position, yet - and this was the rub - all three are increasingly dependent on more than just whites in the United States to build and sustain. For white America to exist, America must die. And the Republicans have made their choice.\n\nIn their effort to restore a white America, the GOP had to wound the kind of multiracial democracy that not only elected Barack Obama to the presidency but enhanced America's global reputation . Republicans, therefore, set out to create an electorate that was disproportionately white and conservative. In Ohio , Florida , Wisconsin , Alabama , North Carolina and more than 20 additional states GOP policies targeted African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Native Americans, the young and the poor to keep them away from the ballot box. Republican governors and GOP-majority state legislatures deployed an array of voter-suppression tactics, including closing hundreds of polling stations in minority and low-income precincts, slashing early voting hours , reinstating poll taxes , mandating discriminatory voter ID laws and purging millions from the voter rolls.\n\nMeanwhile, before his death, Republican legislative mapmaker Thomas Hofeller set in place another key foundation for a white republic. He crafted extreme gerrymandered Congressional districts across the United States that violated the basic Constitutional concept of \" one person, one vote .\" His legislative maps diluted the electoral strength of large, racially diverse cities, and magnified the power of overwhelmingly white suburbs and sparsely populated rural areas. In North Carolina , for example, Hofeller's map meant that although Democrats won 50 percent of the vote in the 2018 election, they received only 23 percent of the Congressional seats . He also had devised a method to erase the electoral strength of the growing Hispanic population by rigging the Census in a way that would create legislative districts that, in his words, \" would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites ,\" and, by design, diminish the political voice of anyone else for at least a decade. (That effort was blocked by the Supreme Court.)\n\nThe dismantling of a robust, multiracial democracy requires not only acts of commission, such as the 5-4 Shelby County v. Holder decision by the conservatives on the Supreme Court to gut the Voting Rights Act, but sins of omission as well. Mitch McConnell's flat-out refusal to even engage legislation that would protect the nation's electoral infrastructure from hacking and foreign interference, despite solid evidence that it occurred in 2016, sends a clear signal that for his ilk this is not an American democracy worth protecting or saving.\n\nThe dangerous quest for a white republic is also undermining the U.S. military. When Trump came to power, there were more than 40,000 immigrants in uniform willing to fight and die for the United States. About 5,000 joined every year. The Department of Defense under this Administration, however, has either proposed or implemented policies that renege on promises of citizenship for immigrants in the armed services, issued directives that ban immigrants, even those with special language and medical skills , from serving and threatened to deport the families of those who are currently in the armed forces. Meanwhile, soldiers and sailors who are supposed to represent and defend all Americans have been seen proudly wearing MAGA caps and patches, even though racial and ethnic minorities \" made up 40% of Defense Department active-duty military in 2015.\" Not surprisingly, in 2018, the Army missed its recruiting goals and then had to lower its expectations for 2019, to avoid two consecutive years of failure.\n\nThe economic might of the United States has not been spared either. While much of the discussion on the economy and immigration has focused on the impact on the agricultural sector, the GOP's xenophobic policies are also taking a direct hit on higher education and the nation's capacity for and leadership in technological and scientific innovation. A 2013 report notes that international students enrolled in American universities accounted for \"70.3 percent of all full-time graduate students in electrical engineering, 63.2 percent in computer science, 60.4 percent in industrial engineering, and more than 50 percent in chemical, materials and mechanical engineering, as well as in economics (a non-STEM field).\" Those students bring the brainpower to innovation, research and technology. In fact, between May 2009 and May 2015, employment in STEM occupations grew by 10.5 percent , compared with 5.2 percent in non-STEM occupations. Nearly three-fourths of those employed in Silicon Valley tech companies are not American citizens. Yet, with the rise of Trump and his policies and rhetoric, U.S. higher education, which fuels this STEM growth, is simply not as attractive as it had been. After Trump came to office and launched the Muslim Ban, harangues to \"Build the Wall\" and disparaging comments about \"shithole countries,\" enrollment from international students dropped 5.5 percent in graduate programs and more than 6 percent in undergraduate programs at American universities.\n\nThe determination to build MAGA Land explains why what should be obvious tripwires - disrespecting military heroes; engaging in widespread corruption; cavorting with a communist dictator in North Korea and a journalist-killing authoritarian in Saudi Arabia; dodging multiple allegations of sexual assault, including rape; creating horrific scenes of White House-sponsored cruelty on the border; and believing Putin over our own intelligence agencies about Russian interference in the 2016 election - have all failed to dislodge one of the most unpopular presidents in recorded history. Put simply, because Trump promises Republicans a return to white dominance, he is more important to the GOP and its base than the country those in power took an oath to support and defend.\n\nTrump's vicious tweets have once again spurred a conversation about whether the President is racist, and the Republicans' relative silence has once again raised questions about why they refuse to condemn him (only four GOP members voted for a House resolution to do so). But to focus solely on this week's events, or even to look at Trump's many racist statements in the past, is to miss the bigger picture: The scurrilous attack on Representatives Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib was just part and parcel of a larger assault on America and the rich diversity and rights culture that are essential for true greatness.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "How Liberal White America Turned Its Back on James Baldwin in the 1960s\n\nIn discussions about race relations today, the works of James Baldwin continue to speak to the present, even decades after they were written. So it is worth remembering that, at the very height of his influence, Baldwin experienced the same frustration that some Black activists, particularly on campus, feel about white liberals today: their refusal to acknowledge their complicity in the regime of white supremacy. In Baldwin's case, the liberal backlash was widespread, and effectively marginalized him for a time.\n\nThe very first piece on the front page of the very first issue of The New York Review of Books , Feb. 1, 1963, was a review of Baldwin's The Fire Next Time by F. W. Dupee of the Columbia English department. Dupee (a former Communist Party organizer) took exception to Baldwin's apocalyptic tone. \"Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house?\" Baldwin had written. The answer, Dupee wrote, is that \"[s]ince you have no other, yes; and the better-disposed firemen will welcome your assistance.\"\n\nBaldwin had abandoned criticism for prophecy and prescription for provocation, Dupee said. He was goading white racists, who were in a better position to cause trouble than Black people were, \"and it is unclear to me how The Fire Next Time , in its madder moments, can do nothing except inflame the former and confuse the latter.\" The point was repeated by Kenneth Rexroth in the San Francisco Examiner. The Fire Next Time , he wrote, \"is designed to make white liberals feel terribly guilty and to scare white reactionaries into running and barking fits.\"\n\nAt the end of the year, Baldwin participated in a Commentary symposium, \"Liberalism and the Negro.\" Baldwin's fellow symposiasts were Gunnar Myrdal, Nathan Glazer and Sidney Hook, the epitome of liberal integrationist opinion. It became a war almost from the start, and Baldwin's most persistent antagonist was Glazer. This was not surprising. Unlike the others, Glazer had worked in the American government. He served in the Housing and Home Finance Agency, precursor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), when Kennedy was president, and he had just published, with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Beyond the Melting Pot . Glazer had written most of the book, which was based on research into the conditions of ethnic groups in New York City. He must have felt entitled to believe that he had a better grasp of government programs and of the facts on the ground than Baldwin did.\n\nThe argument of Beyond the Melting Pot is that many Americans retain their ethnic identities regardless of the degree of their assimilation in other respects, and from this it followed that Black Americans should do the same-that is, they should become like other ethnic groups. The trouble, Glazer said, is that the Negro \"insists that the white world deal with his problems because, since he is so much the product of America, they are not his problems, but everyone's.\" But once he becomes willing to accept that he is a member of a group, he will be able to take responsibility for himself and other members of his community.\n\nBaldwin knew what he was in for, and he set the stakes early on. \"[T]o my mind, you see,\" he said, \"before one can really talk about the Negro problem in this country, one has got to talk about the white people's problem . . . There is a sense,\" he went on, \"in which one can say that the history of this country was built on my back.\" To the suggestion that he become a member of one of the ethnic groups competing for their share of the pie, his answer was: \"What pie are you talking about? From my own point of view, my personal point of view, there is much in that American pie that isn't worth eating.\"\n\nGlazer responded that it's not prejudice that slows racial progress as much as ignorance, incompetence, and bureaucratic inefficiency. \"[T]he problems are a product of the kind of unwieldy institutions we have,\" he told Baldwin, \"the kind of feudal country we have, the kind of recalcitrant special interests that have developed-among them Negro interests. And so we all fight it out.\"\n\nTo this kind of argument Baldwin's response was \"if you don't know what Ray Charles is singing about, then it is entirely possible that you can't help me.\" It is a good bet that none of the white men sitting around the table had ever willingly listened to Ray Charles. But they all wanted to help Black people, and they were being told that this was the reason they probably couldn't.\n\nWhite liberals who identified with the Kennedy Administration resented being told they were not \"getting it.\" But even white liberals who may have considered themselves politically purer of heart expressed impatience. With Baldwin, Susan Sontag wrote in The New York Review of Books, \"passion seemed to transmute itself too readily into stately language, into an inexhaustible self-perpetuating oratory.\"\n\nThe Commentary symposium was published in March, 1964. In August, Esquire ran a profile of Baldwin that had been commissioned by the magazine's editor, Harold Hayes, who thought that Baldwin's war on white liberals was absurd. The writer, Marvin Elkoff, dutifully portrayed Baldwin as mercurial and high-strung, and quoted him calling the white liberal \"blinder, more innocent and ignorant than the segregationist,\" and saying things like: \"If you don't realize that the same people who killed Kennedy also killed Medgar Evers, then you don't understand what is going on in the world.\" In the end, Elkoff concluded, \"everybody was playing his [Baldwin's] game, and of course not nearly as well . . . At bottom he is disaffiliated, a medium of emotion.\"\n\nAt Christmastime, Baldwin published a deluxe boxed coffee table book of photographs with his high school friend Richard Avedon, now a successful fashion photographer. Baldwin's essay is a cri de coeur on the banality of American life. It begins with despairing reflections on the artificiality of actors in television commercials and descends into musings like: \"When a civilization treats its poets with the disdain with which we treat ours, it cannot be far from disaster; it cannot be far from the slaughter of the innocents.\"\n\nThere is a way in which this boutique item, which does not present itself as a book about race, brings the precariousness of Baldwin's position into focus. When he said things like \"the history of this country was built on my back\" or, in a widely publicized debate with William F. Buckley at the Cambridge Union, \"I picked cotton, I carried it to the market, I built the railroads under someone else's whip,\" he was using an established conceit of group autobiography (as Malcolm X did in his autobiography, published in 1965.) The understanding is that if these things did not happen to the author, they happened to somebody like the author. The \"I\" stands for the group.\n\nWhite people don't write group autobiographies, however. It was not that people did not believe that when Baldwin lived in the United States, he had encountered racism and discrimination. It was that professionally, he had suffered no more, and arguably less, from efforts to censor him than, for instance, Norman Mailer or Henry Miller had. From the very beginning, he had been supported and promoted by powerful writers and editors, Black and white. He had written bestsellers: the only book that sold more copies than Another Country in 1963 was William Golding's Lord of the Flies . He wrote for Partisan Review and The New Yorker . He had been on the cover of TIME . He hung around with celebrities; he was rich; he had an entourage. And on top of all that, he had been living in Paris for eight years, and when the Montgomery bus boycott turned out to be a success, he turned up on the scene, in 1957, and started telling everyone what it was like to be Black in America.\n\nThe New York Review of Books was ready for Nothing Personal . The headline was \"Everybody Knows My Name,\" and the reviewer was Robert Brustein, who was soon to become dean of the Yale School of Drama: \"Now comes Richard Avedon, high-fashion photographer for Harper's Bazaar , to join these other outrage exploiters, giving the suburban clubwoman a titillating peek into the obscene and ugly faces of the mad, the dispossessed, and the great and neargreat [ sic ]-with James Baldwin interrupting from time to time, like a punchy and pugnacious drunk awakening from a boozy doze during a stag movie, to introduce his garrulous, irrelevant, and by now predictable comments on how to live, how to love, and how to build Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"[L]ending himself to such an enterprise,\" Brustein concluded, \"Baldwin reveals that he is now part and parcel of the very things he is criticizing.\" Baldwin was one of a handful of Black writers who had a white audience in 1963, and he lost it. He had set the bar higher than many white liberals were willing to jump.\n\nThis essay is adapted from Menand's new book, The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold Wa r, published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "American Hate, a History\n\nT he message was clear. The fate of America - or at least of white America, which was the only America that counted - was at stake. On the autumn evening of Thursday, Oct. 7, 1948, South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond, the segregationist Dixiecrat nominee for President, addressed a crowd of 1,000 inside the University of Virginia's Cabell Hall in Charlottesville, Va. Attacking President Truman's civil rights program, one that included anti-lynching legislation and protections against racial discrimination in hiring, Thurmond denounced these moves toward racial justice, saying such measures \"would undermine the American way of life and outrage the Bill of Rights.\" Interrupted by applause and standing ovations, Thurmond was in his element in the Old Confederacy. \"I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen,\" Thurmond had told the breakaway States' Rights Democratic Party at its July convention in Birmingham, Ala., \"that there's not enough troops in the Army to force the Southern people to break down segregation and admit the nigra race into our theaters, into our swimming pools, into our homes, into our churches.\"\n\nSeventy years on, in the heat of a Virginia August, heirs to the Dixiecrats' platform of hate and exclusion - Klansmen, neo-Nazis and white supremacists of sundry affiliations - gathered in Charlottesville, not far from where Thurmond had taken his stand. The story is depressingly well known by now: a young counterprotester, Heather Heyer , was killed by a barreling car allegedly driven by a man who was seen marching with a neo-Nazi group. In the wake of Heyer's death, the President of the United States - himself an heir to the white populist tradition of Thurmond and of Alabama's George Wallace - flailed about, declining to directly denounce the white supremacists for nearly 48 hours. There was, he said, hate \"on many sides,\" as if there were more than one side to a conflict between neo-Nazis who idolize Adolf Hitler and Americans who stood against Klansmen and proto-Third Reich storm troopers. Within days Donald Trump had wondered aloud why people weren't more upset by the \"alt-left,\" clearly identifying himself with neo-Confederate sentiment.\n\nPerennially latent, extremist and racist nationalism tends to spike in periods of economic and social stress like ours. Americans today have little trust in government; household incomes woefully lag behind our usual middle-class expectations. As the world saw in Charlottesville - and in the alt-right universe of the Web - besieged whites, frightened of change, are seeking refuge in the one thing a shifting world cannot take away from them: the color of their skin.\n\nIf the current climate of grievance is of ancient origin, though, the white supremacists' sense of urgency - indeed of increasing legitimacy - seems new. Today's fringe sees itself not as a fringe but as the tip of the spear for the incumbent President's nationalist agenda. \"We are determined to take our country back,\" said David Duke , former Grand Wizard of the KKK, in Charlottesville. \"We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That's what we believed in, that's why we voted for Donald Trump. Because he said he's going to take our country back. That's what we gotta do.\"\n\nPerhaps President Trump disagrees, but how to know for certain? He rose in national politics, after all, in part by questioning whether Barack Obama had been born in the U.S., thus capitalizing on, and fueling, the racist and xenophobic reaction to the election of the first African-American President. Now in power, Trump governs for his base, and the alt-right is part of that base - a fact that gives white supremacists a kind of privileged status in the tangled political thickets of Trumpland. He may denounce such groups in the end, but he tends to do so only after confounding caesuras - and even then he equivocates. Why? \"Darkness is good,\" Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon , has said. When Joshua Green, the author the new book Devil's Bargain , asked Bannon about Hillary Clinton's 2016 attacks on Trump's popularity among white nationalists, Bannon replied, \"We polled the race stuff and it doesn't matter.\"\n\nBut it does. To understand where we are, we need to understand the history of hate in America - a history that sheds a good deal of light on how we've reached a place in the life of the nation where a former Grand Wizard of the KKK can claim, all too plausibly, that he is at one with the will of the President of the United States.\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, 1865, in Pulaski, Tenn., barely eight months after Robert E. Lee had surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. Gloomy about the failure of the war and anxious about Union-run Reconstruction, six former Confederates founded the Ku Klux Klan in Thomas M. Jones' law office. The organization's name was derived from kuklos, the Greek word for ring or circle, and featured elaborate titles, costumes and hoods fashioned from bed linens, and horseback rides through the night.\n\nOver the next few years, the KKK, with Nathan Bedford Forrest as its Grand Wizard, grew in influence and in menace, devoting itself to terrorizing freed African Americans and to undermining Reconstruction authorities. Put down by three federal laws in 1870 and 1871, the Klan dissipated as an active force. Yet its essential aim, the establishment of white supremacy, was achieved in ensuing years with pro-Southern Supreme Court decisions and the withdrawal of federal forces from the Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida statehouses after the disputed 1876 presidential election. That same year, future South Carolina Senator and Governor Ben Tillman, a prominent voice of white supremacy, was part of an attack on African-American Republicans at Hamburg, S.C. \"The purpose of our visit was to strike terror,\" Tillman recalled in a speech to the Senate in 1900. \"And the next morning when the Negroes who had fled to the swamp returned to the town the ghastly sight ... of seven dead Negroes lying stark and stiff certainly had its effect.\"\n\nBy the 1890s, Jim Crow laws were effectively undoing the verdict of Appomattox. In 1894, Mississippi voted to include the Confederate battle emblem on its state flag; two years later, in Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court sanctioned the principle of \"separate but equal.\" Within three decades of Lee's surrender, angry and alienated Southern whites who had lost a war had successfully used terror and political inflexibility to re-create the antebellum world of American apartheid. Lynchings, church burnings and the systematic denial of access to equal education and to the ballot box were the order of the decades.\n\nThe novelist Richard Wright vividly captured the realities of life under Jim Crow. \"We know that if we protest we will be called 'bad niggers,'\" Wright wrote in a book titled Twelve Million Black Voices . \"The Lords of the Land will preach the doctrine of 'white supremacy' to the poor whites who are eager to form mobs. In the midst of general hysteria they will seize one of us - it does not matter who, the innocent or guilty - and, as a token, a naked and bleeding body will be dragged through the dusty streets ... The Ku Klux Klan attacks us in a thousand ways, driving our boys and girls off the jobs in the cities and keeping us who live on the land from protesting or asking too many questions.\"\n\nThe white supremacists' enmity was not limited to blacks. During World War I and in the years after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, a resurgent Klan, boosted in part by the movie The Birth of a Nation , targeted immigrants, Roman Catholics and Jews. The fear was that the \"huddled masses\" of Emma Lazarus' poem would destroy the America that whites had come to know. As cities swelled with people of diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds - immigrants thought to be agents of a global communist conspiracy - the decline of familiar farm life gave new force to the Klan, which staged massive marches down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington in 1925 and 1926.\n\nOn Thursday, Sept. 11, 1941, Charles Lindbergh - American aviation hero and leading isolationist - stepped to the microphones at an America First Committee rally in Des Moines, Iowa. He had long taken it upon himself to speak, as he had once put it, for \"that silent majority of Americans who have no newspaper, or newsreel, or radio station at their command.\" Now it was time, he had decided, to make himself very clear on what he saw as a critical issue facing the nation as it debated whether to go to war against Adolf Hitler: the role of American Jews. \"No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in Germany,\" Lindbergh said in Des Moines. \"But\" - and the but here is epochal - \"no person of honesty and vision can look on their pro-war policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy, both for us and for them ... Their greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government.\"\n\nOutright Nazi sympathy was evident in America in the prewar years. \"When we get through with the Jews in America,\" Father Charles Coughlin, the anti-Semitic radio priest, said, \"they'll think the treatment they received in Germany was nothing.\" Pro-Nazi groups held huge rallies at Madison Square Garden; one sponsored by the German-American Bund in February 1939 featured a 20,000-strong crowd chanting cries of \"Heil Hitler.\"\n\nIsolationism was a complex phenomenon, but fear was a fairly common theme among its disparate elements: fear of entanglement; fear of sacrificing American blood and treasure for the advantage of others; fear of putting foreign demands ahead of national needs. Even after Pearl Harbor and Hitler's declaration of war on the U.S. in December 1941, there were still those who peddled a toxic blend of anti-Semitism (which came to include Holocaust denial) and virulent anticommunism and racist ideology. Eventually, Cold War anxieties were oxygen to the flames of neo-Nazism. Just as the Klan had benefitted from the fears of the 1920s after the Russian Revolution, white supremacists after World War II linked their cause with the apocalyptic rhetoric of right-wing anticommunism. These were the years of Joseph McCarthy and of the John Birch Society, of IMPEACH EARL WARREN billboards and White Citizens' Councils. In a November 1963 lecture that formed the basis, a year later, of a Harper's cover story and later a book, \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics,\" the historian Richard Hofstadter discerned a pattern of extreme conspiratorial theories about fundamental threats to the country.\n\n\"The paranoid spokesman ... traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values,\" Hofstadter wrote. \"He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point: it is now or never in organizing resistance to conspiracy.\" Ranging from fears of the Bavarian Illuminati in the 1790s to the dark anxieties of the anticommunists of the 1960s, Hofstadter identified the recurrent tendency to see powerful forces at work to undermine American life or politics or, often, both. (Immigrants, Jews and international bankers were favorites.) Hofstadter's point: there's always a war on to make America great again, for there are always those who believe American greatness is under assault from \"the other.\"\n\nIn the South in particular, race, as ever, was the flash point. In 1948, when Minneapolis Mayor Hubert H. Humphrey called on the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to walk into the \"sunshine of human rights,\" Thurmond and his fellow segregationists marched out of the hall, went South and met at Birmingham to form the Dixiecrat ticket. Worried about communists and civil rights - President Truman integrated the military the same month as the Dixiecrat rebellion - the disaffected began to carry Confederate battle flags to rallies, seeking to link their cause with the Lost one.\n\nAfter the school-integration decisions of the mid-1950s, defiance was pervasive. Georgia incorporated the Confederate battle emblem into its flag in 1956, and South Carolina hoisted the Confederate colors over its Capitol in 1961. By 1964, Alabama Governor George Wallace, the man who had promised \"segregation forever,\" was taking a Southern white populism to the national stage.\n\nWallace brought something intriguing to the modern politics of hate in America: a visceral connection to his crowds, an appeal that confounded elites. The cigar-chewing bantam figure with slicked-back hair was \"simply more alive than all the others,\" a female journalist told the writer Marshall Frady, a Wallace biographer. Alluding to a Wallace speech in New Hampshire, the woman continued, \"You saw those people in that auditorium while he was speaking - you saw their eyes. He made those people feel something real for once in their lives. You can't help but respond to him. Me - my heart was pounding. I couldn't take my eyes off him, there were all those people screaming. You almost love him, though you know what a little gremlin he actually is.\"\n\nHate will be with us always, but it need not become a defining feature of a given era. In 1995, when Timothy McVeigh bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City, leaders of both major parties stood up. \"Let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear,\" President Clinton told mourners. \"When there is talk of hatred, let us stand up and talk against it. When there is talk of violence, let us stand up and talk against it. In the face of death, let us honor life.\" In those dark weeks, the National Rifle Association defended a recent fundraising letter that targeted not the murderers of innocents but federal agents the gun lobby's leadership derided as \"jackbooted Government thugs.\" Reading the missive, former President George H.W. Bush, a life member, resigned from the group. \"To attack Secret Service agents or A.T.F. people or any government law enforcement people as 'wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm-trooper uniforms' wanting to 'attack law-abiding citizens,'\" Bush wrote, \"is a vicious slander on good people.\" The same spirit animated George W. Bush when, six years later, he insisted that America's war on terror was not a war against all of Islam. \"The terrorists,\" Bush 43 said, \"are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself.\"\n\nSuch presidential grace can be crucial in ameliorating moments of virulence and violence. We tend to be more likely to choose the right path when we're encouraged to do so from the very top. Franklin D. Roosevelt once observed that the presidency is \"pre-eminently a place of moral leadership,\" and the country has come to look to the White House for a steadying hand in stormy times of unease and vitriol.\n\nAt the moment, we look in vain. Going forward, white supremacists are likely to repeat the strategy of Charlottesville. The march last weekend was ostensibly about demonstrating support for a Robert E. Lee memorial that's slated for removal. Now freshly emboldened, organizers are planning demonstrations in Boston and San Francisco, and in the South the sheer number of Confederate memorials offer white nationalists a target-rich environment. Old times are truly not forgotten, and it seems safe to say that they won't be anytime soon. At least not in Trump's America.\n\n-With reporting by ABIGAIL ABRAMS/NEW YORK\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "America's Booming White Enclaves\n\nT raveling some 27,000 miles, African-American journalist Rich Benjamin roamed the U.S. from 2007 to 2009 exploring a major demographic shift that is attracting remarkably little attention - the flight of white residents from cities and integrated suburbs into cloistered, racially homogeneous enclaves. Tidy communities such as St. George, Utah, and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho - places Benjamin calls Whitopias - have grown at triple the rate of America's cities in recent years, raising troubling questions about the country's multiracial cohesion. The Stanford literature Ph.D. chronicled his adventure in a new book, Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America , and spoke with TIME about what he found.\n\n(Read \"Resisting School Integration in Savannah.\")\n\nLet's start with the title of your book - what is a Whitopia, exactly? It seems to be more than just a place where a lot of white people live. Absolutely. A Whitopia has three things. First, it has posted more than 6% population growth since 2000. The second thing is that the majority of that growth - upwards of 90% - comes from white migrants. The third thing a Whitopia has is an ineffable social charm - a pleasant look and feel.\n\n(Read \"A Brief History of the NAACP.\")\n\nYou say that many Whitopias offer a high quality of life and tend to perform well on those \"Best Places to Live\" lists that run in magazines. Do you think people are also drawn to these places specifically for their whiteness? The major draw to Whitopia is that they're safe communities with good public schools and beautiful natural resources. Those qualities are subconsciously inseparable from race in many Americans' minds. For some people, race is a major role, and they said so to my face, but most of the Whitopians I encountered aren't intentionally practicing racial discrimination or self-segregation.\n\nYou say Whitopias can form even in the middle of diverse cities. How is that possible? People don't realize that diversity isn't the same as integration. Blacks and whites in New York, where I live, are as segregated today as in 1910 [based on a sociologists' segregation index that measures how much contact people of differing races have with one another.]\n\nWhat is the danger Whitopias pose to America as a whole? You can call me old-fashioned, but I'm an integrationist. A democracy can't function at its optimum unless all members are integrated as full members.\n\nA community full of like-minded people tends to enforce their own view of the world and close off opposing viewpoints. You can go to parties in New York City where the liberal smugness is intolerable because they're only hearing liberal viewpoints. On the Whitopian conservative side, it's spinning out of control. Look at the tea-bagger movement, where people are concerned their taxes are going to be wasted on minorities and illegal immigrants. Same with the movement that says [President] Obama is not a citizen .\n\n(See pictures of the tea-party protests.)\n\nSo how can we avoid the threat of the racial Balkanization that you describe? We have a golden opportunity now. If I were an elected leader, I would say we have $800 billion in stimulus money that could rebuild America. We don't want to build communities in such a way that continues segregation. After World War II, President Eisenhower built highways and gave incentives to homeowners that gave white suburbanites an advantage. It left us with segregation for decades to come. Now we have an opportunity to get it right.\n\nAre there any places that are getting it right now? That serve as a model for what you'd like to see? There are communities around the country that get it right. Maplewood, N.J., has all the attributes of a Whitopia - high property values, great public schools, neighborliness - and yet it's also integrated and very diverse.\n\nWhat surprised you about the communities you spent time in? I was caught off-guard by the level of hostility to immigration reform in many of these communities and by how concerned many are by taxes - they believe taxes are too high. But I was also caught off-guard by how pleasant an experience it turned out to be, the personable warmth that greeted me in many cases.\n\nAnd you were surprised by how much you enjoyed golf. I was. [ Laughs. ] I feel like golf courses are the seductive emblem of Whitopia, and I didn't think I could get the essence of the place without learning myself. What I thought was a chore turned out to be a labor of love.\n\nTell me about the time you spent with white separatists in Idaho. I just stumbled upon it. There's a religious sect called Christian Identity, which is a religious arm of the Aryan Nations. When I was in northern Idaho, I sat in on a three-day retreat and had some fascinating conversations. It was just a bizarre experience.\n\nYou, a black man, sat in on a white-separatist retreat. How did that go over? They were curious and shocked they had found a black man on their premises. A lot of the members of the church took pains to explain to me the difference between white supremacy and white separatism. They said, \"We don't think we're better than you; we just want to be separate from you.\"\n\n(Read \"What Berlusconi's Obama 'Jokes' Say About Italy.\")\n\nWe see that tendency to divide ourselves into identity groups in places all over the world, it seems, whether it's by race or religion or political view. Is it simply human nature? I just reject that argument. People in Whitopia would say, \"Hey, Rich, birds of a feather flock together. What's the big deal?\" Our government and businesses across the country make decisions every day that perpetuate segregation. When you say homes need to be built on a 1-acre lot, when you say apartment renters can't live in your community - these concrete policies are what contribute to segregation. It's not in our biology, and it's not natural. We're a great country - we've overcome some thorny problems in our past, and we're better than that.\n\nSee pictures of expensive things that money can buy.\n\nSee pictures of Americans in their homes.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Americans Have Learned to Talk About Racial Inequality. But They've Done Little to Solve It\n\nI n 1937, the Carnegie Corporation hired a Swedish man to unravel an American quandary. The foundation had a history of funding initiatives to help the disadvantaged; in the U.S., where enslavement was only 72 years gone, the disadvantaged were disproportionately Black. The issue was often described as, simply, \"the Negro Problem.\"\n\nBut while it was clear that the problem existed, it was also obvious how difficult it was to solve. And so the foundation brought in economist, sociologist and future Nobel Prize winner Gunnar Myrdal to gather information to guide its programs.\n\nMyrdal did much more. Almost seven years later, he produced a two-volume study he dubbed An American Dilemma , exploring, in statistical detail, the evidence of the great American lie-the gap between the nation's ideals and its racial reality. Myrdal was far from the first to try to illuminate the effects of ongoing institutional racism , the frequent and extreme way it pushed the U.S. away from its core ideals and constitutional promises. And he certainly would not be the last. Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, W.E.B. Du Bois in 1900 and again in 1935 and the Kerner Commission in 1968, among others, enriched our national understanding of troubles we still face today. But Myrdal and his army of social scientists seemed, for at least a time, to cut through America's fairytale understanding of itself. The study was one of just a few credited with prompting the Supreme Court to put a legal end to school segregation .\n\nAnd yet, once again, Myrdal's subject looms large. The profoundly inadequate question of whether America is a racist country has caused a wave in many elected officials' deep-as-a-puddle meditations on the nation's history. Many Americans remain ill-informed about race and near delusional in their description of its reach. The evidence is clear-and was, in a way that all but only the most recalcitrant can deny, made plain again in the extended endurance test that began in March 2020.\n\nIf the past year has been, as is so often claimed, the one in which the ugly scar of American inequality ripped open so wide that few could deny it, it should also be known as the year when a bold and opportunistic set learned to better talk the talk of needed change. Still, even in a country that prides itself on allowing citizens to speak freely and then act to change public policy accordingly, the renewed attention given to racial injustice has scarcely been matched with parallel action.\n\nThe problem is as clear as ever. What America is going to do about it is not.\n\nThe same basic information is the backdrop of Myrdal's work and everything that came before and after. In a country founded on a commitment to equality, white Americans have been the only ones to consistently enjoy the full measure of citizenship. Settlers drove Native Americans from their own lands and then treated them as unwelcome, dangerous guests. Congress barred many others from even entering the country. But it was Black Americans whom the nation enslaved, then so completely marooned that in every major measure of social, economic or physical well-being, millions would-and still do-remain far behind their white compatriots.\n\nWhen Myrdal's work was published, Black Americans earned less , were more likely to be unemployed, and led shorter and unhealthier lives. In the North, their housing was crowded and substandard. In the South, many did not have access to anything beyond basic elementary education. Most Black Americans could not vote or borrow the funds to buy property. \"Virtually the whole range\" of public amenities, from hospitals to libraries, were \"much poorer for Negroes than they are for whites,\" Myrdal wrote. The majority of Black Americans had little to no assets and were the targets of disproportionate incarceration and exploitative profit-making schemes.\n\nNearly 80 years later, we find ourselves more than a year into a pandemic, a recession and a reconsidering of the meaning of Black death caused by agents of the state. Last summer's mass protests have for the most part receded. But increased crime, increased poverty, increased death and increased distress have not. Yet in our litany of collective aches, there is almost no arena in which Black Americans have not suffered more than white Americans.\n\nBlack Americans on average earn less with the same (or, in some categories, more) education than white workers, are more likely to be unemployed and are clustered in industries hit hard by the pandemic. Black Americans are more likely to be born premature and to die younger. In fact, life expectancy for a Black boy born in 2020 is a full seven years shorter than a white boy's. Black women remain more likely to die in or just after childbirth than white women. All Black Americans are more likely to die of cancer than white Americans. The impact of the coronavirus was anything but novel: the death risk for Black Americans is almost two times that of white Americans.\n\nIt doesn't stop there. Black children remain more likely than white ones to attend high-need, low-performing schools, low-quality preschools, and high schools that offer few if any college-prep courses. The Black homeownership rate in the first quarter of 2021 was 29 percentage points lower than that of white Americans. When Black Americans do own homes, those properties are often undervalued by appraisers. That disparity-not saving, spending or even earnings-drives the bulk of the nation's massive Black-white wealth gap. Black Americans are also more likely to live in \"nature\"-deprived areas than white Americans and experience more exposure to pollutants. Black incarceration rates continue to outpace those for all other groups, and the effort to restrict Black voter participation, which has been a part of American politics since Reconstruction, has resurged today.\n\nAnd yet, just as was the case when Myrdal was working, many of those in power have the temerity to express total shock about those vast racial disparities, to confuse the causes of inequality with its effects, and to question what, exactly, is wrong with Black Americans. Or Latino Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans-take your pick. As distinct as the Black experience is, so many communities throughout the U.S. have their own parallel set of facts.\n\nThese problems are not products of the long pandemic. But many were made worse, and perhaps the copious concern about being \"woke\" to inequality (or deeply opposed to anything like it) has hitched a fast ride on the virus to the cultural forefront. Corporations that only years ago reached massive settlements with the U.S. government for engaging in what federal officials alleged was widespread discrimination have released carefully worded statements declaring that Black lives matter. Promises have been made. They will have to be tracked. In the interim, the Dear Black, Latino, Asian employees, we see you and feel your pain email after a horrible event in the news has become a new genre of corporate communication. The very same impulse is also a feature of a certain set's social media feeds and the launching point for thousands of online lists of goods created by people of color, to be bought by those who wish to understand themselves as good.\n\nBut even among those white Americans who do not live in a state of denial, the call to action has once again grown faint, if it was ever there at all. Few companies have been so public in discussing how employees involved in unfair practices might actually be penalized, or how the obligation to operate with equity in mind will be prioritized above profits. Few organizations or individuals have acknowledged outright that they have engaged in racist practices, or explained how they plan to stop. There aren't many parents willing to stop arranging their housing around the pursuit of \"good schools\"-thinly veiled code for white schools-or wealthy people ready to admit the racial consequences of opposing higher taxes on investment earnings. After the nation's so-called reckoning, to which those who claimed to have awakened brought PowerPoint presentations and brochures, few have stayed behind to fold and stack the chairs.\n\nIt is not true that, as the most exhausted among us sometimes assert, nothing has changed. But as the optimistic Myrdal saw in 1944, yet had a hard time putting bluntly, America is not about the business of doing things much differently. When the New Deal reoriented Americans' relationships to their government, officials south of the Mason-Dixon Line made sure that most of the jobs done by Black Americans were excluded from the new Social Security system. Program administrators barred Black Americans from meaningful access to the homeownership and education programs that ensconced millions of white Americans in the middle class.\n\nIn his study, Myrdal found ample proof of Black ingenuity, creativity and grit, producing lives of multidimensional joy and peril. All that's still there. But perhaps today's list of dangerous inequities wouldn't run quite so long or, in some cases, have come to envelop other groups, if sustained action had been taken in response to his findings-something he believed possible. \"It is true the average white American does not want to sacrifice much himself in order to improve the living condition of Negroes,\" he wrote. \"But on this point, the American creed is quite clear and explicit.\"\n\nMyrdal died in 1987. He did not live to see the new and creative ways that Americans have developed of telling lies. And he was not immune to the same maladies. Myrdal was optimistic about the nation and dubious about whether Black Americans were equipped to function as full citizens.\n\nI'm told that those of us who aren't white-a growing share of Americans-can take heart in knowing that our maltreatment is being discussed at all. This is akin to a cruel warden demanding extra pay for services rendered. Those who live with the myriad consequences of inequality are, at this point, unlikely to be impressed by mildly uncomfortable chatter about race in America.\n\nMany are, quite frankly, already busy finding meaning in the American creed, creating new possibilities and erecting work-arounds with the ingenuity and grit that have sustained them thus far. And as was evident in last summer's protests and the fall's election returns, Americans, but particularly Black Americans, have and will put in work to make a democracy of equals real.\n\nThe situation reminds me of the first time I was called the N word to my face-far from the worst moment that being Black in America has brought me, but an instructive one.\n\nA few months before I began kindergarten, my parents emerged triumphant from their battle with banks, real estate agents and the opportunities available to Black people in the U.S. labor market. They bought their first home in a North Texas suburb so new that a wrong turn meant driving on a dirt road.\n\nMy parents grew up in the Jim Crow South . They knew how scary so-called economic anxiety can get when one group's stranglehold on privilege ends. So they didn't expect things to be easy in the new neighborhood. What mattered to me at the time: my sister and I quickly found friends. There were three white girls next door and a Black and white biracial brother and sister opposite us in the cul-de-sac.\n\nWhen a new boy showed up-Chad, towheaded and in tube socks-we were glad to include him. He was one more person to make the day's checkers tournament interesting and one more contender in our bike races to the end of the street and back. But when Chad lost, Chad got mad. Standing near the curb outside our house, he leaped off his bike after a race and said it: He was sick of playing with \"stupid niggers.\"\n\nIt was bad and everyone knew. When Chad hadn't returned for his bike a half hour later, the Ross girls gathered a toolbox from our garage. With the help of our friends, we broke Chad's bike down to its parts. Handlebars, pedals, tires, main body, screws and washers, all left in a pile. Chad-who presumed himself smarter and better; who said he wanted to play with us but didn't like it when we won fair and square; who even as a child turned so automatically to that slur as soon as he saw that we, that day, beat him-would have to figure out how to get it all home. Later, Chad's father, his son cowering behind him, rang our doorbell to demand that we apologize.\n\nThe experiences that accompany life in the body of a person of color are well documented. But even as the notion of white America's inherent superiority is verbally rejected, very few are willing to use what power they have to shift the systems that have served them well. Some people who are used to winning are having trouble playing fair. But America should not expect people of color to apologize for disassembling the vehicles that support racial inequality.\n\nThe people out there with the screwdrivers and wrenches, trying to make the country into what it promised to be, are disproportionately people of color, particularly Black Americans. But if the suffering and loss of the past year is to have meaning, the work of private citizens cannot be enough. We must begin by holding to account those in power-especially the man in the White House.\n\nThe phrase t alk is cheap is a truism for a reason. We have heard enough. Now let's watch for what is done.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Don't Let the Loud Bigots Distract You. America's Real Problem With Race Cuts Far Deeper\n\nI n a recent viral video, an unidentified white woman in line at a grocery store in Oregon, dressed in a floral romper and black knee-high boots, overheard a black woman's phone conversation. She believed this black woman was trying to sell food stamps illegally. The exchange became heated, and the white woman was told, in no uncertain terms, to mind her business. \"Oh, it is my business,\" the white woman responded. \"Because I pay my taxes.\" She then said something that, quite frankly, stunned me: \"We're going to build this wall.\"\n\nThis was not an oddly timed statement about her views on immigration; it was a declaration of her whiteness and, by extension, her view of who belonged in this country. She might as well have called the black woman a nigger. She didn't. She called the police instead.\n\nBut no, this wasn't a video of police violence or another example of some white person hurling racial epithets. In so many ways, the argument between these two women captured the soft bigotry that has, from beneath the surface, enabled American public policy and individual behavior for decades. This woman, years after the departure of what Newt Gingrich called in 2011 \"the most successful food-stamp President in American history,\" saw a member of Mitt Romney's \"47% ... who are dependent upon government ... who pay no income tax.\" This white woman witnessed Ronald Reagan's welfare queen. Now she had not just a new phrase - build this wall - but also the confidence that the President would support her in her indignation, and that the problem would soon be resolved. America would be great again.\n\nIt is this type of outburst, though - blaring and easy to denounce - that provides many Americans with a familiar experience: the moral comfort of having someone else to blame for our nation's racial struggles. If only we, the non-racists, could kick her out, or lock her up.\n\nIt is relatively easy to blame our current struggles on these loud racists who have been emboldened by the election of Donald Trump. But this is typical American racial melodrama. We need easily marked villains and happy endings. Yet this recital of condemnation all too often hides the messiness of our own moral lives: that we aren't absolved of our complicity simply by the politicians we support, especially since the American public so rarely pushes for policies that enact our supposed commitment to racial equality.\n\nThe fact is that Americans have grown comfortable with racism resting just beneath the surface of our politics - to be activated whenever a politician or a community needed it, or some racist incident exhumed it only for us to bury it once again. What has resulted is an illusion that blinds us to what was actually happening right in front of our noses and in our heads - we believed that our country had become less racist, because we were not as brazen as we once were.\n\nTrump has shattered that illusion. He rode race, the third rail of American politics, straight to the White House. He challenged Obama's citizenship, called Mexicans rapists and criminals, proposed to ban all Muslims from entering the country, insisted on the need for \"law and order,\" argued that immigration was changing the \"character\" of the United States and openly courted white supremacists. He dog-whistled in a way that let no one feign deafness. Trump promised to dismantle Obamacare and provide a \"beautiful\" alternative, to make Mexico pay for \"the wall\" and to restore America's manufacturing greatness - jobs and tax relief included. His pledges spoke directly to the forgotten American's sense of victimhood: that he had been left behind during the Obama years and that his way of life was under threat.\n\nTrump exists in a sweet spot between the soft bigotry of self-contradictory American liberals and the loud racism of those who shout \"nigger\" and demand that Latino people go back to Mexico, all stuck in an economic system that cannot reconcile the startling gap between the top 1% and those busting their behinds to make ends meet. Trump sits right there, amid the mess and false promises, with a smirk on his face.\n\nBut Trump isn't some nefarious character unlike anything we have seen before. He embodies the hatreds and fears that have been part of America's politics since its founding and that erupt with every rapid change in our society and world. He stands in a tradition of American politics that can be traced to Strom Thurmond's 1948 Dixiecrat run for the presidency, George Wallace's bids for the presidency in 1968 and 1972, and Patrick Buchanan's runs in 1992 and '96. Each of these men could move a crowd with their homespun rhetoric and their willingness to speak unvarnished truth with little regard for the consequences - and each sought to give voice to a deeply felt sense of white victimhood as the nation grappled with significant social transformation, be it the end of the Jim Crow South or the tumult of the '60s revolution. America responded, at least in words, by othering them: These were marginal men and marginal thoughts. The grievances were real, the country said. The messengers and their racial animus were the problem. This separation - of so-called grievance from racial animus - was a grave error, and it is one we are in the process of repeating.\n\nIn 2016, the degree to which a person deeply identified as white \"strongly related to Republicans' support for Donald Trump,\" political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck write in their forthcoming book, Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America . For instance, among white millennials who voted for Trump, a sense of white vulnerability - \"the perception that whites, through no fault of their own, are losing ground to others\" - and racial resentment were more important factors than economic anxiety, found researchers Matthew Fowler, Vladimir Medenica and Cathy Cohen of the GenForward Survey at the University of Chicago. In fact, Tesler says - and this insight goes beyond those millennials - \"economic anxiety isn't driving racial resentment; rather, racial resentment is driving economic anxiety.\"\n\nDespite this, we heard over and over again from pundits and politicians - including Democrats - that racism couldn't explain the counties that voted for Donald Trump and Barack Obama, that more attention needed to be given to the dire circumstances of working white men and women, that Trump's election was a white, working-class, often rural backlash and what was needed was a focus on Middle America. This criticism coalesced with an ongoing obsession about what suburban white America was thinking. All the while, they decried the President's use of explicit racism, as opposed to the implicit kind they had been endorsing, knowingly or not. The problem was him - not us.\n\nIt felt like folks weren't fighting the true problem. They were, in fact, protecting it.\n\nOur narrow focus on explicit racists misses a development that explains our current moment: that much of our struggle with race today is bound up in the false innocence of white suburban bliss and the manic effort to protect it, no matter the costs. In the late 1960s and early '70s, for example, millions of white homeowners in the nation's suburbs - for the most part, racially segregated communities subsidized by state policies - rejected efforts to desegregate schools through busing and vehemently defended the demographic makeup of their neighborhoods. These were not people shouting slurs at the top of their lungs (although some did). They were courageous defenders of their quality of life - segregated life, that is. These were the people of the so-called \"silent majority,\" who insisted on free-market meritocracy and embraced a color-blind ideology to maintain their racially exclusive enclaves. Their antibusing crusades, taxpayer revolts and insistence on neighborhood schools cut across party lines and helped shape national politics. Democrats and Republicans appealed to the interests of these voters, and many turned their backs on the agenda of the civil rights movement. These Americans, it was argued, were the true victims.\n\nIn his important 2006 book, The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South , historian Matthew D. Lassiter stated clearly the effect of this moment from the late 1960s and early '70s:\n\nThe suburban politics of middle-class warfare charted a middle course between the open racism of the extreme right and the egalitarian agenda of the civil rights movement, based in an ethos of color-blind individualism that accepted the principle of equal opportunity under the law but refused to countenance affirmative-action policies designed to overcome metropolitan structures of inequality.\n\nSuburban white America voiced its belief in racial equality, but relentlessly held on to white class privilege and all the policies and structures that made it possible. Many social scientists would call this the \"new racism\" or \"laissez-faire racism,\" in which white Americans failed to actively address racial inequality and, in doing so, maintained the racial status quo. Historians, like Lassiter, would identify it as a key feature of modern American conservatism.\n\nWhite people's expressed racial attitudes, by most measures, have become progressively better. Today, according to public-opinion surveys, most Americans don't hold the views of Strom Thurmond in 1948 or George Wallace in 1968. They believe in integrated schools and reject segregated public transportation and the like. In the early 1940s, according to Harvard sociologist Lawrence Bobo, 68% of white Americans supported formal segregation. By the 1990s, 96% of white Americans believed that black and white children should attend the same school. But as Bobo wrote in his classic 2001 essay, \"Racial Attitudes and Relations at the Close of the 20th Century,\" these expressed commitments stand alongside \"numerous signs of the gulf in perception that often separates blacks and whites.\"\n\nA 2017 study by the Public Religion Research Institute, for example, showed that 87% of black Americans say black people face a lot of discrimination today. Only 49% of white Americans feel the same. The disconnect between our stated commitments and our practice is so great that we can't even agree what the problem is. This is the hazy middle ground of the silent majority.\n\nThat same study found that 43% of Republicans said there is a lot of discrimination against whites. Only 27% of Republicans said the same with regard to discrimination against blacks. This makes sense. Since the mid - 20th century, Republicans have made a living as the party of white grievance, even as it puts forward \"pro-growth\" policies and ardently defends the benefits of small government. (I know many of my friends will cry foul here and shout that this conclusion is just an indication of my singular focus on race. Their evasion is part of the problem.)\n\nWhat is less explored is the Democrats. The recognition of the volatility of race led many in the party, especially those who founded the Democratic Leadership Council in 1985, to work hard to win back white middle-class voters by addressing their concerns. Ever since, Democratic strategists and politicians have been in hot pursuit of so-called \"Reagan Democrats\" and aimed to speak - especially after Trump's election - to what they generally described as working-class America. Here they rejected bad identity politics in favor of a politics that did not alienate the white working class. Bill Clinton's strategy of triangulation reflected a cynical co-optation of Republican views that drove the party to the center-right while taking black voters, among others, for granted. (In a way, Hillary Clinton duplicated this approach in 2016 in her effort to court \"Bush Republicans\" who said they couldn't vote for Trump.) Meanwhile, as politicians courted the ideal white voter, racial inequality persisted and black political participation was distorted, as we African Americans stood between a party that assumed we would support them nonetheless.\n\nAmericans experienced the confusing effects of this pervasive contradiction between our stated commitments and practices with the election of Barack Obama. For many, Obama's ascendance signaled the end of entitlement for whites. But instead, his presidency occasioned a resurgence of white resentment that set the stage for Trump. We experienced the vitriol of the Tea Party and saw several states seek to enact strict voter-ID laws that disproportionately impact black and brown voters, sometimes successfully. Obama proved our national commitment to racial equality. The vehement hatred of him exposed the illusion for what it is.\n\nAll the talk about equality serves as a kind of cover for the actual practices that continue to reproduce differential outcomes for black and brown people and protect white class advantage. Trump can promote the lie that his policies alone have produced the lowest black unemployment rate in history. He gives no credit to the Obama Administration and pays little attention to black labor-participation rates. He is silent about what would happen to the numbers if we include, as Harvard sociologist Bruce Western suggests, those who are incarcerated. Trump only cites the numbers to deepen the illusion and to justify the dismissal of claims of racial inequality as simple cries of victimhood.\n\nIt turns out what we do reveals what we truly believe - no matter the public proclamations of our commitment to a more perfect union. The facts of our daily lives in this country speak volumes. Studies reveal the racial bias in policing; in sentencing and rates of incarceration; in differential punishment in schools for black and brown children; in the persistence of residential segregation and its cascading effect in the life cycle of black people; in how even if an African-American or Hispanic adult earns a college degree, she will still financially lag behind a white American with the same degree.\n\nBut all of this was the case before Trump was elected. It is not enough, then, to decry the loud racists or to resist Donald Trump. We must, once and for all, confront the silent majority - even if until now we did not realize we are them. We must confront ourselves.\n\nThe desire to distance oneself from Trump fits perfectly with the American insistence that we not see ourselves for who we actually are. We evade the historical wounds, the individual pain and the lasting effects of it all. The lynched relative; the buried son killed at the hands of the police; the millions locked away to rot in prisons; the children languishing in failed schools; the smothering, concentrated poverty passed down from generation to generation; and the generalized indifference to lives lived in the shadows of the American Dream are generally understood as exceptions to the American story, not the rule. Blasphemous facts must be banished from view by a host of public rituals and incantations. We tell ourselves a particular story of the civil rights movement with Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat and Dr. King dreaming of America as it should be. Our gaze averted, we congratulate ourselves for how far we have come and ruthlessly blame those in the shadows for their plight in life. Our innocence secured, we feel no guilt in enjoying what we have earned by our own merit, in defending our right to educate our children in the best schools and in demanding that we be judged by our ability alone. In this illusion, Trump has to be seen as singular. Otherwise, he reveals something terrible about us. But not to see yourself in Trump is to continue the lie. We must finally reject the lie.\n\nThe longing for a time when matters were simpler, and the angst over lost superiority over people of other races and ethnicities, will not disappear on their own. By 2045, America will be a majority minority nation. Demography isn't destiny, and the mere fact that white people will be a minority does not guarantee the country will suddenly become a more racially just society.\n\nBut something fundamental is changing. As a country, we have been at the crossroads before - the Civil War, Reconstruction, the New Deal, the civil rights movement - and found ourselves with a choice to be otherwise. In each moment, no matter the possibilities in front of us or the significant changes in our social imaginations, the country held tightly to its prejudices and its unseemly beliefs about the value of white people. Trump broke the post-civil rights consensus that America would keep its racism quiet. He has unwittingly cracked a pernicious impediment - one we still hear in those who in one breath decry his explicit racism and then accept policies and positions that stoke the flames of white racial resentment. Surprisingly, though, Trump has provided us another choice, another chance.\n\nWhat has for so long been hidden - or willfully ignored - is now in the open. Americans will have to decide whether or not this country will remain racist. To make that decision, we will have to avoid the trap of placing the burden of our national sins on the shoulders of Donald Trump. We must address not just the nasty words, but also the policies and the practices. We need to look inward. Trump is us or, better, you. And by the irony of history, my fate and my son's safety are bound up with you.\n\nHow do we clear the space - Can we clear it? - to debate states' rights, to argue over the necessity of a social safety net, to haggle over policing and prisons or to fight about the importance of public education without the undertow of racial animus and without the attribution of bad faith? I am convinced that, if we are to imagine the country as a genuinely multiracial democracy, we have to tell ourselves a better story about who we are, how we ended up here and why we keep returning to this hell. No more Pollyannaish tales about the inherent greatness of America. Ours is a history of not just obvious racist monsters but also of lily white communities with nice picket fences and good schools, of concerning comfort, of fits and starts and abject failure - rife with ordinary people doing horrific and, sometimes, courageous things.\n\nPerhaps Samuel Beckett's words from his 1983 novella, Worstward Ho , offer a more appropriate (and humble) approach to the crisis we now face: \"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\" Forward movement is halting, inhibited, interrupted. Our history, if we're honest, suggests we will fail. No matter. We go on - together.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "What White America Must Do Next\n\nSaturday, August 12th, will go down as a dark day for America. A coalition of white nationalists attempted to rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Young and old donned swastikas. White militia in full camouflage and many openly carrying weapons set out to \"protect\" the demonstrators. Angry men and women screamed vile and racist slogans. Violence broke out with counter-protesters. Then James Alex Fields, Jr. , a 20-year-old from Ohio, decided to plow his car into a peaceful crowd protesting the racist spectacle. Heather Heyer of Charlottesville was killed and at least 19 people were injured. Cornel West, who joined the counter protests with a group of clergy, witnessed it all and told me, \"I have never seen this kind of hatred.\"\n\nIf these were normal times, even if you believed a press conference to be typical American racial theater, you would expect the President of the United States to condemn unequivocally the hatred and bigotry of the white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville. But these aren't normal times.\n\nInstead, Donald Trump offered a mealy-mouthed response. \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides .\"\n\nTrump did not mention white supremacy or single out white nationalists. He only offered a general condemnation based on a false equivalence: that somehow what we witnessed in Charlottesville was the same as protests at the University of California, Berkeley, or in Ferguson, or in Baltimore. As if what came out of the mouths of these \" white thugs \" is equivalent to the principles espoused by those who dared to stand up to them.\n\nIt is an old move, really. A rhetorical sleight of hand meant to trap the critic in a corner and to hide the speaker's true intent. Black people have seen it since the first moment we called attention to this country's hypocrisy. In this case, Trump did not want to condemn the white nationalists in Charlottesville because they are on his side.\n\nThese people, as David Duke reminded the president, helped elect him. Steve Bannon , Stephen Miller , Sebastian Gorka and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III represent these people. And, if The Daily Stormer, a white nationalist publication, is any indication, these people are quite satisfied with what Trump said. \" He said he loves us all.... No condemnation at all. Really, really good. God bless him .\"\n\nOf course, many politicians and pundits (myself included) were quick to condemn Trump. Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted \"There is only one side. #charlottesville.\" Joe Scarborough tweeted \"Mr. President, call it by its name! 'WHITE SUPREMACIST TERRORISM.\" Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona tweeted, \"The #WhiteSupremacy in #Charlottesville does not reflect the values of the America I know. Hate and bigotry have no place in this country.\" Ivanka Trump's eventual Tweets sounded similar. But these condemnations all seem a little too easy to me. No matter their intentions, they smack of a certain kind of sentimentality. As James Baldwin noted, sentimentality is \"the mark of dishonesty;...the mask of cruelty.\"\n\nIt is easy to condemn Trump and the white nationalists who participated in the rally-to say that they are the bad people. But we give them life. What about the racially coded language that exploits white fears and has defined our political discourse for generations? These rabid racists shout their Nazi slogans, defend Confederate monuments, and declare that America is a white nation-while politicians on both sides of the aisle trade in the myth that Trump's election was a backlash of the white working class , as if what is happening to white workers is somehow distinct from and more important than what is happening to workers of color. As if we are the reasons life has gotten so much harder for white working people in this country.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that this so-called Rust Belt rebellion isn't true. A higher percentage of Trump's voters in comparison to Clinton voters were from houses that earned over $100,000 a year . Moreover, several studies have shown that social issues, not economic issues, motivated the Trump voter. Trump voters worried that a particular cultural vision of America was eroding. Politicians' appeals to \"the white working class revolt\" among Democrats and Republicans is less about the economic devastation of workers and more about white identity-with black and brown folk and immigrants as the scapegoats.\n\nThese white nationalists say they want to take back their country as members of Congress push draconian immigration policies that will ensure this nation remains a white nation. It is easy to condemn the violence of these white supremacists as politicians debate the logistics of a return to a regime of policing that has devastated black and brown communities, or challenge Affirmative Action because supposedly black and brown students are taking the slots of white students, or seek to disenfranchise millions of our fellow citizens under the guise of voter fraud. They all seem to be on Trump's side.\n\nSuch views give oxygen to white supremacy's blazing fire. And such views have animated American politics as long as I can remember. Trump's election has inflamed and emboldened those who embrace them. Now, we have to confront honestly this fact: the white nationalists in Charlottesville, and every other town, are as native to American soil as sagebrush and buffalo grass. What is required of white America now is something much more than a sentimental condemnation of that fact. Ask yourselves: Can you truly give up the idea that this is a white nation? Can you imagine this country as a truly multiracial democracy? Or, are you willing to cast this fragile experiment into the trash bin of history, because you refuse to have it any other way?\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Viewpoint: Why racism in US is worse than in Europe\n\nNews stories emerge almost daily in the US about police being called over black Americans doing nothing more than being black. Writer Barrett Holmes Pitner explains why he thinks American racism is unique.\n\nLast week in California, three black people - a Jamaican, a Canadian of Nigerian descent, and a London native - were confronted by seven police cars as they checked out of their Airbnb because a white American thought they were robbing the house.\n\nThough they were not American, they were still subjected to racist American stereotypes - and being confronted with tense, potentially life-threatening altercations with police without ever committing a crime.\n\nI've travelled a fair amount around the world, but America's racist status quo remains unique and alarmingly oppressive. American racism is entirely complexion-based and monolithic. One's nationality is immaterial.\n\nYears ago during one of my trips to France, a woman at La Poste refused to sell me stamps because she thought I was African.\n\nWhen she learned that I was American, she apologised and sold me the stamps. The racism I experienced in France is totally unacceptable, but it provided an escape not afforded last week to these three visitors to America.\n\nIn France, nationality usurped race, and while that can have its own problems, it was still very different from the racism back home.\n\nWhen I was in London, I lived in Bethnal Green during the 2011 riots, which started after London police officers killed Mark Duggan, a black man.\n\nAs teenage vandals looted and set my neighbourhood ablaze, I remember casually walking down the street during the chaos and having a London police officer politely ask me to return to my flat. There was no tense exchange, I was not arrested, and I never feared for my life.\n\nDuring the week of the riots, Londoners openly discussed how black people might receive different treatment from law enforcement, but conversations focused on analysing policing techniques, discussing ways to keep teenagers off of the streets during the summer when they do not have school, and catching looters via CCTV.\n\nIn the American discourse, a supposedly inherent danger or criminality of black bodies would have been used to justify the police's killing of Duggan and present the riots as an inevitable by-product of a \"culture of crime\". The killing of Michael Brown and the riots in Ferguson followed this all-too-familiar American script.\n\nRacism towards black people in America has largely nothing to do with immigration or nationality. There is no home country for African-Americans to connect to. Instead it is essentially a status quo of domestic alienation, dehumanisation, criminalisation, and terror. European racism is bad, but it was still more welcoming than America's.\n\nAmerica's systemic racism starts with slavery and the various slave codes - state or federal laws created that codified the inhumane practice of chattel slavery into law. The American South was a \"slave society\", not merely a society with slaves. However, following the abolition of slavery, laws similar to the slave codes continued to oppress black people.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, these \"black codes\" had the explicit purpose of depriving newly freed black Americans of the rights they had won. Black codes varied from state to state, but their legal foundation centred on vagrancy laws that allowed for an African American to be arrested if he was unemployed or homeless. They applied to countless blacks because housing and employment opportunities for freed blacks in the South were almost non-existent after the war.\n\nSupporters of Virginia's Vagrancy Act of 1866, one of these measures, stated that it would reinstitute \"slavery in all but its name\".\n\nWhite Southerners would report blacks for vagrancy, and law enforcement would arrest them and sentence African-Americans to up three months of forced labour on public or private lands.\n\nThe federal government fought against black codes during Reconstruction by electing former abolitionists and freed blacks to public office, and creating laws and adding amendments to the US Constitution to protect the rights of black Americans.\n\nBut following the collapse of Reconstruction in 1877, Southern states brought them back. Black codes became the bedrock of state constitutions. Poll taxes and literacy exams to prevent African Americans from voting soon became the norm. Jim Crow and racial segregation, which governed the South until the 1960s, are outgrowths of those laws.\n\nAs black families fled the South in the 20th Century during the Great Migration, black codes followed them to Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and elsewhere. Black Americans - who were domestic refugees fleeing state-funded terrorism - allegedly brought crime, unemployment, vagrancy, and drugs. Police departments across America responded with more black codes and aggressive policing of black communities.\n\nBlack life has always been criminalised and dehumanised in America. During Barack Obama's presidency, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and countless other unarmed African-Americans were killed by police, but with a black president many Americans felt progress was attainable. Social media raised awareness of these injustices and helped create the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, we have the same type of violence that America has always had, but now we have, at best, an indifferent federal government, and at worst a racist president. Due to this change, more white Americans are emboldened to re-employ black codes.\n\nUnder Obama, social media championed our desire for progress, and today it documents our obvious regression.\n\nLast week in New York City, a black lawyer and her 19-year-old daughter were handcuffed and detained by police after being falsely accused of shoplifting. During the same week, the police were called by a white student at Yale University because a black Yale student was sleeping in the common area in their dormitory. In late April, an African-American family had the police called on them by a white woman for having a cookout in a public park.\n\nFollowing the arrest of two black men for sitting in a Starbucks, and the increased awareness of similar injustices, the world can more clearly see the racist applications of the law that black people constantly face in America. Their arrest was black codes in 2018, but without the three months of forced labour.\n\nTrump's presidency has exacerbated the problem and social media has raised awareness, but employing black codes and masquerading oppression against black people as democratic justice and fair law enforcement has sadly always been America's status quo.\n\nBarrett Holmes Pitner is a writer and journalist based in Washington, DC.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated that Trayvon Martin was killed by police.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Meet Usha Vance, the second lady of the United States\n\nAs US second lady, Usha Vance fills a position traditionally relegated to the sidelines of White House life, which may well suit a political spouse who has never sought out the limelight.\n\nYet, according to her friends, the 39-year-old has played anything but a subordinate role in the rapid rise of her husband, US Vice-President JD Vance.\n\nAnd she has occasionally found herself in the media eye after her husband's rise to power - including with a controversial planned trip to Greenland.\n\nAs a hard-working child of immigrants who has moved between the rarefied cloisters of Cambridge, Yale and the Supreme Court to reach the pinnacle of public life, Usha Vance is for many admirers a living embodiment of the American Dream.\n\nEven her husband, 40, seems overawed by her elite credentials. The former Ohio senator has said her accomplishments leave him feeling \"humbled\".\n\nUsha Vance (née Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India.\n\nShe graduated with a BA in history from Yale University and was also a Gates Scholar at Cambridge University, where she came away with an MPhil in early modern history.\n\nIt was as a student at Yale Law School in 2010 that she met Vance, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nThe experience influenced her future husband's bestselling 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class US Rust Belt. It became a 2020 movie directed by Ron Howard.\n\nIn his book, Vance writes how he \"fell hard\" for Usha at Yale, describing her as a \"genetic anomaly\" because she possessed so many ideal qualities.\n\nVance recalls how he \"violated every rule of modern dating\" by telling her he was in love after one date.\n\nClassmates remember her as someone who stood out in the hyper-competitive world of Ivy League law for her willingness to lend a helping hand.\n\nCharles Tyler, now a law professor, told the BBC that Usha Vance would take time to advise other students on how to apply for the highly prized judicial clerkships that she herself wanted.\n\nAnother classmate, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, recalls a similar lack of sharp elbows in Usha Vance.\n\n\"She was an excellent student, like, top of our law school class,\" she says. \"And sometimes when students are like that, they also, you know, want to maintain an edge over other students.\n\n\"But she was someone who would always share her outlines [class notes]. They were, like, perfectly organised, you know, colour-coded, the works.\"\n\nTyler says Usha Vance has a great deal of influence over her husband, although they \"have a very equal partnership\".\n\nThe other friend concurs.\n\n\"She's always like a sounding board for him,\" she says. \"And, you know, she's been his spirit guide pretty much since Yale.\"\n\nUsha Vance's own political views have been the subject of much conjecture.\n\nWhile her husband has often railed about \"woke\" ideas he says are pushed by Democrats, she was a registered Democrat as recently as a decade ago. Until last summer she was a trial lawyer at San Francisco law firm Munger Tolles & Olson, which boasts its reputation as \"radically progressive\".\n\nYet she once clerked for Brett Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court justice, on the District of Columbia court of appeals, then clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts - both men are pillars of the highest court's conservative majority.\n\nOne thing the power couple do seem very much to agree on is the importance of family.\n\nThe Vances wed in Kentucky in 2014 and have three children: two sons, Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel.\n\nUsha Vance told Fox News last August that her husband's emphasis on the cultural importance of a loving home stems partly from his own upbringing, but also from \"knowing that the stability and sort of calm that I provide in our family life comes from all the support that I had, the faith that things would be OK, because I had people behind me\".\n\nIn India, there is immense pride in Usha Vance's storybook life, not least of all from her own relatives.\n\nHer great-grand-aunt in Andhra Pradesh told the BBC that she is not surprised by the US second lady's success, given that she comes from a long line of Hindu scholars.\n\nChilukuri Santhamma, a physics professor from Andhra Pradesh, said: \"Not everyone can climb to the top in a foreign country and achieve accolades and it's fortunate that Usha has reached to the position that happens for one in millionth.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Soutik Biswas in Delhi\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nTrump's inner circle includes the world's richest man, a former NFL player, and a Wall Street financer.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "'It's simple, really' - why Latinos flocked to Trump's working-class coalition\n\nDonald Trump has soared to a decisive election victory over Kamala Harris, lifted up by some of the very voters that Democrats once relied on.\n\nThe Republican president-elect showed strength with the white working-class voters who first propelled him to the White House in 2016, while racking up huge support from Latino voters and putting in a better-than-expected performance among younger Americans, especially men.\n\nAmong Latinos, a key part of the Democratic voter base for decades, Trump benefited from a mammoth 14 percentage-point bump compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls.\n\nNowhere is Trump's reshaping of the electorate more apparent than in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the highly coveted \"blue wall\" that helped propel Joe Biden to victory in 2020.\n\nThis time, Trump won all three states, crushing Democrats' hopes that Harris could find a path to victory despite early election night losses in the southern states of North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nIn his victory speech in Florida, Trump - who is set to win the popular vote too - credited the result to \"the biggest, the broadest, the most unified coalition\" in American history.\n\n\"They came from all quarters. Union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American,\" he told a roaring crowd. \"We had everybody, and it was beautiful.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the prized battleground state, Trump benefited from a huge swell of support from the state's growing Latino population.\n\nExit polls suggested Latinos in Pennsylvania amounted to about 5% of the total vote. Trump garnered 42% of that vote, compared to 27% when he ran against Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThe polls will continue to change as votes are counted, but are broadly representative of electoral trends.\n\nIn the state's \"Latino belt\" - an eastern industrial corridor that has shifted to the right in the last two elections - some voters said they were not surprised by the result.\n\n\"It's simple, really. We liked the way things were four years ago,\" said Samuel Negron, a Pennsylvania state constable and member of the large Puerto Rican community in the city of Allentown.\n\nMr Negron, and other Trump supporters in the now majority-Latino city, listed other reasons that their community was drifting towards Trump, including social issues and a perception that their family values now align more with the Republican Party.\n\nThe most common factor, however, was the economy - specifically, inflation.\n\n\"Out here, you pay $5 for a dozen eggs. It used to be $1, or even 99 cents,\" Mr Negron added. \"A lot of us have woken up, in my opinion, from Democratic lies that things have been better. We realised things were better then.\"\n\nAhead of the election, polls also suggested that many Latinos - across the US and in Pennsylvania specifically - were drawn to Trump's proposals to block migrants at the US-Mexico border and enact much stricter immigration laws.\n\nDaniel Campo, a Venezuelan-American, said that Trump's claims of creeping \"socialism\" reminded him of the situation he left in his home country.\n\n\"I understand what [migrants] are leaving. But you have to do it the right way. I came the right way,\" he said. \"Things have to be done legally. Many of us were worried that the borders were just open\" under the Biden-Harris administration, he said.\n\nCollectively, the Latino shift towards Trump, his hold on white working-class voters and his increased support among non-college educated voters in general created an insurmountable obstacle for the Harris campaign.\n\nBut Trump also improved his position in some surprising corners.\n\nIn 2020 Joe Biden had a 24-point advantage with voters under 30. This time, that lead shrank to just 11 points. While nationally black voters still overwhelmingly supported Harris (85%), in Wisconsin Trump's support among that demographic more than doubled, from 8% in 2020 to 22% this election.\n\nSome of the most significant battlegrounds in Wisconsin were the three counties surrounding Milwaukee known as the Wow counties - Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington. Harris failed to significantly improve upon Biden's 2020 vote share in these suburban areas, while also slipping in rural, whiter parts of the state dominated by Trump.\n\nPreliminary results also indicate that Harris failed to get as many votes as Biden in Wisconsin's biggest, most diverse city - Milwaukee.\n\nMichael Wagner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said her direct appeals to working-class voters may not have made much of a difference given the national political climate.\n\nTed Dietzler cast his vote in a fire station on the outskirts of the small city of Waukesha.\n\n\"I'm voting Trump because of the border, the economy, and no more wars,\" he said, wearing a Green Bay Packers hat.\n\n\"We saw a huge difference when Trump was president,\" Dietzler said, adding  that he was drawn to Trump's embrace of former Democrats like Robert F Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom appear set to have roles in the Trump administration.\n\n\"Inflation is a big deal, and I don't think Harris quite gets it,\" he said. \"I think we'll all just be better off with Trump back.\"\n\nTrump's national economic messaging hit home with working-class voters in the Midwestern state of Michigan, too.\n\nWith nearly all votes counted, Trump is leading the state that he lost in 2020 by about 85,000 votes. He increased his vote share in rural areas as well as in Macomb County, home to many working-class voters in the Detroit suburbs.\n\nOne of them, Nahim Uddin, a delivery driver and former Ford car-worker, cast his ballot for Trump because he said the former president would drive down prices.\n\n\"I went to go purchase a car - the interest rates had skyrocketed,\" the 34-year-old said. \"That's the whole reason I voted for him.\"\n\nThe same was true for Yian Yian Shein, a small business owner in the city Warren, who said Trump would lower income taxes and help people like her.\n\nDemocrats tried to tailor their economic messages in Michigan, touting their investments in electric car manufacturing while securing an endorsement from United Automobile Workers president Shawn Fain, a frequent Trump critic.\n\nBut Republicans were able to \"neutralise\" those messages by arguing that the transition to electric vehicles would come at the cost of jobs, said Michigan State University professor Matt Grossmann.\n\nUltimately what cost Democrats among blue-collar voters across demographic groups was the perception that they were to blame for high prices and pinched budgets.\n\n\"Largely, voters have felt economic pain due to the post-Covid inflationary period, and they're taking it out on Biden\" and Harris, said University of Michigan professor Jonathan Hanson.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his twice-weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

      "text": "January 6: The day that still divides America, three years on\n\nAmericans watched in horror on 6 January, 2021 as rioters smashed through barricades and ransacked the US Capitol with the goal of stopping the certification of Joe Biden's election.\n\nAs Trump supporters stalked the halls of Congress and lawmakers fled to safe rooms in fear, the country seemed united in its disgust.\n\nYet three years on, the fundamental events of that day, established through eyewitness testimony, thousands of hours of footage, hundreds of indictments and one of the most extensive investigations in federal and congressional history, are no longer agreed upon.\n\nAnd voters will continue to hear two different interpretations of the attack as the 2024 election gets under way.\n\nThe way Donald Trump and Joe Biden talk about 6 January reflects the deep partisan divide that has developed around the riot since it happened.\n\nFor Mr Trump and many in his base, the days since have been a tale of nursed grievances and government conspiracy. The former president continues to make the same false allegation that instigated the attack: That the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nHe has also worked to downplay the Capitol riot's significance and recast the hundreds of supporters convicted of participating in the attack as political prisoners. He has vowed to pardon many if he returns to the White House.\n\nPresident Biden, meanwhile, emphasised his opponent's involvement in the violent assault on Congress in his first major campaign speech on Friday in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, a historic site in the American War of Independence.\n\nHe invoked many of the most terrifying images from the day, such as the rioter who carried a Confederate flag through Congress and the gallows that Mr Trump's supporters erected outside the building.\n\nHis intention, according to his campaign, is to use the anniversary to stress to voters that his predecessor would put US democracy at risk if he wins the election in November.\n\n\"Trump's mob wasn't a peaceful protest, it was a violent assault,\" Mr Biden said on Friday. \"They were insurrectionists, not patriots. They were not there to uphold the Constitution, they were there to destroy the Constitution.\"\n\nHis re-election hopes hang, in part, on there being enough Americans who see the Capitol riot in this way - as a dark chapter of American history and Mr Trump's conduct as disqualifying. That view likely aligns with the Democrats and independents Mr Biden will need to win to keep the White House address for another four years.\n\nA majority of Americans - 55% - believe that 6 January was \"an attack on democracy that should never be forgotten\", according to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll released this week. That includes Democrats and independents.\n\nDisinformation sown by Mr Trump and his supporters appears to have resonated with some Americans, however. A quarter of Americans believe a false conspiracy theory that the FBI instigated the attack, the poll suggested.\n\nAt the same time, a large majority of Republicans have said it is \"time to move on\" from 6 January. And only 18% of Republicans believed the attack was violent, which is an eight-point slip from a 2021 survey.\n\n\"It's very tribal, they're very angry about how [Trump has] been treated,\" David Kochel, a Republican political strategist in Iowa, said of his party's voters.\n\n\"People definitely come to his defence, on everything from legal challenges and all those attacks that they perceive from the mainstream media.\"\n\nIt's a new fault line in American politics, political analysts and pundits said. While the topic has galvanised many in Mr Trump's party, memories of the Capitol riot and attempts at election interference have come back to cut the Republican candidate and kept his allies from major wins at the ballot box.\n\nFocusing on Mr Trump as a threat to democracy helped Democrats deliver a surprisingly successful midterm election in 2022.\n\n\"Politicians tend to use what worked for them in the past, and Biden is thinking: 'Once we make Trump the centre of attention again, voters will come back and vote for me, even though I'm quite unpopular,'\" Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said.\n\nIt is also an angle that has the potential to resonate more emotionally with his voters than boasts about the economy, which have so far fallen flat, one Democrat said.\n\n\"To the extent that Biden can clarify that this election is about preserving democracy... it's both beneficial for democracy, and a winning message electorally as well,\" said Steve Phillips, a Democratic political commentator and host of the \"Democracy in Color\" podcast.\n\nMr Trump, meanwhile, continues to present his own version of events to his voters in social media posts and stump speeches. He has dismissed federal felony charges accusing him of interfering in the 2020 election as a \"witch hunt\".\n\nHe has reframed the rioters as \"patriots\" and \"peaceful people\". In a memorable moment, he has even called 6 January a \"beautiful day\" during a CNN town hall in May.\n\nIt appears the former president has sought to use the four criminal indictments he faces to strengthen the bond with his supporters, saying at one August rally in New Hampshire, \"They want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom.\"\n\n\"Legally speaking and politically speaking, Trump needed to find a way to tell the story of January 6 in a way that would keep his hold on the base of the Republican Party,\" Mr Scala said, \"and he has largely succeeded.\"\n\nWhat do you want to know about the Iowa caucuses and the 2024 US election?

      "text": "Rich CEOs are the big winners of Trump's race war\n\nTo watch the president of the United States prevaricate and dissemble in the face of white supremacist terror is and hopefully always will be shocking. But it's hardly surprising. Donald Trump's march to the Oval Office began with the charge that Barack Obama was secretly born in Kenya, he catapulted to the top of the Republican pack with the charge that Mexican immigrants are predominantly rapists and murderers, and along the way he managed to espouse the view that a federal judge should be disqualified from a case on the basis of ethnicity.\n\nTrump embraces a politics of racial conflict because it works for him.\n\nAs Bloomberg's Joshua Green recounts in his new book Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency , candidate Trump shrugged off media and political attention to his dalliances with the unsavory racist elements of the alt-right. \"We polled the race stuff and it doesn't matter,\" Bannon told Green in September; \"it doesn't move anyone who isn't already in [Clinton's] camp.\"\n\nMore from Vox: Debating the liberal case against identity politics GoDaddy and Google have refused service to a notorious neo-Nazi site This anti-Nazi film went viral after Charlottesville. It may be less effective than it seems.\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the United States contains very few committed and vocal white supremacists (turnout for the Virginia rally was dwarfed by counterprotests nationwide). But it does contain an awful lot of white people. To the extent that politics is seen as a crude zero-sum struggle between racial groups, most of them are going to back the side they perceive as supporting the interests of white people.\n\nYet the reality is that while Trump is inflicting tangible disproportionate harm to racial minorities across the country, he's not doing anything substantive to advance the interests of his typical white supporter either. He's loudly embraced a brand of toxic racial politics while quietly creating a narrow winner's circle of C-suite executive and inheritors of vast fortunes. And it's the loyalty of the business class, not of neo-Nazi street brawlers, that ultimately ensures Trump's position of power and is in turn receiving its due rewards.\n\nTrump's racial policymaking is both sadly real and entirely negative.\n\nFrom the various iterations of his travel ban to stepped-up internal immigration enforcement to wink-nudge encouragement of police brutality and neo-Nazis, Trump is creating an environment that both is subjectively alarming to nonwhites and singles out vulnerable groups for extraordinary levels of suffering.\n\nBut these are not policies that actually do anything to advance the interests of the white population. They don't create jobs, grow the economy, or improve public safety. On immigration, where Trump's approach has taken on the most substance, it rather clearly does the reverse.\n\nYet it's not the case that nobody is helped by Trump's policy agenda. Instead, over and over again Trump has put in place new politics that share a dominant plutocratic theme. Despite his well-documented struggles with the legislative process, Trump has gotten real things done, and they are overwhelmingly things that help incumbent businesses get over on the public interests.\n\nTrump and congressional Republicans, for example, deployed the Congressional Review Act to roll back many of the Obama administration's 2016 regulatory actions. Thanks to Trump:\n\nTrump doesn't tweet about it much, but it turns out that making it harder for people to avoid financial rip-offs is something of a passion for the Trump administration. He has, for example, gutted enforcement of an Obama-era rule that would have made it illegal for financial advisers to deliberately rip off their customers.\n\nNone of this, obviously, has anything to do with helping white people any more than the Trump Federal Communications Commission's ongoing efforts to dismantle net neutrality or the Trump Treasury's efforts to reopen corporate tax loopholes are motivated by concern for the welfare of the European-American population. At the behest of the chemical industry, the Trump Environmental Protection Agency has approved the continued sale of a pesticide that poisons children's brains , and at the behest of for-profit colleges, the Trump Education Department is rolling back regulations offering debt relief to students misled by scam schools.\n\nThe winners here are not \"anxious\" working-class heartlanders, but the owners and managers of big companies who have the government off their backs and barely even need to defend their stances in public with Trump's antics sucking up the bulk of attention.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's racial politics are fundamentally a negative-sum game in which everyone loses, with nonwhites taking it on the chin hardest.\n\nTake the recent announcement that Trump's Justice Department wants to investigate colleges and universities for anti-white discrimination . This is a potential disaster for black and Latino applicants and for diversity in higher education. But it's a mistake to see Trumpism as a boon to white applicants.\n\nRather than redistribute resources from nonwhite to white students, Trump is shrinking the overall higher education pie and simply trying to ensure that black and Latino students bear a disproportionate share of the burden. His higher education budget proposals attracted less attention than the affirmative action story, but they are worth paying attention to since, as described by Adam Harris of the Chronicle of Higher Education , they're an across-the-board disaster for everyone:\n\nPresident Trump's budget would eliminate the public-service loan-forgiveness program, subsidized Stafford Loans, and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants; begin to phase out the National Endowments for the Arts and for the Humanities; and allow the Perkins Loan program to expire. It would also cut spending in half on Federal Work-Study programs, slash the budget of the National Institutes of Health by a fifth, eliminate programs that foster foreign-language study, and reduce spending that supports international-education programs and exchanges, such as the Fulbright Scholar program, by 55 percent.\n\nTrump's stepped-up deportations are, of course, primarily hurting undocumented immigrants and their families. But credible analysis from conservative think tanks as well as progressive ones has concluded that trying to squeeze millions of long-time residents out of the country will make the typical American poorer. Trump's plans to curtail legal immigration will, likewise, make native-born Americans less prosperous .\n\nMeanwhile, for all Trump's notional concern for the impact of immigrants on working-class Americans, his budget proposal would devastate Medicaid and the earned income tax credit while showering the top 1 percent with tax cuts .\n\nTrumpism, in short, is fundamentally a hustle. It's essentially a bet that if you punch nonwhite America in the face, white America will be so busy gawking they won't notice their pockets are being picked too. And history teaches that it might work.\n\nLyndon Johnson, speaking at the Jung Hotel in New Orleans during the 1964 campaign told an extraordinary secondhand story about what an old Southern senator allegedly told former House leader Sam Rayburn (D-TX) when Rayburn first got to Washington and called on him:\n\nHe was talking about the economy and what a great future we could have in the South, if we could just meet our economic problems, if we could just take a look at the resources of the South and develop them. And he said, \"Sammy, I wish I felt a little better. I would like to go back to old\" - and I won't call the name of the State; it wasn't Louisiana and it wasn't Texas - \"I would like to go back down there and make them one more Democratic speech. I just feel like I have one in me. The poor old State, they haven't heard a Democratic speech in 30 years. All they ever hear at election time is 'nigger, nigger, nigger!'\"\n\nJohnson, himself a Southerner, bookended the story with a vow to enforce the Civil Rights Act as \"the law of the land\" but also said that \"I am not going to let them build up the hate and try to buy my people by appealing to their prejudice.\"\n\nThe argument of both Johnson and the possibly apocryphal senator, in other words, was that Jim Crow, though obviously distinctly burdensome on the black South, had also been detrimental to the white South. Rather than investing in its people and developing its full economic potential, the South spent decades propping up a nationwide conservative coalition whose policy preferences kept the region poor and backward. Johnson was reelected that year in a landslide, but he didn't convince the white voters of Louisiana (or Mississippi or Alabama or Georgia or South Carolina) who backed the GOP for the first time that year and have done so loyally ever since.\n\nBack in February of 2016, Ian Haney-López and Heather McGhee urged Bernie Sanders to adopt this style of argument as a means to improve his standing with voters of color in the Democratic primary.\n\n\"The progressive movement,\" they wrote, \"should expand from a vision of racism as violence done solely to people of color to include a conception of racism as a political weapon wielded by elites against the 99 percent, nonwhite and white alike.\"\n\nSanders didn't really do this and lost the primary while garnering very few nonwhite voters, and then Clinton proceeded to wage a general election campaign that largely inverted this advice. Seeking to counter Trump by assembling a broad coalition of decency, Clinton focused on Trump's personal unfitness and racism while downplaying traditional policy issues. It didn't work. But it came close enough to working, and Clinton suffered from enough idiosyncratic problems (James Comey, etc.) that it's tempting - especially in the wake of the spectacular events of Charlottesville - to some to try again. But it would be a mistake.\n\nThe key reality of Trump-era politics is that an American business elite that was never sold on candidate Trump has come to embrace a President Trump who embraces it back.\n\nWhen invited to do so back in June, the leaders of America's biggest high-tech companies - including shops like Google that have gone to great lengths to cultivate a progressive image - duly paid court to Trump and offered him the requisite flattery. And why shouldn't they? Trump has lined up behind the business-friendly approach to antitrust law that they crave , and the enormous corporate income tax that he's proposing would be especially beneficial to Apple , Facebook , Microsoft , Google , and other highly profitable multinationals whose largely noncorporeal businesses are ideally suited to various international tax shenanigans.\n\nAs Trump likes to remind us, under his watch stock prices and profits are up.\n\n@realDonaldTrump:  Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!\n\n@realDonaldTrump:  \"Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now.\" Thank you Stuart Varney @ foxandfriends Jobs are starting to roar,watch!\n\nJob growth has slowed relative to where it was last year, but a light regulatory touch and some tax cuts is just what the doctor ordered as far as economic elites are concerned.\n\nIt's completely impossible to ignore Trump's outrages and provocations on race, especially in light of the quite literally deadly consequences they can have. The Trump show as a culture war phenomenon is repugnant.\n\nBut it serves a real function, maintaining Trump's electoral base without requiring him to take the trouble of helping them or to put in the work to convince them that his business-friendly policymaking is actually correct. The interests of the wealthy are being served at the expense of children's neurological development, funding for higher education and health care, consumers' interest in fair investment opportunities, internet users' privacy rights, and dozens of other public interest priorities. The failure of much of the public to see that is integral to Trump's mass political support, but the business community's acute awareness of it is integral to his continued backing by congress and the institutional Republican Party.\n\nThose of us who are troubled by what Trump is doing to American culture and national identity need to clearly identify and understand the full constellation of forces that drive Trumpism and derive concrete material benefits from Trump's presence in office. Trump's racial war is real, but the real winners are flying private jets, not marching with torches.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Steve Bannon's 'economic nationalism' is total nonsense\n\nFormer chief strategist and campaign manager Steve Bannon 's departure from the Trump White House surely does not mean an end to the demagogic racial politics in which Donald Trump has trafficked for decades.\n\nIt does, however, seem to mark the final eclipse of the notion that Trump would move beyond demagoguery and construct a vision of \"nationalist\" economic policy that would differ in a meaningful way from standard-issue pro-business Republicanism. Bannon, on his way out the door, appeared serious about this idea - phoning up progressive magazine editor Robert Kuttner to try to find common ground on trade policy and explain that \"to me, the economic war with China is everything.\"\n\nKuttner's view of why this is unworkable stems from skepticism that \"possible convergence of views on China trade might somehow paper over the political and moral chasm on white nationalism.\"\n\nMore from Vox: The case against Trump's decision to keep fighting in Afghanistan, explained by Trump Donald Trump looked at the eclipse without glasses The time Obamacare's opponents won by losing\n\nJulius Krein, who tried to position himself as a rare pro-Trump intellectual who favored the then-candidate's brand of nationalist politics during the 2016 campaign, gave up the ghost in a New York Times op-ed last week . He denounced \"never-ending chaos\" inside the administration and \"unforced errors,\" arguing that Trump's \"only talent appears to be creating grotesque media frenzies - just as all his critics said.\"\n\nRoss Douthat as early as May flagged indications that Trump \"never really believed in Trumpism himself.\" As Ramesh Ponnuru and Rich Lowry wrote that same month, the president certainly never seems to have taken the time to flesh out what \"a Trumpist philosophy\" that would feature skepticism of trade, immigration, and foreign intervention, a moderate social conservatism, and support for government activism to benefit the working class\" would look like in details.\n\nThe reality, however, is that \"economic nationalism\" has grave flaws as an ideology beyond Trump's racism, lack of policy knowledge, and personal indiscipline. The idea that the United States as a whole is locked in zero-sum economic competition with other countries or that average Americans could become wealthier at the expense of foreigners is simply wrong.\n\nAt best, it's an analytical error born of bias or confusion about relative versus absolute living standards. At worst, it's a con job - an effort to distract middle- and working-class Americans from very real questions about the domestic distribution of economic resources by casting aspersions on foreigners.\n\nThe media, for understandable reasons, likes to cover controversy more than consensus. But attention to controversy can in its own way be misleading. And the extent of expert consensus on the economic impact of both trade and immigration is important to understand.\n\nProbably the most prominent highly credible critique of China trade policy comes from David Autor , an economist whose work with David Dorn and Gordon Hanson argues that the impact of trade with China was much bigger and in some ways much more negative than experts predicted before the fact.\n\nTheir argument is, specifically, that the impact on manufacturing workers and heavily manufacturing-focused communities was too big for them to successfully adjust. The result was a \"China Shock\" that was large and semi-permanent, rather than small and transitory as previously thought. But even if that's true, the fact remains that most Americans don't work in manufacturing or live in heavily manufacturing-focused communities, and we've benefitted from trade with China.\n\n\"It doesn't mean the aggregate gains aren't positive,\" Autor told my colleague Zeeshan Aleem in March . \"Your and my cost of living might be a couple hundred dollars a year lower because of China.\" The problem is that these are small gains spread across hundreds of millions of people counterposed against much larger losses for a much smaller group of people.\n\nJonathan Rothwell of Gallup and the George Washington University Institute of Public Policy has some contrary research that says this is wrong and doesn't properly account for weak overall macroeconomic conditions in the mid-aughts.\n\nIt's a fascinating and in some ways very important dispute, but both sides of the argument agree that the typical American was made better-off by trade with China. By the same token, the entire bitter argument among labor economists about immigration and wages is about whether or not immigrants have depressed the incomes of native-born high school dropouts. This is another fascinating, and in some ways very important, dispute. But, again, only 8 percent of the native population lacks a high school diploma . Both sides agree that most Americans are benefitting from immigration.\n\nNone of that is to say that American public policy with regard to trade or immigration has been perfect over the past generation or so. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research argues that \"globalization, meaning the greater integration of economies across the world, could have been designed an infinite number of ways.\"\n\nIn particular, he argued, it could have been designed in a way that was less beneficial to the upper classes in the United States and more beneficial to the working and middle class.\n\nFor example, policymakers could, and he argues should, have \"focused on removing professional licensing barriers to make it as easy as possible for doctors, dentists, and other highly paid professional to train to U.S. standards and practice in the United States.\"\n\nThese are critically important ideas to debate and consider. Globalization is, fundamentally, an enormous opportunity for almost everyone in the world. But the United States has, thus far, primarily taken advantage of it in order to obtain cheaper manufacturing goods for domestic consumers. That's fine as far as it goes, but fundamentally, inability to afford manufactured goods is not a big problem for more Americans. Deploying the power of globalization to make health care services cheaper and more convenient, by contrast, would be a huge win for the vast majority of the population.\n\nBut note that just as manufacturing-focused globalization hasn't been bad for most Americans, shifting emphasis to professional services would hardly hurt foreigners. Creating broad and clear pathways for foreigners to train to US standards and then move here to work as doctors, dentists, and nurses would be great for most Americans while also creating great new economic opportunities for foreigners. All policy choices involve winners and losers, but the tradeoff is almost never the kind of strict country versus country battle that Bannonism implies.\n\nThe concept of \"economic nationalism\" is, fundamentally, a dodge. The substantive promise and political peril of reengineering globalization is that it would alter the domestic distribution of wealth and income. Keeping doctors scarce and manufactured goods plentiful is good for doctors, and if you try to change it the American Medical Association will try to stop you.\n\nIn that sense, the economic aspects of globalization are fundamentally similar to domestic economic controversies over taxes and spending. Either you believe in trying to rewrite the rules of the economy so that the gains from growth are less hyper-concentrated among one or 2 percent of the population or else you're not. And here, tellingly, Bannon has very little to say on this. And what he does have to say would be devastating to the interests of most Americans.\n\nWhen complaining in his Weekly Standard exit interview that his former colleagues in the White House are \"going to try to moderate him,\" Bannon predicts that among other dire consequences, Trump will likely \"sign a clean debt ceiling\" without agreeing to the Freedom Caucus's extreme fiscal policy. This means that despite his occasional flirtations with antitrust regulation for big tech companies , he's happy to embrace draconian austerity budgets that would drastically increase child poverty and eviscerate the American educational system.\n\nTo the extent that there's any heterodoxy about domestic economic policy from Bannon, it's simply as an extension of culture war posturing - a way of lashing out at Silicon Valley's \"woke\" pretenses - rather than any vision of economic uplift.\n\nPossessing as he does the soul of a con artist rather than the pretenses of an intellectual, Trump himself is much better positioned than Bannon to recognize the full potential of \"economic nationalism\" as a useful distraction tactic but not much more.\n\nWhile Americans who follow politics were obsessing over the latest ups and downs of the Trump Show this summer, real policy changes that are important to wealthy business interests continued to roll out of DC. In late July, for instance, the Senate confirmed David Bernhardt to serve as deputy secretary of the interior. Bernhardt was previously a lobbyist with the firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where he represented, among other clients, Nestlé Waters. Nestlé is not particularly nationalistic, but they do enjoy selling bottled water. Luckily for them, last Thursday the Interior Department decided to reverse restrictions on bringing bottled water into national parks .\n\nThe Trump administration was also hard at work last week on making it easier for nursing homes that provide substandard care to avoid legal liability . Like Trump's effort to let Sinclair Broadcasting violate longstanding media concentration rules , make workplaces less safe for the people who work in them , reduce workers' overtime pay , and make it easier for financial advisers to rip off their clients , there hasn't been a lot of tweeting about these two regulatory actions.\n\nInstead, Trump feeds the public a steady diet of racial conflict hoping that if he punches nonwhite America hard enough, white America will be so busy gawking they won't notice their pockets are being picked too.\n\nThis is a time-honored hustle in American politics, and Trump grasps its operation intuitively. And he also grasps in a way that Bannon may not that \"economic nationalism\" is useful as an extension of the hustle and no further. Adding immigrants and the Chinese to the scapegoat list alongside the traditional African-American targets makes for a more compelling narrative, and it's let him bring the scam to parts of the urban North that have traditionally been too overwhelmingly white for the standard race hustle to seem compelling.\n\nBannon's pretension to constructing something larger than that failed mostly because of his own interpersonal conflicts with other members of Trump's team. But there's nothing to mourn in the failure to build a more substantive vision of \"economic nationalism\" because the vision itself never made sense.\n\nC ommentary by Matthew Yglesias, a writer at Vox.

It's going the opposite way now. White unemployment is going down, African American unemployment is going down. That's a plus-plus that you can't argue with.\"\n\n\"I give the president credit for doing positive things; when I see a president doing positive things, particularly for African Americans,\" added Johnson, who made history as America's first black billionaire when he sold BET to Viacom in 2001. Shortly after the sale, he started the investment firm The RLJ Cos. (Johnson is no longer on the Forbes billionaires list .)\n\nJohnson, who describes himself as a friend of the president, actually supported Hillary Clinton for the White House in 2016. Since then, Johnson has been complimentary of the Trump economy. Shortly after the election, Johnson said he turned down a position in Trump's Cabinet, not over politics but because he said he could not deal with the government red tape.\n\nThe RLJ Cos. founder made headlines in July , and drew a gushing tweet from Trump, over praise he heaped on the president in a CNBC interview, saying \"I think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy. I think business people have more confidence in the way the economy is going.\"\n\nTWEET\n\nDuring that July CNBC interview, Johnson also said the Democratic Party has \"moved too far left.\" At the time, he stopped short of endorsing any candidate, and Thursday on \"Squawk Box\" he reiterated his refusal to indicate which candidate he's leaning toward in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHowever, Johnson did say, \"It's time for African Americans to think in terms of their permanent interests, not being an appendage to either party, either Democrats or Republicans.\"\n\nWith blacks historically voting Democratic, Johnson said he would advise Trump to bring African Americans to the White House to meet with the president and other Republicans and pitch them on the GOP vision for helping them.\n\nHowever, Johnson said, \"I don't think it's fundamentally in the best interest of African Americans to be locked up in one party, particularly in an environment where everything is [a] zero-sum game.\"\n\nBy pushing both parties to address the interests of African Americans, Johnson said, \"We can be the balance of power.\"\n\n\"What the Congressional Black Caucus said in 1971 should be the philosophy for African Americans today: 'No permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests,'\" he concluded.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

But even then, Rogers said there must be a recognition that disparities around 401(k) contributions exist, too.\n\n\"One of the ways to get progress is for all major corporations and anchor institutions in our community to understand there is a problem, and that their African American employees, even though they might be at similar percentage comparability when it comes to joining the 401(k) plan, when you look behind the surface you'll see that African Americans will often have much less saved,\" said Rogers, who founded Ariel in 1983.\n\nChicago-based Ariel - the first African American-led firm to have a family of mutual funds - recently released a survey conducted with Charles Schwab that looked at the wealth gap between Black and white Americans, as well as their exposure to the stock market.\n\nIt found that while Black Americans now report similar ownership levels of 401(k) plans as white respondents, at 53% compared with 55%, respectively, differences in savings rates persist. According to the report, white Americans participating in 401(k) plans invest 26% more in their retirement accounts each month than Black counterparts, translating to a monthly difference of $291 versus $231.\n\nRogers said there are a number of factors contributing to Black Americans accumulating less in retirement savings than white Americans. \"We will be in the most conservative investment options, the most conservative funds. We're much more likely to take hardship loans, early withdrawals to help support expanded families,\" Rogers contended.\n\nFocusing on disparities in 401(k) plans is significant because retirement accounts made up the largest share of U.S. household wealth at 32.8%, according to an August 2020 report from the Census Bureau. It used data from the end of 2017 and excludes the top 1% of households. Home equity was second, accounting for almost 29% of household wealth, follow by stocks and mutual funds at 10.2%.\n\n\"It's really a responsibility of these anchor institutions to put extra effort on really making sure their minority employees are comfortable in the investments within that 401(k) plan,\" Rogers said. \"Maybe there should be more minority-owned options within the 401(k) plan that will get minority employees excited about it.\"\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve's 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances , white families in the U.S. have a median wealth of $188,200 compared with a median wealth of $24,100 for Black families. That current landscape is the result of myriad inequities adding up throughout U.S. history, Rogers said, while noting the housing crisis and the coronavirus pandemic have more recently served to exacerbate the problem.\n\n'The wealth gap has been growing larger and larger every year between the African American and the white America. We've been behind for a very, very long time,\" Rogers said. \"Because of the way we came to this country, the historic racism and Jim Crow laws and things that really impacted us, the restrictive covenants that didn't allow us to buy housing in the fast-growing parts of communities, we were way behind the race when it came to wealth, and it continues to get worse.\"\n\nRogers also was interviewed Wednesday for a CNBC PRO Talks.

      "text": "Trump's next move: Acting presidential?\n\nSuper Tuesday has come and gone. Supertrump continues to  wreak havoc on the GOP 's perception of itself, as he promises to  transform the right into a mirror image of the left. The  past few days confirm that each reflection of leftist values  seems to increase his support among primary voters-while  alienating those who have long seen themselves as the moral and  intellectual leaders of the conservative movement.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump claimed-implausibly-that he lacked the  information necessary to form an immediate opinion about David  Duke and the Ku Klux Klan, though he did eventually disavow their  support.  Voters across the Super Tuesday states appeared to  pay the incident little heed. Trump's best showing of the  evening-by far-came in liberal Massachusetts, hardly  Klan country even when the KKK was an important force in American  politics.\n\nIn several southern states, such as Georgia,  Trump won every key demographic, including those with the highest  levels of education and income.  Pundits and activists from  across the political spectrum, on the other hand, were withering  in their criticism. The differences between critiques from  the left and the right were profound.\n\nLarge parts of the right detest identity politics, decrying the  race riots of the past few years and the segregationist campus  \"safe spaces.\" The right sees President 's embrace of  Al Sharpton and his ilk, and the racial policies of the Holder  Justice Department, as problems, not solutions. The right  opposes the very categorizations that enable affirmative action  or racial set-asides.\n\nThe narrowly focused condemnation  from the right thus targeted Trump's coddling of bigotry. The right believes that history has relegated the KKK to a  small fringe niche, and that only minimal effort is necessary to  keep it there; it criticized Donald Trump for failing to exert  even that minimal effort.\n\nLarge parts of the left see identity politics as a solution to  structural racism and the persistence of \"white privilege,\"  promoting street riots to protest a widespread culture of racial  injustice and creating safe spaces to shelter minorities from an  enraged, despondent white majority.\n\nThe left enshrines racial categorizations, insisting that they  are a corrective to past discrimination and an inoculation  against its return.  The broad and sweeping condemnation  from the left thus targeted Trump's millions of supporters.   The left sees the KKK as a sleeper movement set to awaken  upon hearing the appropriately coded dog whistle; it criticized  Donald Trump for whistling.\n\nIn short, the right condemns white supremacists because they are  supremacist. The left condemns white supremacists because they  are white. That difference has provided the GOP with a moral high  ground.  Any politician unable to condemn the KKK  immediately and unequivocally has fallen deep into the abyss of  identity politics. Trump's hesitance seemed to confirm the left's  invidious stereotypes of \"white America\" and made the dream of a  color-blind, character-based society that much harder to obtain.\n\nOf even greater concern to the soon-to-be-former Republican  thought leadership, identity politics is but part of a coherent  program with a clear economic component.  Free market  capitalism promotes economic growth that enables optimism,  tolerance, and greater social harmony as people become more  willing to share the benefits of a growing pie.\n\nDistributionist economics-whether based in explicit  socialism, punitive taxation, cronyism, subsidization, or  protectionism-promotes divisiveness and violent competition  among groups clinging tightly to their meager pieces of a  shrinking pie.\n\nThe Democratic commitment to economic distribution and identity  politics is solid. The Trump campaign is bringing both into the  Republican fold, where they have long been unwelcome.   Rather than condemning the Democratic embrace of race  baiters, Trump seems disturbingly content to wink at race baiters  of a different complexion. Such a response is as troubling as it  is predictable.\n\nWriting as Republicans who had long hoped that January 20, 2017  might usher in a new era promoting economic growth, respect for  traditional values, and a restoration of America's global  leadership, we understand the increasingly vocal concerns of  those who have shared those hopes. Will the Trump/ Clinton race that appears increasingly likely after each new primary  freeze out economic growth and individual character?\n\nCome  November, will we face the terrible choice of supporting the  Democratic effort to lock in place the identity and distribution  agenda it has developed over the years or acceding to the right's  new embrace of these terrible leftist ideas?\n\nPerhaps not.  Perhaps, if nominated, Trump will turn out to  be the con man he stands accused of being-in the very best  way.  As a consummate performer, Trump may realize that  Republican primary candidate, general election candidate, and  President of the United States are very different roles.\n\nIt  remains entirely possible that Trump's governance will build upon  the finest traditions of the right rather than reflect the basest  instincts of the left. The very different tone Trump took  in his press conference last night provided a glimmer of hope. Even Megyn Kelly of Fox News, whose differences with Trump  have made headlines for months, noted that-for the first  time-Trump sounded \"presidential.\"  Perhaps the  evolution of his character has begun.\n\nCommentary by Bruce Abramson, Ph.D., J.D. and Jeff  Ballabon.

      "text": "Charles Murray's 'How Thick Is Your Bubble' Quiz\n\nCharles Murray is back. The co-author of \"The Bell Curve\"-a book you've undoubtedly heard of and almost certainly never read-has just come out with his new book, \"Coming Apart: The State of White America 1960-2010.\"\n\nMurray's argument this time around is that the cognitive-cultural divide he first identified in The Bell Curve is rapidly growing wider.\n\n\"As the new upper class increasingly consists of people who were born into upper-middle-class families and have never lived outside the upper-middle-class bubble, the danger increases that the people who have so much in?uence on the course of the nation have little direct experience with the lives of ordinary Americans, and make their judgments about what's good for other people based on their own highly atypical lives,\" Murray writes in the book.\n\nMurray argues that the balkanization of the new upper class has led not only the upper class being ignorant of other Americans. It has also led to a lack of awareness on the part of the new upper class of the depth and breadth of their ignorance.\n\n\"It is not a problem if truck drivers cannot empathize with the priorities of Yale professors. It is a problem if Yale professors, or producers of network news programs, or CEOs of great corporations, or presidential advisers cannot empathize with the priorities of truck drivers,\" Murray writes.\n\nThis is not necessarily a completely new problem. I saw it when I was briefly at Harvard in the mid-1990s. Very few of my classmates seemed to have any prolonged association with anyone of less than ordinary intelligence or social standing. Most of their friendships and family relationships were with people of above average intelligence, social status or wealth.\n\nBut Murray says it is getting worse.\n\nBrian Williams of Rock Center recently interviewed Murray about his book. It's good interview, in part because Williams seems genuinely interested in Murray's thesis (rather than just, you know, pointing and screaming about racism). ( Full disclosure : Rock Center airs on NBC, which is part of NBC Universal, which owns CNBC. As far as I know, no one involved in Rock Center gives a damn what I think about the show, Brian Williams or Charles Murray.)\n\nThey touch on one of my favorite parts of \"Coming Apart\"-the Bubble Quiz. Murray suspects that almost all readers of his book will come from the isolated upper classes he is writing about. And he has created a quiz intended to measure just how out of touch with the rest of America his readers might be.\n\nYou can take the entire quiz right here . It's only 25 questions but the scoring is a bit complex. You'll need a pen and paper to keep track of your answers. It will probably only take you about 5 or six minutes.\n\nI scored a 26 out of a possible 100, which puts me between these two types:\n\nA ?rst- generation upper-middle- class person with middle-class parents.\n\nRange: 11-80. Typical: 33.\n\nA second- generation (or more) upper-middle-class person who has made a point of getting out a lot.\n\nRange: 0-43. Typical: 9.\n\nThe second category sounds closer to my personal background, I guess.\n\nAlternatively, you can take this online version of the quiz , which has fewer and simpler questions but seems to get the spirit of Murray's test about right.\n\nMy results: \"On a scale from 0 to 20 points, where 20 signifies full engagement with mainstream American culture and 0 signifies deep cultural isolation within the new upper class bubble, you scored between 5 and 8. In other words, you can see through your bubble, but you need to get out more.\"\n\nAgain, that seems pretty close to being correct.\n\nLeave your score in comments.\n\nFollow John on Twitter .

      "text": "Beto O'Rourke begins filling in the blanks on the economy, taxes and entitlements\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's viability has become a giant question mark in the 2020 presidential race. In 2018, his impassioned Senate campaign against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz made him a national Democratic celebrity and a fund-raising sensation. He narrowly lost, but months later launched a White House bid that, for his backers, evoked memories of Barack Obama a dozen years earlier.\n\nSo far, however, O'Rourke has lost momentum rather than gained it. He remains mired in single-digits among Democratic primary voters nationally and in the crucial early states of the nomination contest. The breakout moment of his first debate came at his expense, when fellow Texan Julian Castro chided him for not doing \"your homework\" on an immigration issue.\n\nYet the one-time punk musician and small business owner, 46, still displays the charisma and youthful energy in town hall gatherings with voters that have become his signature. He has built substantial campaign teams in early states such as Iowa and South Carolina in search of a summer kick-start.\n\nO'Rourke sat down with Editor at Large John Harwood at El Paso's L&J Café to discuss his campaign and his views on the economy. What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their discussion.\n\nJohn Harwood: A couple weeks ago I was with you in Iowa. A woman introduced you there and meant it to be a compliment. She said, \"Beto O'Rourke is a blank slate that we can project our hopes and dreams onto.\" Is that lack of definition a problem for your campaign?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I hope what she meant by that was, Beto O'Rourke has shown up to our community to listen to us. And he came not just to tell us everything that he's going to do for this country, but to bring every single one of us into the solutions. And not just to his solutions - to our solutions.\n\nSo, you know, in some of these smaller, more rural communities in Iowa, I'm listening to farmers who understand rural policy and agricultural policy better than I ever could comin' from El Paso.\n\nThey want me to come in and acknowledge the challenge and then ask them how we meet that challenge together?\n\nJohn Harwood: But do you think that you have defined, in a clear way for people, why you're running and what your core idea is?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: You just met my daughter, Molly. I was telling you about my kids Ulysses and Henry, her brothers. They're counting on me, and they're counting on us at this moment. Earlier today we were in a shelter in Ciudad Juarez, where this country, through the current administration, has turned back asylum seekers throughout their most desperate and vulnerable moments who are penniless and frightened, who are prey to those who will try to take advantage of them in Juarez. Because we, the wealthiest, the most powerful country, one comprised of immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, cannot find the political will to do the right thing.\n\nAll that is on my conscience and it's the judgment of my kids that I fear. I want to make sure that we sit up to do the right thing. When it comes to separated families and kids who've been locked up, when it comes to a system of health care in this country where tens of millions are unable to get the care they need to be well enough to live to their best, the challenge of climate, which is consuming entire communities and going to get exponentially worse if we don't change course, I want to make sure that we're up to this moment.\n\nNot one party, not half the country - all of us are brought into the solutions. The way that I'm running this campaign, the way that I've always served, the way that we ran in Texas, was to write nobody off, take no one for granted, bring everybody in. That's the only way you could beat [President Donald] Trump, the only way you beat these other challenges that we face.\n\nJohn Harwood: Let me ask you about definition with respect to the economy. I was on your website, clicked on the issue tab. There wasn't a listing for the economy. And I wonder why that is. You're a small business guy.\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Absolutely. I think about the fact that we've organized ourselves in a capitalist economy, and so capital is central to a person's success. And yet so many perspective entrepreneurs have been locked out of any access to capital. It might be where they were raised, who their folks are, the chances they've had in their life. Might also be the color of their skin and the fact that they've been redlined out of access to that.\n\nJohn Harwood: But why isn't there an economic tab there?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: We'll get it fixed on the website. It's obviously fundamental to our success as a country. More people having the chance to become small business owners and create jobs and offer their services and their food to the folks in this community and this country.\n\nBut also making sure that we acknowledge that there are people who are on the outside looking in to the world's greatest economy with no meaningful way to participate - who might be paid $7.25 an hour, the minimum wage, and so therefore are working a second or even a third job to make ends meet for themselves or for their kids.\n\nYou have states like mine in Texas where you have a so-called right to work that denies people the right to organize and to use their leverage and the value that they bring to the workforce to exact better working conditions, better wages, better services. I want to make sure that we change all of that, and we change that for the better, and bring every single person into this economy. Then it really works.\n\nJohn Harwood: The big divide in the campaign is between people like, say, Elizabeth Warren who say, \"We need deep, fundamental structural change in how corporations are run and our tax system. In our regulatory system,\" and those who say \"We can move more slowly and more incrementally.\" It feels to me as if you are trying to straddle those two things.\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I feel like I'm just trying to do the right thing. I'm listening to people who are trying to make ends meet. Hearing from teachers in a kindergarten classroom that some kids at the age of five are already ten months behind in reading comprehension.\n\nI bet you that those are the kids of parents who are working two or three jobs to make ends meet and don't have the luxury, as Amy and I have had, to read to our kids before the first day of kindergarten or first grade. So all this stuff is connected.\n\nSo when we call for expanding public education so that we have pre-K universally for every child in every part of the country, it's addressing that. When we're talking about a $15 an hour minimum wage, it is also addressing that. When we talk about guaranteed high quality universal healthcare, it is addressing that. That child's ability to be well enough to learn during that next day of school.\n\nAnd all these are things that I've heard from people all over this country. So I don't know where you want to fix me on the political spectrum or relative to the other candidates. I just don't define myself in opposition to them, but instead in terms of what I want to achieve.\n\nJohn Harwood: At the debate the other night you got a question about the 70% tax rate. And you didn't say that was too high, you didn't say it was about right, or too low. Why not?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I should have. It's too high. I think in my 60 seconds of trying to get an answer in, and trying to root my answer in the fundamental inequality of this economy and the inability of far too many of our fellow Americans to be included in this economy - which is, you know, central to anything else that we're going to address, including the tax rate - I didn't answer the direct question. So if you're asking' me, no, I don't think we should have a 70% tax rate.\n\nJohn Harwood: What sounds right to you?\n\nBeto O'Rourke:\n\nI think you at a minimum roll back the worst elements of the Trump tax cuts. So the top marginal tax rate back up to 39%.\n\nIf you were to do that, and in addition make some other structural changes to our tax code - the corporate tax rate, which was brought down from 35% to 21%, bring that back up to 28% - great place to start. And as you probably know, you generate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years. If you were to tax capital at the same rate that you tax ordinary wage income, like the waiters who are working here, you also get to some greater structural correction to a very unequal economy, and you generate the revenue necessary.\n\nJohn Harwood: You mean capital gains and dividends?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Absolutely. And I want to make sure that I get this point across. You generate the revenue that you need to pay for the investments in education, in health care, in the affordability of college, but you also reduce the concentration of wealth and power and privilege that really defines this age in America in a way that we haven't seen since the last Gilded Age of more than 100 years ago. Both are necessary to ensure that this democracy, this country will work for everybody. If you increase a wealth tax at the inter-generational transfer of wealth within families.. more so than -\n\nJohn Harwood: You mean the estate tax and the step-up basis.\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Absolutely. You tax at the real value of that given asset. Not just, you know -\n\nJohn Harwood: So you'd get rid of the step-up basis?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Absolutely. If you also look at where we're spending money today, and how we've accrued the debt and the current deficit that we're running, it's inescapable that the wars that we have waged, and the fact that we've been in Iraq, for example, for the last 28 years and Afghanistan for 18 years, and in so many other countries around the planet - ending those wars, bringing those service members back home, finding peaceful, non-violent, diplomatic resolution to our foreign policy priorities also produces an extraordinary savings, which could be directed towards investments that we want to make in this country. Infrastructure, education, health care - the things that will make this country stronger and allow more people to participate in the economy.\n\nJohn Harwood: You proposed a tax the other day to fund veterans' initiatives - to tax families that do not have family members in service. When I talked to economists, they thought that's awfully complicated. What constitutes service? How far does family reach? Is that a fully-baked idea?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Yeah. Right now we've asked fewer than 1% of our fellow Americans to serve in the wars since 9/11, and the financial cost of that we placed on this country's credit card to be borne by this and future generations. What I'm proposing is that the next time we decide to go to war, we fully pay for all the costs of that war, including making sure that we've made investments in the care for veterans who will have borne the battle.\n\nThose Americans who served in Vietnam waited 40 years for this country to treat exposure to Agent Orange as a presumptive condition for the cancers that they were dying from. Meaning for four decades the VA provided no meaningful help to hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans. It's been 28 years since Gulf War veterans were exposed to toxins that led to a Gulf War illness. I want to make sure that we're investing right up front when we go to those wars, and the money is deposited in a veterans' trust fund.\n\nJohn Harwood: But have you and the economic advisors you're relying on thought through how you define what families are exempt? Does your dad count, or is it just your kid?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: If you are a veteran, if you're an active duty service member, you're not going to pay into this veterans' trust fund, because you've already paid with your life. If you're an immediate family member in that household - because we know that when someone from a household serves this country and goes to war, everybody in that household serves this country and goes to war. So your spouse is not subject to this tax.\n\nIt ensures that those who have already paid the price are recognized for their service. Those who are currently paying it by being deployed have an investment made to ensure that we're there to meet them when they come back. We're going to spare no expense, bear any burden.\n\nBut that the other Americans who have been able to not have to bear the costs of these wars have to contribute something as well.\n\nBeyond generating the revenues we need to pay for the services that those veterans have earned, here's what else it does: I hope it causes us to pause before we go into the next war because we look at the full accounting and cost for what it really takes to pay for not just the bombs and bullets and the deployments, but those veterans who return over the course of their lives. The PTSD, TBI, military sexual trauma that they incur in service to this country - making sure that we're there for them when they come back.\n\nJohn Harwood: As a member of Generation X, do you subscribe to the argument that baby boomers as a generation have made selfish policy choices that cut their own taxes, that ran up debt, that emphasized consumption rather than resolving a lot of problems?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: No. I mean if we get to pointing fingers at different generations, or blaming our fellow Americans based on a difference in age or geography or really anything else, we just further divide an already polarized country.\n\nJohn Harwood: But when you think about the tremendous liability the government has when this very large baby-boom generation retires, and the fact that there are fewer workers to pay the taxes to support those benefits as they retire, do you see an issue of generational justice in that? Or injustice?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I see an opportunity for us to figure out the answers to some pretty significant challenges posed by this generation retiring. You know, within 15 years it's very possible on this current trajectory that Social Security no longer pays 100% of its obligation to our fellow Americans who've worked every single day of their lives and paid into the Social Security trust fund.\n\nJohn Harwood: So you'd raise the (Social Security tax) cap?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Yeah.You can blame the previous generation, or you can do the sensible thing and raise the cap.\n\nJohn Harwood: Do you eliminate it altogether?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Eliminate it altogether, and make sure that that fund is solvent not just to the next generation, but into the next century. And then look, we spend a lot of time listening to those who are concerned about, or energized over immigration. And we think about very often the threats or the challenges that it poses. Immigrants are coming to this country, traveling thousands of miles for the honor of picking and preparing our food so that we can feed ourselves. Doing jobs that your kids and my kids are, more likely than not, not going to do in this country. And they're an extraordinary opportunity for us to meet our responsibility to successive generations in terms of paying in to this social safety net and make sure that it works.\n\nJohn Harwood: Trump has proposed cutting levels of legal immigration in half. You've proposed raising visa caps. How much higher do you think legal immigration should go?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: We have millions of unfilled jobs in this country for which we cannot find labor that was born in this country. Now, in some instances that's a mismatch of skills and training and education, so I also call for ensuring that we invest in community colleges, investing in the ability for unions and apprenticeships to meet that gap. But many of those jobs will only be filled by those who are willing to come to this country and to work those jobs.\n\nJohn Harwood: A million people a year come in legally now. Should we double that?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I think we should significantly increase it. I think that should be a conversation with small owners, like those here at the L&J Cafe. Farmers, ranchers, producers - all over this country. Immigrant families and communities. Small town America, whose very vitality depends on the willingness of immigrants to come to this country. Making this a much more vibrant, stronger, more successful country than we would otherwise be.\n\nJohn Harwood: Let me ask you about your experience as a small businessman - both the web services company and the Alt-Weekly. Do you look upon that as a success? And what do you take from it as you think about the economic challenges of the country?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I do look at it as a success. To be able with good friends - far more talented, smarter than I was - to come together and create opportunity and jobs in the third poorest urban county in the United States, high-value, high-skill, high-tech jobs, that felt really good.\n\nIt was really hard to do.\n\nI had some advantages that other Americans don't, and I'll give you an example. I could not get a loan in 1998 to start a technology company in El Paso - just didn't have the assets that the bank would lend against. But my dad, who had a home that was fully paid for, could take out a loan on his home and then lend that money back to me, $20,000. That was the seed capital that allowed us to start a business that ultimately hired dozens of our fellow El Pasoans and served clients all over this country.\n\nJohn Harwood: Which reflects the wealth disparities that make it so difficult for some too.\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Absolutely. The fact that there's ten times the wealth in white America than there is in black America, that many black Americans literally were drawn out of the ability to get a home loan and buy a home and build equity against which they could borrow to ensure that next generation, their son or daughter, could start a small business.\n\nThe more I listen to people and travel the country, the more exceptional my experience seems to have been. And the more it helps to explain the lack of dynamism that we see among small businesses right now. As you consolidate more power in corporations, more market share among fewer companies - when you have fewer opportunities to be able to borrow or to lend out at a community level - you're really - stifling opportunity for so many. So I would love more of my fellow Americans to have the same opportunity I had to be an entrepreneur, to create jobs and opportunity.\n\nJohn Harwood: Were you good at it? I know that the weekly went out of business, but was the web services company profitable?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Yeah. It it's still in business today. I don't know how many businesses make it past the 20-year mark, but Stanton Street is still going.\n\nJohn Harwood: You didn't get rich off of it?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I didn't get rich off of it, no. And that was never my goal, and it wasn't what drove me. In fact, the most exciting part of the business was the news part. We started an online newspaper covering city hall, arts and culture and the U.S.-Mexico relationship. I moved back here in '98 and I found this to be the most fascinating, exciting place on the planet, and I wanted to tell our story.\n\nI made the brilliant decision - in quotes - to move from an online-only version in the late '90s to print just as the economy and industry was going in the exact opposite direction. But really proud of the writing, and the reporting, and our coverage of City Hall and politics and policy in El Paso. I really think we helped to deepen and improve the conversation and lead to some better policy outcomes in the communities.\n\nJohn Harwood: One of the issues that's gotten bigger and bigger in our politics are the pros and cons of gentrification. You dealt with that in El Paso on a development project that had some resistance, and you got some blowback for that. What did you learn that you can apply going forward about how government ought to balance the interests of what may look to most people as economic progress, but has concentrated costs on a small number of people?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I was on the city council at a time that our downtown had for all intents and purposes died. The core of our community, the center of our city was not alive. And it was hard to retain and attract talent, to create economic growth and development, and make this a city that young people wanted to be in.\n\nThere was a really ambitious plan to correct that. But what I learned when we introduced that plan, and then I knocked on the doors of those people who lived within the area of the plan, was it did not meet all of their needs, including protecting them against being priced out of their apartments and their homes. So, based on their feedback, I helped to change the plan to ensure that affordability was a fundamental component of the downtown plan. Affordability for housing was defined as a function of income-that no more than 30% of what you earn would be paid in rent or mortgage or living expenses. And what I think that helped to do, in large part, was to retain the ability for people, whether they lived in south El Paso or the communities that ring downtown El Paso, to stay there.\n\nJohn Harwood: But even if you make concessions like that, you can't make everybody happy. Is that OK? You've got to, at some point, say, \"No, the entire city needs this. We're going to go forward.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I think you have to do everything within your power to ensure that those who will be most affected by a given policy decision are protected, and benefit from that decision, especially those in communities that very often are overlooked or neglected or are forgotten altogether.\n\nJohn Harwood: Is what gets referred to as gentrification a bad thing?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: Yeah, it is. When folks who for generations have defined the character and the success of a neighborhood or a community are pushed out because they can no longer afford to be in that community, that's a bad thing. And it's a bad thing that's happening in communities all over the United States right now.\n\nJohn Harwood: The same principle applies to the issue of trade. Trade expansion is broadly good for the economy. It has diffuse benefits for most people, but concentrated costs for some people in industries adversely affected. You were for trade promotion authority, but now you say you would have been against Trans-Pacific Partnership. Are you trying to have it both ways?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: This community got hit harder than almost any other community in the United States after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. I think there were officially 29,000 trade-adjusted job losses that literally picked up stakes and moved right across the river to Ciudad Juarez.\n\nHowever, in the intervening years and decades, we have become a trade hub. So now one out of every four jobs in El Paso is connected to U.S.-Mexico trade. It literally drives the economy of the community that are represented in Texas. So, I'm going to fiercely protect those jobs that we have in place. But I'm also going to remember the lessons learned from NAFTA. I wanted to make sure that President Obama had the authority necessary to negotiate the best possible deal for the United States.\n\nAll of the goals and all of the motives were noble. But here in Mexico--an economy with which we are joined literally at the hip - to deny the ability to organize, which would improve labor conditions, working standards and incomes in Juarez, and, consequently, would put the American worker on a more level playing field - was a serious sin of omission in that plan.\n\nWhat I would do in my administration? I'd make sure that we were able to conduct trade negotiations with all of these Pacific partners, but that we prioritize those labor standards, environmental standards and human rights standards so that free trade becomes fair trade.\n\nJohn Harwood: In opposing TPP you're aligned with Donald Trump. Is anything good for the U.S. economy going to come from his confrontation with China?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: No. Listening to people who've been affected by his trade policy and this war that he's entered the United States in with China over trade, that cost is being borne by the American consumer. It's just an additional tax that all of us are paying on the goods that we purchase.\n\nBut the real devastation is felt in states like Iowa, where farmers, who for their entire lives or for generations worked to open up markets in China for the soybeans and for the corn that they grow, have seen those markets close to them. And know that even if they reopen, those buyers in those places will find other sellers in other countries. We may never be able to get back in to those places.\n\nJohn Harwood: Does it frustrate you as a Democrat that many of those farmers are still going to vote for President Trump?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: No. It doesn't frustrate me, and I don't blame anybody. I just know that the onus is on me as a candidate to show up to listen to them, and then to make sure that we all make the connection between what those farmers are experiencing and what this president is doing. Taking us into a war without allies, turning his back on Canada and Mexico.\n\nJohn Harwood: But TPP was the allies.\n\nBeto O'Rourke: The allies are also the European Union.\n\nIf we met China in a united front - the concessions that we want to get to ensure that they don't dump low cost on the United States market, that they don't manipulate their currency, they don't violate the rules of the road that we've all agreed to - we would be successful in every single one of them. Right now, we are in a war with no exit ramp.\n\nThat's our negotiating tactic around the world. It's with Kim Jong-un, with the leaders in Iran.\n\nWith every single threat or situation we face, we have bucked our allies and friends, and any capacity to meet these challenges successfully. He has diminished our standing in the world and weakened our security and our ability to be successful when it comes to trade.\n\nJohn Harwood: You mentioned that you had the backstop of a family with privileges and with money. There's a line of critique that you've had kind of a cushy life. Politico had a story saying, \"He's been failing upward.\" Is that a fair point?\n\nBeto O'Rourke: I'll leave that to the voters to decide. But I'll just tell you, over the course of my life I've done everything within my power to bring people in. And to use the opportunity that I have to make sure that more people have an opportunity at economic success. As a city council member, that more people can participate in the policy making at the municipal level, holding town hall meetings every week. As a member of Congress, making sure that every voice is heard and that we get the job done, even in the minority with a Republican majority, every day of the six years that I served. And in Texas, going across every one of those 254 counties, and writing nobody off, and counting nobody out, and taking nobody for granted. And instead, bringing everybody in.\n\nJohn Harwood: Is there any experience that you've had that makes you think, \"I've been through the fire, and that's what made me who I am?\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke: For each of us, our entire life is what's made us who we are. I'm trying to give you some of those things that I've worked on, in addition to being a father of three kids who mean the world to me, and for whom I'm running this race right now. And just my record of delivering for people who are counting on this government to work for them.\n\nYou can ask any veteran in El Paso about a community that ranked dead last in wait times for a mental health care provider. I didn't blame Republicans for those services not being there. I didn't wait for somebody else to figure it out. We brought people in in this community to make sure that we addressed those challenges and got care to people who needed it.\n\nSo that experience was transformative for me. Listening to those who had suffered in service to this country, and who are depending on us to act at their moment of need and our moment of truth, and we came through for them. And that's what I want to do for the people of this country.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "website": "https://www.cnbc.com",
      "text": "Here's what the Fed just signaled about the rest of 2017\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee delivered on its long-signaled quarter-point hike in the target range for the federal funds rate . Markets will now focus on the committee's next move. There are two questions to be answered. First, will there be another rate hike this year? Second, how will the anticipated shrinkage of the Fed's balance sheet proceed? Thus far, markets seem calm.\n\nThis was the fourth rate hike since December 2015. The FOMC has signaled one more rate hike this year, but markets give it only about a 50/50 probability. Certainly, inflation gives no reason for the Fed to move aggressively on rates. Inflation remains below 2 percent.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has persistently over-estimated the inflation threat and today's FOMC statement seems to recognize that. The yield curve has flattened despite the anticipated rate hike at this meeting. In short, financial markets are not signaling further Fed rate hikes. The Fed is inclined to adjust its actions to the market's expectations. That suggests there will be no further rate hikes this year.\n\nThe labor market is the central bank's other key concern. The May jobs report once again sent mixed signals. Job creation was weak at 138,000. Yet the unemployment rate declined to 4.3 percent, the lowest in 16 years. These are mixed signals that can, however, be reconciled. We are in a historically long, but subpar economic recovery. Slow job growth accompanies slow economic growth.\n\nThe historically low unemployment rate is the seeming anomaly. That figure is misleading on at least two counts. First, the decline in unemployment is a consequence of the length of the recovery rather than its strength. Second, the fall in the unemployment rate has been affected by the decline in the labor-force participation rate.\n\nThe decline in the overall labor-force participation rate chiefly reflects a decline in the male labor-force participation rate, and a flattening in the rate for women. Observers have offered conflicting reasons for the worrisome decline in men working.\n\nFocusing on the prime-aged workforce, 25-54 years, eliminates most of the demographic explanations. By this measure, nearly 7 million workers, mostly men, have dropped out of the work force in the last 50 years. They are removed from both the workforce measure and the measure of the unemployed. The measured unemployment rate falls, but in a misleading way. Now the low unemployment rate is not a sign of strength in the labor force, but of men no longer seeking employment.\n\nThere are policy reasons for this (e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance) and social forces, including a decline in the work ethic among white, blue collar men. The latter has been examined by Charles Murray in Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010 and, more popularly, by J. D. Vance in Hillbilly Elegy. The bottom line is that, given economic entitlements and underlying social forces, we may be at the fullest employment possible.\n\nAccordingly, there is a labor-market rationale for further rate hikes. The unemployment rate has become a misleading signal, however, and is neither a reliable target nor indicator of the stance of monetary policy. Further, the reasons for slow-output growth must be rethought. Slow growth in GDP reflects, at least in part, supply constraints in labor markets. There is nothing the central bank can do about that.\n\nIn my view, downsizing the Fed's balance sheet is where the important policy actions will now take place. While an unwinding could potentially lead to instability in financial markets, the action is long over-due. The Fed's outsized balance sheet, with a large amount of mortgage-backed securities, has put it in the credit-allocation business. It needs to get out of that business.\n\nFor the rest of 2017 we are looking at likely no further rate hikes and shift in the focus of monetary policy to the size of the Fed's balance sheet. The FOMC is signaling that the unwinding will proceed at a moderate pace. Monetary policy is once again entering unchartered waters.\n\nCommentary by Gerald P. O'Driscoll, Jr., a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.

      "text": "Little Richard, flamboyant rock 'n' roll pioneer, dead at 87\n\nLittle Richard, the self-proclaimed \"architect of rock 'n' roll\" whose piercing wail, pounding piano and towering pompadour irrevocably altered popular music while introducing black R&B to white America, has died Saturday. He was 87.\n\nPastor Bill Minson, a close friend of Little Richard's, told The Associated Press that Little Richard died Saturday morning. Minson said he also spoke to Little Richard's son and brother.\n\nMinson added that the family is not releasing the cause of death.\n\nBorn Richard Penniman, Little Richard was one of rock 'n' roll's founding fathers who helped shatter the color line on the music charts, joining Chuck Berry and Fats Domino in bringing what was once called \"race music\" into the mainstream. Richard's hyperkinetic piano playing, coupled with his howling vocals and hairdo, made him an implausible sensation - a gay, black man celebrated across America during the buttoned-down Eisenhower era.\n\nHe sold more than 30 million records worldwide, and his influence on other musicians was equally staggering, from the Beatles and Otis Redding to Creedence Clearwater Revival and David Bowie. In his personal life, he wavered between raunch and religion, alternately embracing the Good Book and outrageous behavior.\n\n\"Little Richard? That's rock 'n' roll,\" Neil Young, who heard Richard's riffs on the radio in Canada, told biographer Jimmy McDonough. \"Little Richard was great on every record.\"\n\nIt was 1956 when his classic \"Tutti Frutti\" landed like a hand grenade in the Top 40, exploding from radios and off turntables across the country. It was highlighted by Richard's memorable call of \"wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom.\"\n\nA string of hits followed, providing the foundation of rock music: \"Lucille,\" \"Keep A Knockin',\" \"Long Tall Sally,\" \"Good Golly Miss Molly.\" More than 40 years after the latter charted, Bruce Springsteen was still performing \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" live.\n\nThe Beatles' Paul McCartney imitated Richard's signature yelps - perhaps most notably in the \"Wooooo!\" from the hit \"She Loves You.\" Ex-bandmate John Lennon covered Richard's \"Rip It Up\" and \"Ready Teddy\" on the 1975 \"Rock and Roll\" album.\n\nWhen the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame opened in 1986, he was among the charter members with Elvis Presley, Berry, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Cooke and others.\n\nFew were quicker to acknowledge Little Richard's seminal role than Richard himself. The flamboyant singer claimed he paved the way for Elvis, provided Mick Jagger with his stage moves and conducted vocal lessons for McCartney.\n\n\"I am the architect of rock 'n' roll!\" Little Richard crowed at the 1988 Grammy Awards as the crowd rose in a standing ovation. \"I am the originator!\"\n\nRichard Wayne Penniman was born in Macon, Georgia, during the Great Depression, one of 12 children. He was ostracized because he was effeminate and suffered a small deformity: his right leg was shorter than his left.\n\nThe family was religious, and Richard sang in local churches with a group called the Tiny Tots. The tug-of-war between his upbringing and rock 'n' roll excess tormented Penniman throughout his career.\n\nPenniman was performing with bands by the age of 14, but there were problems at home over his sexual orientation. His father beat the boy and derided him as \"half a son.\"\n\nRichard left home to join a minstrel show run by a man known as Sugarloaf Sam, occasionally appearing in drag.\n\nIn late 1955, Little Richard recorded the bawdy \"Tutti Frutti,\" with lyrics that were sanitized by a New Orleans songwriter. It went on to sell 1 million records over the next year.\n\nWhen Little Richard's hit was banned by many white-owned radio stations, white performers like Pat Boone and Elvis Presley did cover versions that topped the charts.\n\nLittle Richard went Hollywood with an appearance in \"Don't Knock the Rock.\" But his wild lifestyle remained at odds with his faith, and a conflicted Richard quit the business in 1957 to enroll in a theological school and get married.\n\nRichard remained on the charts when his label released previously recorded material. And he recorded a gospel record, returning to his roots.\n\nA 1962 arrest for a homosexual encounter in a bus station restroom led to his divorce and return to performing.\n\nHe mounted three tours of England between 1962 and 1964, with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones serving as opening acts. Back in the States, he put together a band that included guitarist Jimi Hendrix - and later fired Hendrix when he was late for a bus.\n\nIn 1968, Richard hit Las Vegas and relaunched his career. Within two years, he had another hit single and made the cover of Rolling Stone.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Richard was battling a $1,000-a-day cocaine problem and once again abandoned his musical career. He returned to religion, selling Bibles and renouncing homosexuality. For more than a decade, he vanished.\n\n\"If God can save an old homosexual like me, he can save anybody,\" Richard said.\n\nBut he returned, in 1986, in spectacular fashion. Little Richard was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and appeared in the movie \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills.\"\n\nA Little Richard song from the soundtrack, \"Great Gosh A'Mighty,\" even put him back on the charts for the first time in more than 15 years. Little Richard was back to stay, enjoying another dose of celebrity that he fully embraced.\n\nMacon, Georgia, named a street after its favorite son. And Little Richard was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In August 2002, he announced his retirement from live performing. But he continued to appear frequently on television, including a humorous appearance on a 2006 commercial for GEICO insurance.\n\nRichard had hip surgery in November 2009 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and asked fans at the time to pray for him. He lived in the Nashville area at the time.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "The Population Confusion\n\nOver the past few weeks, the American public has been told by all the leading news outlets and commentators that white America is on its deathbed as the country moves to a rainbow future led by an explosion of growth among Hispanics and Latinos.\n\nWhile this is in line with the presently popular narratives of the coming demise of America's white oppressors, it's not at all in keeping with the facts. Indeed, the U.S. Census Bureau seems to have turned to magic in order to make the numbers fit the narrative.\n\nFor the 2020 Census, the Bureau reports a total U.S. population of 331 million, up about 6 percent from 308 million in 2010. Of these 331 million inhabitants, 204 million are said to be white. Another 31 odd million are white with some racial mixture making for 235 reported white Americans. The purely white number is reported to be down by a bit over 8 percent, but the number of mixed-race whites is up by nearly 10 percent. Thus, depending on to what extent mixed-race whites consider themselves more or less white, the decline in the white share of the total population isn't really known but ranges from 8 to 3 percent.\n\nThat is just the appetizer for this report. The main course is the treatment of Hispanics and Latinos. Why we reserve a slot in the Census for them is a mystery. Hispanic and Latino aren't racial identifications. A Hispanic person is someone with a Spanish-speaking background and a Latino is one with a background of speaking one of the languages of Latin origin that include French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian, and Romansh. These languages are spoken by people of many different races. What's the point of identifying some people by race and others by language? It seems to be comparing apples and oranges.\n\nBut wait. It gets better. In normal English, the term Latino refers to people whose language is a derivative of ancient Latin. French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian speakers are all normally considered Latinos. But not by the U.S. Census, which defines Latinos as only those who come from a Spanish or Portuguese language background and may also be known as Hispanics. If your background is French, Italian, or Romanian you are automatically white or possibly black or Asian, but not Latino.\n\nPlease stay with me. The Census reports soaring increases in the numbers of Hispanic/Latino Americans and contrasts that with a dramatic decline of the white population. From 9 million in 2010, the population of multi-race Americans is reported as having soared 276 percent to 33.8 million souls in 2020. This suggests that America's multi-racial population has been surging over the past 10 years. But that doesn't jibe with the fact that the total population rose only 6 percent over the past 10 years.\n\nThe problem is with the construction of the Census Bureau's survey and its interpretation. The 2020 survey gives elaborate choices to responders that weren't available to responders in earlier surveys. For instance, a responder in 2020 could say he or she is all white or white in combination with some other race. This choice wasn't available in earlier surveys. Thus, a person who might have reported him or herself as white in 2010 might have changed that to combination white in 2020. The number of people wouldn't have changed, but the number of whites alone would show fewer in 2020 than in 2019. The storyline would become that whites are dying out when in fact the numbers haven't changed that much.\n\nNowhere is this aspect of the Census report more egregious than in the sections dealing with Hispanics and Latinos. The overall survey shows this group increasing its share of the U.S. population from 16.3 to 18.7 percent, a significant increase but not earth-shattering. However, it then goes on to explain that the number of Hispanics and Latinos who identified as white has fallen by 52.9 percent from 26.7 million people to 12.6 million. This really looks as if either white Hispanics/Latinos in America are dying like flies or the number of new immigrants has been soaring over the past 10 years.\n\nCan we confirm this by scanning recent annual Census reports? Well, actually, no, we can't. The 2019 Census report says 38.3 million Hispanics/Latinos (65.5 percent of the entire group) reported themselves as white. Compare that to the 2020 report of only 12.6 million claiming to be white. Did 26 million white Hispanics/Latinos die between 2019 and 2020? No. We know that isn't the case.\n\nThey changed their response to the new wording of the Census questionnaire. The dramatic shifts between 2010 and 2020 reported by the Census Bureau and loudly repeated by the press didn't, in fact, occur. If Latinos/Hispanics all decide they feel white today, whites will forever constitute the American majority. If they continue to keep feeling more like some other race, whites may wind up as a minority. It all depends on how the Hispanics/Latinos feel about themselves.\n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to drop the whole racial classification system. We're all Americans with justice and freedom for all, aren't we?"

      "text": "Warren Harding's Historic Speech on Race: How Black and White Americans Responded\n\nNo matter which major party won America's presidential election in 1920, the country was destined for another chief executive from Ohio. Both major party candidates, Republican Warren Harding and Democrat James Cox, hailed from the Buckeye State.\n\nIf I were to assign a Tomatometer score to Harding's White House tenure, it would probably be 50 percent, or about a five on a 10-point scale. Not the worst (Wilson earns that award), and not the best. But because Harding rarely gets a fair shake, I'd like to praise him on this centennial date of something he did well.\n\nThe audience was segregated-20,000 whites in the front, 10,000 blacks in the rear. When the president finished, the cheers all came from the back.\n\nOn race, Harding was in one way a product of his times. He endorsed blacks and whites going their separate ways in social settings if they so chose. He wasn't a fan of intermarriage.\n\nBut when it came to race and the law, he was well ahead of his time. He spurned the notion that the law should treat one race differently than another. He warned the Birmingham audience that he was going to speak frankly \"whether you like it or not,\" and he sure did.\n\nHe noted with regret, for example, that \"Thousands of black men, serving their country [in World War I] just as patriotically as did the white men, were transported overseas and experienced the life of countries where their color aroused less antagonism than it does here.\"\n\nHarding said it was a \"colored\" soldier who told him that \"the war brought his race the first real conception of citizenship-the first full realization that the flag was their flag, to fight for, to be protected by them, and also to protect them.\"\n\nThe good folks in 1921 Birmingham needed to hear that, especially from the highest official in the land.\n\nHarding told the 30,000 assembled in Birmingham that the goals we should pursue together are \"complete uniformity in ideals, absolute equality in the paths of knowledge and culture, equal opportunity for those who strive, and equal admiration for those who achieve.\"\n\nHe declared that while blacks and whites should be free to associate or to separate in their personal and social choices, pursuing even a degree of racial pride if they want, there should be \"no occasion\" for \"limitations of the individual's opportunity.\"\n\n\"I would insist upon equal educational opportunity for both\" blacks and whites, he said.\n\nOne more thing you should know is exactly where in Birmingham that the underrated Harding said these admirable things. It was-no kidding-in a place called Woodrow Wilson Park."

      "text": "A Pulitzer for a Howard Zinn History\n\nShe followed Zinn so closely that I wondered if she had been educated, as millions of students have been, with Zinn's book.\n\nI immediately recalled how Zinn opened Chapter Two (after dishonestly demolishing the discovery of America) with a paragraph-long description from a 1951 book by Hampton Institute English professor J. Saunders Redding, \"They Came in Chains,\" of \"a strange ship ... a frightening ship, a ship of mystery\" with yawning \"black-mouthed cannons\" approaching Jamestown in 1619. Saunders's creative rendering was punctuated at the end with Zinn's declaration: \"There is not a country in world history in which racism has been more important.\"\n\nI was reminded of that by Hannah-Jones's bold, \"Anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country.\"\n\nFor Zinn, too, racism was \"always a national fact\" because the country was founded upon it.\n\nFor both, racism is a sin that can never be expiated because it emerges from the very foundations of this country, which is based on exploitation. And the worst form of exploitation was of slaves.\n\nAdditionally, according to Zinn, \"American slavery\" was the worst in the world because of its \"frenzy for limitless profit that comes from capitalistic agriculture\" and \"the reduction of the slave to less than human status.\" For Hannah-Jones, \"The shameful paradox of continuing chattel slavery in a nation founded on individual freedom ... led to a hardening of the racial caste system. This ideology ... maintained that black people were subhuman.\"\n\nAccording to Zinn, slavery developed \"into the normal labor relations of blacks to whites in the New World,\" producing \"that combination of inferior status and derogatory thought we call racism,\" which remains to this day. Like Hannah-Jones's claim of genetic imprint, Zinn presents \"the memory of slavery, and after that of segregation, lynching, humiliation.\" Indeed, \"The memory of oppressed people\" was \"a living presence-part of the daily lives of blacks in generation after generation.\" Even \"new 'civil rights' laws did not change the root condition of black people.\"\n\nSlavery was important to the \"dominant economic interests\" that were behind the Constitution, according to Zinn's recycling of the long-discredited thesis by Charles Beard. Zinn disabuses the reader of the idea that the Constitution was \"put together by wise, humane men who created a legal framework for democracy and equality.\" No, it was \"the work of certain groups trying to maintain their privileges.\" These \"upper classes,\" in order to rule, made \"concessions to the middle class, without damage to their own wealth or power, at the expense of slaves, Indians, and poor whites.\"\n\nIn Hannah-Jones's historical rendering, \"This nation's white founders set up a decidedly undemocratic Constitution that excluded women, Native Americans and black people.\" Indeed, with 10 of the first 12 presidents \"enslavers,\" \"this nation was founded not as a democracy but as a slavocracy.\"\n\nLike Zinn, she presents American slavery as uniquely cruel: \"a brutal system of slavery unlike anything that had existed in the world before.\" In fact, \"[the white colonists] created a network of laws and customs, astounding for both their precision and cruelty, that ensured that enslaved people would never be treated as [human beings].\"\n\nRecalling Zinn's reference to ancestral memory, Hannah-Jones writes, \"This belief, that black people were not merely enslaved but were a slave race, became the root of the endemic racism that we still cannot purge from this nation to this day.\" The problems of \"black poverty, out-of-wedlock births, crime and college attendance\" are due to an enduring \"racial caste system.\"\n\nFor both Zinn and Hannah-Jones, American history is a series of \"struggles.\" For Hannah-Jones, \"black rights struggles paved the way for every other rights struggle, including women's and gay rights, immigrant and disability rights.\" In fact, there was no democracy until the \"bloody freedom struggles of the civil rights movement laid the foundation for every other modern rights struggle.\"\n\nHannah-Jones, like Zinn, doesn't allow that appeals to a common humanity and the founding principles, from Frederick Douglass on, formed the basis for reform, however imperfectly achieved.\n\nLike Zinn, she uses personal stories filled with pathos. Zinn's stories are unverifiable. Presenting himself as the champion of the oppressed, he puts the skeptical reader into the category of oppressor. Hannah-Jones uses her own family history, specifically of her father, who at age 17 in 1962 enlisted in the military, but was \"discharged under murky circumstances.\" Relegated to low-level jobs and living in a rundown house in a segregated neighborhood, he nevertheless prided himself on flying a well-cared-for flag.\n\nHannah-Jones recognizes no distinction between whites who were racist, those who were apathetic, and those who were activist to the point of being willing to give up their lives. Like Zinn, she introduces the Nazis to indict \"White America,\" which constructed \"a savagely enforced system of racial apartheid that excluded black people almost entirely from mainstream American life-a system so grotesque that Nazi Germany would later take inspiration from it.\"\n\nHistory is a weapon for both Zinn and Hannah-Jones. Both leave out inconvenient countervailing facts and historical context, and employ emotional blackmail.\n\nZinn's book repeatedly points to the communist revolution as the solution for America's racism.\n\nThe 1619 Project has been adopted for use in schools. The added prestige of a Pulitzer Prize will only reinforce the idea that a Zinn-like history is the true history of our country."

      "text": "Critical Race Theory Makes It Easier to Manipulate Young Minds\n\nCRT is a way of thinking about America's history through the lens of racism. It was a school of thought developed in the 1970s in response to what some people viewed as a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s.\n\nIt centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation's institutions and that those institutions function today to maintain the dominance of white people in society.\n\nProponents believe that race is not biological, but culturally invented, and because of that, our institutions and federal laws have preserved unequal treatment of people of color.\n\nCRT dismisses the idea that racism stems from acts of individuals, but is rooted in a system of oppression based on a socially-constructed hierarchy that only allows white people to reap material benefits over people of color by the misuse of power.\n\nMany teachers' unions, educators and social studies organizations now support the teaching of CRT in our schools. They believe awareness of past acts of racial discrimination against people of color, perpetrated by whites because of systemic racism, is absolutely necessary before \"true equity\" for all minority classes can be achieved.\n\nTo apply CRT in an educational environment requires today's students, whether they have experienced acts of racism or not, to be fully cognizant of past acts of racial discrimination. Students are forced to accept the theory that if you are white, you have been privileged to be part of the oppressor class, and if you are non-white, you are part of the class that has been oppressed, or systematically held back.\n\nOnly a fool does not learn from lessons of the past, and the ignorant learn the wrong things from the past. To reap the benefits of past lessons, it is crucial that we view those lessons in their proper perspective with a knowledge of how those lessons came to be, and an open mind as to their relative importance.\n\nThere is no doubt that there have been horrible instances of racial discrimination in our nation's past, as there have been ten-fold in almost all other nations the world over.\n\nYes, it is important to have a knowledge of past injustices. Yes, there have been times when our institutions and system of laws have supported racial and even gender disparities. Laws enforcing segregation or prohibiting women to vote are just two examples, but have we not as a nation, made tremendous strides to change those laws in the direction of true equality?\n\nWhen the application of CRT focuses only on past examples of institutional class oppression on the basis of skin color, it misses the opportunity of providing any knowledge of individual equality or responsibility.\n\nWhite students are made to feel guilty because of past racial incidents that they have had absolutely nothing to do with, and students of color are made to feel inferior because they have been held back by an oppressive white society. The teaching of CRT denies individual students of all colors the opportunity to aspire to do more and better when it comes to race relations.\n\nIt's a fact that any type of racism and discrimination left unchecked will only promote more of the same. So why does CRT not use the educational setting to promote those concepts in our society that have been proven to eradicate racism and promote true equality by encouraging the individual aspirations of students to do so?\n\nI think the answers are clear.\n\nCRT emphasizes group association over individual responsibility, and skin color over character in order to achieve its goal of class distinction-a very un-American concept that goes against all that our laws and institutions are striving to protect.\n\nWhen CRT says race is not biological but culturally invented, it defies the reality that many of us have different skin colors. Is the real goal here to subvert and denigrate American laws and institutions that have been specifically set up to protect racial equality and ensure equal opportunity?\n\nWhen CRT subjugates the individual to that of a class, and guilt by association to that class, it diminishes the desire and aspirations of young individuals, regardless of color, to achieve even more in terms of race equality. Those who suffer the most by such reverse reasoning are precisely those students of color who will be denied the opportunity to advance themselves on their abilities apart from their skin color or class.\n\nThe costs of allowing such maligned thinking are steep, especially if they include the brainwashing of our innocent children in schools that are teaching critical race theory under the guise of enlightenment about diverse equity.\n\nWhen one examines the basic precepts and goals of such a harmful theory, it is easy to see it for what it is. It is a concerted effort to promote guilt, confusion, and division among different races of people, with the result of generating hate and animosity.\n\nThis most un-American of ideals is taking place right before our very eyes and is being soft-pedaled as intellectually enlightening our children to the realities of past racism in our history.\n\nAgain, it only presents one side of the story, and that is how white America abused and discriminated against all blacks mainly, and a few lesser mentioned minorities.\n\nIt uses instances and snapshots of racism in our past to push the narrative that because of those mistakes, America is systemically racist today.\n\nIt teaches that only whites have been the oppressors, and only non-whites have been the victims. It completely ignores the racist behavior of most other non-white races throughout history such as cannibalism, human sacrifice, tribalism, imperialism, slavery, genocide, and a multitude of other discriminatory practices in the effort to paint only whites as oppressors. CRT gives no credence or recognition to the concept that all human beings share a common humanity apart from race.\n\nMany Americans know that in a country as multicultural as ours, there are and have been many examples of racism where whites have not been the oppressors but indeed the victims, as there are many different types of discrimination.\n\nCRT does not acknowledge this, but insists that only white children must be made to feel guilty even though they themselves have had nothing to do with any kind of past racism. CRT emphasizes and encourages non-white children to think that they somehow are inferior and deserve to be preferentially treated as a class because they have been deprived to compete equally.\n\nI think we have enough of the false reasoning, and purposeful distortion of historical facts such as CRT tries to impose. It's a dated theory being pushed by those who would have us regress a group of class warfare.\n\nThe politicians that support CRT and want to force it on our schools are just pandering for votes as they care nothing about the quality of education being provided to our youngsters or for their welfare tomorrow. They are just as guilty as the race mongers who invented CRT in their failure to acknowledge that America has moved on. The gruesome, cherry picked examples of past racism that they employ are in stark contrast to the reality of American society today.\n\nPeople of different races are now neighbors, close friends, acquaintances, business partners, elected officials, and even family members.\n\nThis didn't happen because of the divisiveness taught by a twisted, bitter, and pseudo-intellectual fringe sect. It is happening because decent, intelligent, socially responsible, and caring people are rejecting skin color and class distinction as a gauge when it comes to their fellow man."

      "text": "Elections as Ideological Contests\n\nListening to some Republican spokesmen predicting a Republican blowout this fall, I have to wonder in what world they're living.\n\nAs I look around at the races in key states, I'm astonished by how well the Democrats seem to be doing. This is the case despite a barely coherent Democratic president, borders that are kept deliberately open (to welcome future Democratic voters), a wildly inflated economy, and the transformation of the American military into a woke social experiment.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the country has divided into ideological blocks. This has happened most dramatically on the woke left, which embraces urban professionals, academics, and most conspicuously college-educated white women. Also inseparably attached to the left's bloc is the overwhelming majority of black voters, who regard themselves as victims of white America. The message of the Republicans and the right to blacks, that they're primarily victimized by violent crime and that the Democrats have been soft on criminals, isn't playing well. It's far less effective than the messaging from the other side, focusing on black victimization by a white racist system.\n\nThose on the right who reject the left's policies and values, however, are far less well organized. Although they reject the ideological persuasion of the mainstream media, public educators, elite universities, and affluent urban dwellers, they don't always do so for the same reasons. Some on the right are strongly libertarian; others are Christian traditionalists typically living in the interior of the country. More often than not, the right embraces inhabitants of rural communities and small towns, the region that the coastal elites characterize contemptuously as \"flyover country.\" Its population created the voting base from which Donald Trump drew much of his support.\n\nMy point isn't to contrast the good and bad guys but to show what ideological politics looks like. Its participants are separated by bloc identities, into which many independents are also swept. These blocs vote in ways that affirm their sociological identity. Being for or against the now prevalent woke left will determine how one reacts to national politics. Especially for those on the cultural left, this factor weighs far more heavily than the economy or violent crime. This has helped the Democrats turn the November election away from a foundering economy and high crime rates to such ideologically charged issues as Donald Trump's \"insurrection.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the right, the left's control of the media and educational system may be far more electorally important than how Biden or his party is managing the country."

      "text": "Conrad Black: Why the Long Tyranny of 'Wokeness' Is on the Way Out\n\nThe neutral-to-positive reception given President Trump's video address to the Davos conference last week confirms that the long tyranny of wokeness, political correctness, affirmative action, aggressive restraints in the name of combating climate change, and militancy ostensibly on behalf of diversity, equity, and inclusion, is finally crumbling into dust, where many of us have been claiming it belonged.\n\nHistorians of the future, but starting quite soon, will make learned inquiries into why Western society suddenly collapsed in a temporary but profound orgy of self-criticism frequently descending to collective self-hate.\n\nBy high standards of conduct, we are all sinners, and all sane and reasonable people sometimes feel guilty about their own conduct and the conduct of collective entities where they are members, such as their country or occupation, or the organization that employs them. In general, Western civilization, as it has developed since World War II, has operated on a consensus that the preferable political system is a democratic state in which governments are chosen in free elections, and the population enjoys freedom of expression, assembly, and religious, political, and other beliefs.\n\nIn the postwar period, those beliefs were concentrated in the countries that described themselves collectively as the Free World, which was challenged both competitively and at times by infiltration and threat of aggression by totalitarian communism, in particular by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The Free World was led by the United States as the world's greatest economic and military power. In the American strategy of containment, elaborated in the years following World War II after the Soviet violation of the agreements over liberated Europe that had been made by the U.S., British, and Soviet leaders (Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin), the Western Alliance pledged military resistance to aggression but avoidance of the initiation of aggression against the Soviet Bloc or China.\n\nThe Free World, in fact, included a good many despotisms, such as Spain, Portugal, much of Latin America, South Korea, at times Greece and Turkey, and many countries in Africa and the Middle East. But most of the countries named, and many others, did in fact become authentic democracies in the course of the Cold War. China, meanwhile, detached itself altogether from the Soviet Bloc and, in economic terms, ceased to pretend to be a communist country though it continues as a totalitarian dictatorship.\n\nAs all readers know, the containment strategy was completely successful: The Soviet Union disintegrated without violence, international communism collapsed, a number of the countries that had involuntarily been members of the Soviet Bloc have become genuine democracies, and there has been a comparative reduction in armaments levels and spending by the major powers. The West enjoyed, by any measurement, the greatest and most bloodless strategic victory in the history of the nation-state.\n\nThere was speculation by reputable political scientists such as Francis Fukuyama that political development had reached its ultimate stage of sophistication with the triumph of Western democracy. And to the credit of the Western democracies, and particularly the United States, there was a minimum of triumphalism. The Russian leaders Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin were treated with uniform respect, and for a time Russia was invited to join the G7, making it the G8. But as relief and contentment settled upon much of the world in quiet celebration of the end of the long and often brutal division between groups of states led by the two superpowers, the ant-like movements of other forces were already starting to disrupt the newly serene political climate.\n\nExhibiting a talent for improvisation that few would have expected from the old left that had been so completely defeated in the Cold War, it vacated the ideological battlefield and opportunistically crowded aboard the accelerating bandwagon of climate concern. The old left took over this movement and deftly converted it into a battering ram with which to assault capitalism from a new angle in the name of saving the planet. Conservation became faddish and psychologically agreeable to those who wished, whether from naive altruism or the ravages of hypocrisy, to palliate materialism and temper the pursuit of mere lucre.\n\nFrom this comfortable attitude through degrees of alarm and anxiety to the now-familiar cries of imminent world flooding, skyrocketing temperatures, and the self-inflicted torment of mankind vastly transcending the experiences and imaginations of the authors of the Old Testament, was a short step and a brief time in coming. Almost all of our Western governments-to the sidesplitting amusement of principal ecological offenders China, India, and Russia-began piling costs and inconveniences upon ourselves to reduce the use of fossil fuel.\n\nIn Canada, meanwhile, there arose an inexplicable and wildly extreme theory that Canadian authorities, both colonial and post-Confederation, deliberately, and also out of gross negligence, inflicted terrible physical harm on our indigenous peoples and set out to deprive them of their culture. These charges were never substantiated, but they escalated steadily into lurid claims of surreptitiously disposing of the corpses of native children who died in Christian residential schools from criminal action or negligence. Almost none of any of these allegations have been supported by serious evidence, and yet the former chief justice and the outgoing prime minister saddled the Canadian people and their European ancestors in this country with the charge of cultural genocide, which does not exist in fact and is really cultural assimilation, which was never officially attempted in this country.\n\nAt the same time in the United States, as if in vengeance against the ultimate triumph of white America, activists gave birth to new permutations of the legacy of slavery. The proportions of slavery were alleged to have been grossly underestimated, and although the United States has made a greater and more successful effort than any society in history to raise up a formerly forcibly servile minority to a level of complete equality, it suddenly was accusing itself of new charges of racist oppression.\n\nBoth the United States and Canada, in their media and their public discourse, and especially in their academies, put themselves in the dock of \"systemic racism.\"\n\nThe very success of our societies made them vulnerable to charges of moral arrogance and forgetfulness. But the charges were excessive, and in the same measure that it is normal human nature to be self-reproachful, it is also normal eventually to tire of self-reproach-particularly when after atonement and due consideration, the reproach can safely be judged excessive. That is where we have arrived, and the entire diversity, equity, and inclusion, and environment, social, and governance tangle of authoritarian guilt infliction is now coming apart like a giant scaffolding in a hurricane.\n\nAll of it-the green terror, the wokeness, the bunk about racial privilege, and the attempted enforcement of un-meritocratic outcomes-has been pulverized every day by the new majority of the United States. And as in most things, more slowly and more gently, but no less surely, that movement will be emulated in Canada and is already underway."

      "text": "The Adjunct's Anger and False Politics\n\nOne of the worst ills besetting American society today is the rising number of well-educated people who can't find jobs suited to their learning. They did the right things but can't find the right post. We know that the American meritocracy runs on smarts, hard work, and accreditation. In this case, however, they did work hard, they showed they had the smarts, got a bachelor's degree, plus an advanced degree, from a Tier One institution, and now they're stuck in low-paying, low-status jobs with no security. How does that happen?\n\nIt began back in the 1970s when the hiring spree of the 1960s and early-'70s (which was prompted by the explosion of the undergraduate population) started to taper off. Schools had employed enough new professors by then to handle the classes, and so the rate of hiring slowed. But something else didn't slow: the pipeline, the training of professors, and admissions to graduate programs. Humanities departments across the nation with only one or two openings for assistant professors each year were still producing a dozen or more doctorates. Each one of those fresh scholar-teachers, 30 years old and having every reason to expect a bright future, thought a plum post like that of their graduate advisers would follow.\n\nThe just-crowned professionals were, indeed, sharp and skilled, diligent and ambitious. They had completed years of seminar work and written a 250-page thesis, logging long hours in the library and at the typewriter, losing their twenties to the prospect of a satisfying professional career for the rest of their lives. And yet, when they scrutinized the job list put out by professional organizations such as the Modern Language Association that advertise openings, they came across slim pickings in their fields of expertise (mine, for instance, was 19th-century American literature, and I'm sure that there were 10 applicants just as capable as I was or better when I got a spot in 1989). They sent out their job applications as widely as they could, and in most cases didn't even manage to land an interview.\n\nWhat could they do? Well, try again next year, and in the meantime pick up a course or two each semester as an adjunct teacher, a temporary fill-in for freshman composition of French 1 at their own or at nearby institutions. The assignments didn't pay much, around $3,000 per course (which worked out to less than minimum wage), but it kept our young aspirant in the academic scene doing what she was trained to do. She had to stay \"collegial\" if she wanted to look good during the coming year's round of hiring.\n\nBut when the next year came along, the same thing happened, and the year after that as well. The job outlook didn't get better-it got worse. Schools found that hiring adjuncts to teach basic classes saved them a lot of money. They didn't have to provide benefits, and no long-term commitment to the employee (no tenure, and no guarantees of reappointment from term to term). The farther time passed beyond the year she earned her doctorate, the less attractive our adjunct looked as a potential regular colleague. She was then 35 years old and stuck. She wanted to settle down, she couldn't go through that annual disappointment anymore, and her memories of hope and advancement that propelled her through the last years of graduate study had faded.\n\nBut she couldn't go anywhere else, not with so many years devoted to preparing for a faculty post. She had to keep going in this dispiriting round of basic teaching for pittance money to freshmen who, in most cases, didn't much care what she had to say. She was now one of a crowd of part-time workers, unacknowledged and without security, academic types who live on the fringe. They know they're good, that they belong in the elite, they've proved it, and now they have no status and less money than a welder.\n\nThis is not a temporary misery. They undergo it every time they travel to campus, slide into their offices (usually shared with others), and realize acutely that which has eluded them. The privileged ones, the professors who did get the jobs, have offices two stories below, where they enjoy the comforts of tenure and advanced courses to teach. Those lucky few travel to conferences and deliver papers at the university's expense. They spend summers traveling, knowing they have a guaranteed paycheck until retirement, which may not come until age 72. They don't have to teach the nuts and bolts of basic instruction in reading and writing. They might have teaching assistants who do most of the grading. They pass our adjunct in the hall with barely a nod.\n\nMeanwhile, our adjunct carries on at the bottom of the ladder. For all its egalitarian talk, the university is one of the most hierarchical spaces on earth. Presidents, provosts, deans, assistant deans, department chairs, full professors, associate professors, assistant professors, lecturers ... and adjuncts whose names don't register with any higher-ups. It's humiliating. Our adjunct wanted to join that hierarchy and start climbing. She believed in this exquisitely rank-filled habitat. She looked down on uneducated Americans with just as much condescension as her distinguished grad school professors did. Now, she has to realize that she shares the un-elite condition no matter how much time she spends in elite spaces. She's nothing to them. At least the mechanics and plumbers make decent pay.\n\nHer situation is a political strain, too. She was a Barack Obama Democrat, the same as all the others on campus. Obama represented the opposite of uneducated, White America. To have supported him was to show one's superiority. Politics was a social marker, an easy way to tick off a qualification for membership in the elite club. And to despise Donald Trump with all one's heart was to do the same. The emotion that piled up against him, the indignation and sputtering, eased the denigration our adjunct suffered daily. She scrambled at the bottom of the academic pile, but here, at least, when it came to national politics, she could join them on an equal footing and \"Resist!\"\n\nThe years have continued, though, advancement hasn't happened, she's still bouncing from one part-time gig to another, and Joe Biden doesn't excite such passions. There is no future for her, and politics will not cure that comedown of middle-age failure. She'll always vote Democrat, though, she has to. The system that has betrayed her is 99 percent controlled by Democrats, but the reality doesn't penetrate. To take a red pill and disengage from the Party would be to lose the last link she has to the elite. It would mean admitting a grave error that has ruined her life, the vision that never came true and should have been abandoned years earlier. The dream of joining the elite was too strong for too long. It holds until the end. Bitterness will grow, but outlets for it won't. I don't know what she'll be like when she's 63."

The parent said her son has been complaining about his eleventh-grade U.S. history class.\n\nThough Williams agrees the Black Panther Party was an important part of history, and \"absolutely\" should be covered in class, she said history shouldn't be taught through a political or racial lens.\n\n\"What's happening with these programs is that they are hyper-political, and they present a portrait of history through the lens of race, usually,\" she said.\n\nThe lesson at Point Loma High School, called \"The Black Party & Their Influence Today,\" is divided into two parts. One is about the Black Panthers \"challenging police and promoting social change,\" while the second focuses on \"how the Black Panthers influenced music and fashion.\"\n\nStudents are asked to answer the questions: \"Who were the Black Panthers and why was the government against them? How can we still [sic] their legacy and influence still today?\"\n\nThe lesson includes images, articles and two video links.\n\n\"What they represented for the black community was something extremely positive,\" Sales says in the video segment.\n\nRobert Woodson, the president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, says in another segment that the civil rights movement of 1954 to 1968, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was a middle-class movement that \"sought equality\" with white Americans, but that the Black Power movement \"assumed equality\" and originated among lower-income and unemployed black Americans.\n\nThe film shows historical footage of a Panther listing the group's a 10-point program of demands: \"Number 1: We want freedom. We want the power to control the destiny of our black communities. Number 2: We want full employment for our people. Number 3: We want an end to the robbery by the white man of our black communities ...\"\n\n\"We want land, justice, housing, education, clothing and peace, and as a major political objective a United Nations supervised plebiscite to be held throughout the black colonies of America in which only black people will participate to decide or determine the will of black people as to their national destiny,\" the Panther states in the video.\n\nThe Panthers also demanded that \"all black people when brought to court be tried by a jury of their peers-or people from their black communities-as defined in the Constitution.\"\n\n\"As the Panthers organized voter registration drives, health centers, and food distribution programs, they won growing support in black communities nationwide. But an escalating cycle of shootouts, arrests, and eventually what Panthers claimed were assassinations by police, led to the almost complete elimination of the Black Panther Party by the early 1970s,\" the narrator states in the video.\n\nManning Marable, a political science professor at the University of Colorado, states in the video that the FBI systematically destroyed the Black Panthers.\n\n\"How did they die?\" Marable says in the video. \"Hey, in 1969, the FBI through its counter-intelligence program targeted the Panthers for elimination. There's plenty of documentary evidence that shows this. In that year alone, in 1969, 26 Panthers were killed by local law enforcement agents and 750 Panthers were imprisoned or jailed. The organization was largely destroyed systematically by the local and federal authorities.\"\n\nThe video shows images of predominantly black American protesters chanting \"Hands up! Don't shoot!\" and carrying Black Lives Matter signs, contrasting today's movement with the Black Panther Party era.\n\n\"In 1966, California law allowed civilians to carry loaded weapons as long as they were not concealed, as do many states today. And the newly formed Black Panther Party took advantage of the law,\" the narrator states.\n\n\"We would stop. We would get out of the cars. We would walk up to the scene. Those who had rifles would carry them in the open and clearly visible,\" original Black Panthers member Sherwin Forte says in the video.\n\nBlack Panthers leader Huey Newton describes how the Panthers would \"stand at a distance\" so that police couldn't claim the Black Panthers were interfering with arrests, \"and make sure there was no brutality.\"\n\nHowever, Ray Gaul of the Oakland Police Department, says in the video that the Black Panthers would take their weapons and \"sweep the barrel right over the police officers. \"It was pretty intimidating,\" he said.\n\nA segment shows news footage of a gun battle between police and Panthers in Houston and includes reports of other shootouts in Chicago and New Orleans.\n\n\"Obviously, we are nowhere near this today. In fact, we may be at a transformative moment,\" states the narrator. \"People of all ages and races are recognizing the problems with policing in black communities and are protesting. Now there's a chance for real change but police departments and political leaders must not overreact as they did 50 years ago. They need to listen.\"\n\n\"That's possible,\" she said, \"but at the very least this is an incredibly narrow reading, and it doesn't do justice to what kids deserve at any level in terms of an accurate telling of history.\"\n\nMost Americans expect history to be \"accurate and truthful, and not related to a political agenda ... and this is an example where that falls far short,\" she said.\n\nWilliams questioned the rationale behind depicting the Black Panthers in such a positive light without mentioning the criminal element associated with the movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe Black Panthers were not a \"cookie-cutter fit\" in history and held a wide range of ideas-many that are covered in the lesson, she said.\n\nHowever, the lesson omits several key facts \"to fit a particular agenda of the day,\" said Williams.\n\nSome of those omissions are heinous crimes-including murder and torture-that members of the Black Panthers committed.\n\nThe group was originally called the \"Black Panther Party for Self-Defense\" and stated its mission was to monitor police and challenge police brutality. Known for wearing black berets and leather-clad clothing, the Black Panthers called for the arming of all \"Afro-Americans.\"\n\nThe Party's official newspaper, The Black Panther, often referred to police as \"pigs\" and published slogans such as \"Guns Baby Guns.\" It used terms such as \"cracker\" and \"honky\" when referring to white people.\n\nIn one newspaper issue, an illustration of an armed man was paired with a quote from communist revolutionary leader Che Guevara that read, \"The great lesson of the invincibility of guerrilla warfare is catching on among the masses of the dispossessed. The galvanization of the national spirit, the preparation for more difficult tasks, for resistance to more violent repression, hate as a factor in the struggle; intransigent hate for the enemy, which takes one beyond the natural limitations of a human being and converts one into an effective, violent, single-minded, cold killing machine.\n\n\"Our soldiers must be like that; a people without hate cannot triumph over a brutal enemy.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Black Panthers had 2,000 members and ran chapters in several major U.S. cities, but the militant rhetoric, radical propaganda, and escalating violent protests led to repeated shootouts in the streets with police and other rival groups.\n\nThe black nationalist group demanded the exemption of black Americans from the draft and from every aspect of so-called white America. The Panthers also demanded reparations payments and the release of all black Americans from jails.\n\nThe newspaper glorified Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X, Marxist militants, and communist dictators including Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh.\n\nAngela Davis, a California member of the Communist Party of the United States of America, persuaded her comrades to join forces with the Black Panthers in the early 1970s under the auspices of fighting racism, strengthening the bond between far-left ideas and black nationalism.\n\nMarxist ideology and the distrust of police also exist today within the Black Lives Matter (BLM) leadership. Embattled BLM leader, Patrisse Cullors, for example, has stated she and other leaders are \"trained Marxists,\" and BLM has pushed for cities to defund local police departments.\n\nIn 1970, Seale faced trial in the New Haven Black Panther trials over the death of Alex Rackley, who the Black Panthers suspected as a police informant. Rackley was tortured, shot in the head, and his body dumped in a swamp. Though Seale was accused of ordering Rackley's execution, the jury couldn't reach a verdict and the charges against him were dropped. Nine other Panthers, known as the \"New Haven Nine\" were convicted on charges related to the Rackley torture and murder case.\n\n• Huey Newton, who wrote the Black Panther Party's 10-point manifesto, was arrested for his involvement in a shootout which led to the death of one police officer, John Frey, and injured another. Newton was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to prison, but the conviction was overturned in May 1970. After his release from prison, Newton succumbed to alcohol and cocaine addiction as faction fighting splintered the Black Panther Party. He was shot to death in 1989 by a member of the Black Guerrilla Family, a rival black power group that opposed the Panthers.\n\n• Eldridge Cleaver, the editor of the Party's official newspaper, The Black Panther, was convicted of burglary, assault, rape, and attempted murder. After serving in Folsom and San Quentin prisons, Cleaver was released on parole in 1968. Shortly after his release from prison, he was allegedly involved in an attack on police in Oakland in which two officers were injured. He fled the U.S. as a fugitive from the law and later supported the idea of a Marxist revolution in Algeria, where he was hiding. There he killed a Panther whom he accused of sleeping with his wife.\n\nCleaver eventually returned to the U.S. in 1975. He disagreed with Newton on a number of key ideas and was eventually expelled from the Black Panther Party. He became a Mormon and a Republican later in life, but he continued to struggle with a crack cocaine addiction and was arrested for possession. His health began to decline, and he died at age 62 in Pomona, Calif.\n\n• Sundiata Acoli, 85, was convicted in May 1973 shooting of state trooper Werner Foerster. Acoli was released from prison on May 10, 2022, after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled he was no longer a risk to public safety.\n\n• Jalil Muntaqim, born Anthony Jalil Bottom in Oakland, Calif., served 49 years in prison for the 1971 killings of New York police officers, Waverly Jones and Joseph Piagentini. He was released on Oct. 7, 2020.\n\n• Herman Bell was also convicted in the murder of Jones and Piagentini and was released from prison in 2018 after serving more than 40 years.\n\n• Mumia Abu-Jamal, born Wesley Cook, remains in prison. He joined the Black Panthers at age of 15 in 1967 and was convicted for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. He served 30 years on death row until his sentence was commuted to life without parole.\n\n• Veronza Leon Curtis Bowers Jr. was sentenced to life in prison for the 1973 murder of U.S. park ranger Kenneth Patrick at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, Calif.\n\n• Romaine \"Chip\" Fitzgerald was imprisoned for more than 50 years for the 1969 murder of Barge Miller, a mall security guard and the attempted murder of a California highway patrolman in a shootout following a traffic stop. He was sentenced to death, but California commuted his sentences to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1972. Fitzgerald died at the age of 71 on March 28, 2021.\n\n\"I was very surprised at how washed over the actual classwork was and what he was asked to write about,\" she said.\n\nFrom reading the lesson, Cassidy said she didn't get the impression that the Black Panthers had done anything wrong. They seemed to be portrayed as cultural visionaries that influenced today's music, and they \"had a really cool lifestyle and look and they fed people and they got them health care.\"\n\nCassidy said it is \"incredibly one-sided\" and \"naïve,\" to see The Black Panthers as being so altruistic.\n\n\"They were violent against a lot of people,\" she said. \"There are still Black Panthers in prison today for some of the atrocities that they committed and that wasn't reflected.\"\n\nInstead, the overall message in the lesson is that the Black Panthers were \"standing up and fighting for good,\" Cassidy said.\n\nNear the beginning of the school year, students in the class were asked to take a test for \"implicit bias.\" When her son showed her the test, Cassidy told him he didn't have to take it.\n\nCassidy's son told her the teacher seems to believe everyone in the class is \"implicitly racist.\"\n\nIn the same week, the teacher gave the students a quiz \"to learn more about them,\" and they were asked about their political ideology-if they were Republican or Democrat. More recently students were asked to bring identification to school to pre-register to vote, Cassidy said.\n\nAccording to her son, the teacher has devised seating arrangements that segregate students into racial groups, Cassidy said.\n\n\"There are two African Americans in the class, and they're seated beside each other. The Hispanics are seated by each other, and he's sitting next to other white kids in the class,\" she said.\n\nThe class is all about \"how America has wronged people,\" she said.\n\nHer son has told her the main message he gets from his teacher is how the \"white man ruins all.\"\n\nHowever, her son can't reconcile the picture of America as \"such an awful place\" with the reality that people with nothing but the clothes on their back are risking their lives to come here for better opportunities, she said.\n\nCassidy said the social justice ideology is spilling over from another class called Identity and Agency that weaves social justice issues and ethnic studies into U.S. history, because both classes are taught by the same teacher.\n\nTwo of her son's friends who are taking the Identity and Agency class have the same presentations and same homework, so he is still being taught the same social justice issues even though he didn't sign up for that class, she said.\n\n\"It's harming my son, because I feel like he's not being challenged to be a critical thinker. He's being spoon-fed propaganda of the times that we're in, and I feel that's unfair to him,\" she said. \"But, more importantly, I feel it's a tremendous disservice to all of the public-school students.\"\n\nCassidy said she's less concerned about her son because they talk a lot about his studies at home. But she wonders how some children must feel if they're constantly told their lot in life is based on how they look.\n\n\"That's not what America is about. We are the land of opportunity. We've got great freedoms, and we've got choices. Every day, we're faced with choices and how we can make our lives better, and how we can make our lives better for those around us,\" she said. \"I feel so bad for public school kids in California.\"\n\nNeither San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) officials, the Point Loma High School principal, nor the teacher of the Black Panther lesson responded to Epoch Times inquiries.\n\nThe San Diego Unified School District has adopted the \"Liberated\" Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (LESMC), a more radical or progressive version of the already controversial state-mandated curriculum. The \"liberated\" model was rejected as the official state-mandated model of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) but individual school districts are still allowed to adopt it.\n\nThe LESMC Consortium displays in large type on its website an unattributed quote on that reads: \"White Privilege is your history being part of the core curriculum and mine being taught as an elective.\"\n\nOne LESMC leader stated in a Nov. 20, 2021, webcast called \"Demystifying Critical Race Theory,\" while promoting liberated ethnic studies, \"What you will see in the lessons that follow are how classroom teachers begin to use critical race theory connected to ethnic studies in a way to empower and to create social justice activists out of our students.\""

      "text": "If you read this newsletter you are acutely aware of the transformation of the mainstream media over the last decade and, especially, over the past couple of years. But few have offered a fully satisfying answer to the question of why .\n\nWhy is it, for example, that between 2013 and 2019, the frequency of the words \"white\" and \"racial privilege\" exploded by 1,200 percent in The New York Times and by 1,500 percent in The Washington Post? Why was the term \"white supremacy\" used 2,400 times by National Public Radio in 2020?\n\nWhat changed? Why was there suddenly a relentless focus on race and power? And who-or what-was driving it?\n\nAt last those questions have been answered with unusual clarity by Batya Ungar-Sargon in her new book \" Bad News: How Woke Media is Undermining Democracy .\"\n\nBatya, who is an opinion editor at Newsweek, is hard to pin down politically. I first met her in 2018 and I would have described her then as woke. These days I'd call her a left-wing populist. (She's part of an endangered species: a person willing to change her mind.) But what I appreciate most about Batya, and what I think you'll find when you read the essay below, is someone who is able to put ideology aside and pursue to illuminate why the news is broken, how it is fueling one war (culture) to distract from another (class), and how that might be changed. - BW\n\nOn November 16, 2018, CNN's Don Lemon hosted a panel discussion about white women who voted for Donald Trump. There was no real news peg for the story; the president hadn't spent the morning tweeting about anything specific, and it was 10 days after the midterm elections. But Lemon valiantly torqued them into an awkward hook for the panel: \"A wave of women, white, black and brown are sweeping into office after the 2018 election. Does Donald Trump still have the support of a majority of white women and if so, why is that?\"\n\nA Friday night capping off a slow news week was as good an opportunity as any to bring up the increasingly hot topic of white supremacy. In fact, the only remarkable thing about the panel was how unremarkable it was, one of a thousand such panels that have graced American airwaves in recent years.\n\nLemon's guests were Kirsten Powers, a senior CNN political analyst; Alice Stewart, a CNN commentator playing the supporting role of token Republican; and Stephanie Jones-Rogers, a professor of history at UC Berkeley, whose book \"They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South\" had been cited in an article on Vox, a progressive opinion site that caters to millennials.\n\nPowers had much to say about Donald Trump's female supporters. \"People will say that they support him for reasons other than his racist language,\" she told Lemon. \"They'll say, 'Well I'm not racist; I just voted for him because I didn't like Hillary Clinton.' And I just want to say that that's not, that doesn't make you not racist. It actually makes you racist,\" Powers explained. \"As for why white women do it,\" she went on, \"I think we have to remember that the white patriarchal system actually benefits white women in a lot of ways.\"\n\nProfessor Jones-Rogers concurred. \"So, as a historian, I explore white women's economic investments in the institution of slavery,\" she said. \"And what that has led me to understand is that there's this broader historical context that we need to keep in mind when we're looking at white women's voting patterns today, and as we look at their support-their overwhelming support of Donald Trump.\" Lemon jumped in to note that just over half of white women had voted for Trump-hardly what would constitute \"overwhelming\" support. Jones-Rogers clarified: \"What I meant by overwhelming was emotionally overwhelming.\"\n\nThe sole Republican, Alice Stewart, was briefly allowed to respond, and voiced her resentment at being called racist for her vote for Trump, whom she chose for his policies. But Powers interjected: It's not just Republican women who have a problem with racism but all white women, indeed, all white people . \"Every white person benefits from an inherently racist system that is structurally racist, so we are all part of the problem,\" Powers said. Jones-Rogers heartily agreed. It was a scene as inescapable today as it would have been rare ten years ago.\n\nFor a long time, the notion that America is an unrepentant white-supremacist state-one that confers power and privilege to white people and systematically denies them to people of color-was the province of far-left activists and academics. But over the past decade, it's found its way into the mainstream, largely through liberal media outlets like the New York Times, NPR, MSNBC, the Washington Post, Vox, CNN, the New Republic, and the Atlantic.\n\nWhat changed? Most obviously: white liberals. Their enthusiasm for wokeness created a feedback loop with the media outlets to which they are paying subscribers. And the impact has been monumental: Once distinct publications and news channels are now staggeringly uniform. A moral panic around race is everywhere: In television segments like Don Lemon's, and articles like \"Is the White Church Inherently Racist?\" and \"The Housewives of White Supremacy\" and \"When Black People Are in Pain, White People Just Join Book Clubs\" and \"How White Women Use Themselves as Instruments of Terror,\" which have become the bread and butter of the New York Times and the Washington Post.\n\nWhere did this obsession come from? The election of Donald Trump is often given all the credit. Trump was so extreme in his disregard of liberal mores, so willing to offend with comments that were sometimes casually racist-comments that were amplified and justified throughout conservative and right-wing news outlets-that American liberals, including the liberal media, swung hard to the left. This is true: The mainstream media certainly molded itself around Trump, whose presidency was a major gift to MSNBC and CNN and the New York Times-outlets that were facing a bleak outlook are now thriving thanks to the ratings and clicks that the Trump stories generated.\n\nBut Trump is an insufficient answer. The moral panic mainstreamed by the liberal news media had actually been underway for at least five years before Trump appeared on the scene. It began around 2011, the year the New York Times erected its online paywall. It was then that articles mentioning \"racism,\" \"people of color,\" \"slavery,\" or \"oppression\" started to appear with exponential frequency at the Times, BuzzFeed, Vox, the Washington Post, and NPR.\n\nThis \"Great Awokening\" has been impossible to miss if you consume mainstream news. But you don't have to rely on your impressions. David Rozado, a computer scientist who teaches at New Zealand's Otago Polytechnic, created a computer program that trawled the online archives of the Times from 1970 to 2018 to track the frequency with which certain words were used. What he found was that the frequency of words like \"racism,\" \"white supremacy,\" \"KKK,\" \"traumatizing,\" \"marginalized,\" \"hate speech,\" \"intersectionality,\" and \"activism\" had absolutely skyrocketed during that time.\n\nHis work echoes that of another academic, Zach Goldberg, a PhD candidate in political science at Georgia State University who found that in 2010, the term \"white supremacy\" was used fewer than 75 times in 2010 in the Washington Post and the New York Times, but over 700 times in 2020 alone; at NPR, it was used 2,400 times. The word \"racism\" appeared in the Washington Post over 4,000 times in 2020. That's the equivalent of using it in 10 articles every single day.\n\nWhat could explain the sudden market for this obsession with race and power?\n\nThe reason for this radical shift, despite the media's fixation on race, has very little to do with it. It has everything to do with class.\n\nJournalism has become a profession of astonishing privilege over the past century, metamorphosing from a blue-collar trade into one of the occupations with the most highly educated workforces in the United States. And along with this status revolution has come the radicalization of the profession on questions of identity, leaving in the dust anything commensurate to a similar concern with economic inequality.\n\nThe recent obsession with identity has allowed these journalists to pretend-indeed to believe -they are still speaking truth to power, still fighting on behalf of the little guy, even after they have themselves ascended to the ranks of the powerful, even when they are speaking down to an audience who, in more cases than not, have less than them on every measurable scale. It has quite simply been a displacement exercise; instead of experiencing economic guilt about rising inequality and their status among America's elite, members of the news media-along with other highly educated liberals-have come to believe that the only inequality that matters is racial inequality; the only guilt that matters is white guilt, the kind you can do absolutely nothing to fix, given that it's based on something as immutable as your skin color.\n\nIn other words, despite a no doubt well-intentioned desire to ameliorate racial inequality, their enthusiasm for the language of wokeness has allowed affluent white liberals to perpetuate and even excuse a deeply unequal economic status quo.\n\nIf journalists once fought the powerful on behalf of the powerless, in 21st century America, they are the powerful. While the average pay for a journalism job is quite low at around $40,000 a year, that's because entry-level jobs pay so little; at the higher levels, journalists now make quite a bit more than the average American. More importantly, journalists now have social and cultural power, and they are overwhelming the children of economic elites. After all, to even be able to make it on $30,000 a year while living in the most expensive cities in America (the only ones left with a functioning journalism industry, thanks to the rise of the Internet and the collapse of local newspapers), you have to come from a family with enormous economic privilege who can help you out. Once a blue-collar trade, journalism has become something akin to an impenetrable caste. And what journalists have done with that power, perhaps inadvertently, is to wage a cultural battle that enhances their own economic interests against a less-educated and struggling American working class.\n\nOnce working-class warriors, the little guys taking on America's powerful elites, journalists today are an American elite, a caste that has abandoned its working class roots as part of its meritocratic climb. And a moral panic around race has allowed them to mask this abandonment under the guise of \"social justice.\"\n\nTake Kirsten Powers, one of Lemon's guests on that panel in 2018. Powers had been the resident liberal at Fox News until CNN poached her in 2016, for a rumored $950,000 yearly salary.\n\nBut for Powers to traverse the ideological distance from Fox to CNN and take advantage of that nearly million-dollar salary, she had to undergo a woke metamorphosis. In 2015, while still employed by Fox, Powers had written a book called \"The Silencing: How the Left Is Killing Free Speech.\" But in the intervening years, she repented. \"I was too dismissive of real concerns by traumatized people and groups who feel marginalized and ignored,\" she wrote in a mea culpa in her USA Today column.\n\nNewly reformed, Powers was able to take to CNN and join a panel to discuss how racist every white person in America is, especially anyone who voted for Trump (there was a bit of slippage between those two contradictory positions). That Lemon panel in 2018, typical in every way of our national news media, featured two television hosts with millions of dollars in the bank, who were convinced that white supremacy is alive and well in America.\n\n\"When people hear 'privilege,' they think that means I'm, like, a Richie Rich, and I'm living a rich life. That's not what it means,\" Powers patiently explained later in the CNN segment, without any apparent irony. \"It just means you have a privilege that people of color don't have.\"\n\nWhy are affluent white liberals so eager to believe we're living in a white-supremacist state, and that they are the beneficiaries of white supremacy? There are a number of explanations.\n\nIn his 2007 book \"White Guilt: How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era,\" Shelby Steele argues that the success of the civil rights movement resulted in a crisis of moral authority in white America when it recognized its collective role in the sin of racism. Writing in the 1990s, the historian Christopher Lasch argued that the Left had begun to portray the nation, the neighborhood, and even the commitment to a common standard as racist, as part of a larger attack on populism and abandonment of the working class.\n\nMore recently, in his book \"Hate, Inc.,\" Matt Taibbi explores how the media uses a fake notion of dissent to hide all the issues relevant to real Americans that it refuses to cover. \"We manufactured fake dissent, to prevent real dissent,\" writes Taibbi in a nod to Noam Chomsky's famous work \"Manufacturing Consent.\" And we know that historically, at least since the Russian Revolution, the intelligentsia has gone to great lengths to portray its own economic interests and power hoarding in the guise of a noble cause that works on behalf of the powerless.\n\nI think these are all pieces of the puzzle. But there's another real reason that, however unconscious, is certainly also at play, and it's this: Wokeness perpetuates the economic interests of affluent white liberals. I believe that many of them truly do wish to live in a more equitable society, but today's liberal elites are also governed by a competing commitment: their belief in meritocracy, or the fiction that their status was earned by their intelligence and talents. Today's meritocratic elites subscribe to the view that not only wealth but also political power should be the province of the highly educated. Still, liberals see themselves as compassionate and progressive. And perhaps unconsciously, they sought a way to reconcile the inequality that their meritocratic status produces with the compassionate emotions they feel toward the less fortunate. They needed a way to be perpetually on what they saw as the right side of history without having to disrupt what was right for them and their children.\n\nA moral panic around race was the perfect solution: It took the guilt that they should have felt around their economic good fortune and political power- which they could have shared with the less fortunate had they cared to-and displaced it onto their whiteness, an immutable characteristic that they could do absolutely nothing to change.\n\nThis is how white liberals arrived at a situation where instead of agitating for a more equal society, they agitated for more diverse elites. Instead of asking why our elites have risen so far above the average American, they asked why the elites are so white. Instead of asking why working-class people of all races are so underrepresented in the halls of power, white liberals called the working class racist for voting for Trump. Instead of asking why New York City's public school system is more segregated than Alabama's, white liberals demanded diversity, equity, and inclusion training in their children's exorbitantly priced prep schools.\n\nIn other words, wokeness provided the perfect ideology for affluent, liberal whites who didn't truly want systemic change if it meant their children would have to sacrifice their own status, but who still wanted to feel like the heroes of a story about social justice, who still wanted to feel vastly superior to their conservative and even slightly less radical friends. They took a no doubt genuine abhorrence for the truly heinous ways black Americans have been treated historically-and, in some cases, continue to be treated-and instead of seeing in it a call to arms to create a genuinely equal society, they used it as an excuse to withdraw from the common good and the social contract, rebranding the problem of racism to fit the solution that would most benefit them. In the process, they demonized America itself, deplatforming the working class (of all races) while protecting their own status.\n\nRacism is still a blight on American life. But wokeness is not how we heal; it has simply redefined the problem to the benefit of educated elites. By focusing on immutable characteristics like race, the woke moral panic has allowed economic elites to evade responsibility for their regressive view that elites should not only exist but rule. And in presenting race rather than class and income as America's deep and worsening divide, the purveyors of wokeness have ended up comforting white, liberal elites, even as they have called them white supremacists.\n\nIt would have been impossible without the media. Once a tool to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, today American journalism comforts the comfortable, speaks power to truth, and insists on an orthodoxy that protects the interests of the elites in the language of a culture war whose burden is given to the working class to bear. In his book \"What's the Matter With Kansas,\" Thomas Frank famously asked why white, working-class voters were voting against their own economic interests. But in 2016, when they voted in their own economic interests, those in the media called them racists.\n\nThe cost of erasing people who are economically working class from the conversation, the cost of concealing rather than exposing the class divide, has deepened and perpetuated inequality. This is plainly a disaster for anyone who truly cares about a more just society. And certainly for any nation that wishes to see itself as a democracy.\n\nReading Batya's piece put me in mind of my conversation with Martin Gurri, whose own book, \"The Revolt of the Public,\" brilliantly explains our collapsing trust in the media  and in so many other institutions in American life. Listen here:\n\nAgreed with a lot of this. but the only equality we should be pushing for is equality of opportunity.\n\nI strongly  oppose any attempts to make equality of outcome. Although we should all be equal in the eyes of the law.  That doesn't mean we should all enjoy an even split of the economic pie.\n\nSome people are smarter than others, some people work harder (or work smarter).  And some the free market just rewards for their talent to throw a ball (see sports stars etc).\n\nI know a lot of people who are content to just do their 40 hour work week, and then kick back the rest of the time.  But if you really want to get ahead that's no where near enough.\n\nI worked 40+ hours a week while going to school to get my MBA.  Same for the 10 months of intense studying for my CPA.\n\nYou can be damn sure I wouldn't have done that if it wasn't going to carry an economic reward.  Mine as well sit around playing video games...\n\nDon't trade BS wokeism, for BS socialism nonsense\n\nThis piece describes how wokeness infected one elite K-12 school - they became Yale's dancing bear. https://thenakeddollar.blogspot.com/2021/11/the-spence-yale-connection-or-how.html\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Among the many unforgettable photographs in Gillian Laub's new book, \" Family Matters ,\" is Mom after yoga . In it, a middle-aged woman sporting all-white athleisure and a vambrace of gold bracelets is stretched out on a white carpet in savasana, or \"corpse pose.\" A few feet away, Fox News is on a huge flatscreen TV. It's the height of the 2020 election, and President Donald Trump is barking about something in a hangar in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The chyron reads: \"Joe Biden Is a Puppet of the Radical Left.\"\n\nHere, in the comfort of her multi-million-dollar home in the suburbs of New York City, is the pro-Trump, white-privileged, hyper-cocooned Uber-Karen - she who was designed to outrage progressives like Gillian Laub, who just happens to be the daughter of Mom after yoga .\n\nLaub marched for Black Lives Matter and partied in the streets when Biden won. \"This man was gross,\" she writes of Trump. \"I tried to reach my mother, woman to woman, but it just never worked.\"\n\nHer parents' support for Trump - and they were all in , donating big time, going to inaugural balls, posing with Omarosa - mystified Laub. She loved her mom and dad more than anyone in the world. They were so generous, so kind. And now, now . . . this ? How could they?\n\nAfter building a successful real-estate business, her parents moved, in the 1980s, to Chappaqua. There was lots of thinly veiled - and not so thinly veiled - antisemitism. Gillian's first boyfriend, when she was 14 years old, told her to \"tuck that shit in\" when he spotted her wearing a Star of David. The local country clubs had a rule: no blacks or Jews allowed. In 1996, \"when Trump's club opened up, it was like, 'If you can pay, you're welcome!' So my dad formed his own community there,\" Laub said in an interview.\n\nLaub's mom would tell her that \"the only reason I could afford to have the views I did was because of everything they gave me,\" Laub writes, \"because I had been shielded from the hard realities that, she asserted, were the ultimate challenge to progressive views.\"\n\nAt the heart of this tug-of-war between mother and daughter were bigger questions: Who in 21st-century America counts as an \"elite\"? The seemingly out-of-touch parents who had to claw their way into the upper echelons of the socioeconomic food chain? Or their bleeding-heart liberal daughter who benefited from their striving? Does privilege come from money? Skin color? Admission to the institutions that control the country's cultural capital?\n\nThese are some of the themes that course through Laub's new book, published by Aperture, and the accompanying exhibition at the International Center for Photography. Laub, whose previous work explored segregated proms in rural Georgia (\"Southern Rites\") and victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (\"Testimony\"), achieves something here that so many Americans have failed to: to bridge the divide between warring, political camps; to make sense of how it is that people we love hold views we can't stand; and to assert that it doesn't matter more than family. Or it shouldn't.\n\nIt is hard not to fall in love with the Laubs. They're a type that pretty much everyone in this country who is not a descendant of the Mayflower is familiar with - those who hustled, made a boatload, and aren't shy about their success. Perhaps in part because that success reaffirmed their love of America. One image - of Laub's grandfather in super-tight Zebra swim trunks while hanging out in his vegetable garden - says it all. \"I know I look nuts,\" he seems to be saying, \"but my wife buys me all my clothes, and she loves when I wear this crap, and who really cares anyway? I'm having the time of my life.\"\n\n\"Family Matters\" made me want to be a part of it all - for mom and dad to squeeze my face and insist I'm looking too svelte . For Gillian's Aunt Phyllis to squeeze my upper arm and tell me she just heard of a new workout to get rid of that flab. For her brother-in-law, Scott, to say something off-color -\"Can someone tell me why we can't say 'cross-dresser' anymore?\" - and for me and Gillian to roll our eyes at each other across the table. I want to waddle out of her family's house after a long, loud Thanksgiving repast, very full, with a warm feeling inside and a slight headache from the endless yammering.\n\nI sat down with Gillian to discuss all of the above. Here is our conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nYou set the stage with your grandparents, who look like they really enjoyed their life. They love their furs and their finery, and each other. When I look at the first pictures, I think: this is the heyday for Jews in America. They made it. And they made it here in a way that never was possible anywhere else. Did you always have a sense of patriotism from your family?\n\nMy grandparents had a profound sense of patriotism and civic duty. They were so proud. This country gave them the opportunity and they built their lives here. I have a letter in the exhibition from my paternal grandfather where he describes being beat up for being a Christ killer on his way to school in Red Hook, Brooklyn. He didn't put it in the letter but he eventually learned to fight back and became a Golden Gloves champion. It hurts me so much that I didn't appreciate him and what he went through when he was alive. Back then I would think, \"Ugh, another one of grandpa's lectures.\" I didn't get what he had to go through for us to live this privileged life. I didn't get how I was raised, and how lucky I was until I saw more than the little tribe I grew up in. I feel so indebted to them, and I'm so sad that, by the time I could understand their history and what they went through to make it in America, they were gone.\n\nThere's also a sense in the pictures that, not only do you have to be loyal to each other, but that you have to have fun together and love spending time together.\n\nI do think that comes from the top. My grandparents had this sense of devotion to family above anything else, and to be good people. That's why, when the Trump years came, it was such an existential crisis for me, because, in my head, I was like, \"Wait, wait, [my parents] are the best people I know! How can they be supporting this? I just don't understand.\" That's why it was so traumatic for me! There were moments during his presidency that were really, really tough. There were four or five years where I woke up with a stomach ache, and I wasn't sleeping at night because of what was going on with them.\n\nWhen you look back on the exhibition, do you regret any of the photos you took, or the screenshots you published of your family group text, getting into it over Trump?\n\nI don't have regrets. When my father and sister read the book, they weren't angry, and they didn't think I misrepresented them - they knew I was being honest - but they said that they felt so bad for me. They felt bad that I could get this upset and have this much angst and anger over someone. In their eyes, they thought I was being childish and judgmental. But these were my visceral responses.\n\nThere's a lot of back and forth in the book between you and your dad, where you're accusing each other of being \"the elite.\" Certainly if we are measuring in terms of wealth, your family is elite, but they don't see themselves that way. Why not?\n\nThey really don't. My father is really earnest, and he feels connected to blue-collar workers. He sees himself as a scrappy boy from Brooklyn that's pulling himself up by his bootstraps. He's not an intellect. He's got street smarts. And he really felt as though he'd been condescended to for so many years by politicians, by \"the elite,\" and he resents that.\n\nWhen he talks about the elite, he goes on rants about \"people with fancy oratory skills who are full of shit and who have never worked a real job in their life.\" His own father started a summer camp. His business is in the Bronx. So he prides himself on really connecting with all sorts of people. I would say, \"How can you not think you're elite? You live in Chappaqua, you drive fancy cars - you're the elite!\" And he would say, \"No, it's not about money, it's about attitude. 'Elite' is an attitude.\"\n\nThat's like how Trump wasn't really elite. The elite despised Trump.\n\nExactly! Where we live in Chappaqua, our neighbors were hugely anti-Semitic. We were not welcomed. We were like the gauche nouveau riche . My father wasn't allowed into the clubs that my friend's parents belonged to. They did not allow black or Jewish people. When Trump's club opened up, it was like, \"If you can pay, you're welcome!\", so my dad formed his own community there.\n\nI don't want to sound like I'm justifying it, because he overlooked way too much, but if we're talking about empathy and meeting someone where they are, I understand it on an emotional level, because my dad is someone who does not follow the rules. He's always felt like an outlier. Trump spoke to him in that way.\n\nI'm in a politically mixed family, too. My mom is a liberal and my dad is a conservative. In 2016 and 2020, my mother threatened to withhold sex from my dad if he dared to pull the lever for Trump. He ended up writing in my mom's name, but I know he wasn't completely disappointed with the Trump presidency, and, for similar reasons that your parents talk about, he hated the Iran deal, and he loved when Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem, even if he thought Trump was personally grotesque. But your parents weren't Trump-curious, like mine. They weren't shy about it. They were hard-core. They had the embroidered golf clubs and the swag, and they went to the inauguration parties and wrote checks. Had you ever seen them get that into anything before?\n\nNo! And I wish I was a psychoanalyst, so I could understand them better. I don't think they're conscious of what it was, but I think they felt like they belonged to something. They felt alienated in our country, which would blow my mind, because it's like, \" You felt alienated? You have the most amazing life! You won!\"\n\nI know my grandparents wouldn't have voted for Trump. For my parents, though, I think about how, as Jews, they tried so hard to assimilate and be accepted into white America, so Trump instilled a fear in them that they were going to lose it all. With the picture of my mom doing savasana with Trump in the background, I walked into the room, and she said to me, \"Gillian, just try and listen with an open mind.\" And I couldn't have timed this more perfectly, because Trump was giving a speech in an airport hangar talking to suburban women, saying something like, \"Your American Dream will stay alive with me.\" He was talking directly to my mother.\n\nAnd she would say to me, \"Easy for you to be so self-righteous, you've had it all. Do you want us to lose where we live?\" She actually thought, in her heart of hearts, they would lose their home that we worked so hard to build. She was angry! It's like, when you wake up and go to sleep with Fox News, the fear is so powerful.\n\nYou write about how you felt as though your mom were replaced by a Fox News anchor. What were they saying about you?\n\nThey think I'm just as brainwashed. They think the exact same thing about me.\n\nSo, toward the end of Trump's presidency, you start to pull back from your family.\n\nThere was a lot of push and pull throughout the years. Eventually, Tahl, my husband, and I realized that we shouldn't talk that much about this. There wasn't that much time left of Trump's presidency, and we were focused on just getting through the election.\n\nI didn't want to be apathetic, but I just decided to keep it light and talk about the kids. So I was sort of at the place of, \"Okay family is more important.\" Plus, I have a close friend in Miami in the same boat. Her father is really Trumpy, and she was my support group. One day she came to my house hysterically crying and said, \"This isn't worth it, my dad is in the hospital.\" She had really cut her parents off, and she was so upset and ashamed of herself. She made me promise that I would go and be with them and love them.\n\nIt became, like, \"Really, how can I give them this grief?\" It made me check myself. This was right before Covid. It didn't take much convincing. I knew I had hurt them, and our relationship was very strained. But then the pandemic hit, and the wound was opened up so much, and salt was poured onto it. It was so obvious to me that Trump was doing such a bad job of it, but they were determined to defend him. In the beginning, Trump wasn't taking it seriously, so they were out at restaurants, and not taking it seriously, and we got into a huge fight, because I told them, \"You cannot go out.\" It was a massive fight, and I thought, \"He's killing my family.\" I was so angry, because I thought, \"Oh wait, this is actually becoming life or death.\" I truly felt like they could die.\n\nDid your parents start masking up?\n\nYes, thank god! Because that would have been a real problem. They started taking it really seriously. My mom will not take her mask off. And then the air started to come out of the balloon when Biden won, just because it meant Trump wouldn't be part of our collective lives anymore. Then, with the insurrection, my dad started to come around. He was thinking, \"This was enough. This is disgraceful.\" And I thought, \"Thank God, I have my family back.\"\n\nI'm assuming they don't buy into the big lie that the election was stolen.\n\nI wouldn't go that far. My mom said she had something to do and wasn't able to tune into Biden's inauguration. My dad was actually open-minded and sent this hopeful text about Biden's speech. Now, of course, he's saying, \"Well that feeling lasted about a week.\"\n\nBesides the Trump pictures, I love the ones of your grandmother aging - specifically, the one where she's with her aide, Dorothy, in the kitchen, and your grandmother is basking in the sun while they're eating lunch, and Dorothy looks kind of over it.\n\nThat's something I thought about when I was growing up. It's a really complicated relationship. Dorothy and my grandma used to fight over getting my grandma to eat, and I would apologize to Dorothy, like, \"I'm sorry she's so cranky.\" I went to Dorothy's apartment in the Bronx to interview her and see her life post-my grandparents. She told me what an impact my grandfather made on her life - he paid for her son to go to college, for example - and that he had begged her, on his deathbed, \"Please, please take care of my BeaBea.\" So, she really did feel that obligation to see that through. Her relationship with my grandparents, in general, was hysterical, but there was a big loss when my grandfather died. I forgot the point I was making . . .\n\nIt's like there's one read of the pictures that's about power dynamics and racial dynamics. And then there's another one about what it looks like to age with dignity, and about our obligation to show up for one another even when it's a bit cumbersome because we made a promise or just because it's the right thing. Growing up, I always found it weird when people called their nannies \"like members of the family.\" Because you don't pay your family! It's like saying, \"We're comfortable.\" It's a dead giveaway that you're very rich. But there is a very fine line, because even though Dorothy is technically an employee, she's also doing something so intimate, which is walking your grandmother to her death. And she's there to fulfill a promise to your grandfather as much as, if not more so, than she is to collect a check.\n\nIf I were to say, more than anything, what identifies my family - it's showing up. That is the one thing that they instilled in me, like, \"You show up for the people that you care about. I don't care if you don't feel like it. I don't care if you feel sick.\" And there's something really powerful and beautiful about that.\n\nYou've photographed Mariah Carey, Chrissy Teigen, Beyoncé, Dolly Parton. Who is the bigger diva? Your mother or Patti LuPone?\n\nWait, do you know the Patti LuPone story? It was 2009, and I went to photograph Patti LuPone for New York Magazine for the last showing of \"Gypsy.\" The stage manager and the publicist had me go around to get the shot of her last number, but they hadn't told her I was going to be there taking a picture. She thought I was an audience member and stopped the show and screamed at me at the top of her lungs. I nearly died. I literally peed in my pants. I couldn't tell, \"Is she crazy?\" And I thought, \"Oh my God, I'm ruining my job - they're never going to hire me again.\" So they hustled me out of the theater, and she was really screaming.  She called me that night to apologize and asked me not to tell the reporter what had happened, and I didn't. It was the most terrifying moment of my life. She seemed like the biggest diva, but I shot her again, and we've laughed about it since.\n\nSo, my mom's not a diva. She's actually quite shy.\n\nFamily Above All.\n\nI have three siblings all well-off urban professionals who are very liberal-progressive who all voted for Biden and have since soured on him, primarily based on his inability to advance the uber-liberal agenda.\n\nI also have another brother, very successful small business owner who is an all-in Trumper along with his wife.\n\nThe common thread? NONE of these well educated otherwise thoughtful, caring people want to hear ANYTHING that deviates from their pre-conceived worldviews on any subject.\n\nMe? I'm a lifelong Republican who didn't really care for Trump who believes that Trump's \"accomplishments\" we're nothing more than Standard Republican Policy that could just have easily been enacted by a President Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio with a lot less drama and tumult.\n\nThis country needs to be governed by ADULTS on both sides of the aisle who will look pragmatically on what needs to be done and actively seek out the POSSIBLE over the fanciful.\n\nWe need more of these:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/885421125/yard-sign-in-this-house-we-believe-that?ref=related-1\n\nNo posts"

      "website": "https://www.thefp.com",
      "text": "Nestled into the mountains of the Upper Valley in New Hampshire, up a semi-paved road in a house next to a tiny cemetery lined with white picket fencing, Fergie Chambers, 38, leans over his kitchen island, worrying over his commune.\n\n\"It feels like we're throwing the same half-assed solutions at this over and over again and hoping it will yield something different,\" he groans into his iPhone, which is on speaker. Fergie's slight, but buff, on account of his multiple times a day martial arts training and competitions. His hair is cut short. A silver boxing glove dangles from one of his ears. He is covered in tattoos, including a double portrait of Stalin and Mao inked onto his thigh. He looks as if the phrase \"Fuck you, Mom and Dad\" were a person.\n\nI offer my hand to a wheezing bulldog named Madison while Fergie talks over the phone to his employee in Alford, Massachusetts-the tiny Berkshires town where he's bought 300 acres since 2019. Around 10 people live there at any given time. But he's unclear-with me, possibly with himself-on what that place is exactly.\n\nIt's a commune. It's a \"liberatory training space.\" It's a housing collective meets agricultural collective. It's where the People's Gym (\"free for working-class people and permanently closed to cops, active military, landlords, and capitalists\") is located. It's where the journal Combat Liberalism is based. It's the headquarters for the Berkshire Communists group, which Fergie started. It's where the Babochki Collective, the funding arm of all of Fergie's projects, sometimes meets.\n\nFergie's the General Secretary of the Berkshire Communists , which describes itself as a \"revolutionary Marxist-Leninist collective, aiming to promote the formation of a powerful workers' party.\" But the urgent issue that late summer afternoon-before Hamas's war against Israel; before Fergie called for \"making people who support Israel actually afraid to go out in public\"; before three of Fergie's comrades were arrested on the roof of a weapons manufacturer in New Hampshire-was that 16 comrades were descending on Alford for a weekend retreat, and it's been pouring rain. The canvas tents they pitched on the property are letting in water. A skylight in one of the six houses there is leaking. The punching bags in the barn-turned-gym are in the wrong place.\n\n\"It's just that, I spent a lot of money so this would be done right the first time,\" Fergie says, exasperated. Today, at least, the revolution requires fifty-dollar stall mats from Tractor Supply Company to line the floor of the tents and keep out moisture.\n\nThen, he changes his tune. He apologizes-\"I'm sorry I freaked out about the gym\"-and then Fergie's employee reminds him that when he drives over to the property tomorrow, not to forget the boxes of beekeeping equipment that were accidentally delivered to his house here, in New Hampshire.\n\n\"Right. I'll probably forget them,\" Fergie says.\n\n\"Well, I forgive you in advance.\"\n\n\"You don't have to do that,\" he tells her. \"You can hold it against me forever.\"\n\nHe's talking about the boxes, of course. But he could also be talking about the stupendous amount of money in his possession.\n\nFergie Chambers, an avowed communist since the age of 13, wants everyone to hold it against him forever that he is heir to an enormous fortune. And he's willing to go to enormous lengths to tear down the mechanisms-capitalism, imperialism, liberalism, the rule of law, America-that delivered it into his lap.\n\nThat struggle has taken him from the charming cobblestone streets of his Brooklyn childhood to the mountains of upstate New York to the lake country region of Georgia to the Donbas region of Ukraine and now, back to the woods of the American Northeast, where locals say that his radical political organizing has taken a menacing turn, especially when it comes to the Jewish state on which he's uniquely fixated.\n\n\"Make Zionists afraid,\" Fergie wrote in a post on his Instagram on November 15. In another he wrote: \"We need to start making people who support Israel actually afraid to go out in public. We need to make all of white America afraid that everything they have stolen is going to be burned to the ground. That's what makes them listen.\"\n\nSince the war broke out, Fergie and his group have been organizing demonstrations around the country. Ostensibly they're in support of Palestine-except members of the Berkshire Communists reportedly harassed a hardware store owner for selling Israeli flags and followed home employees of an Israeli defense company based in Boston. \"No descendant of European settlers is oppressed, anywhere,\" Fergie posted recently. \"Not nearly enough, anyhow.\"\n\nA few Massachusetts residents have told me that Fergie, and those who live on his compound, amount to a \"mob\" and a \"cult,\" with Fergie playing the dual role of guru and sugar daddy-he bought the properties, paid for the gym's remodel, and pays the rent of \"comrades\" who don't even live there. He pays bail fees, too, when those comrades get in trouble with the law for their brand of \"direct action.\"\n\n\"A lot of people are just scared,\" one resident of Great Barrington, the larger town that abuts Alford, told me, referring to things Fergie has posted online in recent weeks.\n\n\"There is nothing more disgusting than rich people who do nothing to undermine the material position of their own class vaguely calling for peace and love,\" Fergie wrote on Instagram on November 2. \"It gives me actual bloodlust.\"\n\n\"We're frightened to go out to restaurants, or cafés in town. It's chilling,\" the man in Great Barrington added. He tells me that the police aren't much help-\"they won't come\"-when it comes to Fergie and his followers, and that he's considering moving towns. (The police declined to comment and directed me to the DA's office who, through a representative, emailed to say that \"District Attorney Shugrue is aware of the comments and posts James Chambers has made. He is actively communicating with local law enforcement and community leaders regarding Chambers' behavior.\")\n\nAlmost all of the people I spoke to who live in the area around Fergie's compound refused to go on the record because they said they are scared of retaliation. \"People are getting panicky,\" one neighbor said.\n\nLocal press coverage has focused on Fergie's fondness for firearms. Many of his neighbors told me that the guns were what made them anxious. But a lot of people own guns. Fergie himself has claimed online that he's \"not a big gun guy\" and told me over text that \"I have like 4 guns,\" and added, \"I have a semi auto 40 cal Keltec [sic] that looks scary to liberals.\" While he poses with guns online , and told me \"I've always been into self-defense, and I was always kind of into guns,\" he pushes back on the recent press coverage: \"no one is raising a militia in Alford'' and to say so is \"a total deflection.\"\n\nIt is the Berkshires itself that seems to be a powder keg. There's a deep and growing tension in the \" best small town in America \"-especially since Covid brought an influx of second-home owners, driving home prices through the roof. There are very liberal colleges with very liberal students who want to take the theories they learn in the classroom into the streets. And then there's Fergie, with hundreds of millions of dollars, eager to make it all go boom.\n\n\"If he was just a kook, that would be one thing,\" a father in Great Barrington told me. \"If he was just a gun-toting communist, that would be one thing. If he was just a millionaire, who liked to host young people and put a roof over their head and train them and indoctrinate them, that would be one thing. But it's a completely different ball game when we're talking about someone from a family that is arguably not only the richest in the county, but maybe richer than the whole county put together.\"\n\nUntil very recently, by dint of his birth, Fergie owned a percentage of Cox Enterprises , a planet-spanning megacorporation, and the third largest private cable provider in the U.S. Over 50,000 people work there. The fact the Coxes still own the company outright makes them the eighth richest family in America, with a net worth around $34 billion.\n\nIt's like if the Murdochs had double the money. But instead of Australia, they're from America, and instead of conservative, they're all-except for Fergie and a lone Republican aunt that no one talks to-establishment Democrats.\n\n\"[My great-grandfather] believed that business and private enterprise could do more to make an impact on the world than anything,\" said Alex Taylor, Fergie's cousin and the current Cox Enterprises CEO. He was onstage with Bill Clinton a few years back, announcing a $20 million investment in green initiatives on behalf of Cox. \"I stand here today,\" added Taylor \"with a great privileged position, carrying on his legacy because of the way he set up his business and the way he set up his personal succession plan.\"\n\nThat first Cox , James, the first one to count for anything, was born in a log cabin on a farm in Ohio in 1870 and bought the struggling Dayton Evening News at 29 years old for $26,000. That purchase was the beginning of what is today Cox Enterprises, comprising a network of radio stations, newspapers, television stations, and extremely lucrative automotive businesses: Autotrader.com, Kelley Blue Book, and Manheim auctions, the biggest car reseller in the world. In 2019, Cox invested $350 million in Rivian, an electric car company. In 2020, Cox Enterprises' revenue was $19.2 billion, a slightly less profitable year than usual. Last summer the family bought Axios for over half a billion dollars.\n\nIn short, everyone in this family is spectacularly-obscenely-rich.\n\nThis past July, another of James Middleton Cox's great-grandsons, Fergie-born James Cox Chambers and brought home to The Dakota apartments on the Upper West Side of Manhattan-traded in his shares of Cox Enterprises so he could make an investment of his own. Like his great-grandfather, he believes money can change America. So this summer he lost his chains. He believes that by extracting himself for good from the web of trusts, tax-shielding entities, accountants, asset managers, and the family office, he can undo their American dream.\n\nThe immediate reason for this break, he told me, was the cops.\n\nSpecifically, Cop City , officially known as the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, a complex that's being built outside Georgia's capital city to \"provide better opportunities to train on more socially just models of policing and crisis intervention.\" Alex, the Cox CEO, is the lead fundraiser for Cop City as the honorary chair of the city's police fund. Fergie, his cousin, is now the lead fundraiser on the other side; he's said he's already given $600,000 to fund the referendum against Cop City as of July, another $250,000 to the legal defense fund of the protesters arrested there, and another $350,000 to an \"abolitionist, not-for-profit media collective.\"\n\nOn Alex's side: reforming the police. On Fergie's: abolishing them altogether.\n\nAlex loves fly fishing for wild salmon and his agenda for Cox includes promoting \"connectivity, mobility, and sustainability.\" On Fergie's agenda this weekday afternoon is picking up 22 joints from a dispensary in Vermont and a few grass-fed steaks down the road. So the self-identified class traitor and I climb into a Tacoma truck with New Hampshire vanity plates that read CCCP -the Russian transliteration of USSR -and that reeks of weed already.\n\nIdyllic A-frame houses are whizzing past the driver's window when I ask him about the straw that broke the camel's back, and how he came to be Merry Levov with neck tattoos and a blue belt.\n\n\"I started tweeting like, my family are enemies of the people with their full names. Like 'Fuck these motherfuckers,\" Fergie tells me. That happened in the late summer of 2022. Fergie never quite fit in with his family, and the lifetime of screaming fights over politics at sushi restaurants in Manhattan, tense interventions in Palm Beach, and endless and expensive wilderness therapy programs for troubled teens in Utah seemed to finally be coalescing into an identity of his own.\n\nAlex called Fergie and offered a compelling proposition that fall. \"My cousin called and said getting out was an option. We can do it right, and here's the offer.\"\n\nNine months later, in May 2023, Jim Chambers, Fergie's dad and Alex's uncle, was giving the opening remarks at Bard College's commencement, where he cuts a figure as the normative liberal, if cartoonishly hippie-ish, chair of the board. \"When are we as a species going to stop fearing love?\" he asked, a rope of gray dreadlocks snaking down the back of the red graduation gown. Chambers called to \"cleanse our dirty ways of polluting mama earth,\" before announcing, \"Life is hardcore, but so is love.\"\n\nShortly after, the main speaker , Georgia senator Raphael Warnock, was disrupted by protesters screaming \"Stop! Cop! City!\" Fergie was one of them . His daughter held one side of a massive banner that read \"HEY WARNOCK: STOP COP CITY FREE PALESTINE.\"\n\n\"That was the first time I saw my dad in two years, and the last time I saw him,\" Fergie tells me of the incident.\n\nA month later , after months of lawyering, nearly a year after his cousin had called, the deal was signed, and the first direct deposit came through. Fergie was free.\n\nThough part of the terms is that he can't get into exact amounts or how many shares he sold with a reporter, he tells me that he received north of $250 million dollars, which is likely less than he would've gotten if he stayed entwined with the company-he says they paid him thirty cents on the dollar per share. But still, a quarter of a billion dollars. He was given half of that earlier this summer and the rest will be doled out over the next 14 years. \"I had money before. I had a lot of money,\" he says, \"but I didn't have A LOTTA money.\"\n\nThe question now was: What the hell was he planning on doing with it?\n\n\"Do you think there's any chance that Ben knows what broccolini is?\" Fergie screams out to his daughter while texting, emerging from the laundry room.\n\nBen is the twentysomething son of one of Fergie's local jiu-jitsu coaches, and his new personal assistant. He resisted hiring help to manage the four dogs, four kids by two women, and the half dozen or so houses spread across the northeast and Atlanta. But now there's so much money, and so many requests from comrades and strangers-for gas, to pay rent, to help cover someone's divorce lawyer-so he's staffing up. In addition to Ben, there's Nick, a fixer hired away from the family office in Atlanta, \"to do shit I don't know how to do.\"\n\nThings like figuring out commercial leases and zoning and permits. Fergie recently spent half a million on 5,000 square feet in an office park near his house in New Hampshire and is setting up the Upper Valley outpost of his People's Gym. So far, he's spent north of $5 million amassing acreage for the compound in Alford through the LLC \"Cloud Kingdom.\"\n\nFergie's New Hampshire house, where he spends the lion's share of his time, is modern; no walls, all blonde wood and sweeping views of the wet mountains bursting with late-summer green. The bookshelf is stacked high with dozens of copies of The Communist Manifesto and Xi Jinping's The Governance of China . There's a framed picture of Fidel Castro above a mini fridge cooling raw milk. A shotgun hangs on bike hooks along one of the rafters.\n\nFergie is pulling espresso shots on a nearly $6,000 Italian coffee machine when his older daughter, Anne Margaret Chambers, 14, with a neck full of hickies and wearing a ripped Pierce the Veil concert t-shirt, trips up the stairs from the basement to make herself two cheese quesadillas. Fergie's other two kids from his first marriage, Nadya and James, live with their mother in Atlanta.\n\nIn addition to Fergie and Anne, Stella Schnabel, 39-daughter of the painter Julian, sister of the art dealer Vito-Fergie's on-off partner, lives here, along with the pair's two-year-old son, Viktor Gonzo Cox Schnabel Chambers. They're all still getting their bearings in New Hampshire. They only moved here from Alford this past January for its lax gun laws and low tax burden, after Fergie decided to cash out.\n\n\"I don't want to pay taxes to Uncle Sam,\" Fergie tells me. \"Objectively, somebody like me should pay almost all of their money in taxes, but if I can legally evade giving that to the U.S. war machine, I will.\"\n\nHe was drawn back to the Northeast after a decade or so sojourn in Atlanta , the later years of which he presided over another land project: 350 acres in Madison County, Georgia that he dubbed \"The Free State of Palestine.\" Fifteen people lived there. The main house, where Fergie lived, was called \"Jerusalem.\"\n\nThe Free State of Palestine, Georgia, fell apart along with his second marriage; Fergie was charged with weed possession at a friend's funeral. He said that he and his wife were both on probation, and his friend, who was a federal fugitive who had lived at the project, died. It was time to go, time to come home. He referred to that time in Georgia as a \"Christ-like wilderness\" in a Facebook post in 2019, which was partly written in the third person: \"Fergie was and is a maniac, an intentional mask-wearer, someone America calls ADHD.\"\n\nThere are other whiffs of a messiah complex-or at the very least, evidence of an overactive mind disposed to conspiracy. Fergie stares at the radio when a Steely Dan song called \" My Old School \" comes on in the car. \"Weird,\" he pauses for a moment, taking in the song. \"This is about Bard.\" He points out, in the same breath, that Cox Enterprises consults for the Department of Defense and that they also invested in telehealth platforms right before Covid hit and tells me over the phone that he believes that his family has his house bugged. \"Do they see everything on my phone? Probably.\"\n\nHe's not being a \"paranoid freak,\" he says. \"My family is a bunch of fucking billionaires who have admitted to having me followed.\" But he also admits to me that he had his own wife-the second one-followed, when he worried she was having an affair.\n\nOnce rich never poor, the saying goes, and with Fergie you can tell. He interrupts and embellishes. He remembers petty grievances like the time his dad got him a low-value Sharper Image gadget one Christmas, or when his Aunt Kathy, who he calls \"the meanest person in the world,\" accused him of stealing thirty dollars twenty years ago. He insists that he was his grandmother's favorite, and that she would have wanted him to take over the company.\n\nIn fact, he worked on a Manheim car auction lot for a year when he moved back to Atlanta, in an attempt to earn his keep within the firm. He calls it his \"fringe, too-precocious, theocratic, proto-alt-right\" era, though today he's swung back fully to the hard left.\n\n\"I've learned to silently wait, and evade, but if need be, to kick them in the heads and submit them on the ground,\" Fergie wrote in that 2019 post. \"I came to wear whatever mask I want to put on today, to make noise, be in the trees, and fuck America in its dead, rotting face.\"\n\nIt's Wednesday, and Fergie is rolling joints in the kitchen. His partner Stella-statuesque, in leggings, and with her dark hair in a bun, just back from a month in the Hamptons with their son-is directing a team of movers who are shuffling around plush jewel-green sofas that were trucked up from her Brooklyn storage unit.\n\n\"He has his plate full,\" says Stella, when I ask about whether she gets fed up with all the projects Fergie seems to be cooking up. He had just told us about a nearby mine that was up for auction that he wanted to buy. Stella adds: \"I wouldn't say managing people is his strong suit.\"\n\n\"That totally depends though, actually,\" Fergie interjects, popping his head out from the kitchen. \"I run a gym staff very well.\"\n\nBefore the couple pauses for a make-out session, I ask about the communist elephant in the room. When I had told the innkeeper in Hanover where I had stayed overnight what I was doing in town-spending time with a rich communist-she said this: \"Screw him, he doesn't know what he's talking about.\"\n\n\"When certain friends of mine, or ex-friends, start critiquing him, and if they have any money, I'm like, Well, I'd love to know where you're putting your money,\" says Stella, whose own dad is worth an estimated $25 million . \"Are they giving their fucking money away? Are they giving money to people in Jackson to clean their water?\"\n\nIt gets complicated, this type of thing. \"I grew up in a world where everyone's kissing your ass for something you didn't do. And it's the same thing when you're super fucking rich.\" She describes her father, Julian, as \"really charming, and super generous and totally annoying and fucked up at the same time.\" She sighs. \"Yeah. Whatever, as you know, dialectical materialism. . . there are always opposites.\"\n\nFergie's own parents split up when he was two. His dad and the business were based in Atlanta; Fergie was raised in a Brooklyn brownstone with his mother. A consummate problem child, he went to St. Ann's, a very expensive and alternative private school for the children of the city's rich but artsy class. (Lena Dunham is a graduate.)\n\nIt was there that Fergie was introduced to communism, thanks to an eighth grade history teacher. But he tells me he didn't even know he was wealthy until a classmate showed him the Forbes list around the same time.\n\nSo he did what any good young revolutionary who found out he was the heir to a fortune would do: he emailed Noam Chomsky. \"I think he suggested some books to read,\" Fergie tells me. He doesn't remember which and tells me that nowadays, \"I don't fuck with Noam Chomsky.\"\n\nFergie's always tended to gravitate toward the hard stuff. Combat sports. Guns. He takes his steak raw, slathered with raw honey and butter. He tells me that he was shooting up heroin at 14, sobered up by 16, but then at 18 he was cooking crack in the shared kitchen at the dorms at Bard. He was asked to take a leave of absence for the crack incident. After a booze and drugs binge ten years later, in 2013, he was arrested on domestic battery charges.\n\nHe has a tattoo on his face. It's a lightning bolt with an arrow on the end of it, a keepsake from a moment during a mushroom trip he had during a blizzard at the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in 2016. \"It was like revolutionary suicide,\" he says. \"There was no question that I'll be doing this to the death.\"\n\nHe was, seemingly by nature, anti-everything his genteel family stood for.\n\nJames Middleton Cox, the original patriarch, was the Democratic nominee for president in 1920-FDR was his running mate-and two-time governor of Ohio. Fergie's grandmother, Anne , the only Cox Fergie seems to have anything nice to say about-\"She was a bad mother and an absent WASP, but she was not cold as a grandmother\"-was the ambassador to Belgium under President Carter. She had a cardboard cutout of Obama in her living room, and she took her private plane to canvass for him in 2008. She sat on the boards of the Met, the Whitney, the Atlanta Symphony, and went to Miss Porter's . She was once worth $17 billion.\n\nBut thanks to some clever estate planning, when she died in 2020 at 100 years old, Fergie only got $6 million, a Chagall painting of a goat herder, \"and some forks.\" The rest was divided between Fergie's dad and aunts.\n\nFergie's father, the eldest boy, is a progressive for his time and a black sheep in his own right. He was a dance major at Bard, and believes deeply, I am told, in the power of chiropractic medicine. He is also a vegetarian and a biodynamic farmer (his farm, Honey Dog , is 15 minutes down the road from Fergie's Massachusetts outpost) and he is obsessed with bees . He's married to Nabila Khashoggi, daughter of Adnan, the infamous arms dealer and once the richest man in the world. They have one son: Ulysses Layth Adnan Cox Khashoggi Chambers.\n\n\"They're kind of lazy, rich people,\" Fergie tells me. (Jim Cox Chambers, Fergie's father; Lauren Hamilton, his mother, an artist who lives in upstate New York; and Cox Enterprises did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) \"They just wanted me to be this liberal and I'm never gonna be a liberal,\" Fergie says.\n\n\"See ya later, fucker!\"\n\nWe've packed up and we're on the highway racing down to Alford, Massachusetts from New Hampshire, about a three-hour drive, and a cop car that Fergie had his eye on just zoomed by. He won't go into detail about the retreat we're heading to and who is coming but says he wants to bring together \"people who are already active in different organizations\" to cook, eat, learn about Marxism, and train in martial arts.\n\nAnne, the 14-year-old, is sitting in the back of the truck-this one has a \"Henry Ford Was a Literal Nazi\" bumper sticker-eating Subway and listening to the Foo Fighters on her AirPods.\n\n\"I don't want to be an overbearing parent but as far as I'm concerned, there's not really another acceptable option for someone in our position than devoting most of one's energy to the dismantling of the system that created us,\" says Fergie. That's why he doesn't just give $2,500 to 200,000 people and call it a day. The wheels of capitalism would keep turning, and Fergie wants to wedge an anvil into the spokes.\n\nI ask Anne, who recently dyed the front of her hair blue-\"there's not enough emos in the world,\" she laments-if she has the same politics as her dad. \"I think it's good to understand that it's totally unjust that we have that money in the first place.\" Even though Fergie thinks it's \"ridiculous\" for anyone of their wealth to have a normal job, Anne works front of house at a local restaurant in New Hampshire.\n\nIt seems exhausting to be in a constant state of self-annihilation, at once achingly lucky and eternally angry. Even other bleeding-heart rich kids who disavow their wealth, like Abigail Disney or Leah Hunt-Hendrix , an heir to an oil fortune who started Solidaire, and support progressive political causes like the Green New Deal and the congressional campaigns of certain Squad members, do it from within the system. Fergie hates all that. He has no interest in joint statements or slow change, small wins, or baby steps.\n\n\"They're getting in rooms where they're like, 'Oh, I'm a really rich kid and I don't know what to do about it so I'm gonna sit at a table with a bunch of other rich people, and we're gonna decide together.' Bro. This is revolutionary?\" Once Democrats get involved, he says, \"any good motivations go to hell.\"\n\nAbsent a formal sounding board, any real executive team, or an established philanthropy under him, Fergie relies on Zooms with a \"council\" of trusted friends and activists-he wouldn't give me their names-for advice on what to do with his money. At various points he's been involved with The People's Forum , the Black Alliance for Peace, the DSA, and different people on the ground in Atlanta. And there's his Babochki Collective. But really, he can do whatever he wants. He's constantly rebranding and reconfiguring his outward-facing groups: yesterday it's Cloud Kingdom, today it's Berkshire Communists. He's had his fallings-out before. When it comes to the money, at the end of the day, he's in control.\n\n\"I couldn't blow the money before because it was in the Cox mechanism and was doled out,\" he says. I ask if he's nervous now that the first lump sum has been transferred. \"Of course I'm scared. Like, did I make the wrong choice?\" he says, eyes darting around for more cop cars.\n\n\"I'm thinking, what if I make the wrong decision with it?\"\n\nEven more than imperialism, liberalism, idealism, capitalism, the cops, the 12 steps, psychopharmacology, his dad, and America-all of which he despises-Fergie hates Israel.\n\nThe war that broke out on October 7 when Hamas attacked Israeli civilians gave him the perfect opportunity to put his money where his mouth is-to let the world know where he stood on the Jewish state. Mostly the world has meant his neighbors in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n\nPeople around town have known about Fergie for as long as he's been here. There was a separate protest in 2021, during the last bout of violence between Hamas in Israel, where comrades held up signs that read \"Death to Amerikkka,\" which raised eyebrows. But the Great Barringtonians I spoke to say they're more scared than they've ever been since a rally he organized in town on October 10.\n\n\"I didn't feel personally threatened until that rally,\" one neighbor tells me.\n\nAt that rally, he and the Berkshire Communists held signs that read: \"End all U.S. aid to Israel\" and \"Israel and U.S.A. = Terrorists.\" When asked by a reporter at The Berkshire Edge if he supported Hamas, Fergie answered in the affirmative: \"Yes,\" and added, \"Hamas is an indigenous anti-colonial resistance group.\" How about the specific events on October 7, where 1,200 people were murdered, women raped, and others burned alive? \"The Al-Aqsa Flood was a powerful statement of resistance to genocide,\" he said.\n\nOn X , he was even more forthcoming about the massacre: \"One month ago today, the Palestinian Resistance heroically jolted the occupiers, eliminat[ing] a number of combatant settlers,\" he wrote. He does not believe civilians were targeted on October 7 in Israel and denies rape took place, writing, \"the resistance is principled. The resistance is devout.\"\n\nFergie has publicized that he's given hundreds of thousands of dollars to groups including the Middle East Children's Alliance, to the anti-Zionist writer Philip Weiss, and to Samidoun, which Israel designated a terrorist organization and which Germany recently banned . (Samidoun has ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist-Leninist group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Japan, Canada, and the European Union.)\n\nThat October 10 rally in Alford was just the beginning. A few days after that protest, Fergie and two Berkshire Communists members-Paige Belanger and Calla Walsh- chained themselves to the entrance of the Cambridge office of Elbit Systems, an Israeli-based weapons manufacturer. Then, on October 20, he was speaking to a crowd from the bed of a truck in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, protesting General Dynamics. More Berkshire Communists-who have spun off, semantically, as Palestine Action U.S .-were arrested at Elbit in Boston late last month but were bailed out later that night. Fergie told Los Angeles magazine that he paid their legal fees. A few days later Fergie was arrested in Washington, D.C., for defacing a McDonald's (\"Free Gaza\" was spray-painted on the facade and the windows were broken). Over the past few weeks, he's been down to Atlanta to demonstrate and organize against Cop City and up to New Hampshire to attend a teach-in at Dartmouth.\n\nThroughout, he's been posting things like \"death to the normalizing left,\" which Fergie wrote recently in reference to the far-left group Jewish Voice for Peace. He ruminates in another post: \"In the future there will be no Israelis.\"\n\n\"This just changes everything. It just changes everything,\" one neighbor says of Fergie's posture toward Hamas. She told me she feels threatened by him-and scared. \"The idea that everything is justified? Well, then, what does that mean for your neighbors, like what's justified?\" She adds, \"How many guns does he have stockpiled here in Alford?\"\n\n\"This is life or death,\" says another community member, who has beefed up security at his own house-he's purchased cameras, floodlights, a dog-since Fergie arrived on the scene.\n\n\"He's got enough money to ruin my life. I have a business, I have a family that I love,\" he says. \"I just want a comfortable, quiet life.\"\n\nBerkshire and Columbia counties, both east of the Hudson River, may seem bucolic from the outside, but residents tell me there's roiling class resentment under the surface between wealthy second- and third-home owners who come in from the city and the locals who have been priced out of the area.\n\nA few locals, like Regi Wingo, a hip-hop artist who volunteered with programs for troubled youth, have been given free housing on Fergie's commune. At the rally on October 10, Wingo held a sign blaring \"When people are occupied, resistance is justified.\"\n\n\"That was hard for me to see him holding that sign, even though I know Fergie is probably paying him off,\" said one of the neighbors, who has known the Wingo family for decades. Regi's 19-year-old daughter Athena lived on the commune with him, but she has since left.\n\nOther Berkshire Communists include Sage Radachowsky, a Harvard-trained biologist , to whom who Fergie gave money to build a house, and Paige Belanger, 32, who, according to her Instagram , is a \"political educator, agitator, and herbalist,\" and the secretary of Berkshire Communists.\n\nThere are the brothers Sam and Ben Catechi. Ben, now 22, was once a student at Bard College at Simon's Rock, a junior college in Great Barrington with a hyper-progressive reputation that a resident tells me is \"ripe\" for Fergie's recruitment. Simon's Rock parent school is Bard, where Fergie's dad is the chair, and where the alumni center is named for his grandmother.\n\n\"There is a matrix of connections between my family and Bard,\" Fergie's dad Jim said at the dedication ceremony for the baseball field he donated for $2.2 million.\n\nIt's unclear how many Berkshire Communists members are from the school, where kids can enroll as young as 15, but a pro-Palestine protest earlier this month was organized by a coalition of Simon's Rock Student Groups and the Berkshire Communists (on this score, Fergie tells me over text, \"I didn't organize that, I wasn't even there\" and says there's \"zero\" relationship between the Berkshire Communists and Simon's Rock).\n\nBut several Simon's Rock students told me that they'd heard of Fergie, or his group, or that their friends work out at the People's Gym. One student said she's noticed \"alarming behavior\" among her classmates. \"Through discussion with one extremely left student, it was explained to me that they believe we need to start collecting firearms to 'arm the proletariat' for a coming revolution.\"\n\nThe response to all of this from institutions in the area-especially Jewish ones-has been lackluster, according to the locals I spoke with.\n\nA concerned community member emailed Simon's Rock but worries they aren't taking Fergie seriously: \"It's negligent.\" One source said he complained to the local Jewish Federation chapter and was told to keep quiet, lest donors become spooked and the Berkshires get a bad rap. (The Federation's executive director for the Berkshires chapter, Dara Kaufman, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) The local Chabad rabbi, Levi Volovik, in nearby Pittsfield, said a few community members have approached him about Fergie. \"He wants everybody to be nervous,\" the rabbi told me over the phone, but he doesn't seem too perturbed himself. \"Why should anybody be nervous?\" He added, \"In a time of darkness, it's time to add light.\"\n\nAlford, which has a population of 486, doesn't have a police department, but neighboring towns, like Great Barrington and Pittsfield, do. But when community members go to the local police claiming that Fergie is inciting violence, they tell me they've been told that Fergie has a right to protest, and to free speech, and there's nothing they can do despite the noxious messages he puts out. They're told that the local and state police and FBI are aware of the commune, and are keeping an eye on him, but the residents feel, they tell me, like it's getting \"lawless\" in Great Barrington.\n\nThere are also the things that have happened in the area that can't be traced directly to Fergie. A local synagogue received an anonymous call, and the voice on the other line said, \"Shabbat Shalom. Allahu Akbar.\" A year ago, the town woke up to a billboard scrawled with graffiti: \"Eat the rich,\" and another, \"No one needs two homes.\"\n\nLeigh Davis is the vice chair of the town's five-person Selectboard, which sets policy in the town. She says Great Barrington-ten minutes from Alford and with more than ten times the population-is \"very progressive\" and that other towns often look to it as an example. She heard of Fergie a few years ago when he moved to Alford but didn't think much of him. \"I didn't feel like it was something that needed our attention.\"\n\nBut since the war broke out, and then the protests in front of town hall, her constituents have been reaching out. \"Here's this incredibly wealthy person that's sitting on millions and millions of dollars saying he's fighting for the poor,\" she told me. \"There's a real worry of 'Where could this go?' \"\n\nTo constituents Davis says, \"My silence is not due to a lack of compassion and solidarity. We are listening and we do care, but there's only so much we can do as the Selectboard.\" She also doesn't want to inflame the situation or antagonize \"the hornet's nest\" of his commune. \"It's a balancing act.\"\n\nFor his part, Fergie posted a message directly on Instagram to Great Barrington residents who feel threatened by him: \"You are rich white [E]uropean settlers in a cultural resort town.\" The working class are \"coming for you one day soon,\" Fergie predicted, and once that happens, \"There won't ever be enough cops to call.\"\n\nA local told me that she worries about her neighbors being drawn into his far-left ideology, which posits that the struggle of Palestinians is the same as that of working people everywhere, including in Berkshire County, where she says they feel edged out. \"I think people are feeling peer pressure here,\" she says. \"Very good, ordinary people, who don't have the means to find their way out get sucked into things.\"\n\n\"My fear is that he will get more supporters, and they will get more radical,\" one resident said. \"And that this will end in an ugly and violent way.\"\n\nOn Monday, November 20, three protesters were arrested at another Elbit Systems office building in Merrimack, New Hampshire. They had smashed windows, splashed the facade of the building in red paint, and climbed to the roof of the building to set off smoke bombs. They also bike-locked the doors of the office shut, locking employees inside, who called the police around 8 a.m.\n\nAll three are a part of Fergie's group-\"those are comrades,\" he texts me, and all young women: Sophie Ross, 22, Calla Walsh, 19, and Bridget Irene Shergalis, 27. Ross appears, it seems, in the Simon's Rock yearbook for the 2019-2020 school year, alongside Ben Catechi.\n\nWalsh was previously locked to the Elbit office building in Cambridge alongside Fergie in early October, and was arrested there , along with Ross, for vandalizing property and disorderly conduct a few weeks later. Before this recent string of arrests, she worked for Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders' campaigns as a teen activist. Her parents are both professors. In 2021, The New York Times , in a write-up, called her part of an \"influential new force in Democratic politics.\"\n\nThe next day in the Hillsborough County Superior Court South, in blue masks and orange jumpsuits, all three women were charged with riot, sabotage, criminal mischief, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct. Walsh and Ross were given $20,000 bail, owing to their recent prior arrests, while Shergalis was issued $5,000 bail.\n\nFergie paid for all of it.\n\n\"We ALWAYS post bail for those facing state repression for radical politics,\" he texted me, in reference to Babochki, the funding collective that distributes his wealth. He added that \"I don't wanna mess w[ith] any legal scenario\" and \"many people in this country are responding to this genocide in a variety of ways.\"\n\nWhen Walsh was released, Fergie posted a picture of her on X with the caption \"Heroic Glow.\"\n\nThe governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, said in a statement , \"I am confident law enforcement will work to bring those responsible for this vile act of hate to swift justice.\" I'm told by the DA's office that a separate state police detective unit has been assigned to monitor the Fergie situation. And last Monday, Alford's building inspector sent a letter to Fergie and his lawyers accusing him of breaking zoning bylaws with his People's Gym, writing, \"This office has previously contacted you about the above referenced address and, specifically, use of the structure thereon for purposes other than storage for which it was permitted.\" Fergie calls the move \"ridiculous and targeted.\" He says cops have been driving up and down the road near the properties and added, \"[I]t's not commercial, it's not crowded, it's us using a big building on an 80-acre property to move around with friends.\" Online, he blamed the \"Zionist frenzy smear articles\" for the efforts to shut down his gym.\n\nTimothy Shugrue, the DA, said this about the unrest Fergie is raising: \"These hateful actions are inconsistent with basic civility, inclusivity, and respect. As district attorney, I will take all efforts to ensure the safety of all citizens of the county. We will vigorously prosecute any and all hate crimes against any citizens of our county.\"\n\nBut Fergie's neighbors, the ones who live near his compound, are confident this will have a different ending.\n\n\"This community is going to have a disaster. There will be a crazy kid who gets ahold of a gun who does something bad. And Fergie will pay for his lawyers. He's got the money. It will ruin the Berkshires,\" says one of them. He worries that everything that's happened with Fergie so far is \"just the prologue.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Fergie Chambers reached out after publication to clarify that he did not have his wife followed because he suspected she was having an affair. He hired a private investigator to confirm her location because he was worried about her. The Free Press regrets the error. In addition, Fergie made clear that his grandmother, Anne, wouldn't have wanted him to run the company, because \"that wasn't me ever.\"\n\nSuzy Weiss is a reporter at The Free Press.

      "text": "Nestled into the mountains of the Upper Valley in New Hampshire, up a semi-paved road in a house next to a tiny cemetery lined with white picket fencing, Fergie Chambers, 38, leans over his kitchen island, worrying over his commune.\n\n\"It feels like we're throwing the same half-assed solutions at this over and over again and hoping it will yield something different,\" he groans into his iPhone, which is on speaker. Fergie's slight, but buff, on account of his multiple times a day martial arts training and competitions. His hair is cut short. A silver boxing glove dangles from one of his ears. He is covered in tattoos, including a double portrait of Stalin and Mao inked onto his thigh. He looks as if the phrase \"Fuck you, Mom and Dad\" were a person.\n\nI offer my hand to a wheezing bulldog named Madison while Fergie talks over the phone to his employee in Alford, Massachusetts-the tiny Berkshires town where he's bought 300 acres since 2019. Around 10 people live there at any given time. But he's unclear-with me, possibly with himself-on what that place is exactly.\n\nIt's a commune. It's a \"liberatory training space.\" It's a housing collective meets agricultural collective. It's where the People's Gym (\"free for working-class people and permanently closed to cops, active military, landlords, and capitalists\") is located. It's where the journal Combat Liberalism is based. It's the headquarters for the Berkshire Communists group, which Fergie started. It's where the Babochki Collective, the funding arm of all of Fergie's projects, sometimes meets.\n\nFergie's the General Secretary of the Berkshire Communists , which describes itself as a \"revolutionary Marxist-Leninist collective, aiming to promote the formation of a powerful workers' party.\" But the urgent issue that late summer afternoon-before Hamas's war against Israel; before Fergie called for \"making people who support Israel actually afraid to go out in public\"; before three of Fergie's comrades were arrested on the roof of a weapons manufacturer in New Hampshire-was that 16 comrades were descending on Alford for a weekend retreat, and it's been pouring rain. The canvas tents they pitched on the property are letting in water. A skylight in one of the six houses there is leaking. The punching bags in the barn-turned-gym are in the wrong place.\n\n\"It's just that, I spent a lot of money so this would be done right the first time,\" Fergie says, exasperated. Today, at least, the revolution requires fifty-dollar stall mats from Tractor Supply Company to line the floor of the tents and keep out moisture.\n\nThen, he changes his tune. He apologizes-\"I'm sorry I freaked out about the gym\"-and then Fergie's employee reminds him that when he drives over to the property tomorrow, not to forget the boxes of beekeeping equipment that were accidentally delivered to his house here, in New Hampshire.\n\n\"Right. I'll probably forget them,\" Fergie says.\n\n\"Well, I forgive you in advance.\"\n\n\"You don't have to do that,\" he tells her. \"You can hold it against me forever.\"\n\nHe's talking about the boxes, of course. But he could also be talking about the stupendous amount of money in his possession.\n\nFergie Chambers, an avowed communist since the age of 13, wants everyone to hold it against him forever that he is heir to an enormous fortune. And he's willing to go to enormous lengths to tear down the mechanisms-capitalism, imperialism, liberalism, the rule of law, America-that delivered it into his lap.\n\nThat struggle has taken him from the charming cobblestone streets of his Brooklyn childhood to the mountains of upstate New York to the lake country region of Georgia to the Donbas region of Ukraine and now, back to the woods of the American Northeast, where locals say that his radical political organizing has taken a menacing turn, especially when it comes to the Jewish state on which he's uniquely fixated.\n\n\"Make Zionists afraid,\" Fergie wrote in a post on his Instagram on November 15. In another he wrote: \"We need to start making people who support Israel actually afraid to go out in public. We need to make all of white America afraid that everything they have stolen is going to be burned to the ground. That's what makes them listen.\"\n\nSince the war broke out, Fergie and his group have been organizing demonstrations around the country. Ostensibly they're in support of Palestine-except members of the Berkshire Communists reportedly harassed a hardware store owner for selling Israeli flags and followed home employees of an Israeli defense company based in Boston. \"No descendant of European settlers is oppressed, anywhere,\" Fergie posted recently. \"Not nearly enough, anyhow.\"\n\nA few Massachusetts residents have told me that Fergie, and those who live on his compound, amount to a \"mob\" and a \"cult,\" with Fergie playing the dual role of guru and sugar daddy-he bought the properties, paid for the gym's remodel, and pays the rent of \"comrades\" who don't even live there. He pays bail fees, too, when those comrades get in trouble with the law for their brand of \"direct action.\"\n\n\"A lot of people are just scared,\" one resident of Great Barrington, the larger town that abuts Alford, told me, referring to things Fergie has posted online in recent weeks.\n\n\"There is nothing more disgusting than rich people who do nothing to undermine the material position of their own class vaguely calling for peace and love,\" Fergie wrote on Instagram on November 2. \"It gives me actual bloodlust.\"\n\n\"We're frightened to go out to restaurants, or cafés in town. It's chilling,\" the man in Great Barrington added. He tells me that the police aren't much help-\"they won't come\"-when it comes to Fergie and his followers, and that he's considering moving towns. (The police declined to comment and directed me to the DA's office who, through a representative, emailed to say that \"District Attorney Shugrue is aware of the comments and posts James Chambers has made. He is actively communicating with local law enforcement and community leaders regarding Chambers' behavior.\")\n\nAlmost all of the people I spoke to who live in the area around Fergie's compound refused to go on the record because they said they are scared of retaliation. \"People are getting panicky,\" one neighbor said.\n\nLocal press coverage has focused on Fergie's fondness for firearms. Many of his neighbors told me that the guns were what made them anxious. But a lot of people own guns. Fergie himself has claimed online that he's \"not a big gun guy\" and told me over text that \"I have like 4 guns,\" and added, \"I have a semi auto 40 cal Keltec [sic] that looks scary to liberals.\" While he poses with guns online , and told me \"I've always been into self-defense, and I was always kind of into guns,\" he pushes back on the recent press coverage: \"no one is raising a militia in Alford'' and to say so is \"a total deflection.\"\n\nIt is the Berkshires itself that seems to be a powder keg. There's a deep and growing tension in the \" best small town in America \"-especially since Covid brought an influx of second-home owners, driving home prices through the roof. There are very liberal colleges with very liberal students who want to take the theories they learn in the classroom into the streets. And then there's Fergie, with hundreds of millions of dollars, eager to make it all go boom.\n\n\"If he was just a kook, that would be one thing,\" a father in Great Barrington told me. \"If he was just a gun-toting communist, that would be one thing. If he was just a millionaire, who liked to host young people and put a roof over their head and train them and indoctrinate them, that would be one thing. But it's a completely different ball game when we're talking about someone from a family that is arguably not only the richest in the county, but maybe richer than the whole county put together.\"\n\nUntil very recently, by dint of his birth, Fergie owned a percentage of Cox Enterprises , a planet-spanning megacorporation, and the third largest private cable provider in the U.S. Over 50,000 people work there. The fact the Coxes still own the company outright makes them the eighth richest family in America, with a net worth around $34 billion.\n\nIt's like if the Murdochs had double the money. But instead of Australia, they're from America, and instead of conservative, they're all-except for Fergie and a lone Republican aunt that no one talks to-establishment Democrats.\n\n\"[My great-grandfather] believed that business and private enterprise could do more to make an impact on the world than anything,\" said Alex Taylor, Fergie's cousin and the current Cox Enterprises CEO. He was onstage with Bill Clinton a few years back, announcing a $20 million investment in green initiatives on behalf of Cox. \"I stand here today,\" added Taylor \"with a great privileged position, carrying on his legacy because of the way he set up his business and the way he set up his personal succession plan.\"\n\nThat first Cox , James, the first one to count for anything, was born in a log cabin on a farm in Ohio in 1870 and bought the struggling Dayton Evening News at 29 years old for $26,000. That purchase was the beginning of what is today Cox Enterprises, comprising a network of radio stations, newspapers, television stations, and extremely lucrative automotive businesses: Autotrader.com, Kelley Blue Book, and Manheim auctions, the biggest car reseller in the world. In 2019, Cox invested $350 million in Rivian, an electric car company. In 2020, Cox Enterprises' revenue was $19.2 billion, a slightly less profitable year than usual. Last summer the family bought Axios for over half a billion dollars.\n\nIn short, everyone in this family is spectacularly-obscenely-rich.\n\nThis past July, another of James Middleton Cox's great-grandsons, Fergie-born James Cox Chambers and brought home to The Dakota apartments on the Upper West Side of Manhattan-traded in his shares of Cox Enterprises so he could make an investment of his own. Like his great-grandfather, he believes money can change America. So this summer he lost his chains. He believes that by extracting himself for good from the web of trusts, tax-shielding entities, accountants, asset managers, and the family office, he can undo their American dream.\n\nThe immediate reason for this break, he told me, was the cops.\n\nSpecifically, Cop City , officially known as the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, a complex that's being built outside Georgia's capital city to \"provide better opportunities to train on more socially just models of policing and crisis intervention.\" Alex, the Cox CEO, is the lead fundraiser for Cop City as the honorary chair of the city's police fund. Fergie, his cousin, is now the lead fundraiser on the other side; he's said he's already given $600,000 to fund the referendum against Cop City as of July, another $250,000 to the legal defense fund of the protesters arrested there, and another $350,000 to an \"abolitionist, not-for-profit media collective.\"\n\nOn Alex's side: reforming the police. On Fergie's: abolishing them altogether.\n\nAlex loves fly fishing for wild salmon and his agenda for Cox includes promoting \"connectivity, mobility, and sustainability.\" On Fergie's agenda this weekday afternoon is picking up 22 joints from a dispensary in Vermont and a few grass-fed steaks down the road. So the self-identified class traitor and I climb into a Tacoma truck with New Hampshire vanity plates that read CCCP -the Russian transliteration of USSR -and that reeks of weed already.\n\nIdyllic A-frame houses are whizzing past the driver's window when I ask him about the straw that broke the camel's back, and how he came to be Merry Levov with neck tattoos and a blue belt.\n\n\"I started tweeting like, my family are enemies of the people with their full names. Like 'Fuck these motherfuckers,\" Fergie tells me. That happened in the late summer of 2022. Fergie never quite fit in with his family, and the lifetime of screaming fights over politics at sushi restaurants in Manhattan, tense interventions in Palm Beach, and endless and expensive wilderness therapy programs for troubled teens in Utah seemed to finally be coalescing into an identity of his own.\n\nAlex called Fergie and offered a compelling proposition that fall. \"My cousin called and said getting out was an option. We can do it right, and here's the offer.\"\n\nNine months later, in May 2023, Jim Chambers, Fergie's dad and Alex's uncle, was giving the opening remarks at Bard College's commencement, where he cuts a figure as the normative liberal, if cartoonishly hippie-ish, chair of the board. \"When are we as a species going to stop fearing love?\" he asked, a rope of gray dreadlocks snaking down the back of the red graduation gown. Chambers called to \"cleanse our dirty ways of polluting mama earth,\" before announcing, \"Life is hardcore, but so is love.\"\n\nShortly after, the main speaker , Georgia senator Raphael Warnock, was disrupted by protesters screaming \"Stop! Cop! City!\" Fergie was one of them . His daughter held one side of a massive banner that read \"HEY WARNOCK: STOP COP CITY FREE PALESTINE.\"\n\n\"That was the first time I saw my dad in two years, and the last time I saw him,\" Fergie tells me of the incident.\n\nA month later , after months of lawyering, nearly a year after his cousin had called, the deal was signed, and the first direct deposit came through. Fergie was free.\n\nThough part of the terms is that he can't get into exact amounts or how many shares he sold with a reporter, he tells me that he received north of $250 million dollars, which is likely less than he would've gotten if he stayed entwined with the company-he says they paid him thirty cents on the dollar per share. But still, a quarter of a billion dollars. He was given half of that earlier this summer and the rest will be doled out over the next 14 years. \"I had money before. I had a lot of money,\" he says, \"but I didn't have A LOTTA money.\"\n\nThe question now was: What the hell was he planning on doing with it?\n\n\"Do you think there's any chance that Ben knows what broccolini is?\" Fergie screams out to his daughter while texting, emerging from the laundry room.\n\nBen is the twentysomething son of one of Fergie's local jiu-jitsu coaches, and his new personal assistant. He resisted hiring help to manage the four dogs, four kids by two women, and the half dozen or so houses spread across the northeast and Atlanta. But now there's so much money, and so many requests from comrades and strangers-for gas, to pay rent, to help cover someone's divorce lawyer-so he's staffing up. In addition to Ben, there's Nick, a fixer hired away from the family office in Atlanta, \"to do shit I don't know how to do.\"\n\nThings like figuring out commercial leases and zoning and permits. Fergie recently spent half a million on 5,000 square feet in an office park near his house in New Hampshire and is setting up the Upper Valley outpost of his People's Gym. So far, he's spent north of $5 million amassing acreage for the compound in Alford through the LLC \"Cloud Kingdom.\"\n\nFergie's New Hampshire house, where he spends the lion's share of his time, is modern; no walls, all blonde wood and sweeping views of the wet mountains bursting with late-summer green. The bookshelf is stacked high with dozens of copies of The Communist Manifesto and Xi Jinping's The Governance of China . There's a framed picture of Fidel Castro above a mini fridge cooling raw milk. A shotgun hangs on bike hooks along one of the rafters.\n\nFergie is pulling espresso shots on a nearly $6,000 Italian coffee machine when his older daughter, Anne Margaret Chambers, 14, with a neck full of hickies and wearing a ripped Pierce the Veil concert t-shirt, trips up the stairs from the basement to make herself two cheese quesadillas. Fergie's other two kids from his first marriage, Nadya and James, live with their mother in Atlanta.\n\nIn addition to Fergie and Anne, Stella Schnabel, 39-daughter of the painter Julian, sister of the art dealer Vito-Fergie's on-off partner, lives here, along with the pair's two-year-old son, Viktor Gonzo Cox Schnabel Chambers. They're all still getting their bearings in New Hampshire. They only moved here from Alford this past January for its lax gun laws and low tax burden, after Fergie decided to cash out.\n\n\"I don't want to pay taxes to Uncle Sam,\" Fergie tells me. \"Objectively, somebody like me should pay almost all of their money in taxes, but if I can legally evade giving that to the U.S. war machine, I will.\"\n\nHe was drawn back to the Northeast after a decade or so sojourn in Atlanta , the later years of which he presided over another land project: 350 acres in Madison County, Georgia that he dubbed \"The Free State of Palestine.\" Fifteen people lived there. The main house, where Fergie lived, was called \"Jerusalem.\"\n\nThe Free State of Palestine, Georgia, fell apart along with his second marriage; Fergie was charged with weed possession at a friend's funeral. He said that he and his wife were both on probation, and his friend, who was a federal fugitive who had lived at the project, died. It was time to go, time to come home. He referred to that time in Georgia as a \"Christ-like wilderness\" in a Facebook post in 2019, which was partly written in the third person: \"Fergie was and is a maniac, an intentional mask-wearer, someone America calls ADHD.\"\n\nThere are other whiffs of a messiah complex-or at the very least, evidence of an overactive mind disposed to conspiracy. Fergie stares at the radio when a Steely Dan song called \" My Old School \" comes on in the car. \"Weird,\" he pauses for a moment, taking in the song. \"This is about Bard.\" He points out, in the same breath, that Cox Enterprises consults for the Department of Defense and that they also invested in telehealth platforms right before Covid hit and tells me over the phone that he believes that his family has his house bugged. \"Do they see everything on my phone? Probably.\"\n\nHe's not being a \"paranoid freak,\" he says. \"My family is a bunch of fucking billionaires who have admitted to having me followed.\" But he also admits to me that he had his own wife-the second one-followed, when he worried she was having an affair.\n\nOnce rich never poor, the saying goes, and with Fergie you can tell. He interrupts and embellishes. He remembers petty grievances like the time his dad got him a low-value Sharper Image gadget one Christmas, or when his Aunt Kathy, who he calls \"the meanest person in the world,\" accused him of stealing thirty dollars twenty years ago. He insists that he was his grandmother's favorite, and that she would have wanted him to take over the company.\n\nIn fact, he worked on a Manheim car auction lot for a year when he moved back to Atlanta, in an attempt to earn his keep within the firm. He calls it his \"fringe, too-precocious, theocratic, proto-alt-right\" era, though today he's swung back fully to the hard left.\n\n\"I've learned to silently wait, and evade, but if need be, to kick them in the heads and submit them on the ground,\" Fergie wrote in that 2019 post. \"I came to wear whatever mask I want to put on today, to make noise, be in the trees, and fuck America in its dead, rotting face.\"\n\nIt's Wednesday, and Fergie is rolling joints in the kitchen. His partner Stella-statuesque, in leggings, and with her dark hair in a bun, just back from a month in the Hamptons with their son-is directing a team of movers who are shuffling around plush jewel-green sofas that were trucked up from her Brooklyn storage unit.\n\n\"He has his plate full,\" says Stella, when I ask about whether she gets fed up with all the projects Fergie seems to be cooking up. He had just told us about a nearby mine that was up for auction that he wanted to buy. Stella adds: \"I wouldn't say managing people is his strong suit.\"\n\n\"That totally depends though, actually,\" Fergie interjects, popping his head out from the kitchen. \"I run a gym staff very well.\"\n\nBefore the couple pauses for a make-out session, I ask about the communist elephant in the room. When I had told the innkeeper in Hanover where I had stayed overnight what I was doing in town-spending time with a rich communist-she said this: \"Screw him, he doesn't know what he's talking about.\"\n\n\"When certain friends of mine, or ex-friends, start critiquing him, and if they have any money, I'm like, Well, I'd love to know where you're putting your money,\" says Stella, whose own dad is worth an estimated $25 million . \"Are they giving their fucking money away? Are they giving money to people in Jackson to clean their water?\"\n\nIt gets complicated, this type of thing. \"I grew up in a world where everyone's kissing your ass for something you didn't do. And it's the same thing when you're super fucking rich.\" She describes her father, Julian, as \"really charming, and super generous and totally annoying and fucked up at the same time.\" She sighs. \"Yeah. Whatever, as you know, dialectical materialism. . . there are always opposites.\"\n\nFergie's own parents split up when he was two. His dad and the business were based in Atlanta; Fergie was raised in a Brooklyn brownstone with his mother. A consummate problem child, he went to St. Ann's, a very expensive and alternative private school for the children of the city's rich but artsy class. (Lena Dunham is a graduate.)\n\nIt was there that Fergie was introduced to communism, thanks to an eighth grade history teacher. But he tells me he didn't even know he was wealthy until a classmate showed him the Forbes list around the same time.\n\nSo he did what any good young revolutionary who found out he was the heir to a fortune would do: he emailed Noam Chomsky. \"I think he suggested some books to read,\" Fergie tells me. He doesn't remember which and tells me that nowadays, \"I don't fuck with Noam Chomsky.\"\n\nFergie's always tended to gravitate toward the hard stuff. Combat sports. Guns. He takes his steak raw, slathered with raw honey and butter. He tells me that he was shooting up heroin at 14, sobered up by 16, but then at 18 he was cooking crack in the shared kitchen at the dorms at Bard. He was asked to take a leave of absence for the crack incident. After a booze and drugs binge ten years later, in 2013, he was arrested on domestic battery charges.\n\nHe has a tattoo on his face. It's a lightning bolt with an arrow on the end of it, a keepsake from a moment during a mushroom trip he had during a blizzard at the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in 2016. \"It was like revolutionary suicide,\" he says. \"There was no question that I'll be doing this to the death.\"\n\nHe was, seemingly by nature, anti-everything his genteel family stood for.\n\nJames Middleton Cox, the original patriarch, was the Democratic nominee for president in 1920-FDR was his running mate-and two-time governor of Ohio. Fergie's grandmother, Anne , the only Cox Fergie seems to have anything nice to say about-\"She was a bad mother and an absent WASP, but she was not cold as a grandmother\"-was the ambassador to Belgium under President Carter. She had a cardboard cutout of Obama in her living room, and she took her private plane to canvass for him in 2008. She sat on the boards of the Met, the Whitney, the Atlanta Symphony, and went to Miss Porter's . She was once worth $17 billion.\n\nBut thanks to some clever estate planning, when she died in 2020 at 100 years old, Fergie only got $6 million, a Chagall painting of a goat herder, \"and some forks.\" The rest was divided between Fergie's dad and aunts.\n\nFergie's father, the eldest boy, is a progressive for his time and a black sheep in his own right. He was a dance major at Bard, and believes deeply, I am told, in the power of chiropractic medicine. He is also a vegetarian and a biodynamic farmer (his farm, Honey Dog , is 15 minutes down the road from Fergie's Massachusetts outpost) and he is obsessed with bees . He's married to Nabila Khashoggi, daughter of Adnan, the infamous arms dealer and once the richest man in the world. They have one son: Ulysses Layth Adnan Cox Khashoggi Chambers.\n\n\"They're kind of lazy, rich people,\" Fergie tells me. (Jim Cox Chambers, Fergie's father; Lauren Hamilton, his mother, an artist who lives in upstate New York; and Cox Enterprises did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) \"They just wanted me to be this liberal and I'm never gonna be a liberal,\" Fergie says.\n\n\"See ya later, fucker!\"\n\nWe've packed up and we're on the highway racing down to Alford, Massachusetts from New Hampshire, about a three-hour drive, and a cop car that Fergie had his eye on just zoomed by. He won't go into detail about the retreat we're heading to and who is coming but says he wants to bring together \"people who are already active in different organizations\" to cook, eat, learn about Marxism, and train in martial arts.\n\nAnne, the 14-year-old, is sitting in the back of the truck-this one has a \"Henry Ford Was a Literal Nazi\" bumper sticker-eating Subway and listening to the Foo Fighters on her AirPods.\n\n\"I don't want to be an overbearing parent but as far as I'm concerned, there's not really another acceptable option for someone in our position than devoting most of one's energy to the dismantling of the system that created us,\" says Fergie. That's why he doesn't just give $2,500 to 200,000 people and call it a day. The wheels of capitalism would keep turning, and Fergie wants to wedge an anvil into the spokes.\n\nI ask Anne, who recently dyed the front of her hair blue-\"there's not enough emos in the world,\" she laments-if she has the same politics as her dad. \"I think it's good to understand that it's totally unjust that we have that money in the first place.\" Even though Fergie thinks it's \"ridiculous\" for anyone of their wealth to have a normal job, Anne works front of house at a local restaurant in New Hampshire.\n\nIt seems exhausting to be in a constant state of self-annihilation, at once achingly lucky and eternally angry. Even other bleeding-heart rich kids who disavow their wealth, like Abigail Disney or Leah Hunt-Hendrix , an heir to an oil fortune who started Solidaire, and support progressive political causes like the Green New Deal and the congressional campaigns of certain Squad members, do it from within the system. Fergie hates all that. He has no interest in joint statements or slow change, small wins, or baby steps.\n\n\"They're getting in rooms where they're like, 'Oh, I'm a really rich kid and I don't know what to do about it so I'm gonna sit at a table with a bunch of other rich people, and we're gonna decide together.' Bro. This is revolutionary?\" Once Democrats get involved, he says, \"any good motivations go to hell.\"\n\nAbsent a formal sounding board, any real executive team, or an established philanthropy under him, Fergie relies on Zooms with a \"council\" of trusted friends and activists-he wouldn't give me their names-for advice on what to do with his money. At various points he's been involved with The People's Forum , the Black Alliance for Peace, the DSA, and different people on the ground in Atlanta. And there's his Babochki Collective. But really, he can do whatever he wants. He's constantly rebranding and reconfiguring his outward-facing groups: yesterday it's Cloud Kingdom, today it's Berkshire Communists. He's had his fallings-out before. When it comes to the money, at the end of the day, he's in control.\n\n\"I couldn't blow the money before because it was in the Cox mechanism and was doled out,\" he says. I ask if he's nervous now that the first lump sum has been transferred. \"Of course I'm scared. Like, did I make the wrong choice?\" he says, eyes darting around for more cop cars.\n\n\"I'm thinking, what if I make the wrong decision with it?\"\n\nEven more than imperialism, liberalism, idealism, capitalism, the cops, the 12 steps, psychopharmacology, his dad, and America-all of which he despises-Fergie hates Israel.\n\nThe war that broke out on October 7 when Hamas attacked Israeli civilians gave him the perfect opportunity to put his money where his mouth is-to let the world know where he stood on the Jewish state. Mostly the world has meant his neighbors in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n\nPeople around town have known about Fergie for as long as he's been here. There was a separate protest in 2021, during the last bout of violence between Hamas in Israel, where comrades held up signs that read \"Death to Amerikkka,\" which raised eyebrows. But the Great Barringtonians I spoke to say they're more scared than they've ever been since a rally he organized in town on October 10.\n\n\"I didn't feel personally threatened until that rally,\" one neighbor tells me.\n\nAt that rally, he and the Berkshire Communists held signs that read: \"End all U.S. aid to Israel\" and \"Israel and U.S.A. = Terrorists.\" When asked by a reporter at The Berkshire Edge if he supported Hamas, Fergie answered in the affirmative: \"Yes,\" and added, \"Hamas is an indigenous anti-colonial resistance group.\" How about the specific events on October 7, where 1,200 people were murdered, women raped, and others burned alive? \"The Al-Aqsa Flood was a powerful statement of resistance to genocide,\" he said.\n\nOn X , he was even more forthcoming about the massacre: \"One month ago today, the Palestinian Resistance heroically jolted the occupiers, eliminat[ing] a number of combatant settlers,\" he wrote. He does not believe civilians were targeted on October 7 in Israel and denies rape took place, writing, \"the resistance is principled. The resistance is devout.\"\n\nFergie has publicized that he's given hundreds of thousands of dollars to groups including the Middle East Children's Alliance, to the anti-Zionist writer Philip Weiss, and to Samidoun, which Israel designated a terrorist organization and which Germany recently banned . (Samidoun has ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist-Leninist group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Japan, Canada, and the European Union.)\n\nThat October 10 rally in Alford was just the beginning. A few days after that protest, Fergie and two Berkshire Communists members-Paige Belanger and Calla Walsh- chained themselves to the entrance of the Cambridge office of Elbit Systems, an Israeli-based weapons manufacturer. Then, on October 20, he was speaking to a crowd from the bed of a truck in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, protesting General Dynamics. More Berkshire Communists-who have spun off, semantically, as Palestine Action U.S .-were arrested at Elbit in Boston late last month but were bailed out later that night. Fergie told Los Angeles magazine that he paid their legal fees. A few days later Fergie was arrested in Washington, D.C., for defacing a McDonald's (\"Free Gaza\" was spray-painted on the facade and the windows were broken). Over the past few weeks, he's been down to Atlanta to demonstrate and organize against Cop City and up to New Hampshire to attend a teach-in at Dartmouth.\n\nThroughout, he's been posting things like \"death to the normalizing left,\" which Fergie wrote recently in reference to the far-left group Jewish Voice for Peace. He ruminates in another post: \"In the future there will be no Israelis.\"\n\n\"This just changes everything. It just changes everything,\" one neighbor says of Fergie's posture toward Hamas. She told me she feels threatened by him-and scared. \"The idea that everything is justified? Well, then, what does that mean for your neighbors, like what's justified?\" She adds, \"How many guns does he have stockpiled here in Alford?\"\n\n\"This is life or death,\" says another community member, who has beefed up security at his own house-he's purchased cameras, floodlights, a dog-since Fergie arrived on the scene.\n\n\"He's got enough money to ruin my life. I have a business, I have a family that I love,\" he says. \"I just want a comfortable, quiet life.\"\n\nBerkshire and Columbia counties, both east of the Hudson River, may seem bucolic from the outside, but residents tell me there's roiling class resentment under the surface between wealthy second- and third-home owners who come in from the city and the locals who have been priced out of the area.\n\nA few locals, like Regi Wingo, a hip-hop artist who volunteered with programs for troubled youth, have been given free housing on Fergie's commune. At the rally on October 10, Wingo held a sign blaring \"When people are occupied, resistance is justified.\"\n\n\"That was hard for me to see him holding that sign, even though I know Fergie is probably paying him off,\" said one of the neighbors, who has known the Wingo family for decades. Regi's 19-year-old daughter Athena lived on the commune with him, but she has since left.\n\nOther Berkshire Communists include Sage Radachowsky, a Harvard-trained biologist , to whom who Fergie gave money to build a house, and Paige Belanger, 32, who, according to her Instagram , is a \"political educator, agitator, and herbalist,\" and the secretary of Berkshire Communists.\n\nThere are the brothers Sam and Ben Catechi. Ben, now 22, was once a student at Bard College at Simon's Rock, a junior college in Great Barrington with a hyper-progressive reputation that a resident tells me is \"ripe\" for Fergie's recruitment. Simon's Rock parent school is Bard, where Fergie's dad is the chair, and where the alumni center is named for his grandmother.\n\n\"There is a matrix of connections between my family and Bard,\" Fergie's dad Jim said at the dedication ceremony for the baseball field he donated for $2.2 million.\n\nIt's unclear how many Berkshire Communists members are from the school, where kids can enroll as young as 15, but a pro-Palestine protest earlier this month was organized by a coalition of Simon's Rock Student Groups and the Berkshire Communists (on this score, Fergie tells me over text, \"I didn't organize that, I wasn't even there\" and says there's \"zero\" relationship between the Berkshire Communists and Simon's Rock).\n\nBut several Simon's Rock students told me that they'd heard of Fergie, or his group, or that their friends work out at the People's Gym. One student said she's noticed \"alarming behavior\" among her classmates. \"Through discussion with one extremely left student, it was explained to me that they believe we need to start collecting firearms to 'arm the proletariat' for a coming revolution.\"\n\nThe response to all of this from institutions in the area-especially Jewish ones-has been lackluster, according to the locals I spoke with.\n\nA concerned community member emailed Simon's Rock but worries they aren't taking Fergie seriously: \"It's negligent.\" One source said he complained to the local Jewish Federation chapter and was told to keep quiet, lest donors become spooked and the Berkshires get a bad rap. (The Federation's executive director for the Berkshires chapter, Dara Kaufman, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) The local Chabad rabbi, Levi Volovik, in nearby Pittsfield, said a few community members have approached him about Fergie. \"He wants everybody to be nervous,\" the rabbi told me over the phone, but he doesn't seem too perturbed himself. \"Why should anybody be nervous?\" He added, \"In a time of darkness, it's time to add light.\"\n\nAlford, which has a population of 486, doesn't have a police department, but neighboring towns, like Great Barrington and Pittsfield, do. But when community members go to the local police claiming that Fergie is inciting violence, they tell me they've been told that Fergie has a right to protest, and to free speech, and there's nothing they can do despite the noxious messages he puts out. They're told that the local and state police and FBI are aware of the commune, and are keeping an eye on him, but the residents feel, they tell me, like it's getting \"lawless\" in Great Barrington.\n\nThere are also the things that have happened in the area that can't be traced directly to Fergie. A local synagogue received an anonymous call, and the voice on the other line said, \"Shabbat Shalom. Allahu Akbar.\" A year ago, the town woke up to a billboard scrawled with graffiti: \"Eat the rich,\" and another, \"No one needs two homes.\"\n\nLeigh Davis is the vice chair of the town's five-person Selectboard, which sets policy in the town. She says Great Barrington-ten minutes from Alford and with more than ten times the population-is \"very progressive\" and that other towns often look to it as an example. She heard of Fergie a few years ago when he moved to Alford but didn't think much of him. \"I didn't feel like it was something that needed our attention.\"\n\nBut since the war broke out, and then the protests in front of town hall, her constituents have been reaching out. \"Here's this incredibly wealthy person that's sitting on millions and millions of dollars saying he's fighting for the poor,\" she told me. \"There's a real worry of 'Where could this go?' \"\n\nTo constituents Davis says, \"My silence is not due to a lack of compassion and solidarity. We are listening and we do care, but there's only so much we can do as the Selectboard.\" She also doesn't want to inflame the situation or antagonize \"the hornet's nest\" of his commune. \"It's a balancing act.\"\n\nFor his part, Fergie posted a message directly on Instagram to Great Barrington residents who feel threatened by him: \"You are rich white [E]uropean settlers in a cultural resort town.\" The working class are \"coming for you one day soon,\" Fergie predicted, and once that happens, \"There won't ever be enough cops to call.\"\n\nA local told me that she worries about her neighbors being drawn into his far-left ideology, which posits that the struggle of Palestinians is the same as that of working people everywhere, including in Berkshire County, where she says they feel edged out. \"I think people are feeling peer pressure here,\" she says. \"Very good, ordinary people, who don't have the means to find their way out get sucked into things.\"\n\n\"My fear is that he will get more supporters, and they will get more radical,\" one resident said. \"And that this will end in an ugly and violent way.\"\n\nOn Monday, November 20, three protesters were arrested at another Elbit Systems office building in Merrimack, New Hampshire. They had smashed windows, splashed the facade of the building in red paint, and climbed to the roof of the building to set off smoke bombs. They also bike-locked the doors of the office shut, locking employees inside, who called the police around 8 a.m.\n\nAll three are a part of Fergie's group-\"those are comrades,\" he texts me, and all young women: Sophie Ross, 22, Calla Walsh, 19, and Bridget Irene Shergalis, 27. Ross appears, it seems, in the Simon's Rock yearbook for the 2019-2020 school year, alongside Ben Catechi.\n\nWalsh was previously locked to the Elbit office building in Cambridge alongside Fergie in early October, and was arrested there , along with Ross, for vandalizing property and disorderly conduct a few weeks later. Before this recent string of arrests, she worked for Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders' campaigns as a teen activist. Her parents are both professors. In 2021, The New York Times , in a write-up, called her part of an \"influential new force in Democratic politics.\"\n\nThe next day in the Hillsborough County Superior Court South, in blue masks and orange jumpsuits, all three women were charged with riot, sabotage, criminal mischief, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct. Walsh and Ross were given $20,000 bail, owing to their recent prior arrests, while Shergalis was issued $5,000 bail.\n\nFergie paid for all of it.\n\n\"We ALWAYS post bail for those facing state repression for radical politics,\" he texted me, in reference to Babochki, the funding collective that distributes his wealth. He added that \"I don't wanna mess w[ith] any legal scenario\" and \"many people in this country are responding to this genocide in a variety of ways.\"\n\nWhen Walsh was released, Fergie posted a picture of her on X with the caption \"Heroic Glow.\"\n\nThe governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, said in a statement , \"I am confident law enforcement will work to bring those responsible for this vile act of hate to swift justice.\" I'm told by the DA's office that a separate state police detective unit has been assigned to monitor the Fergie situation. And last Monday, Alford's building inspector sent a letter to Fergie and his lawyers accusing him of breaking zoning bylaws with his People's Gym, writing, \"This office has previously contacted you about the above referenced address and, specifically, use of the structure thereon for purposes other than storage for which it was permitted.\" Fergie calls the move \"ridiculous and targeted.\" He says cops have been driving up and down the road near the properties and added, \"[I]t's not commercial, it's not crowded, it's us using a big building on an 80-acre property to move around with friends.\" Online, he blamed the \"Zionist frenzy smear articles\" for the efforts to shut down his gym.\n\nTimothy Shugrue, the DA, said this about the unrest Fergie is raising: \"These hateful actions are inconsistent with basic civility, inclusivity, and respect. As district attorney, I will take all efforts to ensure the safety of all citizens of the county. We will vigorously prosecute any and all hate crimes against any citizens of our county.\"\n\nBut Fergie's neighbors, the ones who live near his compound, are confident this will have a different ending.\n\n\"This community is going to have a disaster. There will be a crazy kid who gets ahold of a gun who does something bad. And Fergie will pay for his lawyers. He's got the money. It will ruin the Berkshires,\" says one of them. He worries that everything that's happened with Fergie so far is \"just the prologue.\"\n\nEditor's Note: Fergie Chambers reached out after publication to clarify that he did not have his wife followed because he suspected she was having an affair. He hired a private investigator to confirm her location because he was worried about her. The Free Press regrets the error. In addition, Fergie made clear that his grandmother, Anne, wouldn't have wanted him to run the company, because \"that wasn't me ever.\"\n\nSuzy Weiss is a reporter at The Free Press. Her last story was about young Western women converting to Islam.\n\nIf you appreciate stories like this one, support The Free Press and become a paid subscriber today:\n\nRich commie.

      "text": "There is a patronizing racism in the idea that slaughtering innocent people equates to noble freedom fighting, as if this were the only way to respond to oppression.\n\nI very much agree that people really need to look carefully at these situations before forming an opinion, especially when the issues are so complex. Short-circuiting that process leads to the unthinking endorsement of the barbarity you described. Now, however, I think most Palestinians would be happy to be condescended to if they could just be sure of survival. I truly hope Israel does its utmost to avoid the taking of more innocent lives. Netanyahu has tried to defend these tactics by citing civilian casualties resulting from the United States' counterattacks during WWII and after 9/11. But there's something about these analogies that is problematic. For one thing, the allies were not trying to squeeze Germans out of Germany, and America was not trying to squeeze Afghans and Iraqis out of Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively. There are other reasons the analogies don't hold up, but the most troubling thing is knowing in advance that the enemy is Hamas and not the Palestinians, while knowing the Palestinians will suffer the greatest percentage of the casualties. It's like trying to kill a mosquito with a cannon ball.\n\nThere is another solution to the problem that has not been attempted and it points to one of the reasons Anti-Zionism is not the same thing as Anti-Semitism. Why has there not been a concerted effort on the part of the Israelis to convert the Muslim Population of Palestine to Judaism? If the Jews want to have a Jewish Homeland, and the Jews believe they are the chosen people, then why isn't everyone invited to the party? If it is more a matter of mitochondrial DNA than religious faith, then is this not the very definition of racism?\n\nApplauded by the WOKE Left has been the march toward \"oppressed vs oppressor.\"  There is no middle ground.  You are either oppressed (people of Color,BLM, illegal immigrates, LGBTQ, Palestinians, etc.! ALWAYS the minorities EXCEPT Asians, who are considered White, or Conservative Blacks who are considered Uncle Tom sellouts), OR the oppressor (the majority, always Whites, always Christians, always Conservatives, always Patriotic, always capitalist supporters of Democracy i.e. America & Israel).\n\nThe irony is how the WOKE Left is now \"eating their own\" over the Hamas - Israel WAR!  ALL those years of ALWAYS voting Democrat, ALWAYS supporting BLM, LGBTQ and EVEN denying ANTFA is dangerous, THOSE Jewish people are now under attack by their WOKE comrades!\n\nWhere will this end?  How?  When?  At what cost!  One thing we know for certain, if we do not elect a strong, unapologetic President who will put America back on the World Stage, America will continue to deteriorate!\n\nMr. McWhorter is wrong in asserting, \"Few of those who celebrate savagery in theory would do so when faced with its reality.\" Just watch this video https://youtu.be/A_PR5RaDE38?si=W8TP92ltMuIzP5od to see how wrong he is.\n\nBy the logic of the left is there really any difference in the \"oppression\" felt by the Palestinians from the Israelis and that felt by black Americans and LGBTQIetc from white America? If it is functionally the same, although possibly different in degree, then would your  white lefty neighbor support marrauding gangs of blacks and gays on his street dispensing \"justice\" a la Hamas? If not, why not?\n\nThat's a discussion I'd like to hear.\n\nWow!\n\nI agree with this sentiment. People need to take responsibility for themselves and their communities. The Palestinian people are not just innocent bystanders. They have allowed Hamas to infiltrate their society, controlling their minds and brainwashing their children. At some point, they need to take responsibility for their own community and work to improve it. They had control of Gaza for near 20 years and they allowed Hamas to turn it into a complete den of despair. As expected, the leftists must blame the \"oppressor\" for every struggling community they see on the planet. They refuse to acknowledge that some people live in broken cultures, broken communities. There are countless examples of communities rising from the depths, and it needs to be done from within. Keep telling people they're victims of oppression, that there's nothing they can do to change their own situation. When you convince someone they are a victim, it's only a matter of time before they react violently to the power that is supposedly victimizing them. We are seeing the end result of this victim philosophy and it's ugly. It will lead us back into barabarism.\n\nMacWhorter is dead on! It is condescending to excuse anyone for morally reprehensible behaviour because they see themselves as perennial victims and so have the right to do what they do. This approach is profoundly insulting.\n\nPalestinians have been infantilized since the very start. Excuses for 1948, declining multiple peace offers, 2 intifadas, on and on and now this!! They behave like mindless infants who have had their toys taken away. Any Palestinian of good faith needs to realize that many many of those on the Left of Israel with whom there may have been common cause have been lost to you. I've talked to them over the last two weeks. They are furious and won't be placated with the BS about 2 states, one state...whatever. The onus of responsibility is on any good faith Palestinians to stand up for yourselves, to put yourselves at risk to your own terroristic kin. Then maybe you'll be believed. How about rescinding the 'forever refugee' status that the UN provided. Go elsewhere. Settle down. Leave the Jews be. It is ironic to me that if the Palestinians had made peace with Israel way back in 1948 they would be The Most Successful 'non-oil reliant' Arabs in all of MENA. And through their own infantile, intransigent behavior along with the support of much of the world they have decimated their own hopes and dignity which they replaced with jealousy, hatred and violence.\n\nKJP needs to be hounded out of her position with a burst of righteous anger.  She is so fundamentally dishonest and unwilling to accept responsibility for her misdeeds and her statements.  Because she is a black lesbian, she will be protected. This is outrageous.  The hatred of Jews is so out of proportion with the more justifiable criticism of the entire Arab world1.\n\nI have found the \"Hamas cheerleaders\" refrain to be such an egregious way to frame the narrative. Not only does it seem to forget (or ignore?) that Hamas is the government of Gaza (of which the militant faction is just one part), it also seems to (deceptively, imo) paint supporters of Palestinian liberation as supportive of terrorism. And it seems to come straight from the Bush Admin playbook after 9/11 when they employed the manipulative \"You're either with us or with the terrorists\" form of social engineering. I can't help but feel like we're being socially engineered again.\n\nIt very much pains me to say that I'm disappointed that you authored this article, Dr. McWhorter, because I have so much respect for you and your work... but not this piece.\n\nI don't know why Israel doesn't make the availability of aid to Gaza contingent on the release of all captives. This puts the pressure back on Hamas where it belongs, and they will have a chance to show how much they love the Gazan Palestinians they rule over. A deal could happen in a matter of minutes. And if Hamas holds out and innocent Palestinians suffer (like their Israeli neighbors also did at the hands of Hamas), they can explain to the world why innocent Palestinians must suffer so that ... innocent Israelis can also suffer.\n\nAnd here's another idea: Hold spot elections in the Gaza Strip, right now. If the people vote for Hamas, then they get what they paid for.  If they reject Hamas, it exposes and isolates them as stooges of the Shi-ite Ayatollahs.\n\nSo we are clear....when you hear that Israel is an \"occupier\" it means that Israel as a country should not exist and neither should Jews.  Don't think it means Israel in Gaza.  This is now beyond clear.\n\nLots of great comments to be read. I'm going to dumb down the conversation a bit by trying to remove the layers of analysis of McWhorter's post. In its current state, the left liberals have succumbed to the worldview that if two bodies, bodies meaning race, gender, nations, and so on, exist in close proximity, a fault must be found to explain any disparities in success or prosperity. The knee-jerk reaction is always the same. Observe and react only in a way that discounts the obvious choices that have led to the disparities. In other words, blame the prosperous first, investigate later, maybe. That's not to say groups are never subjugated by others. Just not always.\n\nHypothetically, if Hamas was eliminated and the Palestinians were each given $250,000 dollars,  I would bet in 10 years they would be in the same boat. Maybe it's them. Let's not lower the bar for cause.\n\n@thefp please make these articles accessible to substack's e-reader m. Thank you\n\nI wonder what Palestinian women think when they hold their baby boys to their breast knowing that they will be raised to hate and kill - does she want peace?  Can she say that? Who is the oppressor in this scenario when a woman can not choose the life they want for her children.   What about the propaganda that is taught in schools and financed by the UN?  I  say the government- Gaza has a government in place and it is not Israel.  The West Bank in Palestine is under the rule of the PA.  Everyone talks about Israel's motives or future plans - but what is Palestine hoping for?  Who wants to leave the world a better place and move forward?  There are real issues that the younger generation need to focus on - cleaning pollution, climate change and making the world a better place so we can live at peace with our neighbors.  Jews have been oppressed throughout the ages but succeed anyway;  I think we can learn something from them.\n\nOne who truly cares about the Palestinian people MUST recognize that as long as Hamas and Hezbollah are speaking for the Palestinians the Palestinians will see no progress. Any sentiment that tries to justify what Hamas did three weeks ago is either naïveté, illogical justification, or antisemitism."

TGIF.\n\n→ The classified docs no one cares about: Not that it matters, but the White House counsel's office says there were no visitor logs at Biden's Wilmington house (normal since it's his personal residence), where a bunch of classified documents had been taken and stored while Biden was vice president (not normal). Oh, and no big deal, but Hunter Biden lived at that Wilmington house during the time, with the documents, more of which for some reason keep being discovered . (How many Top Secret document closets are there exactly?) Totally unrelated: Hunter Biden was also getting paid a lot of money by foreign groups for unknown activities around then. All great. Onward.\n\n→ Quick reminder on Davos: Everyone at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a confab of political and financial leaders, arrives by private jet , which is how they move through the world, pumping carbon into your neighborhood air as they go. You, on the other hand, need to stop complaining about your paper straw. It's meant to wilt and congeal, that's how you know it's working! Davosians can arrive by carbon-spewing jet, with a separate jet trailing behind carrying their poodles and pregnant surrogates. And once in Davos, the plan is to terrify and shame everyone who's not there.\n\nHere's Al Gore at Davos this week on greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere: \"the accumulated amount is now trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every single day on the earth. . . . That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land, and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees!\"\n\nOther than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?\n\nI have a confession: In the course of my life, I have been invited to join an executive aboard his private jet-twice, if you can believe it. And twice I have said no. Do I just love Southwest? I do not. But once you've stepped onto a private jet, you're actually never allowed to tell anyone what to do or think (other than on the topics of fly fishing, wild game hunting, and skiing). Once you've stepped onto a private jet, you have to embrace your role as a villain on this earth, here to reap and to enjoy the spoils, which, I'm told, include warm towels when you board. But you have ceded the moral high ground. And I love my moral high ground. (For approximately two more years, and then goodbye, you filthy plebes.)\n\n→ George Santos gets a promotion: Santos, the freshman Republican congressman from New York, is a serial liar. Yes, fine, all politicians are, but Santos seems truly pathological. A great example: He claims his mom was inside the Twin Towers on 9/11. He's also claimed she died that day, but apparently she died of cancer years later. Anyway, now it seems she didn't even live in America then.\n\nThis week's Santos headline comes courtesy of Patch.com's Jacqueline Sweet : \"Disabled Veteran: George Santos Took $3K From Dying Dog's GoFundMe.\" Santos, under a fake name he used at the time-because of course he did-ran a pet charity, Friends of Pets United. He helped a veteran, Richard Osthoff, set up a fundraiser for his cancer-ridden dog. They raised $3,000 from a bunch of Osthoff's friends and family. And then, what do you know, Santos allegedly ran off with the money. It takes a real lowlife to scam a broke veteran who's trying to save his dog. Santos denied it and said he's never heard of the guy, but. . . GoFundMe has confirmed that the fundraiser was real, was linked to Santos, and was taken down amid fraud allegations.\n\nHouse Republicans are responding to the various Santos frauds, lies, and scams by censuring him and pressing him to resign, I assume. Right? Dear God no, they promoted him ! Santos just scored seats on the Small Business and the Science, Space and Technology Committees. Might as well reopen the 9/11 Commission and throw him on Ways and Means while we're at it.\n\nOne thing I'll say for Santos: It looks like he used to be a drag queen , performing under the name Kitara Ravache. And how about that Kitara? She looked great.\n\n→ Biden admin softening on notion of World War III: The president of the United States is now toying with the idea of helping (nudging?) the president of Ukraine to retake Crimea, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. Time magazine has this headline: \" The Liberation of Crimea Is a Must .\" Crimea, by international law, does still belong to Ukraine. But it would be a major escalation in an already expensive and drawn-out war-expensive both in U.S. dollars and in Ukrainian lives.\n\n→ Okay, now we can talk about strokes: Every couple weeks, a former bit of *RED ALERT DISINFO* that could get you fired for even thinking about . . . turns out to be actually true. The latest: The Covid vaccine may increase risk of stroke among people over 65, according to a new CDC and FDA analysis. \"We believe it is important to share this information with the public, as we have in the past, when one of our safety monitoring systems detects a signal,\" the agencies wrote in a statement. Previously, disinformation about the vaccine included that it puts young men at elevated risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (whoops, that one's true ). And the crazy fake news idea that it disrupted menstruation (oh gosh, that's true too ).\n\nI'm happily vaxxed and waited in the basement of an elder care facility to get it early. I vax myself with any needle I can find. But also: The Covid vaccine has side effects. It's a sign of profound insecurity when such truths can't be said plainly.\n\nWe're all suffering now from the loss of trust in health institutions. As a new mom, I've found myself next to other new moms who will talk about pediatricians who are really reasonable about vaccines. No! Stop inviting me to your polio parties! So my message to public health experts: Just tell the truth and admit when things are complicated, so we don't all have to get measles.\n\n→ China's population falls by 850,000: It is a truth universally acknowledged that a nation in possession of a good fortune must be in want of children. Or: People in rich countries don't have many kids. China's population has fallen for the first time in more than 60 years. The birth rate in the US is at a century low . My personal goal is to buck this trend. I don't know what's wrong with me, but our daughter is four-and-a-half months old, I'm dead in the eyes, and I'm googling \"pregnancy post birth safe how soon.\"\n\n→ \"There is no more room in New York\": Eric Adams, mayor of America's largest city, announced that his town is just totally full and cannot accommodate any new immigrants. \"Our cities are being undermined,\" the mayor said this week . \"We don't deserve this. Migrants don't deserve this and the people who live in the cities don't deserve this . . . There is no more room in New York.\" The liberal response to the surge of migrants goes like this: First of all, the border crisis is fake and racist. Second of all, it was caused by Trump, who is still the president. Third, Park Slope is at capacity.\n\n→ Boston's highly questionable new public art: After $10 million and years of work, the city of Boston unveiled a monument. And oh, it is a mon-u-ment. It's meant to capture the moment Martin Luther King Jr., upon hearing he won the Nobel Peace Prize, embraces his wife Coretta Scott King.\n\nBut, viewed from certain angles, \"The Embrace\" looks undeniably like a penis. And what a penis! Washington Post writer Karen Attiah hates the piece and blames its unsightliness on white supremacy, though the artist behind the piece, Hank Willis Thomas, is black. Attiah writes : \"Boston's Embrace statue perfectly represents how White America loves to butcher MLK.\" Not sure about that one.\n\nCoretta Scott King's cousin wrote a great takedown with the headline: \"A Masturbatory 'Homage' to My Family.\" I don't know how men think exactly, but there are worse things than one of your monuments suggesting you had a dream and also . . . you get what I'm saying.\n\n→ Nick Cave doesn't like his AI song: A fan asked ChatGPT , an incredible new artificial intelligence tool, to make a song in the style of the artist Nick Cave. And it did. The fan, named Mark, thought it was cool and posted it for Mr. Cave's pleasure. \"This song sucks,\" the artist responded . \"Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don't feel. Mark, thanks for the song, but with all the love and respect in the world, this song is bullshit.\" Nick Cave is right.\n\nExpect more on ChatGPT in future TGIFs. It's up to some nonsense, just like the humans.\n\n→ Let's check in quickly on campus life:\n\nAh yes, students marching and calling for intifada , or genocide against the Jews, and \"from the river to the sea,\" or the destruction of Israel and expulsion of Jews from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. Just another day on the quad. Go Blue!\n\n→ Jeff Bezos checks in on his Washington Post- based PR team: Reporters at The Washington Post had a fun surprise this week: a visit from the big boss. Bezos sat in on an editorial meeting. According to the NYT 's Ben Mullin (who I'm sure is inundated with WaPo reporter texts), the editors discussed story plans around Amazon and also around the Washington Commanders football team, which Bezos is interested in buying. Bezos was there, sitting in the meeting as the owner of the newspaper, certainly having no influence at all .\n\nPoor Washington Post reporters, the absolute wackiest in America, who produce headlines that read like a 2019 struggle session scream (seriously, look at their homepage , where among other things they blame sexism for the New Zealand prime minister's resignation). TGIF is for sale, Mr. Bezos, but I have something called dignity, and I will not allow you to censor anything beyond 17 items of your choosing per week. Okay, fine, 18.\n\n→ New Zealand's PM resigned because no one liked the lockdowns: Jacinda Ardern's popularity in New Zealand tanked during Covid. Her approval rating these days: 29%. That's thanks to her hard-line lockdowns-not sexism. Now she has resigned . I appreciate someone who knows when to call it. \"For me, it's time,\" she said.\n\n→ Manslaughter charges for Alec Baldwin: The actor will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter in New Mexico following the death of the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the movie Rust in October 2021. He claims that he never pulled the trigger on the gun that held the bullet that killed Hutchins, but the FBI says that's not possible. What a nightmare.\n\n→ Right-wing media catfight: Big drama in the conservative world, and it's playing out on YouTube. Right-wing talk show personality Steven Crowder, whose deal with Glenn Beck's joint The Blaze was expiring, announced that he had been offered a new deal from another conservative outlet, The Daily Wire, but that it was a deal akin to \"slavery.\" This is starting out healthily!\n\n\"Big tech is in bed with big con,\" he said, spending 28 minutes ranting and reading excerpts from the deal that would punish him financially if he gets kicked off tech platforms. Big con, as in conservative. The Daily Wire 's Jeremy Boreing clarified in his own nearly hour-long video that the offer was for $50 million to be paid over four years. Crowder would have a month of vacation every year and would never have to work on a Friday. TGIF is not sure which team to pick here, but if we (I) don't get summer Fridays all year, we (I) are not above doing a 30-minute YouTube monologue.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "In 2016, Donald Trump's margin among white voters was actually 1 percentage point greater than Ronald Reagan's in his 1984 landslide over Walter Mondale. At the same time, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.86 million-nearly the magnitude of victory enjoyed by George W. Bush in 2004. These factoids crystalize the limits of both Trump's appeal and the power of the Democrats' Coalition of the Ascendant. Combined with Trump's clenched-fisted inaugural address the next day's nationwide demonstrations, and last weekend's immigration protests, America looks like it is in the midst of a semi-civil civil war .\n\nMichael Eric Dyson's Tears We Cannot Stop does not go there. Instead, it is an emotional indictment of White America-a jeremiad and a primal scream from a man who is both an ordained minister and a chaired Georgetown University professor. Tears We Cannot Stop catalogs a litany of measures that should be embraced by white Americans, including reparations for the descendants of slaves in the form of Individual Reparations Accounts (IRAs) and a black tax, that is, payment by whites of a surcharge for work performed by black Americans. Suffice it to say, neither will happen any time soon.\n\nTears is also notable for what it is not. It is not a guide to how the Democrats can regain power, and it is not a salve for white liberals. Rather, Tears is really Dyson's own J'accuse . Dyson is raw and unfiltered. He targets white liberals and acidly refers to his readers as \"beloved,\" acridly infusing that word-a word repeatedly found in Solomon's Song of Songs , the Bible's own love poem-with vinegar, bile, and guilt.\n\nSo as to obliterate any possibility of ambiguity, Dyson unloads on Mark Lilla, a Columbia University history professor who had warned against the excesses of identity politics and blamed them, in part, for Hillary Clinton's defeat. As Lilla jarringly framed things in the New York Times , \"liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in American politics was the Ku Klux Klan, which still exists,\" and that \"those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.\"  Unfortunately, Dyson has no patience for Lilla's critique and instead lashes out, characterizing Lilla's views as those of an amnesiac with a \"fang, an exposed snarl, and inconvenient messiness of real history.\"\n\nDyson would do better to digest Lilla's political postmortem and pay greater attention to the numbers. The fact is that Barack Obama, an African-American, significantly outpolled Hillary Clinton with the white working class. Other key statistics that bear upon America today are that white life expectancy is in decline , even with Obamacare as the law of the land, and that the economic recovery has been real but uneven.\n\nWhites lost more than 700,000 jobs between November 2007 and late 2016. On a personal level that is a disaster, and on the political plane, that spelled Election Day doom for the Clinton campaign, a reminder that life in rural Pennsylvania is far from a weekend in Larchmont, and not just as a matter of geographic distance. Charles Murray's blighted Fishtown is real, and for the Blue America's elites way too remote.\n\nAlthough Dyson's \"sermon\" is born of harsh personal experiences and encounters, he unrealistically expects the reader to embrace his crusade. Dyson tells of how, as a teenager, he was stopped by a policeman on the suspicion of driving a stolen car (which actually belonged to Dyson's father), and after Dyson had reached into his pocket to retrieve the car's registration papers, the officer bellowed, \"N*****, if you move again without telling me to I'll put a bullet through your f***ing head.\" There is no reason to doubt Tyson's recollection here.\n\nDyson also writes of how he was asked to step out of his car by the police, after Dyson had hit his son three times as an act of paternal discipline. Apparently, Dyson then identified himself as an academic to the policeman, who shot back, in front of Dyson's wife and son, \"And I'm John Wayne,\" but then let Dyson go after a pat-down and Dyson being encircled by other police cars. In addition, Dyson informs the reader that his own brother was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Make no mistake, all of this is tragic.\n\nBut Dyson's narrative does not end there. Instead, Dyson launches into a head-on attack on America's police in a chapter titled \"Coptopia.\" He also tries to explain away the premeditated murder of police in Baton Rouge, La., and Dallas, Texas, during the summer of 2016, all which coincided with the political convention season.\n\nThe bottom line is that personal grievance does not necessarily make for good politics or sound public policy, particularly when it comes to police. At a time when America's institutions are ever more distrusted, the three exceptions to the trend are the military, small business, and the police. While less than a quarter of Americans have confidence in the criminal-justice system and only two in five trust organized religion, a majority have faith in the police. Indeed, by October 2016, the polls showed that 76 percent of Americans had a \"great deal of respect for police,\" a number not seen since a deadly and riotous 1968.\n\nAll this encapsulates the Democrats' dilemma and the shortcoming of having become overly reliant upon the Coalition of the Ascendant, the amalgam of minority and younger voters. Black lives matter, but white votes do too. And yes, politicians with a focused eye on the prize get it.\n\nTwo-term president Bill Clinton repeatedly pleaded with his wife's campaign to spend more time in the Rust Belt, but was ignored. Bill de Blasio, New York City's ethically addled mayor, has increased the size of New York Police Department and touts the fact that in 2016 murder was at a record low -this after de Blasio first rode into office castigating the cops.\n\nDyson possesses the dual advantages of the ivory tower and the pulpit. He also carries his personal pain and is free to focus as he so chooses. But with Chicago neighborhoods having turned into killing fields, and with the Obama presidency having hollowed out the Democratic Party, Dyson's time may have been better spent on a book that was less indictment and more panorama, one that translated Dyson's grievances and ideals into something practical and embracing, one that acknowledged that 2017 is not 1860, or even 1964.\n\nLloyd Green, an attorney in New York, was opposition research counsel to George H.W.

      "text": "I have been deliberately holding off on election-related comments on matters about which I have little novel to contribute. On one critical issue, though, contemporary debate and theorizing really is trespassing on my areas of expertise.\n\nFor some 15 years now, I have been writing about the idea of the U.S. becoming a majority-minority country , in which no single ethnic or racial group constitutes a majority. I discussed this, for instance, in my book The Next Christendom , back in 2002. That idea has recently become quite standard and orthodox, and is an increasingly familiar element of political rhetoric, especially among liberals and Democrats. But at least as the idea is appearing in the media and political discourse, it is being badly misunderstood, in two critical ways. For some, these misunderstandings arise from excessive optimism; for others the flaw lies in pessimism. These points may seem stunningly obvious, but as I say, they escape a lot of otherwise informed commentators. Consciously or otherwise, observers are letting themselves be deceived by the fluid nature of American ethnic classifications.\n\nFirstly, and obviously, \"minority\" is not a uniform category.\n\nAfter the recent election, I saw plenty of articles saying this was the last gasp of White America before whites lost their majority status, maybe sometime around 2040. Well, 2040 is a long way off, but let us look at the projections for what the U.S. population will look like in mid-century, say in 2050. The best estimate is that non-Latino whites will make up some 47 percent of that population, Latinos 29 percent, African-Americans 15 percent, and Asians 9 percent. Allow a couple of percentage points either way.\n\nIn that situation, \"whites\" will indeed be a minority. But the future U.S. will be a very diverse nation, with multiple communities whose interests might coincide on some issues but not others. The fact that whites will be a minority in 2050 does not, for instance, mean that African-Americans will have unlimited latitude to achieve their goals, or that blacks can count on the reliable support of Asians and Latinos. On some issues, yes, on others, no. Just to take a specific issue, a distinctively African-American issue like reparations for slavery is presumably not going to appeal to the mass of Latino or Asian-American taxpayers any more than it presently does to old-stock whites.\n\nI have actually talked with people who are convinced that by 2050, African-Americans will be a majority in this country. No, they won't, not even close. Actually, the African-American share of the population will not even grow that substantially. The figure was around 12 percent in 1980, rising to 15 percent by 2050. Much of that growth reflects newer African migration, from communities that generally do not identify with African-American politics or traditions.\n\nAlso, what do we mean by \"white\"? Historically, the category of \"whiteness\" has been very flexible, gradually extending over various groups not originally included in that constituency. In the mid-19th century, the Irish were assuredly not white, but then they became so. And then the same fate eventually befell Poles and Italians, and then Jews. A great many U.S. Latinos today certainly think of themselves as white. Ask most Cubans, or Argentines, or Puerto Ricans, and a lot of Mexicans. Any discussion of \"whiteness\" at different points in U.S. history has to take account of those labels and definitions.\n\nNor are Latinos alone in this regard. In recent controversies over diversity in Silicon Valley, complaints about workplaces that are overwhelmingly \"white\" were actually focused on targets where a quarter or more are of Asian origin. Even firms with a great many workers from India, Taiwan, or Korea found themselves condemned for lacking true ethnic diversity. Does that not mean that Asians are in the process of achieving whiteness ?\n\nMeanwhile, intermarriage proceeds apace, with a great many matches involving non-Latino whites and either Latinos or people of Asian origin. (Such unions are much more common than black-white relationships.) Anyone who expects the offspring of such matches to mobilize and rise up against White Supremacy is going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nThe second point specifically concerns the book The End of White Christian America , by Robert P. Jones, a work I found rewarding and provocative. But the title has been much cited and misused (not Jones's fault!). Typically doom-laden was the Washington Post 's headline, \"White Christian America Is Dying,\" and the takeaway for most liberals is: and good riddance.\n\nReading some post-election comments, it seemed as if commentators were expecting the \"white Christian\" population to evaporate, which it won't do. Firstly, non-Latino whites will of course remain, and will still, at least through the 2050s, constitute by far the nation's largest ethnic community. A 47 percent community still represents an enormous plurality. Actually, the scale of \"white Christian\" America will be far more substantial even than that figure might suggest, given the de facto inclusion of other groups-especially Latinos, and possibly Asians-under the ethnic umbrella. Intermarriage accelerates the expansion of whiteness.\n\nWhites are not going away, and nor are Christians. One great effect of the 1965 Immigration Act was to expand vastly the range of ethnic groups in the U.S., who were overwhelmingly Christian in origin. That is true obviously of Mexicans, but also of Asian-Americans and Arab-Americans. New generations of Africans trend to be fiercely Christian. The American Islamic population, for instance, was and remains tiny as a proportion of the national total, and it will continue to do so.\n\nSo no, we are not looking to the end of white Christian America, nor to the passing of white Christian America. In 2050, this will be a much more diverse country religiously and ethnically. But if you are waiting for the White Christian Apocalypse, you may have the wrong millennium.\n\nPhilip Jenkins is the author of The Many Faces of Christ: The Thousand Year Story of the Survival and Influence of the Lost Gospels .

      "text": "Remember the alienated working class?\n\nIf my memory serves, the U.S. establishment took an interest in MAGA Land's discontents for about nine months, beginning in mid-2016 and ending a month or two after Donald Trump's inauguration, a period that roughly coincided with Hillbilly Elegy 's climb atop the best-seller charts. Thereafter, the media and talking heads went back to ignoring or demonizing the social bloc that had propelled the Orange Man to the White House, an approach that persists to this day.\n\nBut before Trump's rise was anything more than a gleam in the reality-TV star's own eye, one thinker saw trouble brewing among the lower orders and tried to warn the nation. I'm speaking of Charles Murray, whose prophecy came in the form of the 2012 book Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010 . It was a work of meticulous research that should have prompted a drastic rethink on social and economic policy, not least on the right.\n\nExcept, it didn't. The Republican Party carried on as before, largely indifferent to working-class misery, of which deaths of despair and the opioid epidemic were only the most glaring symptoms. Most conservatives and libertarians-lawmakers and intellectuals alike-were therefore surprised and baffled by the Trump phenomenon, though I suspect Murray himself escaped this deer-in-headlights effect.\n\nWhy was this? It is true that only a very few books truly change history. But some blame lies also with the author. Reading Coming Apart nearly a decade later, it is clear that Murray reinforced, rather than challenged, elites' conventional wisdom: namely, that to the extent working-class alienation is real, it is primarily a cultural problem, rather than one having to do with law and political economy. This, in turn, rendered his commination ultimately harmless to U.S. elites.\n\nThe trends Murray had highlighted were alarming, but, the author reassured elites, there was little about our neoliberal social and economic arrangements that could or should be altered to reverse these trends. The best the overclass could do was to \"preach what they practice,\" as he famously wrote, exhorting the underclass to the \"Founding virtues\" of marriage, industriousness, honesty, and religiosity.\n\nBy now, Murray's main findings are well-known, and I have no reason to challenge them, still less to present some alternative dataset. Indeed, Coming Apart remains a masterclass in the selection, compilation, and presentation of complex social data, and Murray deserves our thanks for having undertaken this labor. What I take issue with, rather, are the libertarian assumptions that sometimes distort the author's analysis of his own findings, as well as the near complete absence from the book of class conflict and compromise, which lends his view of the American past a strangely rosy, ahistorical quality, making it harder to contextualize the more recent developments he would have us examine.\n\nFor those who still haven't read the book-though you really should-allow me to briefly summarize its core contention. America, Murray shows, has since the mid-1960s been undergoing a dramatic process of social sorting. The members of a new upper class, enjoying the fruits of cognitive advantage and an economy that increasingly rewards them, have separated themselves from the rest of the country, clustering together conjugally, culturally, and geographically in \"Belmont\" (both an upscale Boston suburb, as well as a carefully constructed statistical representative of white, upper-class America).\n\nBelmont, Murray demonstrates, still largely practices the aforementioned Founding virtues. Belmont children grow up in intact biological families, with mothers and fathers locked in stable marriages. As professionals, Belmonters work very hard. They form an honest community, at least as measured by rates of criminality and incarceration. And notwithstanding all the talk about elite secularization, they are still surprisingly churchgoing and actively involved in civic institutions.\n\nBut for much of the rest of America, particularly the new lower class, things aren't going so well. In Fishtown (again, both a real working-class Philly neighborhood, as well as a carefully constructed statistical stand-in for the lower class), marriage rates have dropped since the 1960s, and many children grow up in unstable family environments headed by single mothers. A large share of workers, including prime-age men, have exited the labor force. Crime is spiking. And religiosity and civic engagement are down-way down.\n\nMurray focuses his analysis on white Americans, on the ground that white-versus-minority comparisons risk obscuring the shifts taking place within white America, as the reference point against which other groups' well-being is judged. If other ethnic groups were factored into his analysis, the author speculates, the class divergence documented in Coming Apart would only appear wider and more terrifying. It's a sound decision. Again, I have no reason to criticize Murray's empirical methods. It is his libertarian commitments and assumptions that give me pause. Often, Murray reveals these assumptions in passing-just enough to discount class conflict as a potential causal factor or to rule out solutions rooted in political economy.\n\nFor example, almost immediately after explaining his decision to limit his analysis to whites, Murray writes, \"Don't kid yourselves that we are looking at stresses that can be remedied...by restricting immigration.\" Come again? Why would excluding minorities from an analysis of white-against-white decline rule out immigration's role in the same phenomenon? We know that boosting the aggregate supply of unskilled and low-skilled labor by importing immigrants (of whatever ethnicity) adversely affects the wages, bargaining power, and social-services access of native workers (of all ethnicities).\n\nIt follows that restricting some forms of immigration could improve the material condition of underclass Americans, including the white underclass vis-à-vis the white overclass. This is why immigration restrictionism has been a working-class political demand going back at least to the Populist and Progressive eras, when the nation's ethnic composition was far more homogenous than it is today. Now, if Murray holds the view that immigration doesn't, in fact, undercut workers at or near the bottom of the labor ladder, then that is a belief we might have expected him to justify with as much statistical rigor as he deployed in making his other observations.\n\nOr take work-force participation. Again, there is no denying the bare finding that in Fishtown, \"a substantial number of prime-age, white, working-age men dropped out of the labor force\" in the period under consideration (1960-2010), as Murray notes. Nor that the prime-age, white, male jobless rate jumped during the same period, even when taking into account \"underlying trends in unemployment.\" Yet in explaining these developments, Murray flatly concludes that \"white males of the 2000s were less industrious than they had been 20, 30 or 50 years ago, and that the decay in industriousness occurred overwhelmingly in Fishtown.\"\n\nTo reach that conclusion, Murray quickly rules out wage shrinkage and private-economy labor unionism's long-term funk. Yes, he concedes, \"high-paying unionized jobs have become scarce, and real wages for all kinds of blue-collar jobs have been stagnant or falling since the 1970s.\" But, he goes on, these realities lack explanatory power, since \"insofar as men need work to survive... falling hourly income does not discourage work.\" In the \"very bad\" economic year 2009, he goes on, these men could have toiled as, say, building cleaners for $12.63 an hour, or $505 weekly, assuming a 40-hour week-not a \"great\" wage, yes, but \"enough to be able to live a decent existence.\"\n\nHere, Murray reveals the moral and psychological limitations of a certain kind of econometric libertarianism. While one hopes that any working-age man will pick up work wherever it might be found, it is important to note the historical shift hovering in the background: \"High-paying unionized jobs have become scarce\"-a reminder that such jobs were not so scarce for earlier generations of Fishtown men. Could it be that while a statistical abstraction might be happy to work an insecure, wage-stagnant job for $12.63 an hour, a man who remembers that his father and grandfather had secure, well-paying working-class jobs might be less enthusiastic?\n\nMurray fails to account, in other words, for the lost promise, so foundational to the American project, that \"there is no fixed condition of labor\" for the worker's whole life, as Lincoln put it, that he can get ahead reasonably well and escape wage-drudgery and achieve a measure of secure and equal ownership, if not vast wealth. By the latter third of the 20th century, the Fishtown man wasn't even secure in the fixed-if-decent condition of his unionized father and grandfather. The wages and opportunities on offer to him represented a dramatic retraction from the condition of his forebears.\n\nWhat I'm getting at are the shortcomings of an interpretive frame that leaves out inter-class competition, conflict, and compromise-the workings of a class system -in attempting to analyze the admittedly troubling conduct of the white underclass. Murray, it seems to me, exhibits Michael Lind's characterization of neoliberal and libertarian thought as a whole in attributing \"the problems of the white working class not to the class system, but rather to personal shortcomings\" of millions of Americans, who all seem to be making the same or similarly wrong choices in their lives as individuals. The process, as Murray would have it, just began in the 1960s, in a manner divorced from historical forces, from political economy, from the material substrate that makes it possible for people to build virtuous lives (or not).\n\nWhen it comes to the period under consideration-as well as our history as a whole-Murray's is finally a romantically individualized account of American life. To his credit, the author does recognize that there have always been distinct classes in America, which is more than can be said for many mainstream conservatives and libertarians. But he writes of an \"underlying American kinship\" between classes that strikes me as altogether airbrushed and ideologized: His lost Eden is an America where bosses and their workers lived not too far apart, and not too differently, both groups striving for the Founding virtues and sharing roughly the same aspirations.\n\nFar be it from me to claim that such inter-class harmony has never reigned in American social life. It has, from time to time, especially in the two to three decades immediately following World War II. But the historical norm has been one of intense, violent class conflict. This other United States has been described by one eminent American as a place where \"the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely the reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but . . . result from the discriminating favor of the government and are largely built upon undue extractions from the masses of our people\"; where the gulf between employers and the employed is constantly widening, and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich, while in another are found the toiling poor; where dominate \"trusts, combinations and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel\"; where \"corporations, which ought to be carefully constrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters.\"\n\nThat eminent American was President Grover Cleveland, lamenting the social state of the republic in his fourth annual message to Congress. This was the America that witnessed furious railroad and coal strikes, the America of proletarian squalor set against plutocratic opulence, of farmers who still considered themselves frontier yeomen but who were, in fact, the near-slaves of creditors and the \"money power.\" It was an era as \"honest\" and as virtuous as a figure like Sen. James Blaine, the Gilded Age's master of graft.\n\nThat era of class turbulence, stretching from the Civil War to World War II, came to a close thanks to pro-labor reforms enacted across the Populist, Progressive, and New Deal eras. What followed was the age of convergence whose loss Murray eulogizes. Which class set off divergence? Well, undermining private-sector unionism, shipping jobs offshore, promoting relatively open borders and generally deregulating economic life-these were concrete policies pursued by Murray's virtuous overclass, beginning roughly at the outset of his timeframe (the 1960s). The result: The overclass did very well for itself in the decades that followed, while the underclass seems to have declined as insecure working classes tend to do.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that virtue and cultural factors more generally are unimportant, far from it. But culture and virtue, too, have a material, political dimension. The cultural changes of the 1960s-above all, sexual liberalization-were imposed by \"libertarians in robes\" (Lind's term for the judiciary), and very soon, the hitherto unthinkable became thinkable and then doable. It would seem, then, that the mere exhortation to virtue that the libertarian Murray limits himself to won't suffice to reverse the changes he laments. Something more is needed: law.\n\nMurray, in his typically and admirably genial style, allows that the data presented in Coming Apart will likely reinforce Americans' ideological priors-including his. Most of the author's own explicitly libertarian prescriptions come only toward the end of the book, although, as I have tried to show, the libertarian commitments are also baked into some of his analysis and assumptions. Nevertheless, Coming Apart remains a signal achievement of American social and political science. To bring us back together in the 21st century, however, calls for a richer, more materially attuned analysis.\n\nSohrab Ahmari is a founder and editor of Compact magazine, a contributing editor of The American Conservative, and a visiting fellow of the Veritas Center for Ethics in Public Life at Franciscan University.

      "text": "Last June the U.S. Census disclosed that non-white births in America were on the verge of surpassing the white total and might do so as early as the end of this year. Such an event marks an unprecedented racial watershed in American history. Over the last few years, various demographic projections from that same agency and independent analysts have provided somewhat fluctuating estimates of the date-perhaps 2042 or 2037 or 2050-at which white Americans will become a minority. This represents a remarkable, almost unimaginable, demographic change from our country of the early 1960s, when whites accounted for over 85 percent of the population and seemed likely to remain at that level indefinitely.\n\nMany years of heavy foreign immigration have been the crucial element driving this transformation, but even if all immigration-legal and illegal-were halted tomorrow and the border completely sealed, these demographic trends would continue, although at a much slower pace. Today, the median age of American whites is over 40, putting most of them past their prime child-bearing years. Meanwhile, America's largest minority group, the rapidly growing population of Hispanics, has a median age in the mid-20s, near the peak of family formation and growth, while both Asians and blacks are also considerably younger than whites. In fact, since 1995 births rather than immigration have been the largest factor behind the near doubling of America's Hispanic population.\n\nAs in most matters, public perceptions of America's racial reality are overwhelmingly shaped by the images absorbed from the national media and Hollywood, whether these are realistic or not. For example, over the last generation the massive surge in black visibility in sports, movies, and TV has led to the widespread perception of a similarly huge growth in the black fraction of the population, which, according to Gallup, most people now reckon stands at 33 percent or so of the national total. Yet this is entirely incorrect. During the last hundred-plus years, American blacks have seen their share of the population fluctuate by merely a percentage point or two, going from 11.6 percent in 1900 to 12.6 percent in 2010. By contrast, five decades of immigration have caused Asian Americans-relatively ignored by the news, sports, and entertainment industries-to increase from 0.5 percent in 1960 to 5 percent today, following the fifteen-fold rise in their numbers which has established them as America's most rapidly growing racial group, albeit from a small initial base.\n\nThese national changes in racial distribution have been quite uneven and geographically skewed, with some parts of the country leading and others lagging. For example, during the 1970s when I was a teenager growing up in the Los Angeles area, that city and the surrounding sprawl of Southern California constituted America's whitest region, about the only large urban agglomeration whose racial character approximated that of the country as a whole-around 85 percent white-and my own San Fernando Valley area in particular exemplified the popular image of suburban picket fences and lighthearted \"Leave It to Beaver\" family comedies. Yet during the two decades that followed, Southern California underwent an enormous immigration-driven demographic transformation, creating a new Los Angeles which was almost 80 percent non-white and a surrounding region in which whites no longer held even a mere plurality.\n\nThis sweeping racial shift, involving the movement or displacement of over ten million people, might easily rank as the largest in the peacetime history of the world and is probably matched by just a handful of the greatest population changes brought about by war. The racial transformation in America's national population may be without precedent in human history.\n\nRepublicans as the White Party\n\nIt is a commonplace that politics in America is heavily influenced by race, and these enormous demographic changes since 1965 have certainly not gone unnoticed within the political world. For decades, white voters have tended to lean Republican while non-whites have been strongly Democratic, so the swiftly falling ratio of the former to the latter has become a source of major concern, even alarm, within the top ranks of the GOP, which received a sharp wake-up call when gigantic California, traditionally one of the most reliably Republican states, suddenly became one of the most reliably Democratic.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s there was a powerful strain of thought within conservative and Republican circles that the best means of coping with this looming political problem was to reduce or even halt the foreign immigration that was driving it. But after several years of bitter internal conflict, this anti-immigrationist faction lost out almost completely to the pro-immigrationist camp, which was backed by the powerful business lobby. As a result, the Republican Party mantra became one of embracing \"diversity\" rather than resisting it and focused on increasing the Republican share of the growing non-white vote. Former President George W. Bush, strategist Karl Rove, and Sen. John McCain have been the most prominent advocates of this perspective.\n\nRove invested huge resources in maximizing Bush's Hispanic numbers in 1998 during his easy Texas gubernatorial reelection campaign and achieved considerable success, persuading some 40 percent or more of local Hispanics to vote the Republican ticket that year, a major shift of political loyalties. This later allowed him to tout his candidate's excellent Hispanic rapport in national GOP circles, which was an important factor in gaining him the presidential nomination in 2000. Although Bush's national Hispanic totals were much less impressive in the 2000 race, and the vast funds he invested in a quixotic attempt to carry California were totally wasted, Rove and his allies redoubled their efforts during the 2004 reelection campaign, and buoyed by the continuing patriotic aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, largely succeeded. Although the percentages have been much disputed, Bush seems to have carried somewhat over 40 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide in 2004, although he was once again trounced in California.\n\n•   •   •\n\nPart of the Bush/Rove political strategy was to take a leading role in passing a sweeping immigration-reform measure, aimed at legalizing the status of many millions of (overwhelmingly Hispanic) illegal immigrants, easing the restrictions on future legal immigration, while also tightening border enforcement. Leaving aside policy matters, the political theory was simple: if the Republican Party changed the laws to benefit Hispanic and other immigrants, these groups and their children would be more likely to vote Republican, thereby helping to solve the GOP's demographic dilemma. Rove endlessly pointed to 40 percent as the necessary GOP level of future Hispanic support-score above that number and political victory was likely, score much below it and defeat was nearly assured. Although this precise quantitative target was obviously intended for rhetorical effect, it does seem to represent the dominant strain in conservative thinking, namely the need to combine a strong white vote with a solid minority of Hispanics and Asians, thereby allowing the Republicans to survive and win races in an increasingly non-white America. (Meanwhile decades of fruitless efforts to attract a significant share of the black vote would be quietly abandoned.)\n\nBut does this political strategy actually make any sense? Or are there far more effective and more plausible paths to continued Republican political success? Although almost totally marginalized within Republican establishment ranks, the anti-immigrationist wing of the conservative movement has maintained a vigorous intellectual presence on the Internet. Over the years, its flagship organ, the VDare.com website run by Peter Brimelow, a former National Review senior editor, has been scathing in its attacks on the so-called Rove Strategy, instead proposing a contrasting approach christened the Sailer Strategy, after Steve Sailer, its primary architect and leading promoter (who has himself frequently written for The American Conservative ). In essence, what Sailer proposes is the polar opposite of Rove's approach, which he often ridicules as being based on a mixture of (probably dishonest) wishful thinking and sheer innumeracy.\n\nConsider, for example, Rove's oft-repeated mantra that a Republican presidential candidate needs to win something approaching 40 percent of the national Hispanic vote or have no chance of reaching the White House. During the last several election cycles, Hispanic voters represented between 5 and 8 percent of the national total, so the difference between a candidate winning an outstanding 50 percent of that vote and one winning a miserable 30 percent would amount to little more than just a single percentage point of the popular total, completely insignificant based on recent history. Furthermore, presidential races are determined by the electoral college map rather than popular-vote totals, and the overwhelming majority of Hispanics are concentrated either in solidly blue states such as California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey, or solidly red ones such as Texas and Georgia, reducing their impact to almost nothing. Any Republican fearful of a loss in Texas or Democrat worried about carrying California would be facing a national defeat of epic proportions, in which Hispanic preferences would constitute a trivial component. Pursuing the Hispanic vote for its own sake seems a clear absurdity.\n\nEven more importantly, Sailer argues that once we throw overboard the restrictive blinkers of modern \"political correctness\" on racial matters, certain aspects of the real world become obvious. For nearly the last half-century, the political core of the Republican Party has been the white vote, and especially the votes of whites who live in the most heavily non-white states, notably the arc of the old Confederacy. The political realignment of Southern whites foreshadowed by the support that Barry Goldwater attracted in 1964 based on his opposition to the Civil Rights Act and that constituted George Wallace's white-backlash campaign of 1968 eventually became a central pillar of the dominant Reagan majority in the 1980s.\n\nIn many cases, this was even true outside the Deep South, as the blue-collar whites of Macomb County and other areas surrounding overwhelmingly black cities such as Detroit became the blue-collar Reagan Democrats who gave the GOP a near lock on the presidency. While the politics of racial polarization might be demonized in liberal intellectual circles, it served to elect vast numbers of Republicans to high and low office alike. George H.W. Bush's \"Willie Horton\" ad and Jesse Helms's \"White Hands\" ad have been endlessly vilified by the media, but they contributed to unexpected come-from-behind victories for the candidates willing to run them. And in politics, winning is the only metric of success.\n\nSailer suggests that a very similar approach would work equally well with regard to the hot-button issue of immigration and the rapidly growing Hispanic population, arguing that the votes of this group could be swamped by those of an angry white electorate energized along racial lines. He cites Pete Wilson's unexpected California gubernatorial reelection victory in 1994 as a perfect example. Deeply unpopular due to a severe statewide recession and desperately behind in the polls, Wilson hitched his candidacy to a harsh media campaign vilifying illegal immigrants, and although his Hispanic support plummeted, his white support soared to an equal extent, giving him a landslide victory in a race the pundits had written off and sweeping in a full slate of victorious down-ticket Republicans. Sailer's simple point is that individual white votes count just as much as Hispanic ones, and since there are vastly more of the former, attracting these with racially-charged campaign themes might prove very politically productive.\n\nAn additional fact noted by Sailer is that the racial demographics of a given region can be completely misleading from a political perspective. As mentioned earlier, Hispanics and other immigrants tend to be much younger than whites and much less likely to hold citizenship. Therefore, a state or region in which whites have become a numerical minority may still possess a large white supermajority among the electorate. Once again, today's California provides a telling example, with Hispanics and whites now being about equal in numbers according to the Census, but with whites still regularly casting three times as many votes on Election Day.\n\nThe Sailer analysis is ruthlessly logical. Whites are still the overwhelming majority of voters, and will remain so for many decades to come, so raising your share of the white vote by just a couple of points has much more political impact than huge shifts in the non-white vote. As whites become a smaller and smaller portion of the local population in more and more regions, they will naturally become ripe for political polarization based on appeals to their interests as whites. And if Republicans focus their campaigning on racially charged issues such as immigration and affirmative action, they will promote this polarization, gradually transforming the two national political parties into crude proxies for direct racial interests, effectively becoming the \"white party\" and the \"non-white party.\" Since white voters are still close to 80 percent of the national electorate, the \"white party\"-the Republicans-will end up controlling almost all political power and could enact whatever policies they desired, on both racial and non-racial issues.\n\n•   •   •\n\nMany might find this political scenario quite distasteful or unnerving, but that does not necessarily render it implausible. In fact, over the last couple of decades, this exact process has unfolded in many states across the Deep South, with elected white Democrats becoming an increasingly endangered species. Each election year, blacks overwhelmingly vote for the \"black party,\" whites overwhelmingly vote for the \"white party,\" and since whites are usually two-thirds or so of the electorate, they almost invariably win at the polls. Although Republican consultants and pundits make enormous efforts to camouflage or ignore this underlying racial reality, it exists nonetheless.\n\nBy contrast, appeals for white support based on racial cohesion would be almost total nonstarters in 95 percent white Vermont or New Hampshire, or in many other states of the North in which the local demographics still approximate those of the country that overwhelmingly supported the Civil Rights legislation of the 1960s. But today's national white percentages are much closer to those of 1960s Alabama and Mississippi, where whites fought that legislation tooth and nail on racial grounds. And as the nation's overall demography continues its inexorable slide from that of Vermont to that of Mississippi, will white politics move in that same direction, especially if given a push?\n\nNow I think a strong case can be made that such a process of deliberate racial polarization in American politics might have numerous adverse consequences for the future well-being of our country, sharply divided as it would become between hostile white and non-white political blocs of roughly equal size. But given the extremely utilitarian mentality of those who practice electoral politics for a living, the more important question we should explore is whether it would actually work , purely on the political level. Might this strategy of racial polarization be applicable across the country as a whole?\n\nNon-Whites and Blacks\n\nConsider an interesting datapoint. It is certainly true that the over the last century those states with the smallest white majorities have generally had names like Mississippi, South Carolina, and Alabama, and these have exhibited a very distinctive brand of white politics and race relations. But the least white state of all has actually projected a very different cultural image.\n\nWhites were a minority in Hawaii at the time of statehood and have always been so, with the relative numbers of whites and Asians shifting somewhat based upon the various flows of migrants. Furthermore, the original white colonists and plantation elites historically had had a quite conflicted relationship both with the Native Hawaiian population whose leadership they supplanted and also with the large numbers of Japanese, Chinese, and other Asian workers originally imported as impoverished plantation laborers.\n\nYet although the local Republican Party has generally skewed toward the 25 percent of the population that is white, while the Democrats have been more popular among the majority Asians, the state's reputation has overwhelmingly been one of easygoing race relations, a high degree of intermarriage, and a complete lack of vicious political conflict. Ideologically, Hawaii's white minority seems to think and vote much more like the racially liberal residents of 95 percent white Vermont than as members of a racially polarized minority bloc, locked in endless political struggle with its non-white opponents.\n\nPerhaps Hawaii is just a unique case, being a chain of small tropical islands located thousands of miles off the mainland and heavily dependent upon tourism for its economy. But there is an additional example. After Hawaii, the state with the next lowest white percentage throughout most of the 20th century was New Mexico, with the number of whites fluctuating at around half the total depending upon the ebbs and flows of the white and Hispanic populations, before eventually falling to 40 percent in 2010.\n\nAnd although New Mexico hardly possesses Hawaii's enormously positive social image-it is mostly rural with a small economy-it has also never developed the reputation of being a boiling racial cauldron, with whites and Hispanics locked in a bitter battle for power. Mention \"New Mexico\" and the popular images that spring to mind probably revolve around UFOs, vistas of great natural beauty, and government research laboratories, not longstanding racial conflict.\n\nThese examples lead to the suspicion that the history of bitter racial politics across most of the Deep South may represent less a conflict of white vs. non-white than one of white vs. black, and this seems quite plausible. After all, slavery and its legacy have for centuries constituted the deepest wound in American society, provoking a bloody Civil War which cost the lives of almost one third of all white Southern men of military age. The history of black/white racial relations is arguably the single most significant element in American political history, so we should hardly be surprised if it continues to heavily influence the politics of numerous states and cities, including those outside the South.\n\nBy contrast, although relations between whites and various other groups-Asians, Hispanics, and American Indians-have sometimes been hostile or even violent, these conflicts have never been nearly as long nor intense and are more like the often contentious relationships between various white ethnic groups. As our schoolbooks endlessly emphasize, black/white relations do indeed constitute a unique aspect of American history.\n\n•   •   •\n\nThese alternate hypotheses about the underlying sources of white political behavior may be explored empirically by examining the electoral data across the 50 states. Like it or not, today's Republican Party does indeed constitute the \"white party,\" drawing almost all of its national votes from whites, while the Democratic Party serves as the \"mixed party,\" with roughly comparable support from whites and non-whites. Therefore, white support for Republicans, particularly at the national level, may serve as a reasonable proxy for a state's apparent degree of \"white racial consciousness,\" whether implicit or explicit.\n\nUnder the \"Sailer Hypothesis,\" white alignment with the Republicans should be heavily influenced by the white share of the population, with the residents of lily-white states exhibiting little racial consciousness, while those living in states in which whites have slender or non-existent majorities would tilt much more heavily Republican. A second possibility to consider might be called the \"Hispanic Hypothesis,\" in which the heavy influx of Hispanic immigrants, both legal and illegal, pushes whites toward the harder-line Republicans; since the vast majority of today's Hispanics come from a relatively recent immigrant background, a state's overall Hispanic population can be used as a good approximation for this independent variable. Finally, there is the \"Black Hypothesis,\" in which the long history of black/white racial conflict is assumed to be the primary factor, and the percentage of blacks in the local population is what generally influences white political behavior.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity and to minimize the confounding impact of local political issues and personalities, the easiest output variable to examine would be the percentage of the white vote that supported the Republican presidential ticket over the last 20 years. On a population-weighted basis, the correlation results for elections from 1992 through 2008 across the 50 states are as shown in the chart below.\n\nThe results seem conclusive. The correlations between the Hispanic percentage of each state and white voter preferences are approximately zero for all presidential elections, implying that the presence of large Hispanic populations appears to have virtually no impact upon white political alignment, either one way or the other.\n\nBy contrast, the evidence for apparent black/white racial conflict being the driving force that prompts whites to vote Republican seems very strong: the correlations between the size of the black population and the degree of white GOP support range from 0.43 to 0.70, with a mean of 0.55, being both quite substantial and very consistent over time.\n\nThe data regarding the \"Sailer Hypothesis\" is bit more interesting, with the correlations between a state's overall non-white percentage and white Republican alignment being small but noticeable, ranging between 0.14 and 0.31, with a mean of 0.20.  However, we must remember that a considerable fraction of America's non-whites are blacks, with the ratio declining from around half in 1992 to about one-third by 2008, and obviously the strong black correlations impact the non-white result. In fact, the Sailer Hypothesis curve closely tracks the weighted average of the Hispanic and Black Hypothesis curves, the difference being mostly due to America's small but growing Asian population. Thus, any \"Sailer Effect\" in white voting patterns appears almost entirely due to the black portion of the non-white population and is therefore merely a statistical artifact.\n\n•   •   •\n\nIn many respects, this conclusion merely constitutes a quantitative confirmation of the conventional political wisdom, which stretches back for many decades. For example, in the aftermath of the successful Reagan Revolution of the 1980s, prominent journalists Thomas and Mary Edsall published the widely praised Chain Reaction , which emphasized the underlying racial factors prompting America's political realignment, and several similar books appeared around the same time, notably Peter Brown's Minority Party . Numerous other authors had earlier made the same general point about the politics of the \"white backlash\" vote in the 1960s and 1970s, the era of urban unrest and forced busing.\n\nIn recent years, the Republican Party has grown quite embarrassed over these roots of its modern political rise and has therefore made considerable efforts to downplay such underlying racial factors relative to more innocuous issues such as support for low taxes or small government or patriotism or even traditional religious values, and this sustained effort to rewrite history partly accounts for much current amnesia. But the data speaks for itself.\n\nThere is another, more subtle reason why so many of America's political elites and pundits tend to miss the clear signs of this obvious racial relationship, and it becomes apparent when we examine the scatterplot distribution of these election results for the most recent 2008 presidential vote, including the 50 states and also the District of Columbia. (Scatterplots for the previous presidential elections look very similar.) The results for the individual states mostly follow the sort of distribution we would expect for a strongly correlated result, but there is one huge exception: white voting patterns in D.C. constitute an enormously strong outlier. By a wide margin D.C. is simultaneously more heavily black than any state while also having whites who are the most liberal and Democratic in their voting behavior.\n\nD.C.'s population is much smaller than that of nearly all states, so including it in our weighted correlation calculation would have only slightly shifted the results. But in the real world of today's centralized political culture, the world of politicians and media pundits and political journalists, D.C. ranks as a colossus in mind share, playing a huge role in shaping ideological perceptions and therefore carrying a weight probably greater than that of California or Texas, or perhaps even both combined. And under such a mind-share weighting, that single city filled with a population consisting almost entirely of blacks and very liberal whites serves to substantially mask elite perceptions of the stark racial dynamics that influence political ideologies almost everywhere else in the country.\n\nAn Anti-Immigration Backlash\n\nLet us consider the political implications of these striking results. Since the large-scale presence of non-black non-whites-primarily Hispanic and Asian immigrant groups-does not seem to produce much white political cohesion along racial lines, the continued growth of these populations can hardly represent a potential boon for the Republican Party. Meanwhile, harsh Republican rhetoric or policies that target these groups would naturally tend to drive them into the arms of the Democrats. Under such a scenario, the GOP loses millions of non-white votes without gaining any white votes in exchange, resulting in political disaster.\n\nA perfect example of this danger may be found in the recent political history of California, whose huge size and heavily immigrant population render it a useful testbed for the nation as a whole. During the four decades from 1950 to 1990, California supported the Republican presidential ticket almost without fail, going Democratic only during Lyndon Johnson's unprecedented 1964 landslide. The state was considered as solidly Republican as Wyoming or Idaho, and the huge number of electoral votes it carried combined with the enormous expense of contesting them established it as the anchor of the GOP presidential strategy, leading to the widespread notion of a Republican \"lock\" on the White House.\n\nAlthough Hispanic and Asian numbers had been growing steadily for years, their support for Republicans had been growing as well, and by the early 1990s, a GOP candidate could regularly expect to receive around one-third or more of the Hispanic vote and half that of the Asian. For example, Pete Wilson's narrow 1990 gubernatorial victory over Dianne Feinstein, which significantly relied upon his criticism of \"racial quotas,\" was achieved with 53 percent of the white vote, 47 percent of the Hispanic vote, and 58 percent of the Asian vote according to the prestigious California Field Poll used by the New York Times , though others placed his ethnic totals lower.\n\nBut all of this permanently changed following Wilson's harsh 1994 reelection campaign, whose television ads relentlessly scapegoated Hispanic immigrants for the state's terrible economic woes. Although his words were carefully chosen in lawyerly fashion to distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, his message was perceived very differently, and his loudest grassroots activist supporters certainly made no such distinction. Moreover, the resounding California Republican landslide that resulted soon emboldened the newly established Republican majorities in the U.S. House and Senate to focus on passing anti-immigration legislation, which thus placed legal Asian immigrants in the same political crosshairs.\n\nAs a direct consequence, Republican support sharply dropped among Hispanics and Asians and has never really recovered. Moreover, the immigration battle frightened and energized many traditionally apolitical Hispanics into finally naturalizing and registering, and during the 15 years that followed, their share of the state vote more than doubled to 22 percent, severely compounding the blow to Republican prospects.\n\nThe consequence was that gigantic California-almost as populous as Texas and New York combined-suddenly switched from being the strong anchor of every Republican national campaign to being the equally strong anchor of every Democratic one. In the years that followed, the large GOP congressional delegation was decimated and the powerful state Republican Party, which had once propelled Nixon and Reagan to national leadership, was reduced to near irrelevance.\n\nConsider the interesting case of Howard Ahmanson, long one of California's wealthiest politically-active Evangelical Christians and during the early 1990s routinely described by the media as a central pillar of the Christian Right within the Republican Party. In a prescient 1993 letter to Commentary , he warned of the rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiment in conservative circles and expressed a concern that Republicans would \"doom themselves\" if they drove away these socially conservative voters, perhaps losing them for generations, just as previous Republicans had done with Italian and Irish immigrants a century earlier. The California Republicans completely ignored his warning, with the political consequences already noted.\n\nIn Ahmanson's opinion, today's California GOP has shrunk to the point where it now represents only the most dogmatically taxophobic elements of the state. Meanwhile, the Democrats have expanded so much that they usually incorporate both sides of almost every political divide: business and labor, whites and non-whites, the rich and the poor, liberals and conservatives. This inclusiveness certainly extends to the staunchest socially conservative voters, since it was the overwhelming support of California non-whites that defeated gay marriage at the ballot box in 2008. And these days Howard Ahmanson is a registered Democrat.\n\nThere is no logical contradiction between the powerful backlash of California whites against immigrants 20 years ago and the apparent lack of such political sentiments today. In the early 1990s, the state's demographics had just undergone a period of very rapid change, and middle-class whites were naturally fearful and alarmed about the consequences of these changes and the possible behavior of so many millions of new immigrants from such different backgrounds, especially in the immediate aftermath of the deadly Rodney King riots. This left them easy targets for political demagoguery. But after a few years had gone by, most whites concluded that their new neighbors seemed like pretty reasonable people, not too different from themselves, and racial concerns dropped to the lower levels of most public opinion surveys, usually ranking below jobs, housing, healthcare, and sometimes even traffic.\n\nSimilarly, most Hispanic and Asian newcomers have developed perfectly amicable relations with their white counterparts, but still remain deeply suspicious of the Republican Party, whose leaders had spent several years defaming and attacking them. Such ethnic suspicions might occasionally be overcome by a particularly unusual Republican candidate, as we saw in the case of worldwide film superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger-himself a heavily-accented foreign immigrant-who managed to win a couple of landslide victories. But they proved enormous barriers to more typical Republican candidates, who began each statewide campaign with what amounted to an automatic ten or 15-point deficit at the polls and almost invariably lost as a result.\n\nThis can be seen in the details of the most recent California election cycle. As the only statewide Republican officeholder and a wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner was assumed to have a lock on his party's gubernatorial nomination and naturally attracted the support of all major segments of the GOP apparatus. But then former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, an utter political neophyte but with a billion-dollar fortune, decided to enter the race and immediately became the darling of the party's mercenary establishment, given the bottomless funds she promised to spend on her campaign. Outmatched financially, Poizner was forced to refocus on right-wing primary voters, and as a highly opportunistic fellow, he decided to ride the national tidal wave of anti-immigration fears then sweeping across the country and make it the centerpiece of his campaign, eventually spending $25 million of his own money on the effort.\n\nThe result was that he lost the primary by 40 points . When you run as an immigration hard-liner, spend $25 million on your race, and lose by 40 points among the hard-core conservatives who dominate Republican primaries, you're clearly selling the dog food that dogs just won't eat. These days, anti-immigration candidacies in California possess about as much resonance as anti-papist candidacies in Massachusetts.\n\nAfterwards, Whitman went on to spend an astonishing $180 million in her campaign, nearly all of it her own money, and in a year featuring an enormous national backlash against career politicians lost in a landslide to former Governor Jerry Brown, who had almost continuously been an elected official or a political candidate for the previous 45 years. Meanwhile, the best nationwide year for Republicans in two decades saw their California party lose every statewide race, mostly by wide margins. Such is the dismal political legacy that Pete Wilson bequeathed to his most unfortunate local successors.\n\n•   •   •\n\nNow consider the likely political future of a state such as Arizona, ground zero of the most recent national anti-immigrant backlash by nervous whites. A severe recession and rapidly changing demographics had alarmed Arizona voters, many of them elderly retirees from elsewhere, leaving them vulnerable to wild rumors of a huge immigrant crime wave, including beheadings and kidnappings, almost all of which was complete nonsense. As a result, harsh anti-immigrant measures were passed into law, and their mostly Republican supporters won sweeping victories among an electorate that is today roughly 80 percent white.\n\nBut buried near the bottom of a single one of the innumerable New York Times articles analyzing Arizona politics was the seemingly minor and irrelevant fact that almost half of all Arizona schoolchildren are now Hispanic. Meanwhile, according to Census data, over 80 percent of Arizonans aged 65 or older are white. A decade or more from now it seems likely that Arizona whites and Hispanics will enjoy perfectly good relations, and the former will have long since forgotten their current \"immigrant scare.\" But the latter will still remember it, and the once mighty Arizona Republican Party will be set on the road to oblivion.\n\nEven in a rock-solid Deep South Republican state like Georgia, Hispanics have now grown into a remarkable 10 percent of the population, up from almost nothing in the early 1990s, and represent an even larger share of younger Georgians. So unless the local Republican Party can somehow greatly enhance its appeal to the 30 percent of Georgians who are black, the current wave of anti-immigrant legislation may prove highly problematical ten or 20 years down the road.\n\nThis pattern highlights a central dilemma faced by today's Republican leadership. In states or regions experiencing heavy waves of non-white immigration, the party's white conservative base tends to grow alarmed, and any particular spark-an economic downturn, a brutal crime widely publicized by the media-can lead to an explosion of racial hostility. At that point, thoughtful Republican candidates are faced with the choice of either following this populist appeal to immediate victory, often attracting the crossover support of large numbers of Democratic or independent voters in the process, or gritting their teeth and opposing it.\n\nIf they take the former approach, temporary electoral victories, no matter how sweeping, almost invariably become long-term disasters in political alignment. But if they take the latter stance, they sacrifice the sort of immediate opportunities that tend to figure very high in the minds of most politicians, and even risk losing primaries to harder-line rivals with shorter horizons or fewer scruples.\n\nSince the Democratic Party is already so heavily influenced at the national level by non-white voters and pro-immigrant activists, local Democrats possess little leeway on this sort of issue, and any candidates who might consider adopting a populist anti-immigrant platform would quickly find themselves blacklisted by the party leadership, quite possibly becoming Republicans at the end of a bitter ideological divorce.\n\nBut when we consider the case of California and the numerous other states that now appear to be following along that same demographic trajectory, certainly including the Republican anchor state of Texas in which whites recently became a minority, today's high levels of immigration seem to be forcing the Republicans into a very difficult strategic position, not necessarily over the next five or six years, but over the next ten or 20. Is there any way they can somehow escape this racial trap, perhaps by curtailing immigration? Moreover, can such a proposal be justified on anything other than political grounds?\n\nOur Population Ponzi Scheme\n\nThis obviously leads into the endlessly contentious topic of immigration, and whether or not today's high levels provide benefits that outweigh their problems. There are few subjects so likely to provoke angry emotions in political circles, as well as sweeping ideological justifications, personal vilifications, and factual claims that have no basis in reality. Furthermore, this is one issue in which individuals quite frequently feel compelled to take one position publicly while very clearly holding the opposite belief in private; and such dishonesty seems to occur in both directions of the debate.\n\nMany of the leading factors driving populist opposition to immigration, such as perceptions of high crime rates or anti-white ethnic hostility, seem completely incorrect. As I demonstrated in a 2010 article, all available evidence indicates that most immigrant groups tend to have approximately the same crime rates as white Americans of a similar age, or perhaps even a bit lower. Similarly, there is overwhelming evidence that today's immigrants want to learn English, gain productive employment, assimilate into our society, and generally become \"good Americans\" at least as much as did their European counterparts of a century ago.\n\nThe notion that masses of non-white immigrants, legal or not, will turn our cities into violent battlefields or support ethnic separatist movements which shatter national unity are total absurdities, and the people who believe such claims are fools. And as we have seen above from the accumulated voting data of the last couple of decades, after a brief transition period, whites and non-white immigrant groups seem to coexist perfectly well, or at least as well as did the various white ethnic groups on the East Coast 50 or 60 years ago.\n\nHowever, the fact does remain that America's current immigration levels are extremely high, not merely relative to the 40-year pause between 1925 and 1965, but even relative to the previous peak reached during the early years of the 20th century. Over the last decade, the flow of immigrants has often hit a million or more per year, a rate that would have seemed almost unimaginable during the immigration controversy of the early 1990s, when Peter Brimelow warned of America becoming an \"Alien Nation\" in his alarmist book of that title. The number of foreign-born Americans has doubled in the last 20 years, while almost a quarter of all American children today have at least one foreign-born parent, nearly matching the level reached during the absolute height of European immigration a century ago.\n\nThe result of all this has been a quite remarkable rate of national population growth. During the early 1970s, when environmental concerns, such as depletion of resources and overpopulation, became leading causes among the liberal intelligentsia, America's population was a little over 200 million, and growth was rapidly diminishing, with birth rates falling to replacement levels following the end of the postwar Baby Boom. But soon after those activists declared victory and moved on to new and varied ideological causes, population growth-driven almost entirely by immigrants and their children-suddenly started up again, with numbers reaching unprecedented levels: 250 million in 1990, 275 million in 2000, and well over 300 million today. A couple of years ago, urban-development expert Joel Kotkin published The Next Hundred Million , a book in which he trumpeted the likely fact that the American population would reach 400 million within about 30 years. Does an eventual billion inhabitants of the 50 states now seem utterly impossible?\n\nSuch rapid and massive population growth is found nowhere else in the developed world and is rare even among the more successful developing countries. The European nations, Japan, and China are all approximately stable in their populations, and in most cases are projected to undergo some decline in the near future. Even crowded Mexico, long the leading source of anti-immigrationist dystopian nightmares, saw total fertility rates drop to replacement levels a few years ago, as increasing levels of affluence and education permeated the population.\n\nLarge and growing populations certainly do produce national benefits as well as burdens, and America's wide-open interior spaces still provide a much lower overall population density than small and crowded European countries. But if our national population trends are so wildly discordant with those of almost all our international peers, perhaps we should at least question them.\n\n•   •   •\n\nThere are obvious reasons for this curious lack of national debate. The solvency of our Social Security system is buttressed by such rapid population growth, which increases the number of current workers relative to retirees. The housing sector-which during the peak of the bubble became America's largest industry-is heavily dependent upon population growth to boost demand. But support for immigration based on these arguments amounts to an endorsement of Ponzi schemes in which growth must continue indefinitely in order to maintain the same benefits. And as we have seen in the recent past, Ponzi schemes eventually collapse, usually leaving devastation in their wake.\n\nMeanwhile, consider the strange continued silence of the once vocal environmentalist groups, for whom massive housing growth and endless suburban sprawl are hardly cherished dreams. I strongly suspect that the difference between their energetic criticism a generation or so ago and their quiescence today centers on the matter of race: back then, America's population growth was driven almost entirely by the white birthrate, while today non-white immigration and the children of such immigrants are the overwhelming source. And these days in American society, very few individuals-least of all the sort of affluent liberals who focus on the environment-care to risk being branded with a \"Scarlet R\".\n\nAs a prime example of this dynamic, consider the case of the Sierra Club, one of America's oldest and largest environmental groups, which quite naturally had always made population growth one of its major concerns. During the mid-1990s, a wealthy California environmentalist, David Gelbaum, himself the grandson of Jewish immigrants from Europe and with a Mexican-American wife, grew outraged over the nasty racial tone of the political battle unleashed by Pete Wilson and Proposition 187 and privately pledged $100 million to the Sierra Club on the condition that it never turn anti-immigration. This requirement was accepted, permanently silencing that organization.\n\nEven without such explicit inducements, we should hardly be surprised that liberal, cosmopolitan, upper middle class environmentalists would be extremely uncomfortable enlisting in a political cause typically spearheaded by the sort of loud right-wing populists whom they personally detest as \"racist rabble.\" Sometimes strange bedfellows do find it extremely difficult to share the same bed.\n\nMeanwhile, many other powerful lobbies within our political system derive important real or perceived benefits from endless population growth. The massive inflow of often impoverished and desperate immigrants tends to weaken unions and drive down working-class wages, thereby increasing corporate profits, a slice of which is then rebated back to the campaign accounts of the elected officials who maintain such policies. Some of the more expansively-minded neoconservatives feel that if America must establish a hegemonic world empire, it necessarily requires a vast population to do so, especially given their expectation of an inevitable conflict with China. Particular proposals from some of these individuals carry strong echoes of the decaying Late Roman Empire, with Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, having suggested that we should offer automatic American citizenship to any foreigner willing to enlist in the U.S. military.\n\nBut if we take a step back and ask ourselves to consider the current outcome of all these interlocked policies, we discover a very sorry situation. The massive immigration of the last couple of decades is certainly not the sole or even the leading cause, but it is an important contributing factor. Endless foreign wars, partly made possible by the availability of pliant immigrant cannon fodder, have ruined America's worldwide reputation and its finances. A gigantic housing bubble, inflated by heavy immigration-driven population growth, has collapsed, wrecking the American economy and endangering our financial system. And the extremes of American wealth and poverty have reached levels never previously seen in our society.\n\nThis last point is perhaps the most significant, but also the least often articulated, given that both political parties are largely funded by the same financial interests.\n\nThe Politics of Rich and Poor\n\nIn recent decades, American society has undergone an almost unprecedented concentration of wealth, now reaching the point at which the top 1 percent possess as much net wealth as the bottom 90-95 percent. This same top 1 percent received over 80 percent of the total increase in American personal income between 1980 and 2005, and that trend has almost certainly accelerated since then. Late last year New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof sounded the alarm that America might soon reach the extremes of wealth and poverty found in the notoriously polarized societies of Argentina and the \"banana republics\" of Latin America, then needed to retract that claim when he discovered that we had already long since passed most of those countries in that regard. And in a widely discussed Vanity Fair article, Economics Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz characterized today's America as being a country \"Of the One Percent, By the One Percent, and For the One Percent.\" This state of affairs is clearly not beneficial to the less wealthy 99 percent of our society, but he also pointed out that the obvious potential for social instability should deeply concern the more thoughtful members of the One Percent themselves.\n\nFurthermore, much of this economic decline has been absolute rather than merely relative. Adjusted for inflation, median personal income has been stagnant for the past 40 years, and a substantial fraction of the population has seen a sharp drop in its standard of living, a situation almost without precedent in American history. Meanwhile, the costs of numerous budget items such as healthcare or higher education have risen very rapidly, thereby forcing more and more families into what Paul Krugman has characterized as a system of permanent \"debt peonage\" or what Warren Buffett has similarly described as a \"sharecropper's society.\" As a result, nearly a quarter of American households have zero to negative net worth, and a single unexpected illness or economic setback can push them to the brink of destitution.\n\nTo some extent, this long stagnation in financial well-being has been masked by the material benefits derived from the exponentially growing power of our electronic technologies and also by the false sense of wealth temporarily provided by the housing bubble. But with the collapse of the latter, many Americans are finally discovering just how poor they really have become. And in many respects, this economic situation seems far worse in America than in most of the other wealthy countries we have long regarded as our economic peers, so it cannot simply be blamed upon problems of technological displacement or the rise of China or global free trade.\n\nIt is perhaps not entirely coincidental that this 40 year period of economic stagnation for most Americans coincides exactly with 40 years of rapidly rising immigration levels. After all, the concept that a huge influx of eager workers would tend to benefit Capital at the expense of Labor is hardly astonishing, nor does it require years of academic research into the intricacies of economic theory.\n\nConsider, for example, the case of self-educated union activist Cesar Chavez, a liberal icon of the 1960s who today ranks as the top Latino figure in America's progressive pantheon. During nearly his entire career, Chavez stood as a vigorous opponent of immigration, especially of the undocumented variety, repeatedly denouncing the failure of the government to enforce its immigration laws due to the pervasive influence of the business lobby and even occasionally organizing vigilante patrols at the Mexican border. Indeed, the Minutemen border activists of a few years back were merely following in Chavez's footsteps and would have had every historical right to have named their organization the \"Cesar Chavez Brigade.\" I think a good case can be made that during his own era Chavez ranked as America's foremost anti-immigration activist.\n\nBut today's union leaders have grown almost completely silent on the obvious impact that large increases in the supply of labor have on the economic well-being of ordinary workers. A crucial explanation is that for reasons of citizenship and language, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are employed in the private sector, particularly the small-scale non-unionized private sector. Meanwhile, population growth tends to increase the need for teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other government employees, thereby benefiting the powerful public-sector unions that today completely dominate the labor movement.\n\n•   •   •\n\nThis relates to another perfectly valid criticism raised by anti-immigration activists, namely that the net fiscal impact of many immigrants is substantially negative. The notion that large numbers of immigrants and their families subsist on welfare or that Mexican immigrant mothers often have five or ten children is sheer nonsense. Immigrants actually have very high labor force participation rates and relatively low rates of welfare dependency, while the vast majority of their families stop at two or three children, a number somewhat higher than that of today's native-born whites but really no different from the typical American family during the hallowed 1950s. And since, as mentioned earlier, immigrant crime rates are about average, there is no large additional cost for police or prisons.\n\nThe fiscal difficulty lies not on the expenditure side but on the tax side. Most immigrants, especially illegal ones, work at relatively low paid jobs, and the various taxes they pay simply cannot cover their share of the (extremely inflated) costs of America's governmental structure, notably schooling. Furthermore, for exactly this same reason of relative poverty, they receive a disproportionate share of those government programs aimed at benefiting the working poor, ranging from tax credits to food stamps to rental subsidies. Immigration critics have persuasively argued that the current system amounts to the classic case of economic special interests managing to privatize profits while socializing costs, wherein immigrant employers receive the full benefits of the labor done by their low-wage workforce while pushing many of the costs-including explicit income subsidies-onto the taxpayers. Obviously, all these same factors are equally true for non-immigrant Americans who fall into the category of working-poor, but the large continuing inflow of low-wage workers greatly exacerbates this basic fiscal problem.\n\nImmigration and the Political Trap\n\nBut even if we conclude that our high immigration levels represent a serious national problem, is there any possible solution? The political reality is that both major parties are enormously dependent upon the business interests that greatly benefit from the current system and are also dominated by disparate ideologies-libertarian open-borders and multicultural open-borders-whose positions tend to coincide on this issue.\n\nAs an extreme example of the bizarre ideological views of our current political elites, consider a less-publicized element of the immigration reform plan that President George W. Bush trumpeted during his 2004 reelection campaign. This provision would have allowed any foreigner anywhere in the world to legally immigrate to America if he accepted a minimum-wage job that no American were willing to fill, an utterly insane proposal which would have effectively transformed America's minimum wage into its maximum wage. Naturally his opponent, Sen. John Kerry, saw absolutely nothing wrong with this idea, though he did criticize various other aspects of Bush's immigration plan as being somewhat mean-spirited.\n\nFurthermore, while significant Democratic support for curtailing immigration appears almost unthinkable given the party's internal dynamics, a committed Republican effort-unlikely though it might be-would seem doomed to failure due to the racial aspects of the issue. Republicans would immediately be subjected to withering Democratic attacks in the media-whether or not these were fair or sincere-and as a result would lose much of whatever remaining non-white political support they still retained, while the GOP plan would never have the slightest chance of gaining majority support in Congress, let alone a filibuster-proof majority. The Republicans would suffer massive political damage without any possibility of achieving legislative success, and knowing that, would never undertake the effort. So they don't.\n\nAfter all, even strictly enforcing existing immigration laws is almost impossible in our current political and media climate. Although the press has recently highlighted the hundreds of thousands of undocumented residents annually deported under the Obama administration-and this has sparked a sharp political backlash among his pro-immigrant supporters-such a number is negligible compared to the estimated total of 11 million or so. Only the most utterly egregious employers of those workers have ever paid serious penalties, and the dollars involved are usually trivial compared to the economic benefits of ignoring the law. In almost all cases, \"employer sanctions\" have amounted to just a (small) cost of doing business. When both worker and employer have a strong mutual interest in evading a law, enforcement becomes very difficult and cumbersome, just as we have seen in the case of our endlessly violated drug laws.\n\nEven so, attacking the employment side of the equation remains the most effective approach. Virtually all immigrants come here for jobs, so eliminating government benefits would merely serve to further immiserate millions of families, who would remain in this country regardless. Having immigration agents conduct random sweeps through ethnic neighborhoods would engender enormous fear and anger and also deter immigrants from reporting crimes, while constituting a massive violation of traditional civil liberties. Even building a fence and doubling the border-patrol would probably have just a small impact across such an enormously long border, not least because an estimated one-half of all illegal immigrants enter the country legally and then overstay their visas. If the magnetic appeal of the American job market could somehow be reduced or eliminated, such ancillary measures might prove useful, but if the jobs remain, the immigrants will remain here as well.\n\nEscaping the Low-Wage Society\n\nSo we are faced with several apparently insoluble and reinforcing dilemmas. Passing legislation to curtail immigration seems a political non-starter with both parties, and enforcing such legislation even if passed is equally unlikely. Yet as an almost inevitable consequence of the current system, the bulk of the American population-including the vast majority of immigrants and their children-falls deeper and deeper into economic misery, while government finances steadily deteriorate, leading our country to a looming calamity whose outcome appears both dire and quite difficult to predict. Over the last century, the political consequences of a largely impoverished middle class and a bankrupt government-whether in Latin America or in Central Europe-have often been very unfortunate.\n\nBy contrast, the sharp constriction in the labor supply resulting from steep reductions in additional immigration would dramatically boost worker wages, especially at the low end, with current immigrants themselves being among the greatest beneficiaries. An increase of a couple of dollars per hour or more could make huge improvements in the difficult existence of the working poor, perhaps allowing them to exit the debt treadmill and stand a better chance of eventually rising into a revitalized middle class. Admittedly, corporate profits might suffer a little and some businesses at the lowest end might disappear; but corporate profits are already doing quite nicely these days, and it makes no sense for developed countries to desperately compete with the impoverished Third World for jobs that are only viable under Third World salaries. Immigration restrictions that raised working-class wages by a couple of dollars an hour would also do wonders for the fiscal health of the Social Security system and government finances in general.\n\nBut perhaps the obvious escape from this seemingly inescapable political trap is as simple as merely reversing the direction of cause and effect. Consider the consequences of a very substantial rise in the national minimum wage, perhaps to $10 or more likely $12 per hour.\n\n•   •   •\n\nThe automatic rejoinder to proposals for hiking the minimum wage is that \"jobs will be lost.\" But in today's America a huge fraction of jobs at or near the minimum wage are held by immigrants, often illegal ones. Eliminating those jobs is a central goal of the plan, a feature not a bug.\n\nLet us explore the likely implications of this simple proposal. The analysis that follows should be regarded as impressionistic and plausible rather than based on any sort of rigorous and detailed research. It is intended to raise possibilities rather than provide answers. Also, let us assume for the moment that these higher wage requirements would be very strictly enforced.\n\nFirst, the vast majority of workers in America's surviving manufacturing sector-whether in unionized Seattle or non-union South Carolina-already earn far more than the existing minimum wage, so their employers would hardly be affected, resulting in almost no impact on our international competitiveness. The same would be true for government employees, resulting in negligible cost to the taxpayer.\n\nBy contrast, the bulk of the low-wage jobs affected fall into the category of domestic non-tradeable service-sector jobs, which cannot be replaced by overseas workers. Many of these jobs would disappear, but a substantial fraction would remain viable at the higher wage level, with employers either raising prices or trimming profits or more likely a mixture of both. Perhaps consumers would pay 3 percent more for Wal-Mart goods or an extra dime for a McDonald's hamburger, but most of these jobs would still exist and the price changes would be small compared to ongoing fluctuations due to commodity prices, international exchange rates, or Chinese production costs.\n\nMeanwhile, many millions of low-wage workers would see an immediate 20 percent or 30 percent boost in their take-home pay, producing a large increase in general economic activity, not to mention personal well-being. We must bear in mind that an increase in the hourly minimum wage from the current federal level of $7.25 to (say) $12.00 would also have secondary, smaller ripple effects, boosting wages already above that level as well, perhaps even reaching workers earning as much as $15 per hour.\n\nThe likely impact upon immigrant workers, whether legal or illegal, would be quite varied. Those most recently arrived, especially illegal ones with weak language or job skills, would probably lose their jobs, especially since many of these individuals are already forced to work (illegally) for sub-minimum wages. However, workers who have been here for some years and acquired reasonably good language and job skills and who had demonstrated their reliability over time would probably be kept on, even if their employer needed to boost their pay by a dollar or two an hour.\n\nThus, the force of the policy would fall overwhelmingly on those immigrants who possessed the weakest ties to American society and still retained the strongest links to their country of origin. By contrast, those immigrants-legal or otherwise-who had lived here for some years and therefore had gradually become part of the community would mostly emerge unscathed, probably receiving a very welcome boost to their family income. Some anti-immigration activists might find this prospect extremely distasteful, but half- or two-thirds of a loaf is better than none.\n\nMoreover, although this wage structure would tend to \"grandfather\" a considerable fraction of existing illegal immigrants, it would constitute a very formidable barrier to future ones. Paying $12 per hour might be reasonable for a reliable employee who had worked with you for several years, but would be much harder to justify for an impoverished new arrival speaking minimal English and with no track record. To a large extent, the undocumented job window in America would have permanently slammed shut.\n\nIn effect, a much higher minimum wage serves to remove the lowest rungs in the employment ladder, thus preventing newly arrived immigrants from gaining their initial foothold in the economy. As a natural consequence, these rungs would also disappear for the bottom-most American workers, such as youths seeking their first jobs or the least skilled in our society. But over the last few decades, these groups have already been largely displaced in the private-sector job market by immigrants, especially illegal ones. Whereas 40 years ago, teenagers and blacks tended to mow lawns and work as janitors, in most parts of the country these days, such jobs are now held by recent arrivals from south of the border. So the net loss of opportunity to Americans would not be large.\n\nFurthermore, recently arrived illegal workers must very quickly find employment if they hope to cover their living expenses and remain here rather than being forced to return home instead. But first-time American job-seekers are already living with their families and anyway have no other home to draw them away, and consequently could spend months seeking an available job. Thus, a higher minimum wage would tend to disproportionately impact new immigrants rather than their American-born competitors.\n\n•   •   •\n\nThe enforcement of these wage provisions would be quite easy compared with the complex web of current government requirements and restrictions. It is possible for business owners to claim they were \"fooled\" by obviously fraudulent legal documents or that they somehow neglected to run the confusing electronic background checks on their new temporary dishwasher. But it is very difficult for anyone to claim he \"forgot\" to pay his workers the legally mandated minimum wage. Furthermore, the former situation constitutes something of a \"victimless crime\" and usually arouses considerable sympathy among immigrant-rights advocates and within ethnic communities; but the latter would universally be seen as the case of a greedy boss who refused to pay his workers the money they were legally due and would attract no sympathy from the media, the police, juries, or anyone else.\n\nVery stiff penalties, including mandatory prison terms, could assure near absolute compliance. Virtually no employer would be foolish enough to attempt to save a few hundred dollars a month in wages paid at the risk of a five-year prison sentence, especially since the workers he was cheating would immediately acquire enormous bargaining leverage over him by threatening to report his behavior to the police.\n\nThe proposed change would simply be in the rate of the minimum wage, rather than in the structure of the law, so certain relatively small modification and exceptions, such as including estimated tips for some restaurant employees, might be maintained, so long as these did not expand as a means of circumventing the statute.\n\nDepending upon the state, the current American minimum wage ranges between $7.25 and $8.67 per hour. But is a much higher national minimum wage such as $12 per hour really unreasonable by historical or international standards? In 2011 dollars, the American hourly minimum wage was over $10 in 1968, during our peak of postwar prosperity and full employment, and perhaps that relationship was partly causal. Although exchange-rate fluctuations render exact comparisons difficult, the minimum wage in Ontario along our northern border is currently well over $10 per hour, while in France it now stands at nearly $13. Even more remarkably, Australia recently raised its minimum wage to over $16 per hour, and nonetheless has an unemployment rate of just 5 percent. With the collapse of America's unsustainable housing-bubble economy of the 2000s, our unemployment rates seem no better and in many cases considerably worse than those of affluent Western countries that have refused to pursue our race-to-the-bottom low-wage economic strategy of recent decades.\n\n• • •\n\nBut suppose this boost in the minimum wage succeeded at one of its primary goals and eliminated the jobs of many millions of America's large undocumented population. Would these current workers and their families remain here anyway, perhaps turning to crime as they became financially desperate? After all, huge numbers of immigrants were employed in housing construction, and following the collapse of that industry their unemployment rates have soared, but most of them have stayed here anyway rather than going home again.\n\nThe central point to recognize is that most illegal immigrants, and a substantial fraction of legal ones, enter America with the original goal of short-term economic gain, intending to work for a few years, save as much money as possible, then go back home to their family and friends with a nice nest-egg. Frequently, these plans are unrealistic-saving money proves more difficult than expected-and local ties develop. But except for financial factors, even those individuals who have lived here a decade or longer often still dream of returning to their native countries, sometimes even after they have married, had American-born children, and put down considerable roots.\n\nAmong other factors, the cost-structure of American society is extremely high compared with that in most of the developing world, where dollars go much farther. This is the primary reason that substantial numbers of non-Hispanic American retirees have chosen to relocate to Mexico with their pensions, despite considerable barriers of language and culture.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed earlier, the fiscal costs to the American government of low-wage immigrant families can be enormous. A couple working jobs at or near the present minimum wage pays negligible taxes, while if they have two school-age children, the grossly inflated expense structure of American public education may easily result in an annual taxpayer burden of $20,000 or more, even excluding the substantial costs associated with all other public services. And if one or both of these parents lose their jobs due to a soaring minimum wage, the fiscal burden grows still more severe.\n\nThe obvious solution, both humane and highly cost-effective, would be for the government to offer immigrants extremely generous financial relocation packages if they return home to their own countries. A tax-free cash payment perhaps as high as $5,000 or even $10,000 per adult plus a much smaller sum per minor child, together with free travel arrangements, would constitute an enormously attractive offer, probably being much more than they had managed to accumulate during many years of difficult low-wage labor. If the legal changes proposed herein had already caused their jobs to disappear, such a relocation offer would become irresistible. (Naturally, the full financial package would require hard evidence that they had already been living in America for a year or more, thereby preventing foreigners from crossing our borders simply to game the system.) Given the massive fiscal burdens inherent in the current situation, even such generous financial terms would probably pay for themselves almost immediately.\n\nAn important aspect of all these proposals is that they are largely self-enforcing. Workers would be perfectly aware of the simple minimum wage laws, and harsh penalties would deter employers from taking the risk of violating them. The disappearance of low-wage jobs would remove the primary lure for new illegal immigrants, and generous cash relocation packages would lead many existing ones to eagerly turn themselves in and seek deportation. Although the Border Patrol would continue to exist and immigration laws would remain on the books, after a short transition period these would become much less necessary, and a vast existing system of government bureaucracy, business red tape, and taxpayer expense could safely be reduced.\n\nEven principled libertarians, fervently opposed to the very concept of a minimum wage, might find this system preferable to the status quo, which contains an enormously complex web of regulations and employment restrictions; the civil libertarian nightmares of identity cards, national databases, and workplace raids; and an existing minimum wage on top of all these other things.\n\nThe Political Balance Sheet\n\nThe political response to this package would obviously not be uniformly favorable, but would almost certainly be more so than for any typical immigration-restriction proposal.\n\nMost of the larger corporations, especially those in the industrial sector, would be minimally affected by the wage changes, while benefiting from the (eventually) decreased burden of immigration-related reporting and paperwork requirements.\n\nMany large retail establishments would be forced to pay higher wages, but since these requirements would be uniform, hitting all of them simultaneously, they would be able to raise prices in unison to cover much of the additional expense, a situation very different from one in which well-paid unionized companies are driven to the wall by their lower-paid non-unionized competitors. Furthermore, during the course of this severe recession, giant companies such as Wal-Mart have disclosed disturbing trends of declining sales, and this has widely been ascribed to the growing impoverishment of their lower-middle-class and working-poor customers. A dramatic rise in the wages of low-end groups would reverse this situation and probably boost the fortunes of Wal-Mart and its peers.\n\nLarge agricultural interests are heavily reliant upon illegal labor, but while they might be unhappy about raising their workers' pay by a significant amount, they would find this situation vastly preferable to actual enforcement of today's immigration laws, which would immediately put them out of business. Anyway, although agricultural labor is difficult and unpleasant, most field workers already earn well above current minimum-wage levels, averaging just over $10 per hour in 2009, so the required increase would be much less than what one might assume. And unlike the situation decades ago, only a small fraction of today's illegal immigrants are employed in agriculture.\n\nMany small textile manufacturers and other businesses that survive only by relying upon very low-paid immigrant labor, working in near-sweatshop conditions, would probably be driven out of business. But that is the intent of the proposal.\n\nThe reality is that most of the larger, more powerful business interests in America are much less heavily impacted by minimum wage laws than by all sorts of other regulatory and legal issues, not to mention healthcare and pension costs. A simple change in minimum-wage rates would provoke only a small fraction of the organized business opposition generated by many of the other sweeping national proposals of recent decades, notably healthcare reform. Small business interests, influential in Republican circles, would certainly oppose the measure, but they would largely stand alone.\n\n•   •   •\n\nA greater difficulty on the Republican side of the aisle would involve the entrenched ideological positions of many conservative elected officials and pundits, who over the years have come to vaguely regard minimum wage laws as being \"bad,\" both economically and even spiritually, having substituted dogma for thinking. As an example, conservative firebrand Rep. Michele Bachmann recently hinted that the solution to America's current economic problems might involve substantially reducing our existing minimum-wage rates. Presumably, she believes our country would prosper by cutting its wages to Sub-Saharan African levels, then naturally importing millions of Sub-Saharan Africans happy to work at those rates.\n\nBut we should also recognize that these days a crucial component of the Republican electorate consists of working-class whites, often strongly religious ones, who tend to live in non-unionized low-wage states or who otherwise generally subsist, sometimes with considerable difficulty, on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. Proposing a large wage increase to a socially conservative evangelical Christian who works at Wal-Mart and currently struggles to pay her bills would be the sort of simple, clear message that might easily cut through an enormous amount of ideological clutter. And even if Rush Limbaugh, who earns tens of millions of dollars each year, denounced this proposal as \"big-government liberalism,\" for once his views might not find receptive ears. I suspect that a very substantial fraction of Michele Bachmann's supporters fall into exactly this socioeconomic category.\n\nThe minimum wage represents one of those political issues whose vast appeal to ordinary voters is matched by little if any interest among establishment political elites. As an example, in 1996, following years of unsuccessful attempts to attract the support of California politicians, disgruntled union activists led by State Sen. Hilda Solis, now serving as President Obama's secretary of labor, scraped together the funds to place a huge 35 percent minimum wage increase on the state ballot. Once Republican pollsters began testing the issue, they discovered voter support was so immensely broad and deep that the ballot initiative could not possibly be defeated, and they advised their business clients to avoid any attempt to do so, thus allowing the measure to pass in a landslide against almost no organized opposition. Afterward, the free-market naysayers who had predicted economic disaster were proven entirely wrong, and instead the state economy boomed.\n\nFinally, we should remember that many of the most militant and ideologically fervent grassroots activists within conservative ranks are vehemently anti-immigration, often largely on racial grounds, and sometimes focus on that one issue to the exclusion of most others. For them, the very realistic prospect of dramatically cutting the numbers of America's huge undocumented population, reducing future illegal immigration to a mere trickle, and even perhaps encouraging a substantial fraction of our legal immigrants to return home would be tremendously attractive, and they might make life very uncomfortable for any Republican politician who opposed this plan without providing a realistic alternative in its place.\n\nThe political calculus among Democrats would be much simpler. Any neoliberal Democratic officeholder who balked at a large rise in the minimum wage by citing the economic theories of Milton Friedman or the research reports of Goldman Sachs would be trampled into the dust by his enraged constituents, disappearing forever.\n\n•   •   •\n\nA little over a century ago, Henry Ford took the bold step of doubling the regular wages of his assembly-line workers to the then remarkable sum of $5 per day, thereby achieving international fame as well as enormous business success for his own company. According to most accounts, this event was a crucial factor in creating the prosperous middle class that eventually dominated America's 20th-century history, and Lenin later hailed Ford as one of the world's greatest revolutionary heroes, urged his followers to closely study Ford's writings, and argued that so long as America possessed leaders of such wisdom, no Communist revolution would be necessary there.\n\nThese days, times have changed. But perhaps a similarly bold step, which similarly raises the income of America's working class and similarly crosses many ideological lines, would help safeguard and maintain the national prosperity that men like Ford originally created.\n\nRon Unz is publisher of The American Conservative .

      "text": "Yesterday I read J.D. Vance's new book Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and a Culture In Crisis. Well, \"read\" is not quite the word. I devoured the thing in a single gulp. If you want to understand America in 2016, Hillbilly Elegy is a must-read. I will be thinking about this book for a long, long time. Here are my impressions.\n\nThe book is an autobiographical account by a lawyer (Yale Law School graduate) and sometime conservative writer who grew up in a poor and chaotic Appalachian household. He's a hillbilly, in other words, and is not ashamed of the term. Vance reflects on his childhood, and how he escaped the miserable fate (broken families, drugs, etc) of so many white working class and poor people around whom he grew up. And he draws conclusions from it, conclusions that may be hard for some people to take. But Vance has earned the right to make those judgments. This was his life. He speaks with authority that has been extremely hard won.\n\nForgive the rambling nature of this post. I'm still trying to process this extraordinary book.\n\nVance's people come from Kentucky and southern Ohio, a deeply depressed region filled with hard-bitten but proud Scots-Irish folks. He begins by talking about how, as a young man, he got a job working in a warehouse, doing hard work for extra money. He writes about how even though the work was physically demanding, the pay wasn't bad, and it came with benefits. Yet the warehouse struggled to keep people employed. Vance says his book is about macroeconomic trends - outsourcing jobs overseas - but not only that:\n\nBut this book is about something else: what goes on in the lives of real people when the industrial economy goes south. It's about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible. It's about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it. The problems that I saw at the tile warehouse run far deeper than macroeconomic trends and policy. too many young men immune to hard work. Good jobs impossible to fill for any length of time. And a young man [one of Vance's co-workers] with every reason to work - a wife-to-be to support and a baby on the way - carelessly tossing aside a good job with excellent health insurance. More troublingly, when it was all over, he thought something had been done to him. There is a lack of agency here - a feeling that you have little control over your life and a willingness to blame everyone but yourself. This is distinct from the larger economic landscape of modern America.\n\nThis is the heart of Hillbilly Elegy : how hillbilly white culture fails its children, and how the greatest disadvantages it imparts to its youth are the life of violence and chaos in which they are raised, and the closely related problem of a lack of moral agency. Young Vance was on a road to ruin until certain people - including the US Marine Corps - showed him that his choices mattered, and that he had a lot more control over his fate than he thought.\n\nVance talks about how, in his youth, there was a lot of hardscrabble poverty among his people, but nothing like today, dominated by the devastation of drug addiction. Everything we are accustomed to hearing about black inner city social dysfunction is fully present among these white hillbillies, as Vance documents in great detail. He writes that \"hillbillies learn from an early age to deal with uncomfortable truths by avoiding them, or by pretending better truths exist. This tendency might make for psychological resilience, but it also makes it hard for Appalachians to look at themselves honestly.\"\n\nThis was one of many points at which Vance's experience converged somewhat with mine. My people are not hillbillies per se, but I come from working-class Southern country white people. Many of the cultural traits Vance describes are present in a more diluted way in my own family. That fierce pride, a pride that would rather see everything go to hell than admit error. This, I think, has something to do with why Southern Protestant Christianity has traditionally been more Stoic than Christian. Real Christianity has as its heart humility . That's not a characteristic Scots-Irish people hold dear.\n\nVance talks about the hillbilly habit of stigmatizing people who leave the hollers as \"too big for your britches\" - meaning that you got above yourself. It doesn't matter that they may have left to find work, and that they're living a fairly poor life not too far away, in Ohio. The point is, they left , and that is a hard sin to forgive. What, we weren't good enough for you?\n\nThis is the white-people version of \"acting white,\" if you follow me: the same stigma and shame that poor black people deploy against other poor black people who want to better themselves with education and so on.\n\nThe most important figure in Vance's life is his Mamaw (pron. \"MAM-maw\"), Bonnie Vance, a kind of hillbilly Catherine the Great. She was a phenomenally tough woman. She knew how to use a gun, she had a staggeringly foul mouth, she smoked menthols and stood ready to fight at the drop of a hat. And she saved Vance's life.\n\nVance plainly loves his people, and because he loves them, he tells hard truths about them. He talks about how cultural fatalism destroys initiative. When hillbillies run up against adversity, they tend to assume that they can't do anything about it. To the hillbilly mind, people who \"make it\" are either born to wealth, or were born with uncanny talent, winning the genetic lottery. The connection between self-discipline and hard work, and success, is invisible to them. Vance:\n\nPeople talk about hard work all the time in places like Middletown [where Vance grew up]. You can walk through a town where 30 percent of the young men work fewer than twenty hours a week and find not a single person aware of his own laziness.\n\nVance was born into a world of chaos. It takes concentration to follow the trail of family connections. Women give birth out of wedlock, having children by different men. Marriages rarely last, and informal partnerings are more common. Vance has half-siblings by his mom's different husbands (she has had five to date). In his generation, Vance says, grandparents are often having to raise their grandchildren, because those grandparents, however impoverished and messy their own lives may be, offer a more stable alternative than the incredible instability of the kids' parents (or more likely, parent).\n\nVance scarcely knew his biological father until he was a bit older, and lived with his mom and her rotating cast of boyfriends and husbands. Here's Vance on models of manhood:\n\nI learned little else about what masculinity required of me other than drinking beer and screaming at a woman when she screamed at you. In the end, the only lesson that took was that you can't depend on people. \"I learned that men will disappear at the drop of a hat,\" Lindsay [his half-sister] once said. \"They don't care about their kids; they don't provide; they just disappear, and it's not that hard to make them go.\"\n\nThis is what happens in inner-city black culture, as has been exhaustively documented. But these are rural and small-town white people. This dysfunction is not color-based, but cultural.\n\nI could not do justice here to describe the violence, emotional and physical, that characterizes everyday life in Vance's childhood culture, and the instability in people's outer lives and inner lives. To read in such detail what life is like as a child formed by communities like that is to gain a sense of why it is so difficult to escape from the malign gravity of that way of life. You can't imagine that life could be any different.\n\nReligion among the hillbillies is not much help. Vance says that hillbillies love to talk about Jesus, but they don't go to church, and Christianity doesn't seem to have much effect at all on their behavior. Vance's biological father is an exception. He belonged to a strict fundamentalist church, one that helped him beat his alcoholism and gave him the severe structure he needed to keep his life from going off track. Vance:\n\nDad's church offered something desperately needed by people like me. For alcoholics, it gave them a community of support and a sense that they weren't fighting addiction alone. For expectant mothers, it offered a free home with job training and parenting classes. When someone needed a job, church friends could either provide one or make introductions. When Dad faced financial troubles, his church banded together and purchased a used car for the family. In the broken world I saw around me - and for the people struggling in that world - religion offered tangible assistance to keep the faithful on track.\n\nVance says the best thing about life in his dad's house was how boring it was. It was predictable. It was a respite from the constant chaos.\n\nOn the other hand, the religion most hillbillies espouse is a rusticated form of Moralistic Therapeutic Deism. God seems to exist only as a guarantor of ultimate order, and ultimate justice; Jesus is there to assuage one's pain. Except for those who commit to churchgoing - and believe it or not, this is one of the least churched parts of the US - Christianity is a ghost.\n\nAbout Vance's father's fundamentalism, I got more details about what this blog's reader Turmarion, who lives in Appalachia, keeps telling me about that region's fundamentalism. Even though I live in the rural Deep South, this form of Christianity is alien to me. When he went to live with his dad for a time as an adolescent (if I have my chronology correct), Vance was exposed for the first time to church. He appreciated very much the structure, but noticed that the spirituality on offer was fear-based and paranoid. \"[T]he deeper I immersed myself in evangelical theology, the more I felt compelled to mistrust many sectors of society. Evolution and the Big Bang became ideologies to confront, not theories to understand ... In my new church ... I heard more about the gay lobby and the war on Christmas than about any particular character trait that a Christian should aspire to have.\"\n\nThis was yet another reminder of why so many Evangelicals react strongly against the Benedict Option. As I often say, I have no experience of this extreme siege mentality in Christianity. In fact, my experience is entirely the opposite. I believe that some Christians coming out of fundamentalism may react so strongly against their miserable, unhappy background that they don't appreciate the extent to which there really are people and forces out to \"get\" them. When you have lived almost all your Christian life among highly assimilated Christians who generally don't pay attention to these things, their complacency can drive you crazy. But Vance helps me to understand how someone who grew up in its opposite would find even the slightest hint of siege Christianity to be anathema.\n\nOne of the most important contributions Vance makes to our understanding of American poverty is how little public policy can affect the cultural habits that keep people poor. He talks about education policy, saying that the elite discussion of how to help schools focuses entirely on reforming institutions. \"As a teacher at my old high school told me recently, 'They want us to be shepherds to these kids. But no one wants to talk about the fact that many of them are raised by wolves.\"\n\nHe continues:\n\nWhy didn't our neighbor leave that abusive man? Why did she spend her money on drugs? Why couldn't she see that her behavior was destroying her daughter? Why were all of these things happening not just to our neighbor but to my mom? It would be years before I learned that no single book, or expert, or field could fully explain the problems of hillbillies in modern America. Our elegy is a sociological one, yes, but it is also about psychology and community and culture and faith. During my junior year of high school, our neighbor Pattie called her landlord to report a leaky roof. The landlord arrived and found Pattie topless, stoned, and unconscious on her living room couch. Upstairs the bathtub was overflowing - hence, the leaking roof. Pattie had apparently drawn herself a bath, taken a few prescription painkillers, and passed out. The top floor of her home and many of her family's possessions were ruined. This is the reality of our community. It's about a naked druggie destroying what little of value exists in her life. It's about children who lose their toys and clothes to a mother's addiction.\n\nThis was my world: a world of truly irrational behavior. We spend our way into the poorhouse. We buy giant TVs and iPads. Our children wear nice clothes thanks to high-interest credit cards and payday loans. We purchase homes we don't need, refinance them for more spending money, and declare bankruptcy, often leaving them full of garbage in our wake. Thrift is inimical to our being. We spend to pretend that we're upper class. And when the dust clears - when bankruptcy hits or a family member bails us out of our stupidity - there's nothing left over. Nothing for the kids' college tuition, no investment to grow our wealth, no rainy-day fund if someone loses her job. We know we shouldn't spend like this. Sometimes we beat ourselves up over it, but we do it anyway.\n\nMore:\n\nOur homes are a chaotic mess. We scream and yell at each other like we're spectators at a football game. At least one member of the family uses drugs - sometimes the father, sometimes both. At especially stressful times, we'll hit and punch each other, all in front of the rest of the family, including young children; much of the time, the neighbors hear what's happening. A bad day is when the neighbors call the police to stop the drama. Our kids go to foster care but never stay for long. We apologize to our kids. The kids believe we're really sorry, and we are. But then we act just as mean a few days later.\n\nAnd on and on. Vance says his people lie to themselves about the reality of their condition, and their own personal responsibility for their degradation. He says that not all working-class white hillbillies are like this. There are those who work hard, stay faithful, and are self-reliant - people like Mamaw and Papaw. Their kids stand a good chance of making it; in fact, Vance says friends of his who grew up like this are doing pretty well for themselves. Unfortunately, most of the people in Vance's neighborhood were like his mom: \"consumerist, isolated, angry, distrustful.\"\n\nAs I said earlier, the two things that saved Vance were going to live full time with his Mamaw (therefore getting out of the insanity of his mom's home), and later, going into the US Marine Corps. I've already written at too much length about Vance's story, so I won't belabor this much longer. Suffice it to say that as imperfect as she was, Mamaw gave young Vance the stability he needed to start succeeding in school. And she wouldn't let him slack off on his studies. She taught him the value of hard work, and of moral agency.\n\nThe Marine Corps remade J.D. Vance. It pulverized his inner hillbilly fatalism, and gave him a sense that he had control over his life, and that his choices mattered . This was news to him. Reading this was a revelation to me. I was raised by parents who grew up poor, but who taught my sister and me from the very start that we were responsible for ourselves. Hard work, self-respect, and self-discipline were at the core of my dad's ethic, for sure. There was no more despicable person in my dad's way of seeing the world than the sumbitch who won't work. I doubt that I've ever known a man more willing to do hard physical labor than my father was. Knowing what he came from, and knowing how any progress he made came from the sweat of his brow and self-discipline on spending, he had no tolerance for people who were lazy and blamed everybody else for their problems. This is true whether they were poor, middle class, or rich (but especially if they were rich).\n\nAnyway, Vance talks about how the contemporary hillbilly mindset renders them unfit for participation in life outside their own ghetto. They don't trust anybody, and are willing to believe outlandish conspiracy theories, particularly if those theories absolve them from responsibility.\n\nI once ran into an old acquaintance at a Middletown bar who told me that he had recently quit his job because he was sick of waking up early I later saw him complaining on Facebook about the \"Obama economy\" and how it had affected his life. I don't doubt that the Obama economy has affected many, but this man is assuredly not among them. His status in life is directly attributable to the choices he's made, and his life will improve only through better decisions. But for him to make better choices, he needs to live in an environment that forces him to ask tough questions about himself. There is a cultural movement in the white working class to blame problems on society or the government, and that movement gains adherents by the day.\n\nHence the enormous popularity of Donald Trump among the white working class. Here's a guy who will believe and say anything, and who blames Mexicans, Chinese, and Muslims for America's problems. The elites hate him, so he's made the right enemies, as far as the white working class is concerned. And his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan speaks to the deep patriotism that Vance says is virtually a religion among hillbillies.\n\nTrump doesn't come up in Vance's narrative, but in truth, he's all over it. Vance is telling his personal story, not analyzing US politics and culture broadly. It's also true, however, that the GOP elites set themselves up for their current disaster, by listening to theories that absolved themselves of any responsibility for problems in this country from immigration and free trade (Trump is not all wrong about this).\n\nThe sense of inner order and discipline Vance learned in the Marine Corps allowed his natural intelligence to blossom. The poor hillbilly kid with the druggie mom ends up at Yale Law School. He says he felt like an outsider there, but it was a serious education in more than the law:\n\nThe wealthy and the powerful aren't just wealthy and powerful; they follow a different set of norms and mores. ... It was at this meal, on the first of five grueling days of [law school job] interviews, that I began to understand that I was seeing the inner workings of a system that lay hidden to most of my kind. ... That week of interviews showed me that successful people are playing an entirely different game.\n\nWhat he's talking about is social capital , and how critically important it is to success. Poor white kids don't have it (neither do poor black or Hispanic kids). You're never going to teach a kid from the trailer park or the housing project the secrets of the upper middle class, but you can give them what kids like me had: a basic understanding of work, discipline, confidence, good manners, and an eagerness to learn. A big part of the problem for his people, says Vance, is the shocking degree of family instability among the American poor. \"Chaos begets chaos. Instability begets instability. Welcome to family life for the American hillbilly.\"\n\nVance is admirably humble about how the only reason he got out was because key people along the way helped him climb out of the hole his culture dug for him. When Vance talks about how to fix these problems, he strikes a strong skeptical note. The worst problems of his culture, the things that held kids like him back, are not things a government program can fix. For example, as a child, his culture taught him that doing well in school made you a \"sissy.\" Vance says the home is the source of the worst of these problems. There simply is not a policy fix for families and family systems that have collapsed.\n\nI believe we hillbillies are the toughest goddamned people on this earth. ... But are we tough enough to do what needs to be done to help a kid like Brian? Are we tough enough to build a church that forces kids like me to engage with the world rather than withdraw from it? Are we tough enough to look ourselves in the mirror and admit that our conduct harms our children? Public policy can help, but there is no government that can fix these problems for us. These problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else. We created them, and only we can fix them.\n\nVoting for Trump is not going to fix these problems. For the black community, protesting against police brutality on the streets is not going to fix their most pressing problems. It's not that the problems Trump points to aren't real, and it's not that police brutality, especially towards minorities, isn't a problem. It's that these serve as distractions from the core realities that keep poor white and black people down. A missionary to inner-city Dallas once told me that the greatest obstacle the black and Latino kids he helped out had was their rock-solid conviction that nothing could change for them, and that people who succeeded got that way because they were born white, or rich, or just got lucky.\n\nUntil these things are honestly and effectively addressed by families, communities, and their institutions, nothing will change.\n\nIs there a black J.D. Vance? I wonder. I mean, I know there are African-Americans who have done what he has done. But are there any who will write about it? Clarence Thomas did, in his autobiography. Who else? Anybody know?\n\nVance's book sends me back to Kevin D. Williamson's stunning National Review piece on \"The White Ghetto\" - Appalachia, he means. This is the world J.D. Vance came out of, though he saw more good in it that Williams does in his journalistic tour. It also brings to mind Williamson's highly controversial piece earlier this year (behind subscription paywall; David French excerpts the hottest part here ) in which he said:\n\nIt is immoral because it perpetuates a lie: that the white working class that finds itself attracted to Trump has been victimized by outside forces. It hasn't. The white middle class may like the idea of Trump as a giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the Cathedral, they may sing hymns to Trump the destroyer and whisper darkly about \"globalists\" and - odious, stupid term - \"the Establishment,\" but nobody did this to them. They failed themselves.\n\nIf you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate New York, or eastern Kentucky, or my own native West Texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy - which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog - you will come to an awful realization. It wasn't Beijing. It wasn't even Washington, as bad as Washington can be. It wasn't immigrants from Mexico, excessive and problematic as our current immigration levels are. It wasn't any of that. Nothing happened to them. There wasn't some awful disaster. There wasn't a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence - and the incomprehensible malice - of poor white America. So the gypsum business in Garbutt ain't what it used to be. There is more to life in the 21st century than wallboard and cheap sentimentality about how the Man closed the factories down. The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die.\n\nEconomically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap. Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs. Forget your goddamned gypsum, and, if he has a problem with that, forget Ed Burke, too. The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump's speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin. What they need isn't analgesics, literal or political. They need real opportunity, which means that they need real change, which means that they need U-Haul.\n\nI criticized Williamson at the time for his harshness. I still wouldn't have put it the way he did, but reading Vance gives me reason to reconsider my earlier judgment. Vance writes from a much more loving and appreciative place than Williamson did (though I believe Williamson came from a similar rough background), but he affirms many of the same truths. If white lives matter - and they do, because all lives matter - then sentimentality and more government programs aren't going to rescue these poor people. Vance puts it more delicately than Williamson, but getting a U-Haul and getting away from other poor people - or at least finding some way to get their kids out of there, to a place where people aren't so fatalistic, lazy, and paranoid - is their best hope. And that is surely true no matter what your race.\n\nThe book is called Hillbilly Elegy , and I can't recommend it to you strongly enough. It offers no easy answers. But it does tell the truth. I thank reader Surly Temple for giving it to me.\n\nUPDATE: Hello Browser readers. Glad to see traffic from one of my favorite websites. If you found this piece interesting, I strongly encourage you to take a look at the subsequent interview I did with J.D. Vance about the book. I posted it last Friday, and it has gone viral.

This extraordinary young writer is tapping into something very, very deep in American life right now. I've been getting plenty of e-mails from liberals saying how much they appreciated the piece, because Vance tells difficult truths that both liberals and conservatives need to hear.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "By Ron Unz | September 21, 2011\n\nLast June the U.S. Census disclosed that non-white births in America were on the verge of surpassing the white total and might do so as early as the end of this year. Such an event marks an unprecedented racial watershed in American history. Over the last few years, various demographic projections from that same agency and independent analysts have provided somewhat fluctuating estimates of the date-perhaps 2042 or 2037 or 2050-at which white Americans will become a minority. This represents a remarkable, almost unimaginable, demographic change from our country of the early 1960s, when whites accounted for over 85 percent of the population and seemed likely to remain at that level indefinitely.\n\nMany years of heavy foreign immigration have been the crucial element driving this transformation, but even if all immigration-legal and illegal-were halted tomorrow and the border completely sealed, these demographic trends would continue, although at a much slower pace. Today, the median age of American whites is over 40, putting most of them past their prime child-bearing years. Meanwhile, America's largest minority group, the rapidly growing population of Hispanics, has a median age in the mid-20s, near the peak of family formation and growth, while both Asians and blacks are also considerably younger than whites. In fact, since 1995 births rather than immigration have been the largest factor behind the near doubling of America's Hispanic population.\n\nAs in most matters, public perceptions of America's racial reality are overwhelmingly shaped by the images absorbed from the national media and Hollywood, whether these are realistic or not. For example, over the last generation the massive surge in black visibility in sports, movies, and TV has led to the widespread perception of a similarly huge growth in the black fraction of the population, which, according to Gallup, most people now reckon stands at 33 percent or so of the national total. Yet this is entirely incorrect. During the last hundred-plus years, American blacks have seen their share of the population fluctuate by merely a percentage point or two, going from 11.6 percent in 1900 to 12.6 percent in 2010. By contrast, five decades of immigration have caused Asian Americans-relatively ignored by the news, sports, and entertainment industries-to increase from 0.5 percent in 1960 to 5 percent today, following the fifteen-fold rise in their numbers which has established them as America's most rapidly growing racial group, albeit from a small initial base.\n\nThese national changes in racial distribution have been quite uneven and geographically skewed, with some parts of the country leading and others lagging. For example, during the 1970s when I was a teenager growing up in the Los Angeles area, that city and the surrounding sprawl of Southern California constituted America's whitest region, about the only large urban agglomeration whose racial character approximated that of the country as a whole-around 85 percent white-and my own San Fernando Valley area in particular exemplified the popular image of suburban picket fences and lighthearted \"Leave It to Beaver\" family comedies. Yet during the two decades that followed, Southern California underwent an enormous immigration-driven demographic transformation, creating a new Los Angeles which was almost 80 percent non-white and a surrounding region in which whites no longer held even a mere plurality.\n\nThis sweeping racial shift, involving the movement or displacement of over ten million people, might easily rank as the largest in the peacetime history of the world and is probably matched by just a handful of the greatest population changes brought about by war. The racial transformation in America's national population may be without precedent in human history.\n\nNext Page: Republicans as the White Party >\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nSingle Page\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "By Ron Unz | September 21, 2011\n\n< Previous Page\n\nRepublicans as the White Party\n\nIt is a commonplace that politics in America is heavily influenced by race, and these enormous demographic changes since 1965 have certainly not gone unnoticed within the political world. For decades, white voters have tended to lean Republican while non-whites have been strongly Democratic, so the swiftly falling ratio of the former to the latter has become a source of major concern, even alarm, within the top ranks of the GOP, which received a sharp wake-up call when gigantic California, traditionally one of the most reliably Republican states, suddenly became one of the most reliably Democratic.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s there was a powerful strain of thought within conservative and Republican circles that the best means of coping with this looming political problem was to reduce or even halt the foreign immigration that was driving it. But after several years of bitter internal conflict, this anti-immigrationist faction lost out almost completely to the pro-immigrationist camp, which was backed by the powerful business lobby. As a result, the Republican Party mantra became one of embracing \"diversity\" rather than resisting it and focused on increasing the Republican share of the growing non-white vote. Former President George W. Bush, strategist Karl Rove, and Sen. John McCain have been the most prominent advocates of this perspective.\n\nRove invested huge resources in maximizing Bush's Hispanic numbers in 1998 during his easy Texas gubernatorial reelection campaign and achieved considerable success, persuading some 40 percent or more of local Hispanics to vote the Republican ticket that year, a major shift of political loyalties. This later allowed him to tout his candidate's excellent Hispanic rapport in national GOP circles, which was an important factor in gaining him the presidential nomination in 2000. Although Bush's national Hispanic totals were much less impressive in the 2000 race, and the vast funds he invested in a quixotic attempt to carry California were totally wasted, Rove and his allies redoubled their efforts during the 2004 reelection campaign, and buoyed by the continuing patriotic aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, largely succeeded. Although the percentages have been much disputed, Bush seems to have carried somewhat over 40 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide in 2004, although he was once again trounced in California.\n\n•   •   •\n\nPart of the Bush/Rove political strategy was to take a leading role in passing a sweeping immigration-reform measure, aimed at legalizing the status of many millions of (overwhelmingly Hispanic) illegal immigrants, easing the restrictions on future legal immigration, while also tightening border enforcement. Leaving aside policy matters, the political theory was simple: if the Republican Party changed the laws to benefit Hispanic and other immigrants, these groups and their children would be more likely to vote Republican, thereby helping to solve the GOP's demographic dilemma. Rove endlessly pointed to 40 percent as the necessary GOP level of future Hispanic support-score above that number and political victory was likely, score much below it and defeat was nearly assured. Although this precise quantitative target was obviously intended for rhetorical effect, it does seem to represent the dominant strain in conservative thinking, namely the need to combine a strong white vote with a solid minority of Hispanics and Asians, thereby allowing the Republicans to survive and win races in an increasingly non-white America. (Meanwhile decades of fruitless efforts to attract a significant share of the black vote would be quietly abandoned.)\n\nBut does this political strategy actually make any sense? Or are there far more effective and more plausible paths to continued Republican political success? Although almost totally marginalized within Republican establishment ranks, the anti-immigrationist wing of the conservative movement has maintained a vigorous intellectual presence on the Internet. Over the years, its flagship organ, the VDare.com website run by Peter Brimelow, a former National Review senior editor, has been scathing in its attacks on the so-called Rove Strategy, instead proposing a contrasting approach christened the Sailer Strategy, after Steve Sailer, its primary architect and leading promoter (who has himself frequently written for The American Conservative ). In essence, what Sailer proposes is the polar opposite of Rove's approach, which he often ridicules as being based on a mixture of (probably dishonest) wishful thinking and sheer innumeracy.\n\nConsider, for example, Rove's oft-repeated mantra that a Republican presidential candidate needs to win something approaching 40 percent of the national Hispanic vote or have no chance of reaching the White House. During the last several election cycles, Hispanic voters represented between 5 and 8 percent of the national total, so the difference between a candidate winning an outstanding 50 percent of that vote and one winning a miserable 30 percent would amount to little more than just a single percentage point of the popular total, completely insignificant based on recent history. Furthermore, presidential races are determined by the electoral college map rather than popular-vote totals, and the overwhelming majority of Hispanics are concentrated either in solidly blue states such as California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey, or solidly red ones such as Texas and Georgia, reducing their impact to almost nothing. Any Republican fearful of a loss in Texas or Democrat worried about carrying California would be facing a national defeat of epic proportions, in which Hispanic preferences would constitute a trivial component. Pursuing the Hispanic vote for its own sake seems a clear absurdity.\n\nEven more importantly, Sailer argues that once we throw overboard the restrictive blinkers of modern \"political correctness\" on racial matters, certain aspects of the real world become obvious. For nearly the last half-century, the political core of the Republican Party has been the white vote, and especially the votes of whites who live in the most heavily non-white states, notably the arc of the old Confederacy. The political realignment of Southern whites foreshadowed by the support that Barry Goldwater attracted in 1964 based on his opposition to the Civil Rights Act and that constituted George Wallace's white-backlash campaign of 1968 eventually became a central pillar of the dominant Reagan majority in the 1980s.\n\nIn many cases, this was even true outside the Deep South, as the blue-collar whites of Macomb County and other areas surrounding overwhelmingly black cities such as Detroit became the blue-collar Reagan Democrats who gave the GOP a near lock on the presidency. While the politics of racial polarization might be demonized in liberal intellectual circles, it served to elect vast numbers of Republicans to high and low office alike. George H.W. Bush's \"Willie Horton\" ad and Jesse Helms's \"White Hands\" ad have been endlessly vilified by the media, but they contributed to unexpected come-from-behind victories for the candidates willing to run them. And in politics, winning is the only metric of success.\n\nSailer suggests that a very similar approach would work equally well with regard to the hot-button issue of immigration and the rapidly growing Hispanic population, arguing that the votes of this group could be swamped by those of an angry white electorate energized along racial lines. He cites Pete Wilson's unexpected California gubernatorial reelection victory in 1994 as a perfect example. Deeply unpopular due to a severe statewide recession and desperately behind in the polls, Wilson hitched his candidacy to a harsh media campaign vilifying illegal immigrants, and although his Hispanic support plummeted, his white support soared to an equal extent, giving him a landslide victory in a race the pundits had written off and sweeping in a full slate of victorious down-ticket Republicans. Sailer's simple point is that individual white votes count just as much as Hispanic ones, and since there are vastly more of the former, attracting these with racially-charged campaign themes might prove very politically productive.\n\nAn additional fact noted by Sailer is that the racial demographics of a given region can be completely misleading from a political perspective. As mentioned earlier, Hispanics and other immigrants tend to be much younger than whites and much less likely to hold citizenship. Therefore, a state or region in which whites have become a numerical minority may still possess a large white supermajority among the electorate. Once again, today's California provides a telling example, with Hispanics and whites now being about equal in numbers according to the Census, but with whites still regularly casting three times as many votes on Election Day.\n\nThe Sailer analysis is ruthlessly logical. Whites are still the overwhelming majority of voters, and will remain so for many decades to come, so raising your share of the white vote by just a couple of points has much more political impact than huge shifts in the non-white vote. As whites become a smaller and smaller portion of the local population in more and more regions, they will naturally become ripe for political polarization based on appeals to their interests as whites. And if Republicans focus their campaigning on racially charged issues such as immigration and affirmative action, they will promote this polarization, gradually transforming the two national political parties into crude proxies for direct racial interests, effectively becoming the \"white party\" and the \"non-white party.\" Since white voters are still close to 80 percent of the national electorate, the \"white party\"-the Republicans-will end up controlling almost all political power and could enact whatever policies they desired, on both racial and non-racial issues.\n\n•   •   •\n\nMany might find this political scenario quite distasteful or unnerving, but that does not necessarily render it implausible. In fact, over the last couple of decades, this exact process has unfolded in many states across the Deep South, with elected white Democrats becoming an increasingly endangered species. Each election year, blacks overwhelmingly vote for the \"black party,\" whites overwhelmingly vote for the \"white party,\" and since whites are usually two-thirds or so of the electorate, they almost invariably win at the polls. Although Republican consultants and pundits make enormous efforts to camouflage or ignore this underlying racial reality, it exists nonetheless.\n\nBy contrast, appeals for white support based on racial cohesion would be almost total nonstarters in 95 percent white Vermont or New Hampshire, or in many other states of the North in which the local demographics still approximate those of the country that overwhelmingly supported the Civil Rights legislation of the 1960s. But today's national white percentages are much closer to those of 1960s Alabama and Mississippi, where whites fought that legislation tooth and nail on racial grounds. And as the nation's overall demography continues its inexorable slide from that of Vermont to that of Mississippi, will white politics move in that same direction, especially if given a push?\n\nNow I think a strong case can be made that such a process of deliberate racial polarization in American politics might have numerous adverse consequences for the future well-being of our country, sharply divided as it would become between hostile white and non-white political blocs of roughly equal size. But given the extremely utilitarian mentality of those who practice electoral politics for a living, the more important question we should explore is whether it would actually work , purely on the political level. Might this strategy of racial polarization be applicable across the country as a whole?\n\nNext Page: Non-Whites and Blacks >\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nSingle Page\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "In 1950 my wife's uncle, the son of a West Side of Chicago ditch digger, won a scholarship to MIT. Back then it was unusual enough for anybody from Chicago to go all the way to Massachusetts for college that the local newspaper printed a picture of him boarding the train for Cambridge. By the 1960s, however, the spread of standardized testing had helped make it customary for elite universities to vacuum up larger and larger fractions of the country's cognitive talent. The long-term implications of this momentous change are quantified in Charles Murray's new book on the evolving American class system, Coming Apart .\n\nThe book pulls together strands of his thought going back three decades, a period during which Murray has been the model of a public intellectual. Striving to reconcile contrasting virtues, Murray has displayed a dazzling gift for sophisticated data analysis while remaining devoted to making his books as broadly comprehensible as possible. He's a social-scientific elitist and a civic egalitarian; a libertarian and a communitarian; a truth-teller and a thinker of the utmost judiciousness.\n\nNot surprisingly, none of these strengths have made the co-author of The Bell Curve terribly popular, especially because in the 18 years since the publication of that infinitely denounced book about the growing stratification of America by intelligence not much has happened to prove it in error. In 2012, it looks like it's Charles Murray's world and we're just living in it.\n\nMurray isn't hated for being wrong but instead for authoritatively documenting the kinds of things that everybody uncomfortably senses are true. But Murray has never been complacent about how Americans are increasingly sorted by college admissions. Is an I.Q.-driven meritocracy compatible with the old middle-class republic that he cherishes? Part of the creative tension behind The Bell Curve was that co-authors Murray and Richard Herrnstein, the Harvard psychologist, could never quite agree on whether the growing cartelization of smart young people by elite colleges was, on the whole, good or bad for America. Herrnstein, a native New Yorker, tended to view the Ivy League's lock on native talent favorably, while Murray, a Midwestern boy who went to Harvard in 1961, worried that a Jeffersonian republic requires more geographic and cultural diversity.\n\nThe subtitle of Murray's new analysis of the deepening class chasm, The State of White America, 1960-2010 , is likely to give the commentariat another case of the vapors. The term \"white America\" is only to be used these days with obviously hostile intent, and Murray, a loyal son of Newton, Iowa, appears suspiciously objective, even sympathetic.\n\nYet how can social class be tracked without isolating it from race? Class obsessed intellectuals from before the time of Marx, but interest in it faded after 1960 as race and ethnicity grabbed the spotlight. And yet class still matters. So how do we make apples to apples comparisons over a half-century of rapid demographic change? Murray desnarls the data by focusing solely upon non-Hispanic whites from ages 30-49. He's scoured the databases to find fair comparisons of the Eisenhower-Kennedy era to the Bush-Obama age.\n\nIronically, one problem with thinking about class is that the subject suffers from more fundamental vagueness than does race. We're always being told that race does not exist because races have fuzzy boundaries or because Tiger Woods belongs to more than one race. Yet the federal government collects vast quantities of statistics for use in discrimination lawsuits simply by asking people to check whichever race boxes they feel appropriate on the Census. This system is hardly perfect, but it appears to be good enough for government work.\n\nIn contrast, the Census doesn't bother asking Americans to self-identify their class. Polling shows that large numbers of Americans think of themselves as simply middle-class: too many to be useful to social scientists. So Murray sorts people into classes based on objective markers of education and prestige of occupation. He defines the working class as no degree above a high-school diploma and a blue-collar, service, or low-level white-collar job. The upper middle class has college degrees and professional or managerial jobs. (An intellectual himself, less interested in money than in behavior, Murray largely leaves income and assets out of his class categorizations, but there's little evidence that would much change things.)\n\nOne potential issue is that the working class has been shrinking and the upper middle class growing over time, so Murray alternatively compares the top 20 percent in education and occupation to the bottom 30 percent. Strikingly, this doesn't make much difference.\n\nThe first paradox he's uncovered is that the upper middle class tends to Talk Sixties but Live Fifties. In terms of not screwing up their lives, \"the people who run the country are doing just fine.\" For example, among white women with college degrees, the illegitimacy rate remains below 5 percent. Murray notes, \"The new upper class still does a good job of practicing some of the virtues, but it no longer preaches them.\"\n\nOne pattern that leaps out from Murray's dozens of time series graphs is how beneficial the preachy culture of mid-century America was for the less educated. My mother, for instance, was born into a deeply dysfunctional working class family in 1920 and never went to college. But she had no trouble picking up from society the right lessons about what was required to attain a respectable middle-class life.\n\nSince then, however, the message has gotten muddled. The out-of-wedlock birth rate, which was negligible in 1960, has broken 40 percent for white women with just high-school diplomas and 60 percent for high-school dropouts.\n\nSimilarly, among the top 20 percent of whites, the fraction of children not living with both biological parents is only about one out of ten. Among the bottom 30 percent of whites, however, this rate had grown since the 1960s from single figures to over half.\n\nAmong the upper middle class, other symptoms of malaise remain minor. Arrests for violent crime have declined from 17 per 100,000 in 1960 to 16 in 2009. Among the white working class, however, arrests are up from 125 to 592. And the percentage of theoretically working-class men who have declared themselves \"disabled and unable to work\" has grown from 2 percent in 1970 to 10 percent in 2010, versus only 0.2 percent among the well off.\n\nInterestingly, despite all the complaints you read from commentators about how they are being inundated by Tim Tebow-worshipping Christian zealots, religion has declined more severely among the working class. The percentage of upper middle class folks who are \"de facto seculars\"-those who profess no religion or attend church no more than once per year-has grown from 27 percent to 40 percent since the early 1970s. But among the working class, secular lifestyles have grown from 35 percent to 59 percent.\n\nMurray concludes, \"a significant and growing proportion of the American population is losing the virtues required to be functioning members of a free society.\" This slow erosion is seldom discussed, however, because on the other side of the class chasm, the upper reaches \"have become so isolated that they are often oblivious to the nature of the problems that exist elsewhere.\" Murray has ranked every zip code in the country by class, and one of his more informative findings is that vast swathes of the greater Washington D.C. area, which increasingly monopolizes public discourse, rank at the 95th percentile or higher.\n\nTo illustrate the degree of social insulation that the people who read serious nonfiction books like Coming Apart have engineered for themselves, Murray has crafted an amusing survey on \"How Thick Is Your Bubble?\" Questions include \"During the last month, have you voluntarily hung out with people who were smoking cigarettes?\" \"Since leaving school, have you ever worn a uniform,\" and \"During the last year, have you ever purchased domestic mass-market beer to stock your own fridge?\"\n\nThat last one stumped me since I buy Anheuser-Busch Natural Light, a cheap sub-mass-market product aimed at college kids-on campus, Natty Lights are known as \"frat water\"-and solitary imbibers who like their modest amount of alcohol without all that tiresome beer flavor. I emailed the author to learn how I should score my answer, but after a lengthy exchange, we concluded that anybody whose first reaction is to contact Charles Murray to discuss one's taste (or lack thereof) in beer was kind of missing the point of his survey.\n\nMurray put an early draft of this test online last year, which elicited some catcalls, but the final version in Coming Apart is much improved. I scored 31 out of 100 on \"access to the rest of America,\" which accurately defines me as \"A first-generation upper-middle class person with middle-class parents.\" My wife scored 56, which also seems insightful: both her parents had advanced degrees, but she grew up in a working class neighborhood of Chicago and then moved to a farm.\n\nContinuing an argument put forward by Herrnstein in a landmark 1971 Atlantic article, \"I.Q.,\" Murray argues that the main engine of class segregation has been \"homogamy\" or assortative mating driven by increased education. In 1960, Murray reports, only among 3 percent of married couples did both spouses have a college degree. By 2010, that was up to 25 percent.\n\nIt's revealing that the elite education system has succeeded in fulfilling the dream of \"positive eugenicists\" such as Sir Francis Galton, who called for society to develop institutions to bring together the smartest and hardest-working young people for romance. Among the last three couples in the White House, for example, the Clintons met at Yale Law School and the Obamas were assigned each other because both were Harvard Law students.\n\nAnother reason for the growing class segregation is the decline in the economic importance of natural resources. In a farming and mining economy, smart people tended to spread out over the landscape. In an information economy, they cluster with other smart people. Theoretically, they could now live anywhere and work together over the Internet, but instead they seem to crowd into their industry's dominant metropolitan area. For example, Boston's once-booming Route 128 technology district has been badly surpassed by Silicon Valley.\n\nAt the other end of the class spectrum, however, there's less huddling. In 1993, Murray penned an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal called \"The Coming White Underclass\" in which he predicted the rise of white slum neighborhoods. In Coming Apart , Murray defines the new white underclass as men who don't make enough money in a year to lift two people above the poverty line, single mothers, or \"social isolates\"-people who don't belong to any sort of organized group and don't attend church more than annually.\n\nBy his calculations, only 8 percent of whites were underclass in the late 1960s, but that grew to 17 percent by prosperous 2007, and then over 19 percent during the current downturn. This trend is depressing, but the slope of white working class decay doesn't seem quite as precipitous as in Britain, where illegitimacy, property crime, and drunken brawling are more pervasive.\n\nMoreover, the growth of distinctive white underclass neighborhoods hasn't really come to pass over the last 19 years. The white underclass seems either to be dispersed among more functional family members, to dissipate into the hinterlands, or to get absorbed into demographically vibrant Hispanic neighborhoods.\n\nYet if this trend continues, the underclass would comprise a dystopian 40 percent of the white population by mid-century-which might be enough to notice even in Georgetown.\n\nSteve Sailer is TAC 's film critic and VDARE.com's Monday morning columnist.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "\"I'm your black friend,\" B. L. Wilson assures us , \"but I won't educate you about racism. That's on you.\" This has become a common refrain in the anti-racism movement. White folks (like me) are supposed to come to grips with our own subliminal anti-black prejudices, but without asking black people to explain what those prejudices look like . We may as well demand the French to learn Swedish without asking a Swede. Those who genuinely wish to purge any unconscious bigotry are forced to pay enormous sums of money to other whites who style themselves as \"experts\" on white racism.\n\nHow will we know if our re-education is a success? Nobody can say for sure but, once you've come around to the idea of abolishing the police, you're headed in the right direction.\n\nWhite people are tying themselves into knots trying to awoken themselves, and with little success. As the editor of a Catholic magazine, I've received a number of submissions by young, white Catholics who insist the Church is racist because there aren't any black people in their parish. I point out that, for the better part of a century now, our bishops have discouraged \"proselytism.\" That's why, for every one person who converts to Catholicism, seven people abandon the Faith. Catholics aren't trying to convert black people because we're not trying to convert anyone . The author will nod in agreement, withdraw the submission, and head back to the drawing board.\n\nI understand why black people who experience discrimination at the hands of white people don't want to talk about it with white people. It must be like someone with two healthy parents asking to explain how it felt when your mom died. And I understand why well-meaning whites don't want to ask blacks if we can pick their scabs.\n\nBut what's the alternative? A small group of affluent, educated whites trying to explain racism to themselves-a sin they've never experienced and don't even know they're committing-hoping that, one day, blacks will say, \"Hey, you did it! Good job. There's no more racism. We can all get along now.\"\n\nOf course, that's never going to happen. Which is why a more radical form of anti-racism is now emerging in America. It holds that white people are inherently racist, that \"whiteness\" itself is anti-black. White people are supposed to devote themselves to purging racism from their souls while, at the same time, acknowledging that we are totally incapable of doing so.\n\nThat might explain why so many are despairing of integration altogether. The new, prevailing theory of race in this country now holds that whites and non-whites cannot coexist. White folks, by our nature, will always try to subjugate and marginalize black folks. It's in our DNA.\n\nA third school of anti-racism is now emerging, which we might call \"woke segregationism.\" Black folks are deciding that, since white folks are fundamentally and irredeemably racist, it's best if they strike out on their own.\n\nThere were echoes of woke segregationism in the debate over gentrification. Racism led white people to box black people into urban ghettoes in the middle of the 20th century; racism now leads us to move into those neighborhoods, driving up property value and forcing black residents to move out. And there's a legitimate grievance there. But there's also no clear solution, except for blacks and whites to keep to themselves.\n\nThat's precisely what the Freedom Georgia Initiative has decided to do. A group of 19 black families have just purchased 97 acres of land in rural Wilkinson County in hopes of creating a new, all-black society. \"We needed to create a space and a place where we could be a village again, a tribe again,\" said organizer Ashley Scott. Their despair is understandable. Big Agriculture has ravaged rural Georgia, dispossessing black farmers at a much higher rate than white farmers. It's heartbreaking that some black Georgians feel they have no alternative than to self-segregate but, apparently, that's where we are.\n\nSpeaking of the Catholic Church, at least one of our prelates has enthusiastically embraced woke segregationism. In June, Bishop David Zubik of Pittsburgh announced that he was forming a new parish under his direct control exclusively for black Catholics. \"Along with their sincere enthusiasm and passion for their Catholic faith, I heard and felt their desire to have their unique spiritual and cultural needs met,\" said Bishop Zubik. \"I want to raise awareness of the need to walk with our black sisters and brothers as they continue to enrich and be an integral part of the Diocese of Pittsburgh and the Catholic Church Universal.\"\n\nThe thing is, though, they won't be an integral part of the diocese. That's exactly the point. They'll be tucked away in some ecclesial ghetto. Black parishioners won't enrich the wider Catholic community by isolating themselves from it.\n\nGiven the astonishing decline in American race relations over the course of 2020, there's every reason to believe that woke segregationism will become the favored solution in America by year's end. If \"systemic racism\" is a myth, as I believe that it is, then it's a myth that many of our countrymen-both black and white-take very seriously.\n\n♦♦♦\n\nBlack separatism is nothing new, of course. Louis Farrakhan has expressed hopes that the Trump Administration would implement racist policies, leading African-Americans to abandon their white countrymen. Speaking to the State of the Black World Conference in 2016, Mr. Farrakhan said, \"The white man is going to push. He's putting in place the very thing that will limit the freedom of others.\" Then he pointed to the crowd, smiled and said, \"That's what you needed,\" as motivation to finally separate from whites. \"My message to Mr. Trump: Push it real good,\" Farrakhan continued, building to a roar that drew applause and cheers. \"Push it so good that black people say, 'I'm outta here. I can't take it no more.'\"\n\nWhite nationalists will happily embrace the new segregationism. The rest of white America will simply shake our heads in sorrow and disbelief. Is there nothing we can do but tip our hats and go our separate ways? Whites would never expel blacks from the cities and churches and neighborhoods we share, but what if they choose to leave of their own volition? What can we do but wish them well?\n\nOf course, this could all come to naught. Yet, seeing how much this country has changed in the last four years, only a fool would say that it's impossible. We can't even say it's unlikely, because nothing is \"likely\" in America anymore.\n\nI don't know what to say except I hope it does come to naught. Whatever The New York Times might say, American black and whites (and Hispanics, and Asians, and all the rest) are better for having each other. Slavery and colonialism were great evils; that goes without saying. But they also left us totally incapable of imagining what America would look like if our different ethic groups had no contact with each other. It wouldn't be America in any meaningful way.\n\nThen again, this seems to be a long time coming. The growth of black ghettoes, Chinatowns, and Jewish enclaves show that Americans have never really worked out how to coexist happily. Even as we struggled to integrate blacks and whites after the Civil War, we were herding Native Americans into reservations.\n\nReally, the impulse behind \"woke segregation\" isn't unlike that of the Benedict Option. Many Christians, like many blacks, feel the need to make a tactical retreat in order to escape persecution. The BenOp's principal theorist, TAC 's own Rod Dreher, has even looked to Hasidic communities in New York for inspiration. It should be said that, contrary to what his critics claim, Mr. Dreher isn't a Christian separatist. The Benedict Option is a strategy for Christians to survive and regroup so we can re-evangelize America. The woke segregationists have no plans to reintegrate. They're happy to lock the door and throw away the key.\n\nI'm a BenOpter myself, which may be why I sympathize with black separatists. When secularists tell BenOp types that our fears of persecution are unfounded, we say, \"That's because you've never experienced it.\" When I say that systemic racism is a myth, black people may very well say the same thing to me. Even if I think they're wrong-which, again, I do-who cares what I think? If they believe it so strongly that they're willing to desert their homes and create their own \"villages\" far away from whites, what can I do to stop them?\n\nI can't answer those questions. I have no idea what to do, and I'm not even allowed to ask black people for help. What seems obvious is that America's experiment in multiculturalism is failing. Looking back, it doesn't seem to have gotten very far.\n\nMichael Warren Davis is the editor of Crisis Magazine .

      "text": "Dear White America': Black Professor's Open Letter Asks Readers to 'Admit' to the 'Racist Poison That Is Inside of You\n\nIn an open letter to white Americans, Emory University professor of philosophy George Yancy asked readers to deeply consider \"the ways in which you perpetuate a racist society, the ways in which you are racist.\"\n\nYancy called his letter \"Dear White America\" - published in the New York Times on Christmas Eve - a \"gift.\" In it he also asked readers to not \"run to seek shelter from your own racism. Don't hide from your responsibility. Rather, begin, right now, to practice being vulnerable. Being neither a 'good' white person nor a liberal white person will get you off the proverbial hook.\"\n\nMore from Yancy's letter:\n\nGeorge Yancy (Image source: GeorgeYancy.com)\n\nAgain, take a deep breath. Don't tell me about how many black friends you have. Don't tell me that you are married to someone of color. Don't tell me that you voted for Obama. Don't tell me that I'm the racist. Don't tell me that you don't see color. Don't tell me that I'm blaming whites for everything. To do so is to hide yet again. You may have never used the N-word in your life, you may hate the K.K.K., but that does not mean that you don't harbor racism and benefit from racism. After all, you are part of a system that allows you to walk into stores where you are not followed, where you get to go for a bank loan and your skin does not count against you, where you don't need to engage in \"the talk\" that black people and people of color must tell their children when they are confronted by white police officers.\n\nAs you reap comfort from being white, we suffer for being black and people of color. But your comfort is linked to our pain and suffering. Just as my comfort in being male is linked to the suffering of women, which makes me sexist, so, too, you are racist. That is the gift that I want you to accept, to embrace. It is a form of knowledge that is taboo. Imagine the impact that the acceptance of this gift might have on you and the world.\n\nTake another deep breath. I know that there are those who will write to me in the comment section with boiling anger, sarcasm, disbelief, denial. There are those who will say, \"Yancy is just an angry black man.\" There are others who will say, \"Why isn't Yancy telling black people to be honest about the violence in their own black neighborhoods?\" Or, \"How can Yancy say that all white people are racists?\" If you are saying these things, then you've already failed to listen. I come with a gift. You're already rejecting the gift that I have to offer. This letter is about you. Don't change the conversation. I assure you that so many black people suffering from poverty and joblessness, which is linked to high levels of crime, are painfully aware of the existential toll that they have had to face because they are black and, as Baldwin adds, \"for no other reason.\"\n\n\"What I'm asking is that you first accept the racism within yourself, accept all of the truth about what it means for you to be white in a society that was created for you,\" Yancy wrote. \"I'm asking for you to trace the binds that tie you to forms of domination that you would rather not see. When you walk into the world, you can walk with assurance; you have already signed a contract, so to speak, that guarantees you a certain form of social safety.\"\n\nMore from Yancy's letter:\n\nTake one more deep breath. I have another gift.\n\nIf you have young children, before you fall off to sleep tonight, I want you to hold your child. Touch your child's face. Smell your child's hair. Count the fingers on your child's hand. See the miracle that is your child. And then, with as much vision as you can muster, I want you to imagine that your child is black.\n\nIn peace,\n\nGeorge Yancy\n\nWhile it appeared many of the more than 1,600 comments gave Yancy's letter a thumbs up, there were detractors.\n\n\"The article should have been titled 'Dear Humanity.' Racism isn't endemic to whites only,\" reader Song Yu commented. \"Growing up in the 70s as one of the few Asian Americans in my neighborhood in Connecticut, I occasionally experienced racism from other kids. Particularly relentless badgering about how 'funny' I looked and spoke came from Puerto Rican and Black kids who did not already know me. Desire to feel superior and belonging to a 'better' group is a natural human instinct. We need to fight this instinct through education and awareness. However just picking on the whites is ignoring the true nature of the problem.\"\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \"This focus on getting white people to admit their privilege instead of focusing on conversations about how to improve black schools, inner cities and poverty makes no sense. I don't buy all whites are racists but for the sake of argument, suppose the white race (which itself is very diverse you realize?) admits this. Fine, now what? What's next? How do we destroy gangs in the city? How do we ensure all kids get a good education? How do we stop the violence? Those are topics worth a long-winded NY Times editorial. This isn't.\"\n\n(H/T: New York Times )\n\nDave Urbanski\n\nSr. Editor, News"

      "text": "Not Fair to Be White': See the Unbelievable New Campaign Sponsored by the University of Minnesota-Duluth\n\nHere's a pop quiz: What do we usually call unsubstantiated assumptions about someone's class, or position in life, based upon the color of their skin?\n\nThat's right, racism. And that appears to be what Campus Reform has uncovered at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, which is sponsoring an ad campaign whose core message is very difficult to distinguish from undiluted racism. Watch the ad below if you don't believe us, and if that doesn't convince you, keep reading:\n\nHere is what Campus Reform has to say about the ad campaign:\n\nThe project disseminates its message, that \"society was setup for us [whites]\" and as such is \"unfair,\" through an aggressive campaign of online videos, billboards, and lectures. The ads feature a number of Caucasians confessing their guilt for the supposed \"privilege\" that comes along with their fair features.[...]\n\n\"You give me better jobs, better pay, better treatment, and a better chance - all because of the color of my skin,\" reads one poster that features a close shot of a Caucasian male.\n\nThe Un-Fair campaign also held a series of lectures and events on campus last semester. One included a presentation by Tim Wise , author of Dear White America. In his book, Wise confesses a \"longstanding fantasy\" where he turns to a man with a \"God Bless the USA\" button and asks him, \"why can't you just get over it?\"\n\nThese lectures were publicly endorsed by university Chancellor Lendley Black. Black sent a message to the campus community in April describing his effort to \"create an inclusive campus climate for all\" through providing \"support and... leadership to the Un-Fair Campaign.\"\n\nFor those who are familiar with the work of Tim Wise, this should come as no surprise. Wise is one of the more infamous \"anti-racist\" activists alive, and is especially notable for having written a \"Letter to the White Right\" after the 2010 elections which includes quotes which dance dangerously close to an open desire for genocide. Consider the following, with special attention to the quotes in bold:\n\nAnd for y'all a bit lower on the economic scale, enjoy your Pabst Blue Ribbon, ...\n\nWhatever the case, and whatever your economic station, know this . . .\n\nYou need to drink up.\n\nAnd quickly.\n\nAnd heavily.\n\nBecause your time is limited.[...]\n\nAnd in the pantheon of American history, old white people have pretty much always been the bad guys, the keepers of the hegemonic and reactionary flame, the folks unwilling to share the category of American with others on equal terms.\n\nFine, keep it up. It doesn't matter.\n\nBecause you're on the endangered list.\n\nAnd unlike, say, the bald eagle or some exotic species of muskrat, you are not worth saving.\n\nWise has also accused the Founders of deliberately setting up a white supremacist society on CNN. Ironically, Wise is himself white.\n\nBut even if one of the campaign's speakers is crazy, some might be saying, that doesn't mean the entire campaign is racist, right? Wrong. The evidence shows that this pervasive effort to tar hundreds of millions of people with the racist brush is an integral part of the Un-Fair campaign. For instance, the website associated with the Un-Fair campaign also includes such lovely posters as the following:\n\nAnd bill boards with their slogan:\n\nAs well as four more videos:\n\nAs for the campaign's slogan, \"it's hard to see racism when you're white,\" the irony is almost too deafening to remark upon it at all. We certainly are not prepared to make such a harsh generalization about a race of people, but it does seem fair to say that, if this organization is considered to be representative of the white population, this slogan might have a point. Unfortunately, we don't think self-hatred is the kind of racism they mean.\n\nWorse yet is the fact that the idea of \"white privilege\" is as easily disproved as any other ugly racial stereotype. For instance, unless this campaign wants to argue with a straight face that a coal miner in West Virginia is more privileged than Colin Powell (in which case, they'd be laughed out of most reasonable company), their generalization completely falls apart. More to the point, using the term \"white privilege\" and slogans like \"it's hard to see racism when you're white\" is a transparent and logically fallacious attempt to shut people up. The claim that whites who don't agree with this stereotype are automatically trying to perpetuate racism completes the exercise in bullying that this campaign is.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Blaze reported on the disgustingly racist attitudes of a resident of South Buffalo, who argued in full view of a camera that \"blacks ruin neighborhoods.\" This absurd stereotype was rightfully condemned. Yet now the University of Minnesota Duluth is lending institutional support to a campaign whose message is essentially \"whites ruined the world and are trying to keep it ruined so that they can profit.\" Granted, this isn't particularly surprising, coming from a university whose very administrators consider the Constitution to be a symbol of \"white privilege,\" but it is still wrong.\n\nClearly, the Un-Fair campaign is aptly named.\n\nMytheos Holt"

      "text": "How racial dogma fuels the left's attacks on Trump\n\nBy refusing to surrender, the former president raises the hope that a better, saner way of life remains possible.\n\nDonald Trump has challenged the priorities of the prosecutor in his hush money case by highlighting the decay of New York City. The connection Trump draws is not superficial. It is rooted deeply in the racial politics of the city and the progressive left more widely.\n\nThe reason progressive Democrats want to jail Trump over a dalliance with a porn star - a gravely serious dalliance, they would say - is the same reason they let insane vagrants terrorize subway riders with impunity. It is the same reason that they will never close the southern border and the reason they will always make martyrs out of black men killed by police, no matter the circumstances.\n\nTrump's impenitence threatens the progressive political order and the deadly but delicate lies upon which it rests.\n\nAnti-white demagogue Joy Reid said the quiet part out loud by celebrating the \"poetic\" optics of Trump, the evil avatar of white America, being held \"accountable\" by the first black prosecutor of Manhattan. Reid's honesty is appreciated. It is true that Trump's trial is about something much more than it appears on the surface. He challenges our society in a fundamental way, and the deranged backlash against him cannot be explained without reference to a deeper cause than his superficial foibles.\n\nBefore Trump entered politics, it was considered preordained that America would be invaded continuously with Third Worlders. America would become more diverse, and white people would humble themselves. Most consequently, society would learn to live with more crime and danger, rather than punish disproportionately nonwhite criminals.\n\nTrump took all of these racial dogmas and spit at them. This apostasy from Trump is what Biden actually means when he calls his opponent an enemy of \"our democracy.\" What makes Trump dangerous is that he enjoys a freedom unknown to most Americans, who have been cowed into self-reproach and a tortured politeness. By now, the average American has had it drilled into his head that it is better to get mugged or killed than to be thought a \"racist.\"\n\nThe impenitence of Trump threatens the progressive political order and the deadly but delicate lies upon which it rests. If you read the insidious \"mainstream\" media, violent crimes by illegal aliens are statistically meaningless, and public concern over them is not worth risking an anti-immigrant backlash. Nothing can be permitted to get in the way of America's quiet, inexorable transformation into an extension of Mexico. After all, we are a nation of immigrants.\n\nThe crime wave is, according to the Biden campaign and its surrogates, simply a delusion of the masses to whom Trump is playing pied piper. The chaos that inevitably comes with the progressive project of \"diversity\" must be made to appear as the most natural thing in the world. Beneath the regime's gaslighting is the Orwellian message that barbarism is America's fate. It is our cross to bear for the original sin of white supremacy.\n\nUnder Biden, this deranged precept has been allowed to work itself out at lightning speed. The border has been thrown open, causing a flood of literally millions to pour in. In cities where liberals have all the power, a subset of the population has been permitted to torment the law-abiding majority with impunity.\n\nAll this madness ends up playing to Trump's advantage. He bluntly calls violent migrants \"animals,\" and his honesty is appreciated. His opponent is preoccupied with throwing up distractions and defending the honor of \"the undocumented community,\" itself a euphemism for millions of lawbreakers.\n\nBehind the witch hunts, Trump's real crime, the thing that makes him a satanic figure in the liberal imagination, is his bold, tireless refusal to lie to himself and everyone else by paying honor to the left's fictions. Above all, he rejects the anti-white insanity of the time, an act requiring great courage, for which he has suffered immensely. Amazingly, he has not given up yet. By refusing to surrender, Trump raises the hope that a better, saner way of life remains possible.\n\nMatt Boose"

      "text": "Whitlock: Will Smith is a tool to cancel men\n\nIn the court of public opinion, Will Smith will benefit from the indifference of black elites when it comes to black-on-black violence.\n\nBarack Obama will not issue a statement suggesting that \"Chris Rock could be his brother.\" The Rev. Al Sharpton won't call for a boycott of the Academy if Smith isn't harshly punished. Lawyer Benjamin Crump will not threaten a lawsuit. Black Lives Matter and the NAACP will not take positions on Smith's assault on Chris Rock.\n\nNo one will analogize Smith's slap as a painful reminder of the public abuse black slaves were subjected to by their white masters.\n\nInstead, black elites, aka liberal Negro wranglers, will seek to rationalize, justify, celebrate, and weaponize Smith's emotional and criminal behavior at Sunday's Academy Awards.\n\nLate Monday night, Twitter influencer Jemele Hill floated the first trial balloon in manipulating the narrative related to Smith's unjustified assault. Writing for the Atlantic, Hill argued that the reaction to Smith's crime was a tale of \"two Americas,\" one white and one black. She said she couldn't \"help but notice the disproportionate outrage that many people in white America - and many in the Hollywood elite - are showing\" toward Smith. She pointed to an angry, since-deleted tweet by director Judd Apatow that criticized Smith's \"out of control rage and violence\" and comedian Howard Stern comparing Smith to Trump.\n\nHill's job is to calm white liberals by assuring them that black people do not see Smith's outburst as problematic. To the contrary, Hill insinuated that black people were inspired by Smith's actions. She quoted actress Tiffany Haddish: \"When I saw a black man stand up for his wife, that meant so much to me.\"\n\nThe underlying message of Hill's column in the Atlantic is that black people do not have a set of values and principles that determine our point of view. Everything is based on race.\n\nWe know that had a white male slapped Chris Rock in defense of his wife's honor, Haddish, Obama, Sharpton, Crump, BLM, the NAACP, and Hill would all be disproportionately outraged. There would be calls for the white actor to be stripped of his award, permanently banned from the Oscars, and jailed for several weeks or months.\n\nNone of that will happen to Smith because black elites will and have convinced the establishment that the bad behavior of black people should not be taken seriously. Black Lives Do Not Matter. White perpetrators matter.\n\nChris Rock is Mychal Moultry Jr., a 4-year-old black boy shot in the head in Chicago. Rock is Serenity Broughton, a 7-year-old black girl killed by a bullet to the chest in Chicago. Black elites have not and never will beg you to say Mychal Moultry's or Serenity Broughton's names. They're unimportant. They were not killed by white people.\n\nChris Rock, despite his fame and wealth, is unimportant, too. He was slapped by the wrong-colored perpetrator. Rock knows it. That's why he won't be pressing charges against Smith. He won't be asking the Academy to strip Smith of his best actor award.\n\nBlack men settling their petty differences with violence is acceptable behavior in America. It's acceptable because the black voices granted the largest microphones tell the world to ignore our violent mistreatment of each other.\n\nThirty minutes after Smith assaulted Rock, the white and black liberal elites assembled inside Dolby Theater showered Smith with applause as he blamed Richard Williams, the father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams, and God for inspiring his attack on Rock. Smith cried. He proclaimed that love will make you do crazy things. He said he was a crazy father just like Richard Williams. He said he was overwhelmed by what God had called him to do.\n\nHis acceptance speech was absolutely deranged. He sounded like Jim Jones addressing his followers in Guyana. The audience of elites drank Smith's Kool-Aid.\n\nNo one should be rationalizing Smith's behavior. We should be pleading for Smith to get mental and emotional help. Stripping Smith of his Oscar might shake him from some of the delusion created by living the past 35 years as a pampered and entitled celebrity. Punishment serves the perpetrator as much as the victim.\n\nSmith's 160-word apology was weak. He assaulted Rock on an international television broadcast. He wrote an apology on Instagram. He continued to pretend that Rock's harmless G.I. Jane joke was a bridge too far. Six days before the Oscars, Jada Pinkett Smith released a TikTok video claiming she loved her shaved head and that she did not care what people thought of her hairstyle.\n\nWill Smith needs to explain why he initially laughed at Rock's joke. Beyond an apology, he should state how he plans to atone for embarrassing Rock, the Williams family, the Academy, and overshadowing the other nominees and winners.\n\nSmith needs to be held accountable. His actions damaged public discourse. Comedians play an important role in free societies. They protect and expand free speech. Comedians and ministers are authorized to speak uncomfortable truths. We expect them to say things publicly that others won't have the courage to do.\n\nDave Chappelle creates the room for the public to ponder whether we've gone too far in protecting the sensitivities of the LGBTQIA+ community. Joe Rogan's podcast lets us debate the appropriateness of mask and vaccine mandates.\n\nJemele Hill and Tiffany Haddish support Smith slapping Rock because they want to live in a world where no one questions the motives, behavior, and logic of black women.\n\nRock is collateral damage in a war to silence men. Will Smith is a Trojan horse in that war.\n\nJason Whitlock\n\nBlazeTV Host"

      "text": "Joy Reid complains that the close election only means there is 'great amount of racism and anti-blackness' in US\n\nSure, Joy\n\nMSNBC host Joy Reid says that there's a \"great amount of racism and anti-blackness\" in the United States as evidenced by the fact that the 2020 presidential election is so close.\n\nAs highlighted by The Hill , Reid said Wednesday that the amount of racism in the country is staggering, and the fact that the presidential election is so close is both \"aggravating\" and \"disappointing.\"\n\n\"I think partly because we knew the red wave was a thing, the red mirage, I should say, we all knew it was coming,\" Reid told fellow MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. \"In the moment, it's aggravating. And I think partly, and I said this last night, I do think it's because we've been reporting for five years, Rachel, about Russia ... undermining our national security, the impeachment, the racism, the Nazis, all of it and then COVID laying on top of it, [it] felt like a repudiation was coming.\"\n\nReid added that a lot of people also believe that political correctness is \"some scheme to destroy white America.\"\n\n\"I think even though we intellectually understand what America is at its base, right?\" she continued. \"That there is a great amount of racism, anti-blackness, anti-wokeness, this idea that political correctness is some scheme to destroy white America, right? We know what this country is, but still part of you, I think part of your heart says, you know what, maybe the country's going to pay off all of this pain, the children that were stolen with a repudiation. And as the night wore on and I realized and it sunk in, OK, that's not happening, we are still who we thought, unfortunately.\"\n\nReid said that on the whole, she's vastly disappointed in the election, and in U.S. voters as a whole.\n\n\"It's disappointing,\" she admitted. \"And I emerged from this disappointed.\"\n\nReid took fire Wednesday after she referred to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as \"Uncle Clarence\" - a clear nod to the racist term \"Uncle Tom.\"\n\nIn social media remarks, Reid addressed President Donald Trump's insistence that he plans to take close races to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"If somehow they manage to stumble into the Supreme Court, do any of you guys expect Uncle Clarence and Amy Coney Barrett and those guys to actually follow the letter of the law?\" Reid asked her followers. \"No. It's a completely politicized Supreme Court that you can't just trust they'll do the right thing. ... Now, so far, the courts have actually been pretty good. So we'll see.\"\n\nNeedless to say, Reid's remarks didn't go over well, and many of her fellow Twitter users called her out for what they said was blatant racism.\n\nSarah Taylor"

      "text": "Rev. Sharpton Responds to Blaze 'Shocking Racism' Video\n\nRev. Al Sharpton is responding to a video posted on The Blaze Tuesday morning, by saying the message emphasized in the video was not indicative of the \"whole rally.\"\n\nThe Blaze stands by the video which includes Sharpton's concerns over the 8/28 \"Restoring Honor\" rally in DC and his assertion on Saturday that \"They want to disgrace this day.\"  The video contrasts segments from Saturday's \"Restoring Honor\" rally with the \"Redeem the Dream\" event held on 8/28/00 in the same location. That event was co-sponsored by Sharpton's National Action Network.\n\nhttps://blip.tv/file/4066020\n\nThe most controversial sections of the video include comments by New Black Panther activist Malik Zulu Shabazz. Shabazz would become the leader of the New Black Panthers shortly after the 2000 rally.\n\nThe video features Sharpton's affirmation of the New Black Panthers and Shabazz declaring solidarity with Sharpton.\n\nAfter leading a call that has the \"black jury\" finding \"white America\" guilty of \"injustice and racism,\" Shabazz calls on black young people, including \"gang members,\"  to unite against the \"common enemy.\"\n\nShabazz goes on to articulate a \"black dream that when we see caskets rolling in the black community...that we will see caskets and funerals in the community of our enemy as well.\"\n\nI talked with Rev. Sharpton Tuesday evening about his concerns over the video. He disagreed with The Blaze characterization of the event as a \"Sharpton rally.\"  He explained that his National Action Network was a co-sponsor of the event along with the Southern Leadership Christian Conference.\n\nSharpton further explained that he disagreed with the message of Shabazz and says he expressed his disagreement at the time. I asked Sharpton how and when he made that expression. He indicated that the overall tone of the \"whole rally\" made the message clear. Further, he said that he was asked about Shabazz's comments at a news conference after the event. Sharpton said he did not remember hearing Shabazz's \"caskets\" comments. He recalled being asked if he agreed with Shabazz's view that the dream of Dr. King had become a \"nightmare.\" He said he indicated his disagreement with that sentiment. The Blaze could not independently verify Sharpton's recollection about the news conference.\n\nWe did reexamine the video of the event. Sharpton does return to the podium immediately after Shabbaz. He makes no comment about Shabbaz's speech and simply moves on to introduce the next speaker.\n\nI did ask Rev. Sharpton about his charge that the \"Restoring Honor\" rally would \"disgrace this day.\"  Sharpton said he felt that the actual event was different than how he believed Glenn Beck had originally characterized it, but that he didn't want to get into a \"name calling thing with him.\" After he expressed some areas of agreement with Beck, I asked him for his current opinion of the 8/28 event. He said it was \"fine.\"\n\nScott Baker"

      "text": "Couch: USA Today sports columnist Mike Freeman plays the role of clown in new column bashing the NFL\n\nUSA Today published a column this week claiming the NFL's new taunting rule is about \"control of black bodies.\" Longtime NFL reporter Mike Freeman wrote the fascinating and baffling piece.\n\nYes, I thought the NFL went a little overboard penalizing taunting. When players taunt each other after big plays, it looks stupid, unprofessional, and self-indulgent. But I'm not sure it warrants a 15-yard penalty and a $10,000 fine. The league might have been best served asking refs to shrug their shoulders and give the offending player a look of disapproval. The NFL is a TV show with a cast of characters jockeying for attention.\n\nSo, apparently, is USA Today. Mike Freeman taunted those of us with common sense. He argued in print that the NFL's new policy is a plot to woo back Trump supporters who abandoned the league - which he calls \"Trump adjacent\" - over Colin Kaepernick. It's a curb on black protest and a \"social justice counterbalance.\"\n\nWTF?\n\n\"The league used Kaepernick as a cautionary tale,\" Freeman wrote. \"'You can only protest in the way we deem appropriate. If you step outside of those boundaries, you'll get the Kaepernick treatment.'\"\n\nI don't think so. Is a 15-yard taunting penalty really a civil rights issue, Mike? I'm calling BS on Freeman here for recklessly bringing race into this, which minimizes serious race issues. He's wrong, and also what he said is insulting to black people.\n\nOf course, the media work in flocks. There also was Carron J. Phillips at Deadspin, who said that \"after the fallout from the NFL's continued blackballing of Colin Kaepernick and exposure for race norming, this is the NFL's way of telling white America: 'Hey, don't worry. We still have these n*****s on a tight leash.'\"\n\nNo. It isn't. The NFL is an outward-facing business that thinks taunting is a bad look and a turnoff to paying customers.\n\nNot only that, but also there is no continued blackballing of Kaepernick. The league attempted to hold a tryout for him, but he sabotaged it, didn't show up, and tried to hijack the moment into self-promotion. He doesn't want to play in the NFL any more; it would wreck his career as a professional victim.\n\nAnd NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is not so stupid as to think that a 15-yard taunting penalty can be used to bring back white fans who left the game because the league was allowing players to take a knee during the national anthem.\n\nTalk about convoluted. I mean, what is the argument here exactly? That black athletes aren't capable of acting professionally or with a little decorum and self-control? And that they should be excused?\n\nIsn't that insulting?\n\nFootball players aren't yelling in their opponents' faces or spinning the ball on the ground in front of them like a mic drop as an expression that Black Lives Matter. They're doing it because they are trained to be amped up. They're in a mentality of hitting the other guy and showing they're the better man.\n\nAnd when they're done proving their point, they're just looking for an exclamation mark. Or, sometimes, they're just doing it for show.\n\nAnd the NFL doesn't think that show sells.\n\nIn addition, the NFL isn't in any financial trouble over its social justice stances. It won that battle. Attendance is up, TV money is rolling in, and the league weathered the storm much better than the NBA did.\n\nThat's not to say there hasn't been a place for taunting in history or that it hasn't carried social meaning. Muhammad Ali used to do it. Jack Johnson did it, famously standing over James Jeffries, hand on hip.\n\nSometimes taunting is just for fun. I was at an Olympics where Usain Bolt was under the stands about to come out for a relay. He walked past an opposing relay team - and me - and told them to enjoy the sight of the bottom of his shoes. They laughed and told him they hoped he wouldn't drop the baton in front of all those people who are watching, and wouldn't that be embarrassing?\n\nThat's just the culture of sprinters. They did it for fun and were all laughing together and hugging after the race, which, of course, Bolt won.\n\nAs a tennis coach, I once worked with a high school kid whose dad asked for help. I hit with the kid for two minutes and thought \"Uh-oh, this kid is way better than I'll ever be.\" Then we played an entire set in about 15 minutes, and I won 6-0.\n\nThe problem was clear: He was too nice. You might not know this, but as a one-on-one sport, tennis is very mentally aggressive. Attacking, really. I told the kid to taunt me:\n\n\"Any time you win a point, stare me down across the net, point at me and yell 'F YOU,'\" I said. I was building a mentality. After a few minutes, I told him to stop pointing and screaming, but just to think those things inside.\n\nThat seems to be what Goodell is telling the players now.\n\n\"One theory,\" Freeman wrote, \"is that the league knew it might face potential backlash from conservatives over some of the social justice measures it planned to enact this season, and the taunting rule emphasis was a way to appease conservatives who didn't like the measures.\"\n\nOne theory? Whose theory? Your friends in the media, who bow down for approval among themselves on Twitter?\n\nNo. The taunting penalty isn't \"racist\" as the Deadspin headline said. At some point, Phillips said, the NFL will take heat over these taunting penalties and \"will put Tony Dungy on TV to speak on their behalf, as he so often does whenever the league needs him to put a positive spin on one of their racist decisions.\"\n\nNow, if you want to talk racist, how about suggesting that Dungy is a puppet of the league's white owners and commissioner, not strong enough to think for himself?\n\nGreg Couch"

      "text": "Republicans and Winning the Minority Vote\n\nThe reaction to the Romney/Ryan loss of 2012 by many Republicans was a complete meltdown. The opinion by many on the right was that the day of reckoning had come where they needed to sway the Hispanic vote; immediately John McCain and Marco Rubio got to work on an amnesty bill and almost no one asked any questions.  To many Republicans 2016 depended on the Hispanic vote.\n\nUnfortunately, none of that was the case. Had Mitt Romney coped Bush's figures with Hispanic voters- between 35% and 44% depending on the exit polls you believe- Romney still would have lost. In fact had Romney received 70% of the Hispanic vote in 2012 he still would have lost. The 2012 loss had nothing to do with the Hispanics and everything to do with the Black and blue-collar white vote. The latter of which failed to come out and vote at all.\n\nThe New York Times put out a political calculator of the Electoral College results based upon racial turnout.\n\nAnalyze this, had Romney increased his percentage of the Hispanic vote to 70% he still would have lost 270 to 268.\n\nHowever, had Romney increased his percentage of the Black vote to 70%, he would have won 365 to 173.\n\nIf Romney increased his percentage of the White vote to 70%, he would have won 382 to 156.\n\nIt was the overwhelming rejection by Black Americans and the apathy by White Americans that killed the Romney campaign.  Increasing these two voting groups would have set him to electoral victory.\n\nRepublicans need to focus more on reaching the needs of working class Americans, both White and Black.   It is the working class that the presidency is won.\n\nNow obviously Republicans capturing 70% of either the Black or White vote would be difficult.  The point is true, there was no reasonable Hispanic outreach that could have saved the Mitt Romney campaign in 2012.\n\nThe idea of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan running for ticket didn't appeal to blue-collar America and rightfully so.  However working-class White America could be on the GOP's side if they are convinced the GOP is on their side.\n\nAs for the Black vote, several Republicans have succeeded in attaining a sizeable number of their vote in the last two decades.\n\nMichael Steele\n\nBefore he was the Chairman of the RNC, Michael Steele ran for the US Senate in Maryland in 2006.  It was a terrible year for Republicans as the backlash to the war in Iraq took its toll on the party.  Despite running a very strong campaign, Steele had a respectable loss of 54% to 44%. Nonetheless, Steele was able to capture 25% of the African-American vote in Maryland.\n\nArlene Specter\n\nBefore defecting from the party in order to avoid a primary from now Senator Pat Toomey, Specter was a Republican for 44 years.  In 2004, last re-election bid as a Republican, Specter captured a decisive 25% of the African-American vote in Pennsylvania. He went on to win all but four counties in the state and a total of 52.6% of the popular vote.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger\n\nThe former body-builder, former Kennedy-in-law, was up for re-election in 2006 in one of the bluest states in the country.  He was re-elected by a huge 17-point margin and won 27% of the Black vote in California.   Schwarzenegger also won 39% of the Hispanic vote and a huge 62% of the Asian vote and 63% of the White Vote.\n\nGeorge Voinovich\n\nVoinovich started his career in politics in the 1970's in Cleveland, Ohio.  After spending time as a mayor, congressman, lieutenant governor and governor before he ran for the senate in 1998.  It was during re-election in 2004 that Voinovich captured 32% of the African American vote in Ohio.  He won every county in the state, trampling his opponent 64% to 36%.  Voinovich never lost an election in his life.\n\nDino Rossi\n\nIn his first bid for the Governorship of Washington State, Dino Rossi lost by 129 votes.  It was one of the closest statewide elections in United States history.   Although Rossi lost, he captured 37% of the Washington State's African-American vote and 31 of Washington States 39 counties.\n\nJodi Rell\n\nJodi Rell was the Lieutenant Governor who found herself in charge when her boss, then Governor John Rowland was found in a corruption scandal.  Many would expect someone in that position to be a lame-duck Governor, not Jodi.  She became one of the most popular governors in Connecticut history.  She won a landslide re-election in 2006, garnering 63% of the vote.  She won every county and an astounding 40% of the Black vote and 45% of the Hispanic vote.\n\nMike Huckabee\n\nThe Fox News host was Governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007.  It was his 1998 re-election campaign though where he won nearly 60% of the vote and nearly 48% of African-American vote.\n\nRepublicans would do well to reach out to any and everyone who can find a home in their party no matter what their race is.  However, if Republicans are looking for the minority vote to win, it's no the Hispanic vote. The only way for Republicans to get back in the White House is with the blue collared and Black voters.\n\n--\n\nMore Contributions From TheBlaze:\n\nRyan James Girdusky"

      "text": "The slow death of white America: How will the great melting pot adapt to the millions of black and Hispanic voters who swept Obama back to power, asks TOM LEONARD\n\nBy TOM LEONARD\n\nPublished: 20:01 EDT, 8 November 2012 | Updated: 11:54 EDT, 9 November 2012\n\n256\n\nView comments\n\nFor Republicans struggling to understand their defeat at the polls, the most chilling statistic in this week's presidential election was this: Mitt Romney won the biggest share of the white vote that any Republican White House contender ever has - and he still lost.\n\nIn an election battle that was defined as much as anything by race, Mitt Romney won the support of 59 per cent of whites, but just 27 per cent of Latinos, 26 per cent of Asian-Americans and 6 per cent of African-Americans.\n\nThirty years ago, being unpopular with ethnic minorities would hardly have stopped a white establishment candidate like Romney from trouncing Barack Obama. But back then, whites accounted for almost 90 per cent of voters. Now they make up just 72 per cent of the electorate, and that figure is shrinking by the year.\n\nDefeated: Mitt Romney won the support of 59 per cent of whites, but just 27 per cent of Latinos, 26 per cent of Asian-Americans and 6 per cent of African-Americans\n\nTuesday's election showed a large turnout by Hispanics, who constituted some 10 per cent of voters - more than ever before. With 71 per cent of them voting for Mr Obama - notably in a handful of crucial swing states such as Florida, Colorado and Nevada, where they turned out at the polls in unusually high numbers - Hispanic voters gave the President his winning margin.\n\nIn other key states, such as Ohio, pundits said a strong showing by Hispanic and black voters together ensured an Obama victory.\n\nThe Republican party, said one pollster, 'will be doomed if they lose black and Latino votes by these same margins in the future'.\n\nHe's not exaggerating. As the election highlighted, white America is dying - and in a quite literal sense.\n\nSolidarity: A strong showing by Hispanic and black voters in key states like Ohio, ensured an Obama victory\n\nThe evidence of this demographic timebomb, which is likely to alter the face and character of the U.S. far more fundamentally than any number of elections, was made plain in the summer in a new report by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nIt revealed that for the first time in American history, ethnic minorities now account for more than half the babies born in the U.S.\n\nOf the four million children born in the year to July 2011, 50.4 per cent were ethnic minorities - black, Asian, mixed-race and, above all, Hispanic.\n\nIt was a long-expected milestone on the road to an America in which, according to experts, within 30 years whites will no longer be the majority.\n\nRather, the U.S. will boast 130 million Hispanics, more than the current population of Mexico. Among under 18-year-olds, whites will become a minority as early as 2019.\n\nDiverse: Of the four million children born in the year to July 2011, 50.4 per cent were ethnic minorities, black, Asian, mixed-race and, above all, Hispani\n\nFor a country founded by British colonists on British traditions and, for half its history inhabited almost entirely by white Europeans (if you discount the slaves, as the nation's leaders did), it signals a seismic cultural transformation for the world's sole superpower.\n\nGiven that immigration has become the country's single most divisive issue, predictably some Americans have been punching the air for joy at the decline of a white majority, while others are bereft at what they see as the leaching away of their nation's traditional character.\n\nLiberals wedded to a multi-ethnic future insist it will be an opportunity to reinvigorate the U.S., creating a more diversified, open-minded and 21st century country.\n\nAt the other extreme are conservatives who believe the 'death' of white America spells cultural, economic and political doom for their country, and an end to the values of self-sufficiency that made their country great. And in between the two extremes are most rank-and-file Americans, who understand that the U.S. needs new blood if it is to avoid Japan and Europe's economic nightmare of an ageing population, but who are worried by the implications of what has been dubbed the 'browning' of the U.S.\n\nAs they sit on a bus or train listening to Mexican Americans chat away in Spanish, they may wonder if their country's famous ability to assimilate all newcomers is going to work in the next century.\n\nOutspoken: Pat Buchanan says that 'white America is a dying tribe'\n\nConservative thinker Pat Buchanan, a senior adviser to Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, is an outspoken critic of recent immigration. For him, 'white America is a dying tribe', and the ethnic minority tribes that are jostling to fill the gap are simply not up to the task of competing against the rising power of China.\n\nWhen, 14 years ago, President Bill Clinton told students in Oregon that it would be better for America when everyone was a minority, Buchanan waspishly observed that those students would one day 'have to spend their golden years in a Third World America'.\n\nUnlike in the past, it isn't black Americans who are the greatest political concern for the defenders of 'old' America, but Hispanics from Mexico and Latin America - the legacy of four decades of economic migration by millions who have come north looking for a job and a chance to find the American Dream.\n\nThe problem, in the eyes of many conservatives, is that compared with the generations of Irish, Germans, Jews, Poles and Italians before them, pitifully few Hispanics have yet found that dream. Most Hispanics - two-thirds of whom originate from Mexico - continue to be stuck limpet-like at the bottom of society, a quiet, often overlooked army doing the most menial jobs such as picking fruit, washing cars, toiling in restaurant kitchens and cleaning offices.\n\nThanks to the sweeping away of immigrant quotas, the immigrant population has quadrupled since 1970, with nearly 14 million entering the country between 2000 and 2010 alone.\n\nMexicans are by far the biggest group - of the 12 million now living in the U.S., about half are there legally. (It is sobering to learn that the U.S. population of around 226 million in 1980 has now increased to more than 314 million.)\n\nAmerica's struggling economy and toughened border controls have put a brake on immigration, but the problem for those upset by the country's changing demographics is that whites - while still constituting 72 per cent of the population - aren't having enough children.\n\nThe fertility rate for Hispanic women is 2.4 children, compared with 2.1 for black women, and only 1.8 for whites. Latinos don't just have more children - already more than a quarter of all babies - but they are also much younger. While the average age of American whites is 42, for Hispanics it is just 27.\n\nChanging demographics: America's toughened border controls have put a brake on immigration, but whites aren't having enough children to sustain their share of the population\n\nIn much of America's south-west, there is growing tension between richer but increasingly beleaguered older white people and younger, poorer Latinos.\n\nEarlier this year, a Texas pizza chain called Pizza Patron drew a storm of protest from conservatives after launching a promotion to give free slices to anyone who could order in Spanish. (In 2007, the company's bosses even received death threats after they started accepting Mexican pesos as another stunt.)\n\nPat Buchanan told me that white Middle America feels it has been abandoned. 'They watch on cable TV as illegal aliens walk into their country and are rewarded with free healthcare and education for their kids, take jobs away from U.S. workers and carry Mexican flags while marching in American cities to demand U.S. citizenship: they sense that they are losing their country, and they are right,' he said.\n\nHe insisted there are increasingly 'two Americas': white and northern Asian-Americans from China, Japan and South Korea, who have higher incomes and far better educational qualifications than the other half of the divided nation - the Hispanic and African-Americans.\n\nIn this, at least, his opponents will concede he has a point. America - like Britain - desperately needs a well-qualified workforce to compete in the world, but just 13 per cent of adult Latinos have a college degree, compared with 18 per cent of blacks and 31 one per cent of whites.\n\nBuchanan believes Britain, with the rest of Europe, faces the same fate as the U.S. under the relentless logic of a dwindling white population and growing minorities.\n\n'There's nothing the British can do because they're not reproducing,' he said. 'They're getting older, they're going to die and someone's going to come in and take it over. I think Europe is finished.'\n\nLiberal demographic experts such as Bill Frey at the think-tank the Brookings Institution dismiss doom-mongering about Hispanics as the irrational fear of a generation who - owing to a dearth of immigration between the Thirties and Seventies - never had to grow up with an influx of newcomers. Americans were just as scared of Italian immigrants when they arrived in the early 20th century, he argues. He says Hispanic immigrants bring 'enthusiasm, energy and inventiveness' to America - qualities you can't measure by the size of their bank account or their number of degrees.\n\nWhat's more, he says,  while it always takes about three generations for immigrants to start moving up through society, surveys show Hispanic immigrants really do want to become 'mainstream Americans'. They 'just' need government help - education, housing, social services, English lessons - to give them a leg-up.\n\nWith this touchstone issue set to dominate much of America's social and political debate in the coming years, the Republican Party is left to wrestle with the issue of how it can attract voters who are not wedded to the traditional values it espouses.\n\nThe sensible response for the party will be to turn to its strong line-up of young, ethnic minority figures - particularly charismatic Cuban-American Marco Rubio, a Florida senator - who are waiting in the wings as future leaders.\n\nIf instead it chooses another candidate like Romney in 2016, it may be doomed to failure again.\n\n'Harsh rhetoric about Hispanics is for some Republicans rather like smoking - you know it will kill you, but you do it anyway,' says party pollster Whit Ayres.\n\nIf those in the leadership don't 'break the habit', he says grimly, the Republican party is finished.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

It's the very opposite of what the EU is all about. The very opposite of the multi-lateralism that the US and the UK have led on for the last 70 years.'\n\nThe embarrassing video showed Mr Trudeau - along with Boris Johnson, French president Emmanuel Macron and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte - standing in a huddle drinking at Tuesday night's Buckingham Palace reception.\n\nAlthough Mr Trump was not mentioned by name, they appeared to mock the US President and his long impromptu press conferences earlier in the day.\n\nWhen asked about the footage and Mr Trudeau at the Nato summit in Watford yesterday, Mr Trump responded: 'Well, he's two-faced.'\n\nIn the latest escalation of a war of words between the two leaders, Mr Khan also condemned Mr Trump for 'calling people rapists because they happen to be Mexican'.\n\nThe Muslim mayor criticised Mr Trump, who has been in London as well this week during the Nato summit, for 'having a travel ban against people of my faith'.\n\nHe told CNN: 'The concern we have is when President Trump talks about America First - does he really mean white America first? That's a big concern for many of us.'\n\nLabour politician Mr Khan added that Republican Mr Trump's actions 'on many, many occasions... gives us the impression that all he cares about is white America.'\n\nHe continued: 'When you see... the President of the USA calling people rapists because they happen to be Mexican, having a travel ban against people of my faith, that leads to huge concerns across the world.'\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania at 10 Downing Street in London on Tuesday\n\nMr Trump and Mr Khan have exchanged insults over the past four years, with Mr Khan referring to Mr Trump in June as a '6ft 3in child in the White House'.\n\nThat came three weeks after Mr Trump described Mr Khan as a 'stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me' and also made fun of his short stature.\n\nMr Khan previously called on the UK Government in June 2017 to cancel Mr Trump's state visit to Britain because 'his policies go against everything we stand for'.\n\nBut Mr Trump has also described Mr Khan as a 'disaster', adding that the mayor is a 'national disgrace who is destroying the city of London'.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "JUSTIN WEBB: The tragic irony is, that under Barack Obama's policy of not being black, America has become MORE divided by race\n\nBy JUSTIN WEBB FOR THE DAILY MAIL\n\nPublished: 20:20 EDT, 19 July 2016 | Updated: 22:36 EDT, 19 July 2016\n\n21\n\nView comments\n\nLike many of the most persuasive public speakers, Barack Obama has always had a neat line in self-deprecation.\n\nShortly before being elected President in 2008 he told an audience: 'Contrary to the rumours you have heard, I was not born in a manger. I was actually born on Krypton and sent here by my father, Jor-el, to save the planet Earth.'\n\nIn other words, he was saying, he was Superman, not Jesus.\n\nSometimes I used to wonder if he was completely joking. Be in no doubt that this man, when he arrived on political Earth, was not coming among us to make up the numbers.\n\nHe was on a mission - a mission to bring change.\n\nSometimes we should wonder if Barack Obama was joking when he said, in 2008, that he was Superman, not Jesus, says columnist Justin Webb\n\nWhich is why, as he prepares to leave office, there is so much anguish among some of his keenest supporters at the grim fact that race relations in the U.S are as bad today as they were when the world was marvelling at Obama's rise.\n\nIn fact, incredibly, some think they are worse, as bad as they were during the Los Angeles riots of 1992.\n\nThe murder of three policemen by an African American in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, this week may well prove to be further evidence of how horribly wrong things have gone. It came after five policemen were killed and seven others injured in Dallas by a black militant.\n\nSymbolic\n\nThe shootings of black men by police, the revenge killings, the demonstrations and near riots: this was not what Americans expected when they chose Obama. This was not in the script. So what went wrong?\n\nAt the August 2008 Denver Convention when Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the fight for the Democratic Party nomination, I spied, one warm evening, Michelle and the children being driven home. It melted the heart.\n\nThey were in one of those huge presidential 4x4s with the secret service men hanging out of the open doors. I caught the briefest glimpse of the Obama family's faces as they passed, peering out from the depths of the car, cocooned by grey-suited, heavily armed white people.\n\nIt looked so brilliantly symbolic. Nothing could have been more completely supportive of Obama's big claim in a speech: 'There is no Black America and White America.' Surely change had come.\n\nThe truth is that it was a self-deluding daydream. Change couldn't come that easily. And Barack Obama knew that.\n\nThe man who promised, when he was given the nomination: 'This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,' made no such grand promises about race. In fact, he made none at all.\n\nThe truth is that America did not actually elect a black man to the White House. You might just about be able to argue that this is true physically: Obama is of mixed race with a white mother, but psychologically, intellectually and politically, Obama is not a black politician.\n\nAnd Obama never sought to hide that. This was not a black administration with black concerns at its heart, indeed in his first term he had one of the smallest number of black cabinet members in recent times - fewer than George W. Bush.\n\nPresident Obama had fewer black cabinet members than George W. Bush, pictured\n\nNo, Obama never intended to be a black president. Remember the controversy over the Reverend Jeremiah Wright?\n\nHe had been a pastor and friend to the Obamas but during the election campaign, video surfaced of the pastor revealing himself to be the angriest of angry black men, calling for reparations for slavery, blaming the U.S. for 9/11, screaming: 'God damn America!'\n\nObama reacted with a speech that many still believe was the finest of his career. Entitled 'A More Perfect Union', it ranged across the whole American experience and included poignant details of his own life; including the fact that his white grandmother had confessed to him that she was frightened of black men.\n\nObama refused to condemn Rev. Wright just as he refused to condemn his granny.\n\n'These people are a part of me,' he said, 'and they are a part of America, this country that I love.' It was a thoughtful speech which refused to preach to either side. And it was made when Obama still needed the support of white Americans to gain power, which caused many to think Obama was just holding back on the subject of race to get elected.\n\nOnce he made it to the White House he would be like the firebrand Al Sharpton, or the veteran civil rights campaigner and failed presidential hopeful, Jesse Jackson.\n\nBut that was never his plan. He simply does not believe that such anger works. He actually does not feel it.\n\nFrustration\n\nAnd for some African Americans that is now a problem, because they feel let down. The Rev. Wright still preaches in North Carolina but now refers to his former friend as 'our Halfrican-American president'.\n\nIt is difficult to avoid a sense that following the recent killings, Wright's madcap anger rings more bells with black Americans than it did in 2008; in other words, Obama's approach has lost ground in the nearly eight years he has been in power.\n\nThe reasons are not difficult to find. Obama, in that More Perfect Union speech, called on black people to 'bind their grievances' to those of all Americans hoping for better lives.\n\nBut the binding never happened. There is something about black life in America that seems to prevent it: something difficult to shift.\n\nAnd there is real frustration with Obama from some black people; as one prominent black commentator put it recently: 'He bends so far backward to avoid giving offence, even to those who richly deserve offending, that he must need regular sessions with a chiropractor.'\n\nU.S. Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is introduced before she speaks at a campaign event at the Culinary Academy Training Center in North Las Vegas, Nevada, yesterday\n\nWhat many African Americans say is that Obama's dream cannot happen until he and other well-meaning people stop calling for racial unity and start telling white people the truth.\n\nAs one black writer put it recently: 'We need whites to stop being racist.' They look for their president to speak out and are angry that even with the Obamas in the White House, black poverty and black rates of imprisonment are as awful as they ever were.\n\nAccording to the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute, nearly 46 per cent of young black children under the age of six live in poverty in America, compared to 14.5 per cent of white children.\n\nSeriously: nearly half of all black kids are disadvantaged from the start of their lives.\n\nIt's nice that Obama's daughter Malia is off to Harvard after attending one of the nation's finest private schools; nice to see a black girl making it in the world of education. But jarring as well that his family's experience and that of other black families is so different.\n\nEven the figures for black incarceration do not seem to raise Obama's blood pressure. According to Pew Research, one in 87 working-aged white men is in prison or jail, compared with one in 36 Hispanic men but a community-destroying one in 12 African-American men.\n\nYoung black men with no high school diplomas are more likely to be in jail (37 per cent) than employed (26 per cent).\n\nScrapheap\n\nAgain, in an area where there was hope, change did not come.\n\nAnd yet: what if Obama's instincts not to confront the issue were right? White people are going to be a minority in America by the middle of this century in any case.\n\nThe decline of white power is written in the demographic DNA of the modern United States. It is a given and cannot be dodged.\n\nPerhaps Obama, by just being president, has made enough of a point.\n\nPerhaps he has done his bit. The trouble is that such a professorial approach might suit a 55-year-old successful man who has risen to be president and whose kids are going to Harvard.\n\nIt does not look so good if you voted for that man and your life is still dismal, if your son is going to prison or is at the bottom of the economic scrapheap.\n\nBarack Obama's policy of not being black has served him well for most of his presidency.\n\nThe risk is that it is blowing up in his face in his final months in office.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nBombshell new report reveals who made fatal mistake that caused Black Hawk to collide with jet and kill 67\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

By show of hands, how many of you could see it? Some people are sitting here, 'Oh no, I don't want to raise my hand,' that's called denial.'\n\n'There is no discussion about the delusions and the perversion of whiteness,' he added. 'Say this with me: rape culture in America is a legal, economic, and moral institution.\n\n'We have it written in the law, you can rape black women - but we've never been a racist country. This goes beyond gaslighting, and it's rooted in psychological delusion.'\n\nControversial lecturer Dante King has canceled his upcoming guest appearance at the University of California San Francisco after locking horns with right-wing student groups who published videos of his bizarre anti-white rants online\n\nKing, 48, was scheduled to give a two-day anti-racism class for doctors and nurses at the school (pictured) in February, but he stepped back amid the backlash led by conservative group Young America's Foundation\n\nThe controversy stemmed from a talk King gave at UCSF during Black History Month in February last year, when he argued that the treatment of black people in America over the generations has been 'psychopathic'\n\nHe added: 'As much as we want to talk about how bad anti-blackness is, it is the foundation of all American, all white American, institutions.'\n\nThe video prompted a flood of people to call out King for 'racism' - but some also attacked him in racial terms. King shared emails with the San Francisco Chronicle showing people calling him the N-word and comparing him to animals.\n\nRight-wing group Campus Reform published a blog post alerting students King was set to teach an anti-racism class in February, prompting the revisiting of his past lectures online.\n\nKing told the Chronicle that he had agreed with UCSF to pull out from the talks.\n\n'The attention the course is receiving could lead to more harm than good for me personally, for my family and for the (UCSF) organization,' he said.\n\n'So it was best, in this political moment - this cultural moment - to dissolve this relationship.'\n\nLast February, the Mayo Clinic also canceled King's contract with them after the same clip went viral. King said he had been giving anti-racism advice at the hospital since 2022.\n\nKing is not a professor. He has a master's degree in adult learning and equity, and he previously penned a book called The 400-Year Holocaust: White America's Legal, Psychopathic, and Sociopathic Black Genocide - and the Revolt Against Critical Race Theory.\n\nHe has secured many lucrative contracts on various equity programs for several San Francisco city departments.\n\n. @UCSF invited Dante King to speak on \"Diagnosing Whiteness.\" He claims that \"whites are psychopaths\" and that white people \"have it written in the law you can rape black women.\" He also makes excuses for black teenagers who commit violent crimes. This is the modern university. pic.twitter.com/EzVlliZPR9\n\nKing told the Chronicle that he had agreed with UCSF to pull out from the talks\n\nIn 2023, he accused the city of discriminating against him, and it paid $563,000 to settle the civil action.

And by the way, we think we owe you what was taken from you for over 300 years of slavery, Jim Crow, segregation and denial of economic opportunity and rights,\"' Johnson said.\n\n'I think that would be a huge emotional assuaging of guilt for black and white Americans and this country could stand up proudly on July 4 and say we are truly an exceptional nation and now we're living up to the principles on which we were founded which for many years were denied to our fellow citizens.'\n\nBET founder Robert Johnson has called for the US to pay $14 trillion in slavery reparations to bring 40 million African-Americans in line with the wealth of white Americans, as he says the nation 'has never come to grips with its original sin of slavery'\n\nJohnson said the nation's wealth and the inequality between white and black people can be traced back to slavery.\n\n'America from its inception has been plagued by the evils of slavery... Economically, socially, educationally - all of these things are because America has never come to grips with its original sin of slavery, which has been responsible for most of the disharmony between blacks and whites in this country,' he said.\n\nHe added: 'What happens when you have wealth, you do the things that white Americans have done from the time they first arrived here. African-Americans were denied that opportunity.'\n\nJohnson's proposal involves giving 40 million African-Americans who are descendants of slaves direct cash payments of around $10,000 to $11,000 per year over a 30-year period.\n\nIn total this would add up to $350,000 per person.\n\nThe businessman said the plan is 'simple math' with the $350,000 being the average personal net worth of a white American family, taking into account factors including home ownership and income.\n\nThis figure currently dwarfs the average personal net worth of an African-American family in America, which is around ten times lower at $30,000, he explained.\n\nJohnson speaks during an executive order signing in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington DC. Johnson, who was the first black American billionaire, said his proposal for reparations to be paid to US descendants of slaves would be 'a huge emotional assuaging of guilt for black and white Americans'\n\n'African-Americans are way behind white Americans in homeownership... African-Americans fall behind white Americans significantly in income, savings, investments in stocks and bonds, money to put your kids in school,' Johnson said.\n\n'When you take all these factors, you come up with the fact that the disparity of wealth is something that you need to close. So in order to close that - to bring 40 million African-Americans, up to $350,000 of wealth. Well, you multiply that number - $350,000 - times 40 million African-American descendants of slaves. You come out with $14 trillion.'\n\n'In order to make everything equal, you have to bring African-Americans equal to white Americans,' he said, adding there are only two options to tackling this wealth disparity - stopping white people from getting richer or making black people wealthier.\n\nHe said the first option will not happen so 'you got to make black people wealthier'.\n\nUnder the plan, the money would be paid out to any African-American who is a direct descendant of slaves in a similar way to how Social Security checks are sent out.\n\nJohnson said the plan would 'use the slave era definition of black' to determine who is eligible for the payments, meaning 'if you had one drop of blood in you that was black you were determined to be black'.\n\nProtesters rally during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Boston this week\n\nA protester writes 'reparations' on the sidewalk in New York City during a Black Lives Matter protest near One Police Plaza this week\n\nThe money would come from taxes because it is the 'responsibility of the nation' and all wealth circulating in the US today can be traced back to the slave trade.\n\n'Reparations is a debt owed by the nation as a whole because all of the wealth that was taken from slaves. Free labor is a transfer of wealth,' he explained.\n\n'That wealth of slavery found its way throughout the creation of wealth in the United States. I've often said that slaves may have died but the money that they created did not die. Money doesn't die. Money not only circulates; money multiplies.\n\nHe added: 'If you gave me a group of the brightest forensic accountants, I would be willing to bet you that I could trace every dollar of wealth in the United States today back to slavery.'\n\nThe taxes would work out at just about $8 a day on average for each American and it would be a progressive tax so that lower-income Americans of all races pay less than wealthier Americans.\n\nJohnson's suggestion comes after Washington Democratic Senator Cory Booker put forward a bill last June to explore reparation proposals for African-Americans saying 'we have a historic opportunity to break the silence, to speak of the ugly past, and talk constructively on how we will move this nation forward'.\n\nThe House version of the bill was sponsored by Texas Representative Sheila Jackson Lee who also said 'slavery is the original sin'.\n\nBut the idea of reparations appears to have fallen along party lines with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, dismissing the Democrats' plans the day before the committee hearing.\n\nAll Black Lives Matter is painted on the Hollywood Boulevard in LA. Johnson's proposal involves giving 40 million African-Americans who are slave descendants yearly payments of around $10,000 over 30 years\n\nTwo young protesters in Baltimore. Johnson said the reparations would make black people financially equal and help repair some of the damage caused by generations of inequality\n\n'I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,' McConnell said.\n\nEven the Democrats' proposals do not go far enough, Johnson told Fox News, saying there is 'no need to study reparations or slavery'.\n\n'To me, this is rearranging the deck chairs on a racial titanic. It's not going any place,' he said.\n\nJohnson also went on to cast doubt on the party ever voting in the reparations.\n\n'What they will do is what they have always done, which is paternalistic programs managed by bureaucrats to give support - somewhat means-tested support - in the black community. And call it a day,' he said.\n\nJohnson warned that if reparations aren't paid, widespread inequality and racial tensions will continue to ravage America.\n\n'If America can atone for that in the form of cash payments to African-Americans to make them economically equal to white Americans, two things will happen,' he said.\n\n'One, African-Americans will be, in effect, financially equal in a capitalist society and given the opportunity to grow wealth for themselves and their families. And two... unless you can atone, forgive and then repair in the form of the $14 trillion of cash, which the way I've developed it would make 40 million African-Americans equal in wealth to white Americans, we will live with this problem for generations to come.'\n\nHe urged white Americans to say to themselves 'we want to atone' and they will find 'there are no more forgiving people on the face of the Earth than African-American people'.\n\nJohnson's proposal comes after he slammed protesters pulling down Confederate and racist statues 'borderline anarchists' and said 'black people laugh at white people' doing it in an interview with Fox earlier this week.\n\nJohnson said tearing down statues across America and calling for TV shows to be canceled achieves nothing in the fight for racial equality but are actions simply being done by white people to 'assuage their guilt'.\n\n'What white people are doing with the idea that they're making us feel good is tantamount to rearranging the deck chairs on a racial Titanic,' he told Fox News Wednesday. 'It absolutely means nothing.'\n\nHe urged white people instead to 'ask us what we think first' rather than assume to know what black people want.\n\nJohnson has also called for Black Lives Matter to form its own political party.\n\nProtests are continuing across America demanding an end to systemic racism in the wake of the Memorial Day 'murder' of black man George Floyd at the hands of a white cop.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.\n\nVince Gill spoke out about diversity in country music as well as the scandal surrounding Morgan Wallen that started a conversation about racism within the genre.\n\nThe 21-time Grammy winner spoke with \"CBS This Morning\" about the current state of country music and the perception by many that it is only for a conservative audience and has a reputation of being unwelcoming to those who don't fall under that category.\n\n\"Most people perceive that country music is extremely conservative and I'm not sure if that's true,\" Gill explained . \"Maybe the audience might be predominantly conservative, but I don't know that the artistry is; that the community is so there's a rub in there.\"\n\nAs an example, he noted the mostly positive reception that Brothers Osborne singer T.J.

The 27-year-old singer was dropped by his talent agency and saw his songs removed from the airwaves after a leaked video showed him using a racial slur. The 63-year-old artist called Wallen's situation \"disappointing\" mostly for perpetuating a negative perception of country music.\n\n\"It was just sad and disappointing because I knew that everyone was going to massacre country music,\" he said. \"White America, when they make the argument 'I hear it in rap music all the time'... have you not been paying attention to the last 300 or 400 years how that word has been used by the white community? It's derogatory, dismissive and hurtful. It doesn't have a place.\"\n\nMORGAN WALLEN INELIGIBLE FOR ACM AWARDS FOLLOWING USE OF RACIAL SLUR\n\nGill concluded his comments on diversity in country music by addressing the uphill battle that women often face to face to break into the business.\n\n\"Women in country music could make the same claim, to some degree, that Black artists could. That they haven't been made to feel welcome,\" he said.\n\nGill adds: \"I don't know. I wish I knew, you know, because I'm someone that adores what they do and I think we would be better for it.\"\n\nGill ended the interview with a performance of a new song \" March On, March On ,\" about the history of racism within America.\n\nTyler McCarthy covers entertainment at Foxnews.com.\n\nGet a daily look at the top news in music, movies, television and more in the entertainment industry.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nConservative author and columnist Shelby Steele joins 'Life, Liberty & Levin' to discuss racism, social justice, multiculturalism and how these issues impact our society.\n\nThis is a rush transcript from \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" July 15, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nMARK LEVIN, HOST: Hello America, I Am Mark Levin and this is \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" I have a great guest, Shelby Steele, how are you, sir.\n\nSHELBY STEELE, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: I am good.\n\nLEVIN: It's a great honor to see you.\n\nSTEELE: Thanks for having me.\n\nLEVIN: I have been a fan of yours for years and years, first time we're meeting.\n\nSTEELE: Well, it's mutual.\n\nLEVIN: Thank you. You are an author, columnist. You've done documentary films. You're a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. You specialize in the study of race relation, multiculturalism, affirmative action. You were born in Chicago - January 1, 1946. Your father, Shelby, Senior was a truck driver; met your mother, Ruth, as a social worker while working for Congress of Racial Equality. You hold a PhD in English from the University of Utah, an MA in Sociology from Southern Illinois University, a BA in Political Science from Coe College at Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nYour latest book - it is a great book, too, is \"Shame: How America's Past Sins Have Polarized Our Country.\" You're a pretty courageous man in my view, you write things beautifully, your logic is outstanding.\n\nSTEELE: Well, thank you.\n\nLEVIN: And yet, some people consider it controversial, I don't. I consider it common sense. I'll give you an example. You wrote a few months ago in \"Wall Street Journal\" on this so-called protest with the football players taking the knee during the National Anthem.\n\nSTEELE: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: Among other things you said, \"It's not surprising then that these black football players would don the mantle of protest,\" because you say protest is something that black Americans have had to do for Civil Rights. You look at Martin Luther King. You look at Jackie Robinson in sports, and so forth and so on, and you say, the surprise was that it didn't work this time.\n\n\"They had misread the historic moment, they were not speaking truth to power, rather they were figures of pathos, mindlessly loyal to a black identity that had run its course,\" so you say in the article, \"Look, protest is a good thing.\" Protest sometimes is necessary, right, to get vote, to get equal rights, to draw the attention of society and so forth, but this one fell on deaf ears. Explain.\n\nSTEELE: Well, protest is central to the evolution of black American culture. It was protest that really finally won our freedom for us. Beyond that, it's always interesting to note that it expanded the idea of democracy. Democracy had all of the theory, all of the thinking - before had never dealt with the clash between race and racism and democracy. Well, it was the Civil Right Movement, it was Martin Luther King who said, \"You have to take and go beyond race even, that democracy is universal.\"\n\nSo that is a big part of the black American identity, and it is sort of seen as the test of your authenticity as a black, yet this protest in the NFL made the point that this was kind of fruitless at this point, and I think that central issue behind what you are talking about is the fact that the oppression of black Americans is over with.\n\nSTEELE: It's over with.\n\nSTEELE: It's over with. I grew up, I mean, it was - we never thought there would be an end to oppression. I remember being a teenager, I never thought that I'd live in a society that was not segregated. It happened. Now, are there exceptions? Yes, there are a few here and there. Will racism every completely go away? No, it is a part of the - as I say in that article, it is endemic to the human condition just as stupidity is endemic to the human condition. And so we'll always have to be on guard about it.\n\nBut we are at a point where the old fashion method of protest is obsolete. We need a lot of things, but we don't need that any more. We're at a point now where we can - we are a free people and can pursue our lives as we would like to.\n\nLEVIN: You point out in the article in your thought process is that, that's part of the issue. We are a free people. We are all a free people.\n\nSTEELE: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: We are not an oppressed people. Blacks are not an oppressed people quite frankly, Jews are not an oppressed people and so forth. This is America now. There is a history where there is oppression, obviously, slavery and segregation and so forth, but that is gone. And you say - and so some people are having difficulty coping with liberty. What do you mean by that?\n\nSTEELE: Absolutely. Well, when you think about it black American culture evolved over three and a half centuries. Every minute under which they lived under oppression and they adapted to dealing with the fact that those freedoms were going to be cut off. They had to somehow make a life within all of those restriction, and they did. Part of the - one of the - I think black American culture is nothing less than heroic. I mean, they evolved - look at the - you know, the contribution like music and so forth. They achieved great things.\n\nThe one thing we never had to do was to deal with freedom. That was precisely the thing that we denied, so that's not in our culture, in a vivid clear sense as it would be if we had been free - truly free. Well, we now are free. Freedom is, as the existentialist I think rightly say, a burden, it's a difficulty. It puts the individual in a position of being much more responsible for themselves, their own development as individuals and that is new for us.\n\nThe idea is still that black unity, we just can't be unified. That is the way ahead. Not anymore. You take yourself ahead. That's the new and stunning really fact of American life that we're now facing and having to deal with.\n\nLEVIN: So, these football players. They are successful. They are wealthy in comparison to other citizens, whatever their race.\n\nSTEELE: They beat me.\n\nLEVIN: They beat you. They beat a lot of people. And they are treated with great respect. I mean in terms of - the fans love them, they want their autograph, they buy things with their numbers and their names on it, and yet they protest. What exactly are they protesting?\n\nSTEELE: They are just stuck. You know, one of the ways we adapted to not being free was to think that our group identity was again, the way we were being black, and being down with the cards. That was the way we were going to get it. Unity was everything. And if you are authentically black, you are going to do what blacks have always done to one degree or another, you are going to protest.\n\nWell, the irony is that you are making $15 million a year, you are making vast amounts of money doing successful in every way. You are free. There is nothing for you to protest. Nothing.\n\nLEVIN: How about social justice? And equality? And the phrases like that? I hear that is what people say they are protesting.\n\nSTEELE: You've got all the social justice you need. Again, I lived through segregation. The freedom we have today is absolutely remarkable. We, as a people have not yet absorbed that. We have not absorbed the fact that our problem is no longer racism, our problem is freedom. We have to learn to deal with freedom, and only way to do that is to - it's going to have to be grounded in individual responsibility. That is the only chance you have with freedom, it's to take charge of your life and make a life for yourself.\n\nRalph Ellison, one of my all-time favorite writers talks about this, \"The group is the gift of its individuals, the goal is not to create the uncreated conscience of your race, but to create the uncreated conscience of your face.\" And boy, that's 50 to 60 years ago, that is on the money. That is in his great book, \"Invisible Man.\"\n\nLEVIN: Do you think part of the problem is the daily recitation of group think, group rights? You get it a lot in our universities and colleges, you see it on television a lot. Politicians balkanizing the nation in order to empower themselves and their party and so forth. Isn't that part of the problem?\n\nSTEELE: What I think are you are pointing to is definitely maybe the overriding problem, which is - and we don't talk about it very much at all, is white guilt. And that keeps feeding whatever blacks are doing is not helping them, thinking of themselves as nothing more than members of a group, of protesting and so forth. It's white guilt that keeps feeding that. What is white guilt? We always - we think - well, I make up in the morning and you feel guilty about black Americans? No. White guilt doesn't have anything to do with actual feelings of guilt.\n\nWhite guilt is the terror of being seen as a racist, as a bigot that now pervades American life. All of our social policy, our culture, everything is touched by this anxiety in most of white America. Understandably given America's history that they are vulnerable, they have this vulnerability to being disarmed of moral authority.\n\nBy being called a racist, I can use it as a weapon. I can say, \"You know what? I went on the Levin Show, let me tell you how I was treated.\" And big - it explodes. So, it constitutes that is black power, white guilt is black power. They are virtually one and the same and one of the big problems we have is that we talk about universities and political correctness and so forth. These are all ways in which white Americans say, I'm innocent. I don't feel this way. I am not a bigot. I am not a racist. I am innocent.\n\nAnd white guilt causes this drive to prove and establish innocence, and so then we have a whole generation of black leaders who do one thing, and one thing only, milk white guilt. And we're at a moment, I thought this protest was telling in that regard, kind of pointed in which culture meeting maybe turning because it was a fruitless protest. It achieved absolutely nothing.\n\nLEVIN: Could the culture be turning? But the elites digging in?\n\nSTEELE: That is well said.\n\nLEVIN: Because more and more, when I watch these debates on television and so forth, people very easily, almost casualty call people they disagree with racist. If they disagree with a political agenda, if they disagree with a particular issue - and most of that is come from the left, what do you make of that?\n\nSTEELE: Well, it's white guilt. This is meant to disarm you of moral authority. When they scream racism all of the time, \"They're saying you're a racist.\" You don't have moral authority to deal with whatever issue or problem we are dealing with, because you are a racist, and, so therefore, you are morally compromised, and your moral authority - you don't have any moral authority and this is the seduction that people on left have fallen for. They then are given as award idea of their innocence.\n\nLEVIN: I want to pursue this further when we return because I think it is very, very important. Ladies and gentlemen, you can watch me on LevinTV on our crtv.com network almost every week night. If you'd like to join us there, give us a call at 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN-TV. We'd love to have you. We'll be right back.\n\nShelby Steele, I want to pick up on this issue of white guilt, and use of the word racism. I find it to be now an ideological tool of the left, more and more and more, if they disagree with a particular issue, and I'm speaking - I am generalizing. They disagree with a particular issue, then you are a racist. And somebody could be called a racist who is not a racist, has no history of being a racist, hasn't done a thing in their lives that indicate racism, do you see this, too?\n\nSTEELE: Absolutely. The other side of that is that because whites are still so vulnerable to that charge of being a racist, that is the power that the entire - all of the power of the American left is based on that guilt, that susceptibility, that terror of being seen as racist.\n\nNot to introduce the presidential campaign, but Hillary Clinton and her deplorable statement, now famous, as a perfect example of saying, \"These people are bigots and racists. I am innocent. You vote for me, you prove your innocence. I offer you an identity of innocence.\" Being liberal, being left is more an identity than anything else. This is the way I think of myself, as a decent civilized human being and those other people are contemptable, and so it works on a cultural level.\n\nNow, I think the irony is that this is beginning to fade. You see signs of it cracking at this point that people don't take Maxine Waters seriously anymore. That is not Martin Luther King. When he came along, there were obvious terrible things, terrible discrimination behind every word he spoke and everybody knew it and there was really no debate about it. Racism was everywhere.\n\nWhen the era of Maxine as some people now call it, there is nothing behind the protest.\n\nLEVIN: But if you have a political mindset or a political party or a political ideology, that has to sustain this argument, even though as you say, this is a horrific past, but we're free. But the Democratic Party, not all of the people in the Democratic Party, but many of the spokesmen and leaders of the Democratic Party, they are not free this? Is it because they seek to keep people or stigmatize people? What is that all about?\n\nSTEELE: The essence of American liberalism, I think is the - again, the pursuit of innocence. Innocence of specifically the ugly American past. And that is why, because I am free of that ugliness and innocent of it, that is why you should vote for me. That is why you should let me change this aspect of the university system. That is why you should let me do any number of other things, not because I have better ideas, that I am a better problem solver, but because I offer this identity of innocence, which is now the, I think, big political problem that we have not identified up to this point.\n\nBut it is that susceptibility, that vulnerability in the political arena, people are going to play on it. They are going to exploit it. I can - and I have seen this. I have spent my adult lives in universities and you see reasonable, civilized decent people just fold up when the charge of racism is even hinted at.\n\nThey begin to sell out the quality of the university. One thing they invariably always absolutely do is lower standards. Remove western civilization from the curriculum. What are you doing? You think that's going to make you innocent? It makes you stupid. It makes you destructive. And black Americans, we need to understand the magnificent careful evolution of western civilization as much as anyone else does. So you're keeping us from it in saying, \"Well, it's a bunch of white guys,\" I don't care. I need to know and be informed. I need to identify with the western civilization. I am a western person.\n\nBlack Americans are a western people. We evolved here in the west, thankfully.\n\nLEVIN: In some cases, longer than most others?\n\nSTEELE: Certainly.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEVIN: ... people who are in this ...\n\nSTEELE: Certainly, we've been here since the very, very, very beginning, and so forth, and shot the first shot in the Revolutionary War, Crispus Attucks and so this is it. And now we are in a position, and I understand this as a black person. When you come out into freedom after that, and society admits it was wrong, and you come out suddenly into freedom, you are going to say, \"Well, something is due me. You did that to me for three centuries.\"\n\nLEVIN: Is something due to the person?\n\nSTEELE: And there may be something due. America tried its best to you know, we've got several trillion dollars on social programs, and wars on poverty and so forth. We've tried do to that, and it hasn't worked, and that is the realization I think we're just about getting to. Is that yes, we had a hard time.\n\nI had to watch my father be discriminated against in every way. The unions would not take him, wouldn't take him in. So, I know all about it and there's a part of me that says, \"Wait, whoa, I'm not ready to fully identify with America yet,\" that is a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe cold fact is, it doesn't matter. We can't change the past. We could only move into the future, and in the future, we have to identify with this country. It's the greatest country there ever was. What other system are you going to go to? And that's hard emotionally for a people to say, \"Well, we need to get some sort of a pay check, something for what we went through, some reparation.\" That's what - reparation in the discussion is the psychological sort of imposition of what justice in some cosmic way should be.\n\nBut that kind of justice does not very often exist in real life. And if you look at history, you see other people have been set free. They didn't get paid off for their suffering. We're not going to get paid off of that, and if we keep holding out demanding that, we will pay the price. We'll get weaker and weaker.\n\nToday, black Americans on almost over socioeconomic measure are farther behind whites than they were in the '50s and '60s.\n\nLEVIN: And when we come back, I want to ask you why. In this central point that you've written about before, the denial of liberty.\n\nSTEELE: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: It's almost sort of genuflecting type argument.\n\nSTEELE: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: And relying on the past to deny the future.\n\nSTEELE: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: We'll be right back.\n\nTODD PIRO, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Todd Piro. Three people dead, dozens injured in a deadly bus crash in New Mexico early this morning. The accident began when a car rear ended a pickup truck on the highway around 2:00 a.m. A commercial bus heading from Denver to El Paso, Texas tried to evade the disabled car and its driver who was ejected, but the bus driver lost control, rolling the bus onto its side. It was then sideswiped by a semi truck.\n\nEight animals have now died at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans after a jaguar escaped from its habitat. The jaguar got loose on Saturday killing four alpacas, an emu and a fox. A fifth alpaca and a second fox died today from their injuries. The jaguar was tranquilized by a vet team and returned to its enclosure. Zoo officials still unsure how that jaguar escaped. I'm Todd Piro, now back to \"Life, Liberty & Levin\"\n\nLEVIN: Shelby Steele, we've been talking about these forces that are in play. Why the almost myopic focus, I watch some of these professors and so-called Civil Right leaders, almost a myopic focus 150 years ago. I believe we ought to learn our history, I believe we ought to know our history. I mean, that's crucial. But really almost a rejection of a fact that we have liberty.\n\nSTEELE: Absolutely. We think that freedom is a lie. And one that I'm doing some work on as of at the moment, but one of the things that come out that there are people who have been long oppressed and who finally come into freedom, one of the problems that goes with that is what I call bad faith.\n\nIf you have been a victim of America's hypocrisy for three centuries, now you are free, now you don't know what to do with the freedom, and so, you've got some problems there. But the easy thing is to simply say, \"We're not free.\" And, now we're down to micro aggressions.\n\nLEVIN: Safe spaces.\n\nSTEELE: Yes, safe spaces, where I am determined to - I am going to do whatever I need it to do to convince myself, to make it up in my own mind that I'm not free. It is a tragedy that is striking black America. It is something perfectly normal, it comes out of three centuries of victimization. The idea that you don't trust what they say to you - all these white people, you don't trust these elites. Bad faith is cunning. It is being smart. It is saying, \"I'm not a sucker. I was a sucker for three centuries. I am not going to be - I am not going to believe these people again. I am going to keep a distance.\"\n\nAnd you end up keeping a distance from your own opportunities, and you miss them, and you hurt yourself.\n\nLEVIN: How do you break out of this as an individual?\n\nSTEELE: It is a damn hard question. Certainly, one of the things that I think would be to - we will eventually do is to express this, to say, \"Look, freedom.\" If you are going to never get married, to start having babies in your late teens and dropping out of high school, and so forth, you are going to suffer no matter what goes on elsewhere in the society.\n\nYou will be the one who pays the price. What we as blacks have to do, and this is what is so damn hard, I acknowledge it is hard. After going through all of that, we all have that pain in the families, in ourselves, but we have to accept the fact that it is over with, and we're not going to get perfect justice. We're not going to get reparations. If you give me $20,000.00 because my grandfather, which he was, born a slave, what am I going to really do with that $20,000.00?\n\nIt will probably be gone maybe a month or two, maybe a few days, but, what is it going to do to change my life? You can't get reparation.\n\nLEVIN: Right, and what is it going to do to change your thinking?\n\nSTEELE: Right.\n\nLEVIN: Or the thinking of those who keep pressing the so called - they are pressing the agenda? They're not going to stop, are they?\n\nSTEELE: That's right. This is what - you know, this is why liberalism has become - they are - what is the term they use? People who help out or keep addicts - there's a word - it escapes me at the moment, but they facilitate our problem - that psychology by which we say freedom does not exist.\n\nWhite guilt forces them to facilitate that and to then claim this proves we are not racist. There is a symbiotic bond between black America and white America, and there always has been. It takes different forms at different times, but right now, since the 60s, white Americans have been guilty and again, as I say, it's not that they feel guilt, it is that they feel this pressure, this threat, and so they behave guiltily.\n\nIt's the behaving guiltily that is the problem. I am going to do something. I'm going to actually take micro aggression seriously. I'm going to hire people to teach you about that. When it is a joke - if black people - how did we survive this long if we ...\n\nLEVIN: If every little thing ...\n\nSTEELE: With every little thing, every time - I grew up you calling me an \"N\" word, that was once or twice a week. I refuse to accept the idea that we're that weak if we are in this, there's really no hope.\n\nLEVIN: Lots more, but first, check us out most week nights on LevinTV on crtv.com. We'd love to have you there. We have great programming on CRTV. Give us a call and sign up, 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN-TV. We'll be right back.\n\nYou know the broader issue to me is assimilation - assimilation into the culture, assimilation into certain traditions, beliefs and values. Universal truths, eternal truths, and when a society doesn't have that, a society can't succeed. It balkanizes, it tribalizes, it breaks apart. It's a war with itself. I personally see this with immigration that you have a political party that does not believe in it, you have corporate entities that keep different languages, they press button one for this and button two for this and so forth and so on, and it is very concerning to me, but is it a bigger problem because assimilation is Americanization, that is what is intended. The point you are raising not necessarily just with immigration, this issue of Americanization, you've touched on this, too. It is crucial for the people who are already here to be Americanized.\n\nSTEELE: Yes.\n\nLEVIN: What do you mean by that?\n\nSTEELE: Well, you know, if you don't like the world American, you can use modernity. The modern world functions in a certain way. It's the result of a very long centuries and centuries of evolution and to an enlightenment or reformation. I mean, scientific revolution, on and on. That is no joke. You don't want to - what would its competitor be? Well, when talk about assimilation, that's what one of the things oppression did to black Americans was prevent us from assimilating saying, \"You're not going to learn these things. You're not going to ...\" and we of course, in many ways, we did anyway, and adopted those principles and values and so forth.\n\nBut now, there are these politics and this guilt that we've been talking about, and I am white now, and I am guilty and I am liberal, I want immigrants to be un-assimilable. They have been a victim class. And as a victim class, then I am the one who is going to be responsible and I anguish over their victimization and I therefore take moral authority and power.\n\nLEVIN: You bring this up, moral authority, is this whole notion one of superior moral authority where the left then looks down at everybody else who doesn't agree with them? Is that's what's going on?\n\nSTEELE: What the left said today is \"We are good people and we are redeeming America,\" the great moral principle they subscribe to is redemption. \"Look at how ugly we were, it's people like us ...\" That's why we're elite. That's why we're special. That's why we are so sophisticated. It's because we are going to - we're fighting against that ignorance and that backwardness.\n\nAnd so, if immigrants come to America, and say \"Good to be here, we're going to now become Americans.\" That doesn't make the left happy. That doesn't give them any - because they are not going to be victims. So, you look at the problem we have now with immigration. The people on the left immediately characterize it as a moral problem of a people of color being oppressed, once again, and therefore, we have - it falls on us as liberals to somehow redeem America from its abusive people like this.\n\nThere is a lot of power. I mean, there is so much power and the rewards are so high because you get an identity and I see this in any number of people. There is a - I am going to - to vote for somebody on the left, liberal whomever, makes \"I am in with the good people. I'm not in with - look at how abhorrent white people were, and I'm above that,\" you know, \"I'm above my Uncle Tony who used to use the \"n\" word all the time at the dinner table.\" That is on the opposite of that.\n\nSo, we've given America this avenue to redemption, and the leftist turned it to a vein of power and it is now I think destroying us. because it cuts away at everything that is timeless and beautiful and important. Difficult. Difficult certainly, but very important.\n\nLEVIN: We'll be right back.\n\nShelby Steele, affirmative action, will it ever end?\n\nSTEELE: Boy, not for a long time.\n\nLEVIN: Why?\n\nSTEELE: Because for many reasons, but again, one of them, to go back to this old guilt thing is that without affirmative action, without the idea of a preference that you grant to victims, the left has no power, it has no way to keep this whole machinery going. So it just - they just find new and different more inventive ways of using preferences to send a signal that we are innocent.\n\nAt Harvard University, 8% to 9% of every single freshman class has to be black. If you didn't lower the standards, for admission, probably only 1% would be black. They would be ones who have earned it via merit, but they would be greatly outnumbered by those who won it as a racial preference.\n\nAnd in a sense white America saying is that, \"We're redeeming ourselves this way, without us we would go back to old way - discrimination and racism and so forth,\" so, you know we have got the finger in the dike, and so affirmative action is just diversity, it's this sort of new incarnation, a wretched idea with all sorts of perversions that follow from this idea of diversity. I could tell you a story about that.\n\nLEVIN: Doesn't it help camouflage the failures of half a century of the left's agenda?\n\nSTEELE: Yes, because you know, black America has to face some - why are we poorer now than we were when we had no freedom. After 50, 60 years of freedom, why are we poor? Well, whites have a bill coming due as well. Why have you betrayed every principle that made you great? That made America great? Why did you betray all of that? In the name of what? In the name of your own innocence.\n\nYour innocence is a corruption. It facilitates everything that is not good in the minority community. You are the problem now. It used to, as I say often, the old fashion segregation, it's you called me the \"n\" word all the time while I was growing up. I prefer them any day to the modern white American liberal who exploits me and black Americans for this moral authority that then uses as its base.\n\nI'm being used now just as a slave was being used to over state it a little bit, but not much and it breaks my heart, I visit campuses, I talk to black students, and they tell me all sorts of stories about their roommates, and white roommates saying, \"You wouldn't be here if you weren't black.\" So affirmative action ruins the very people that claims to help. It dispirits them. It takes the incentive away for achieving excellence. It ruins them. And then you get - and so no doubt then, you get groups like Black Lives Matter that just take this to wide extremes claiming how victimized they are.\n\nLEVIN: We have to take a break, unfortunately. We'll be right back.\n\nShelby Steele, ten years from now, race relations in America, better or worse?\n\nSTEELE: Very good question. What makes me feel - and I'm basically an optimist and I think in the long run, we pretty much always work through these problems, although painful as that working maybe. So I think we ultimately will be able to do that and today, you see signs of the left's sort of - of this guilt and so forth, it's preoccupation with its own innocence and you see that beginning to crack a little and people are saying, \"No, no, no. I see through that. You are manipulating me. You are not pointing to some real human pain here or some real difficulty. You are just manipulating me. You are talking about a micro - I'm supposed to get up in the morning and believe that?\"\n\nLEVIN: I hope you're right and I want to thank you. it's been an absolute honor to meet you and talk to you.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nJohnson says 40 million African Americans should each receive $350,000 to atone for slavery and to close the wealth gap with white Americans.\n\nThe Big Idea is a series that asks top lawmakers and figures to discuss their moonshot - what's the one proposal, if politics and polls and even price tag were not an issue, they'd implement to change the country for the better?\n\nRobert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television , says it's time America atones for slavery and systemic racism by paying African-Americans reparations to make them economically equal to white Americans.\n\nJohnson, the first black billionaire in the United States, has put a price tag on the debt America owes to African-Americans at $14 trillion.\n\nBET FOUNDER ROBERT JOHNSON SAYS DEMS TAKING BLACK VOTERS 'FOR GRANTED,' CALLS FOR BLM TO FORM PARTY\n\n\"Nobody talks about cash, but black people understand cash,\" Johnson told Fox News.\n\nUnder his proposal, an estimated 40 million African-Americans would get $350,000 in direct cash payments over 30 years (costing the average taxpayer roughly $2,900 a year, according to his office). The $350,000 would signify the wealth disparity between African-Americans and white Americans.\n\nTo say this is controversial is an understatement. Some Democratic lawmakers have warmed to the discussion, but often in the form of commissions and other partial measures. A Fox News poll last year found most Americans are opposed to cash reparations. And with the government already spending trillions on coronavirus relief and the national debt pushing past $26 trillion, concerns about the country's fiscal stability would pose an obvious hurdle.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last year of the idea: \"I think we're always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive was responsible for that, and I don't think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it.\"\n\nJohnson contends white Americans built generations of wealth on the backs of slave labor, and black people will never be able to catch up in wealth unless they are paid this debt.\n\n\"You want a big idea: white America, what would happen if you said, 'please forgive us and accept our apology. And by the way, we think we owe you what was taken from you for over 300 years of slavery, Jim Crow, segregation and denial of economic opportunity and rights,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"I think that would be a huge emotional assuaging of guilt.\"\n\nJohnson, the founder of RLJ Companies, discussed his reparations proposal at length with Fox News this week. This Q & A has been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nBlack Entertainment Television (BET) founder Robert Johnson says American owes African Americans $14 trillion in reparations. (Photo by Ron Adar/Getty Images)\n\nQ: You've put forth a reparations plan that calls for $14 trillion in direct cash payments to descendants from slavery. Why do you think it's important for today's Americans to atone for the sins of the past?\n\nJohnson : America from its inception has been plagued by the evils of slavery, so much so that this country fought a brutal civil war to try to settle the issue. Well, obviously, the issue was not settled after the Civil War. And this country has experienced continual racial violence, segregation and discrimination since that time. And as a country that has espoused ideas about freedom, individual rights, equal treatment under the law, everything in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution, and yet at the same time have this significant division between blacks and whites. Economically, socially, educationally -- all of these things are because America has never come to grips with its original sin of slavery, which has been responsible for most of the disharmony between blacks and whites in this country.\n\nAnd therefore, I'm proposing that if America can atone for that in the form of cash payments to African-Americans to make them economically equal to white Americans, two things will happen. One, African-Americans will be, in effect, financially equal in a capitalist society and given the opportunity to grow wealth for themselves and their families. And two ... unless you can atone, forgive and then repair in the form of the $14 trillion of cash, which the way I've developed it would make 40 million African-Americans equal in wealth to white Americans, we will live with this problem for generations to come.\n\nBET FOUNDER ROBERT JOHNSON MOCKS CROWDS PULLING DOWN STATUES, CALLS THEM 'BORDERLINE ANARCHISTS'\n\nQ: Your plan calls for $14 trillion to be paid out to descendants of slavery over the course of 30 years. How do you get to that figure?\n\nJohnson : It's simple math. If you look at it this way, the median white American family has about $350,000 of personal net worth. African-Americans have about 10 times less than that. So about, let's say, $30,000 of personal net worth of an African-American family. In order to make everything equal. You have to bring African-Americans equal to white Americans.\n\nAnd the factors that we use to determine net worth are pretty simple. Your home is your most important asset for most middle-class people. African-Americans are way behind white Americans in homeownership. Income, i.e. salaries, are the next factor in wealth. African-Americans fall behind white Americans significantly in income, savings, investments in stocks and bonds, money to put your kids in school. When you take all these factors, you come up with the fact that the disparity of wealth is something that you need to close. So in order to close that -- to bring 40 million African-Americans, up to $350,000 of wealth. Well, you multiply that number -- $350,000 - times 40 million African-American descendants of slaves. You come out with $14 trillion. That money would be paid out over 30 years.\n\nQ: Would this be a special reparations new tax that would fund this program?\n\nJohnson: Ultimately, it's a debt owed by the taxpayers. And reparations is a debt owed by the nation as a whole because all of the wealth that was taken from slaves. Free labor is a transfer of wealth.\n\nThat wealth of slavery found its way throughout the creation of wealth in the United States. I've often said that slaves may have died but the money that they created did not die. Money doesn't die. Money not only circulates; money multiplies. If you gave me a group of the brightest forensic accountants, I would be willing to bet you that I could trace every dollar of wealth in the United States today back to slavery.\n\nREP. TIM RYAN'S BIG IDEA: GIVING AMERICANS A MENTAL TIMEOUT\n\nThe $350,000 would be paid on average $10,000 to $11,000 per year for the next 30 years to each African-American descendant. Let's assume there are 170 million people who pay taxes in the U.S. If you break it down by days, it comes out to American taxpayers paying about $8 a day in reparations.\n\nNow, anticipating the question, what about poor whites who may not have that money to pay into the reparations program? Well, we could do it like we do other taxes. It could be a progressive tax. So those white Americans with more money would pay more, like the income tax. Those white Americans with less money would pay less. And by the way, African-Americans would also pay tax on this because it's a responsibility of the nation. And we're not exempting African-Americans from paying that tax, even though they are the recipients of the damages, just as if you were to get damages awarded by a court today. The court wouldn't say, well, you have damages coming, you don't have to pay taxes. You have to pay taxes.\n\nRobert L. Johnson, BET Founder, at BET's 25th Anniversary. (File photo by L. Cohen/WireImage for BET Network)\n\nQ: And how do you envision these direct cash payments being distributed? And how would you determine who is eligible for the payments?\n\nJohnson: The eligibility is any African-American, black American, who is a direct descendant of slaves. So that's fairly simple.\n\nAnd the definition of who's black. We simply use the slave era definition of black. And back in slavery days ... if you had one drop of blood in you that was black you were determined to be black. You were treated as black. So we'll use that same model.\n\nThe money would come out of the taxpayers' pockets. ...  So that money would be transferred in the form of a cash payment to every African-American. It's sort of like Social Security. They send you a check.\n\nQ: There's been some reparations proposals in Washington. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., has a bill that would establish a commission to study the impact of slavery and continuing discrimination against African Americans and then make recommendations on reparation proposals. In the House, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, authored the companion legislation . Do you support these efforts? Have you talked to them about these plans?\n\nJohnson: I know about them and I know Sheila Jackson Lee and I know Cory, but no, I have not talked about them. And fundamentally, the reason I haven't talked about them is because they are going nowhere.\n\nThere is no need to study reparations or slavery. You can go to Google and you could have within an instant, hundreds of thousands of articles, literature, studies, on reparations and slavery. To me, this is rearranging the deck chairs on a racial titanic. It's not going any place.\n\nREP. RO KHANNA'S BIG IDEA: BRINGING SILICON VALLEY JOBS TO RURAL AMERICA\n\nThe Democrats will never, ever vote for any reparations involving cash payments to descendants of slaves. They will never do it. And what they will do is what they have always done, which is paternalistic programs managed by bureaucrats to give support -- somewhat means-tested support -- in the black community. And call it a day. That's it. I guarantee you that's what will happen with this study. Because that's what this government ... is comfortable with: giving money to hopefully well-meaning bureaucrats to supervise money going to help black people.\n\nIf you're going to close the wealth gap, there are only two ways to do it. Either you've got to stop white people from getting wealthier, which you're not going to. Or you got to make black people wealthier.\n\nThe only way you are going to do it is if you give them cash. Programs don't do it.\n\nQ:  How would you know if this program has been successful? Would you gauge it from an economic standpoint where you see the wealth gap lessen or be closed?\n\nJohnson: You would obviously gauge it by closing the wealth gap. That's fairly simple because what happens when you have wealth, you do the things that white Americans have done from the time they first arrived here. They bought homes. They started businesses. They sent their kids off to college. They saved. They invested. And all of a sudden they accumulated wealth. African-Americans were denied that opportunity.\n\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY'S BIG IDEA: ALLOW AMERICANS TO SUE BIG TECH FOR SELECTIVE POLITICAL CENSORSHIP\n\nThe second part is really up to white Americans. Will white Americans say to themselves, 'we have atoned for an original sin. And not only that, we have made 40 million African-Americans whole for what was done to them through no fault of their own. They were dragged here on ships to be slaves. Not even people. Property. And we took advantage of the labor that they created and used it to build our wealth. Now we're saying we want to atone.'\n\nIf white people see this as a way of saying in a huge way, I apologize. I'm sorry. I can assure you there are no more forgiving people on the face of the Earth than African-American people.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

DiAngelo distanced herself from the training seminar amid the backlash.\n\nBLACK PROFESSOR BLASTS 'DEHUMANIZING CONDESCENSION' OF BESTSELLING BOOK 'WHITE FRAGILITY'\n\nColumbia University associate professor John McWhorter torched DiAngelo's book in a piece in The Atlantic from July of last year, saying the controversial book is \"about how to make certain educated white readers feel better about themselves.\"\n\n\"DiAngelo's outlook rests upon a depiction of Black people as endlessly delicate poster children within this self-gratifying fantasy about how white America needs to think,\" McWhorter wrote.\n\n\"Or, better, stop thinking. Her answer to white fragility, in other words, entails an elaborate and pitilessly dehumanizing condescension toward Black people.\"\n\nWhen asked about the decision to host DiAngelo for the paid speech, university spokesman Tim Doty told Fox News that the university does not \"censor\" or \"silence\" speakers at the school \"regardless how preposterous or offensive\" a person with an opposing viewpoint might consider the speaker to be.\n\nHe also said that the university does not \"prevent groups\" at Purdue from \"inviting particular speakers\" and that the university believes students' \"best response to speech\" they disagree with or \"oppose\" is to \"respond with better arguments.\"\n\n\"At Purdue, we don't censor and don't silence speakers, regardless how preposterous or offensive others with differing views consider those remarks or writings to be. And we don't prevent groups within the university from inviting particular speakers,\" Doty wrote. \"We believe that Boilermakers' best response to speech they oppose is not to silence it, rather to respond with better arguments.\"\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram reports on House Speaker Mike Johnson facing heat after the foreign aid vote Saturday.\n\nEditor's note: The following op-ed is adapted from author Jeremy Carl's new book: \"The Unprotected Class: How Anti-White Racism is Tearing America Apart.\" (Regnery, April 23, 2024)\n\nPolitics is complicated, and it is rare that we can trace an abrupt break in American society to a single act or single piece of legislation. But the Hart-Celler Immigration Act of 1965 fundamentally transformed America's immigration policy and is arguably one such piece of transformative legislation. It took us from being an almost uniformly White and Black country at the time of its passage to a fully multi-ethnic, and increasingly ethnically fractious, country today.\n\nWhat is clear is that the post-1965 immigration boom, rather than serving as a continuation of longstanding American policy, was a spectacular repudiation of that policy. Over the last six decades, America's government has created a new American people. Democrats, who have not won the White vote since 1964, simply elected another people through immigration policy and attacked any White person who complained as a racist.\n\nGiven the enormous changes it would engender, it was inevitable that Democrat leaders would lie about the Hart-Celler immigration bill before putting it forward in 1965. \"This bill that we will sign today is not a revolutionary bill,\" President Lyndon Johnson said. \"It does not affect the lives of millions. It will not reshape the structure of our daily lives.\"\n\nNEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS BELIEVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS REAL CRISIS, NOT A MEDIA NARRATIVE: POLL\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy claimed, \"The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.\" None of this turned out to be true.\n\nIn an aerial view, immigrants pass through coils of razor wire while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border on March 13, 2024, in El Paso, Texas. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nA more accurate assessment was given by North Carolina Democratic Senator Sam Ervin, who argued it was not possible to design an immigration policy that did not discriminate, so why not discriminate on behalf of those who had made the country?\n\nThe American Legion said, \"It is in the best interest of our country to maintain the present makeup of our cultural and social structure.\" A Harris poll in May 1965 showed that by a 58%-24% margin, Americans opposed loosening immigration laws.\n\nBut who cares what the American people - in particular White Americans - thought?\n\nTo be fair, even many of the bill's proponents professed to be surprised by how radical it proved in practice, how its \"family reunification\" provisions, intended to help White ethnics, led to chain migration, particularly from Mexico.\n\nAs immigration policy quickly took on a dramatically different character than had been promised, the left, unsurprisingly, shifted rhetorical tactics. In 1968, just a few years after the bill's passage, the New York Times reported that \"the extent of the change\" in immigration because of the new law had surprised nearly everyone, but that it was unlikely to be modified because \"congressmen don't want to look like racists.\" Even in the late 1960s, the left's racial blackmail tactics were working.\n\nIllegal immigration didn't begin en masse until the 1970s, and its history is even more fraught. We are constantly told that illegal aliens do not commit more crimes than natives - another carefully chosen anti-White statement.\n\nMany Whites are not concerned with whether illegal aliens commit more crimes than current legal residents; they're concerned with whether they commit more crimes than their own communities of White Americans - which they most certainly do. The fact that there are non-White populations in the United States that commit even more crimes and thus raise the average should not convince Whites that immigration makes them safer.\n\nBy the 1990s, even moderate New Democrat rhetoric on immigration was changing. As former President Bill Clinton said in a 1998 address at Portland State, \"Today, largely because of immigration, there is no majority race in Hawaii or Houston, or New York City. Within five years, there will be no majority race in our largest state, California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in the United States. ... [These immigrants] are energizing our culture and broadening our vision of the world. They are renewing our most basic values and reminding us all of what it truly means to be American.\"\n\nJeremy Carl's new book, \"The Unprotected Class: How Anti-White Racism is Tearing America Apart,\" talks about the continued impact of sweeping immigration changes.\n\nSounds kind of like ... a great replacement. Did the supermajority of White Americans ask for this? Nobody cared.\n\nImmigration has had many political consequences for America. The Democrats have used their polarization of African-American voters, in concert with mass immigration, to do something remarkable: they have achieved electoral pre-eminence while consistently losing the votes of the supermajority ethnicity. (This supermajority has ranged from an 89% White electorate in former President Jimmy Carter's victory in 1976 to a 67% White electorate in the 2020 victory of Joe Biden.)\n\nOver this time, the Democrats have won six presidential elections and the popular vote in two additional elections without once winning the vote of White voters. There is no other modern multiracial democracy of which I am aware where a party has achieved electoral success while perennially losing the votes of the supermajority ethnicity. This fact, perhaps any more than any other, explains the power of Hart-Celler in creating an anti-White America.\n\nThe mass growth of illegal immigration has created another problem: the representation of illegal immigrants in our census - they are counted just like everyone else - has led to the creation of so-called \"rotten boroughs\" (a term originally used to describe very small constituencies in England that elected members to Parliament and that were eliminated in the Reform Act of 1832).\n\nThese unequal districts amount to a modern three-fifths compromise in which the citizens of states and districts with large numbers of illegal aliens and other non-citizens are given disproportionate political power relative to those in districts with more citizens.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court theoretically established a \"one person, one vote\" rule in Baker v. Carr, which set the stage for forcing states to create congressional districts with equal populations in the name of fairness, somehow the court (and the media) has not considered the unequal representation from illegal aliens to be a problem.\n\nOverall, we have more than 45 million immigrants in America (88 million if you also count the children of immigrants), up from just 8 million or so in 1960. Of note, the number of immigrants from Europe and Canada has declined by almost 25% during that same period - almost all the rest come from areas where immigration had previously been minimal or nonexistent.\n\nIn 1968, just a few years after the bill's passage, the New York Times reported that \"the extent of the change\" in immigration because of the new law had surprised nearly everyone, but that it was unlikely to be modified because \"congressmen don't want to look like racists.\"\n\nIndeed, since 1990, the Diversity Visa program welcomes 55,000 immigrants each year from countries that are chosen precisely for their lack of connection with historical immigration patterns to the United States. Some entrants on this visa have committed terrorist activities.\n\nYet the Democrats have staunchly opposed eliminating the program, even when this number of visas was offset by an equal increase of visas in other categories. Filling America with people with little or no ties to the historic American nation is an article of liberal ideology.\n\nThe result: among America's children, less than half are non-Hispanic White. Within approximately two decades, America as a whole is projected to become majority-minority. The Great Replacement isn't a conspiracy theory; it is, as 2024 GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy observed, \"just the basic immigration policy of the Democrats.\"\n\nJeremy Carl is a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and a former senior official in the Trump administration.

(Getty Images)\n\n\"I think even though we intellectually understand what America is at its base, right? That there is a great amount of racism, anti-blackness, anti-wokeness, this idea that political correctness is some sort of scheme to destroy white America, right?

We are still who we thought, unfortunately,\" Reid continued. \"It's disappointing. I emerge from this disappointed.\"\n\nWith votes still being counted across the country - including in several swing states that will decide his contest against Trump - Biden had more than 72 million votes as of midnight EST Thursday, according to the Associated Press.\n\nTrump had about 68.5 million votes and could also potentially surpass former President Obama's 2008 record.\n\nIn his inaugural bid for the White House , Obama garnered 69,498,516 million votes. The U.S. population has grown by about 26 million people in the last 12 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Reid caught some heat for using a racial slur against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas during the network's election coverage.\n\nFollowing President Trump's early Wednesday remarks from the White House , where he vowed to take any outstanding ballot counts to the Supreme Court , Reid sounded the alarm that the conservative-controlled bench would favor the president.\n\nReid then appeared to put on a faux Southern accent and said, \"Do any of you guys trust Uncle Clarence and Amy Coney Barrett and those guys to actually follow the letter of the law? No.\"\n\nFox News' Joseph A. Wulfsohn and Brie Stimson contributed to this report.\n\nBrian Flood is a media editor/reporter for FOX News Digital.

She started this role in February 2023. The administrative office oversees the day-to-day operations of all city departments in accordance with the goals and policy directives of Mayor Sheng Thao and the city council.\n\nLieu's past remarks reflect views steeped in critical race theory, specifically that the United States is systemically oppressive and that people \"must get uncomfortable about examining implicit biases because this is the inflection point where change occurs.\"\n\nIn a 2019 Medium post , Lieu articulated her animus against \"White America\" - believing the racial group to has a \"superiority complex\" and a \"pathology\" - as well as the Christian religion as part of her argument to integrate \"Ethnic Studies and Culturally Relevant Science\" into K-12 schools.\n\nOAKLAND LOCALS BLAME HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT FOR CITY REMOVING TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO STOP COPPER THIEVES\n\nOakland inclusivity officer Carina Lieu has a history blasting Jesus and Christians. (Fox News Digital)\n\nLieu advanced her beliefs about Whiteness and Christianity in the 2019 post by using the case of a Christian missionary who opened a center to treat hundreds of malnourished children in Uganda. At least 105 children who were patients reportedly died. Two mothers whose kids had died filed a lawsuit against the missionary, which she settled without acknowledging any wrongdoing or liability in the matter.\n\nLieu also wrote that Europeans have a history of exploiting third-world countries \"brought on by the assumption that underdeveloped societies were uncivilized\" and because they \"believed that white Christianity would save [the third-world inhabitants] from themselves.\"\n\nShe went on to accuse the monotheistic faith , practiced by over two billion people globally, of being \"a tool of spiritual submission, language conversion, and essentially enforcing social order.\"\n\nLieu said the phrase \"Jesus Saves\" has a \"double entendre meaning that Jesus was a tool used to enslave minds and dismantle indigenous traditions for capital gain.\"\n\nOakland inclusivity officer Carina Lieu argued that White children should learn \"that people of color had been tricked into accepting Christianity so they could be subjugated to colonial rule.\" (Fox News Digital)\n\nShe further argued that children should learn \"that people of color had been tricked into accepting Christianity so they could be subjugated to colonial rule\" and that the \"role of white people is to work as an ally to dismantle systems of oppression.\"\n\n'WEST POINT' FOR DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES HIRED DIRECTOR WHO CALLED TERRORISM THE 'DREAM OF POLITICS'\n\n\"The pathology of whiteness is pervasive in the mass shootings, the Trump rallies, and anti-immigrant sentiment of today,\" Lieu wrote. \"It is literally killing people physically and causing emotional and psychological trauma. Such is the reason for making the case for Ethnic Studies further.\"\n\n\"[W]e need Ethnic Studies in 2019 more than ever to dismantle violence set up by white supremacy ,\" she continued.\n\nLieu said students should be taught that America has a \"the racist pathology inherited over years of schooling and influence\" and should determine whether their \"righteous path forward\" will be within that perception.\n\nPreviously, the inclusion officer was involved in making changes to public safety policy in Oakland.\n\nShe helped launch Oakland's Reimagining Public Safety Task Force's Youth Advisory Board, a community participatory budgeting process.\n\nCritical race theory holds that America is systemically racist and puts people into oppressed or oppressor categories.

Woodson, the author of \"Red, White, and Black: Rescuing American History from Revisionists and Race Hustlers\" was one of his guests, and he slammed the very concept of reparations from a variety of angles.\n\n\"When you go into slavery, it's much more complex than all White people were the oppressors, and Black people were the victims,\" he said. \"If you dissect it, you will find there were about 3,700 free Blacks who owned 12,000 slaves - Black slaves. The question is, do the descendants of those free Blacks who owned Black slaves, do they pay?\"\n\nREPARATIONS FOR BLACK CALIFORNIANS COULD COST $800B, ECONOMISTS WARN\n\nWoodson, 86, claimed that the modern Black community in America is unrecognizable compared to the more socially conservative one of his youth.\n\nCivil rights activist and author Bob Woodson criticizes the idea of reparations on an episode of Dr. Phil.\n\n\"Blacks really benefited more the first 100 years after slavery than we have in the last 50 years,\" he said. \"I was born in 1937 during the Depression. Everyone in my small, low-income Black community, 98% of the households, had a man and a woman raising children. Elderly people could walk safely in that community without fear of being assaulted by their grandchildren. Never heard of gunfire during that time. Never heard of a child being shot to death in the crib, but there are 50 children today who have been shot and killed in our cities.\"\n\nWoodson pivoted to suggest that the Black community needs to shift its mindset away from blaming White Americans for its problems.\n\n\"If you're talking about remedies, we've got to look beyond saying that every solution has to have a winner and a loser - that Blacks can only benefit if Whites lose. We have to be defined [as] more than just victims of oppression,\" he argued. \"When Whites were at their worst, Blacks were at their best. When we were denied access to hotels, we built our own.\"\n\n\"We have to communicate to our people the history of how they achieved in the face of oppression,\" Woodson added. \"But if we continue to sit back and say all of the challenges that we face in out-of-wedlock births, the violence, that somehow the control of that is in the hands of White America, and therefore, until White people change, there's nothing that we can do - this sets up a terrible situation for this nation.\"\n\nAnti-racist educator Ashani Mfuko defends the idea of reparations on an episode of Dr. Phil. (CBS)\n\nREPARATIONS FOR BLACK CALIFORNIANS COULD COST $800B, ECONOMISTS WARN\n\nWoodson went on to suggest the crisis i America is not racial but \"the moral and spiritual freefall that is consuming our children,\"ranging from \"homicide\" among \"Black families\" to \"prescription drug\" addiction in Appalachia.\n\nHis proposed solution was to \"come together and look beyond race and realize America is drowning because it's in a moral and spiritual freefall,\" and to \"be defined by what we want to become in the future\" rather than remind them of past problems.\n\nEducator Ashani Mfuko suggested the best solution for the Black community is \"not an 'either-or,'\" choice between reparations or self-improvement and claimed, \"We cannot ignore the reality of systemic racism and how it's affected the Black community.\" She added that this racism is \"finding us. It finds us wherever we go.\"\n\nLos Angeles long-time resident, Walter Foster, age 80, holds up a sign as the Reparations Task Force meets to hear public input on reparations at the California Science Center in Los Angeles on Sept. 22, 2022.

Every one of the villains was a Black guard or a  Black officer,\" he recounted. \"It did not generate any debate or discussion because it did not fit the racial narrative.\" Woodson then criticized the mindset of many racial activists in the Black community.\n\n\"In other words, the only time that we can become upset is when evil wears a White face,\" he said.\n\n\"I disagree,\" Mfuko replied.\n\nAlexander Hall is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

      "text": "House Democrats Announce They Now Have the Votes to Pass Reparations Bill\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 14: The U.S. Capitol Building is seen past fall foliage on November 14, 2021 in Washington, DC. U.S. consumer prices have increased solidly in the past few months on items such as food, rent, cars and other goods as inflation has risen to a level not seen in 30 years. The consumer-price index rose by 6.2 percent in October compared to one year ago. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\n\nHouse Democrats say they are ready to take the next step to force through a bill that would study how reparations for slavery will take shape, but want to hurry to assure passage of any plan can be implemented by the Biden administration.\n\n\"This has been a 30-plus year journey,\" Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas said in reference to her efforts to have reparations approved, according to The Washington Post . \"We had to take a different approach. We had to go one by one to members explaining this does not generate a check.\"\n\nBut it would cost $12 million of taxpayer dollars, for starters.\n\nAnd under H.R. 40, the bill House Democrats think they can force through with their razor-thin House majority, the bill would form a commission to which Republicans need not apply to determine how reparations would be structured.\n\nThe panel would have 13 members, one each appointed by President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont as president pro tempore of the Senate, and six from civil rights groups that support reparations.\n\nJackson Lee insisted that the hearing conducted by the commission would be good for America.\n\n\"Reparations is about repair and when you repair the damage that has been done, you do so much to move a society forward. This commission can be a healing process - telling the truth can heal America,\" she said.\n\nAlthough House Democrats think they can pass the bill in the House, its fate in the Senate is less certain. To that end, Democrats plan to follow House passage with a demand that Biden create the commission through an executive order, bypassing the Senate entirely.\n\nThe Post report says advocates for reparations want fast action now so that the commission's recommendations can be implemented while Biden , who as a candidate said he supported a study of reparations , is in the White House.\n\nJackson Lee said she and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey have 260 federal lawmakers on board, although none are Republicans.\n\n\"This groundswell of support sends a clear message to President Biden,\" said Kennis Henry of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations.\n\n\"We are ready for the opportunity to have this racial reckoning. And if not now, when?\" said Henry.\n\n\"We have seen other groups get reparations from the Japanese to the families of 9/11 victims. In those cases and others, our government said we must do something,\" Henry said. \"So why is this country unwilling to discuss reparations for people of African descent? The only difference between those who have gotten reparations and those who have not gotten compensation is the color of my skin.\"\n\nJade Magnus Ogunnaike, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, said the commission will rebut the effort of opponents of Critical Race Theory .\n\n\"At the heart of what the critical race theory fight is about is the refusal to educate young people and by proxy their families about the harm America has done to Black people,\" she said. \"And so you have people asking: 'Why should a Black person today receive reparations, none of you experienced slavery?' And this is why I think H.R. 40 is so, so important because it's going to explain and show the ways that slavery, the Jim Crow era and Reconstruction materially impacted Black communities and their legacies.\"\n\nThis is the perfect time to demand reparations from Biden..\n\nIt's now or never!!!\n\n- Derrick Moultrie (@djmimpact) February 25, 2022\n\nOgunnaike said the racial wealth gap will vanish once reparations are passed.\n\n\"There are so many White families who may not be wealthy, but they have a home that they inherited from their grandparents who bought the home with federal funds when they returned from World War II,\" Ogunnaike said. \"So few Black people have that ability, and that's a direct harm at the hands of the federal government. It's time for them to repair it. Black organizers, the Black movement has done an incredible job of making this a centerpiece of conversation, now we need to figure out the how of how we move people to action.\"\n\nIf the liberals in congress Get this passes\n\nI AM DONE PAYING TAXES\n\nI WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES PAY A TAX FOR REPARATIONS WOULD RATHER GO TO WAR\n\nMY FAMILY CAME TO AMERICA IN THE 1970s We had nothing to do with slavery\n\nAnd if U try to get it out of me ITS WAR pic.twitter.com/eyLGCEKMVP\n\n- ??+??+??+?? = NORTH AMERICAN EMPIRE (@findgg33) February 25, 2022\n\nRep.

But for slavery, for the hanging of thousands of Black people, for Jim Crow laws, for the horrible segregation laws of the 20th century, for the segregation of the United States military, for redlining, your government has a responsibility because it was all government-sanctioned.

This, Zeleny said, was not the kind of speech Trump could have delivered in the U.S., although he said it was one of his best speeches in terms of staying on a focused theme.\n\n\"This is not a speech he could have given really any place else.

      "text": "Dem Congressional Hopeful Sue Altman Led Group That Called To 'Imagine a Society Without Police'\n\nNew Jersey Democratic congressional candidate Sue Altman helped lead a left-wing activist group that called to \"imagine a society without police,\" promoted \"black-only spaces,\" and held workshops about \"white fragility,\" the Washington Free Beacon has learned.\n\nAltman served on the leadership board for South Jersey Women for Progressive Change (SJWPC) from 2018 until at least February 2020 , including as co-chair of the political engagement committee. The group describes itself as an \"8,000-member action network for intersectional grassroots advocacy and activism, open to all who identify as female or were assigned female at birth.\"\n\nWhile Altman has faced scrutiny for her tenure as the state director for the New Jersey Working Families Party, her leadership position with SJWPC so far has flown under the media radar. A Free Beacon review of SJWPC's publications shows the group embraced far-left positions on a variety of cultural issues.\n\nIn addition to its bimonthly general meetings, SJWPC also held several private study groups that workshopped various social issues including \"racial justice,\" the \"Asian model minority myth,\" \"white fragility,\" \"cultural appropriation,\" and \"alternatives to the police.\" The group held an August 2018 study group on \"policing\" that posed the questions \"Can you imagine a society without police?\" and asked whether police actions improve situations or \"make it worse?\"\n\nPrimary source materials for the workshop participants included \"A concise history of the connection between policing and slavery ,\" an essay describing \" alternatives to the police ,\" and a now deleted blog post titled \"What To Do Instead of Calling the Police\" that offered an \"introduction into alternatives to the police.\"\n\nAltman's group's official 2018 platform was in favor of \"divesting in [sic] prisons,\" \"debt-free college\" as an option for \"all students,\" \"protect[ing] our residents from deportation,\" and access to health care \"regardless ... of ability to pay.\" The group also opposed all fracking in New Jersey.\n\nSJWPC also tackled \"white privilege and white fragility\" in a September 2018 study group titled \"But I'm Not Racist: White Supremacy in Activist Spaces.\" This study group asked participants to consider how to \"overcome\" their own privilege and included an article titled \"Black-Only Spaces Harm No One-So Why Are White People So Upset?\" by Danny Cardwell. This article defended excluding white people from \"black-only\" spaces, claiming white people are \"in no way negatively impacted.\"\n\n\"The desire to decenter whiteness from discussions affecting people of color isn't the same as government policies designed to limit access to opportunity. White America is in no way negatively impacted by Black-only spaces,\" Cardwell wrote. \"Contrary to popular belief, Black-only spaces aren't a form of segregation.\"\n\nAnother reading included was a blog post titled \"Hey people with privilege, you need to be OK with making mistakes and being called out,\" which provided advice to those looking to \"fight inequity.\" The author argued that being \"called out\" on politically incorrect language is part of what someone \"signed up for\" when they have \"privilege.\"\n\n\"And a big part of this involves white colleagues, cisgender men, able-bodied people, and others with systemic privilege reflecting on their privilege and accepting uncomfortable feedback, sometimes publicly,\" the blog author wrote. \"If you are committed to fighting for social justice, you will make mistakes and be called out too. This is what we signed up for.\"\n\nThe Asian \"model minority myth\" study group lamented the idea that Asian Americans are less likely to live in poverty than other minority groups due to their focus on \"education and hard work.\" The April 2017 National Public Radio article assigned to the study group participants argued this \"model minority myth\" created a \"racial wedge\" between Asian and black Americans and did not take anti-black \"racism\" into account enough.\n\n\"Since the end of World War II, many white people have used Asian-Americans and their perceived collective success as a racial wedge. The effect? Minimizing the role racism plays in the persistent struggles of other racial/ethnic minority groups-especially black Americans,\" Kat Chow, the article's author wrote.\n\nOther \"anti-racism reading\" SJWPC recommended included \"Guidelines for Being Strong White Allies\" by Paul Kivel and \"A Few Pointers for Protesting While White\" by Tucker FitzGerald.\n\nRep. Andy Kim (D., N.J.) posed for a photo alongside Altman and other SJWPC members, according to the website's \"Our People\" page. Kim is now the frontrunner in New Jersey's Senate race after Sen. Bob Menendez (D.), who is battling bribery charges, dropped out of the Democratic nomination process. Kim endorsed Altman's campaign in April.\n\nAltman's campaign manager Rob West told the Free Beacon Altman does not support defunding the police now, but declined to comment on her previous involvement in SJWPC's work to reimagine policing.\n\n\"I do not support defunding the police. Public safety is an incredibly important issue-I welcome the opportunity to discuss it with Tom Kean Jr. whenever he's ready to come out of hiding and agree to a debate,\" Altman said in a statement to the Free Beacon .\n\nSince announcing her bid to unseat Rep. Thomas Kean Jr. (R., N.J.) in one of the most hotly contested 2024 House races, Altman has struck a conciliatory pose towards law enforcement. To commemorate police week last week, she wrote a statement thanking officers for their \"courage and dedication\" to keeping her community safe. The support, however, came after Altman, who served as the state director of the progressive New Jersey Working Families Party, called for fewer police.\n\n\"As we commemorate Police Week, I want to thank our law enforcement officers who serve with courage and dedication every day,\" Altman said .\n\n\"I promise to work with our police to ensure they have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.\"\n\nIn 2017, Altman said a \"reducing of policing\" would be \"positive ... for society.\"\n\nAltman in 2022 voiced her opposition to a state bill that would have provided more funding for police officers in cities with high crime rates.\n\n\"Super problematic incentive structure alert! This bill gives MORE cops to cities where MORE ARRESTS are made. Think about that for 2 seconds.\" Altman wrote . \"Feels like we've seen this movie before and it ends poorly.\"\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , Anti-Racism , Defund the Police , House Democrats , New Jersey , Progressive Movement\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "What We Talk About When We Talk About Deaths of Despair\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, the number of Americans dying from nonmedical, self-inflicted causes-drug overdose, suicide, and alcohol-related illness-has exploded.\n\nPer capita rates of death from drug poisoning, suicide, and alcoholic liver disease (a proxy for the long-run effects of heavy drinking)* have roughly doubled over the past 20 years. Drug overdose and suicide in particular are responsible for a nearly unprecedented multiyear decline in life expectancy in the United States. Drugs are the leading cause of death for Americans under 50 .\n\nThis explosion has prompted endless speculation on underlying causes. Because each of these causes of death is \"self-inflicted\" (i.e., not caused by a disease or the direct fault of another as in homicide or vehicular manslaughter), they have been grouped together. And because each tends to be associated with depressive behavior and poor social circumstances, the media have adopted a single descriptor for them: \"deaths of despair.\"\n\nThis term has its origin in a particular academic context, naming rising death rates among middle-age, low-status whites. But while the term means something empirical and precise to researchers, the media have adopted \"deaths of despair\" as a causal, rather than descriptive, label, with deaths being linked to some ill-defined \"despair\" allegedly permeating American society.\n\nCommentators inevitably tie this \"despair\" to some other large scale trend- inequality , fatherlessness , loneliness , a lack of \" meaning ,\" the decline of religion -which they argue must be addressed if we want to stop the dying. Each of these trends is concerning in its own right, and all may indeed increase a person's risk for suicide, drug overdose, or alcohol death. But it does not follow that these kinds of deaths can be grouped together by cause, or that the cure for one is the cure for another.\n\nIn reality, the causes that make up the monolith \"deaths of despair\" exhibit deep heterogeneity. A set of crises initially concentrated among poorly educated, older whites has spread. As of 2017, they each predominate in different states and exhibit different trends over time.\n\nPrecision matters, especially when talking about something as grim as death. \"Deaths of despair\" has become shorthand for everything that ails America. But the easy stories that people like to tell with that shorthand cannot stand up to close inspection.\n\nThe phrase \"deaths of despair\" comes from the work of economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They explored the basic concepts (although did not yet use the phrase) in a 2015 paper , \"Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century.\"\n\nFor decades, mortality rates had been falling across the developed world. But in the paper, Case and Deaton identified something odd: Mortality among middle-aged, non-Hispanic whites actually began to rise in the late 1990s, upending the popular assumption rates would decline indefinitely.\n\nIn the original paper, Case and Deaton linked this unexpected reversal to increases in deaths from drug overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related liver diseases. They also identified declines in physical and mental health and increases in disability, and noted that the mortality increase concentrated among whites without a college degree.\n\nIn subsequent research , the pair contended that the decline is the result of \"progressively worsening labor market opportunities\" across generations, and so may not abate for decades. Other research has reinforced the nexus of causes Case and Deaton identified, including tying prescription opioid use to labor force drop-out and linking the weakening labor market for low-status whites to declining marriage and civil society.\n\n\"Deaths of despair\" as originally conceptualized, then, names (a) a reversal of trend for the white mortality rate, which (b) is caused primarily by increases in drug, suicide, and alcohol-associated death rates among (c) middle-aged whites without college degrees, probably caused by (d) collapsing labor market conditions and social capital among that community.\n\nAmong other things, this likely helps explain the election of President Donald Trump. But it reflects the social condition of one particular population, and so is not a general diagnosis for society's present ills. Whereas there is a neat story to be told linking job market decline to \"deaths of despair\" among Case and Deaton's original groups of interest, it does not follow either that this is the only group affected by those causes of death or that what explains those causes of death within that group will explain it in other groups.\n\nIt may make more sense to understand low-status, middle-aged whites as a sort of canary in the coal mine, among whom rising deaths of despair first manifested, but who now make up just part of the overall population being affected. Because they were experiencing weakening social capital and job opportunities, they were particularly prone to being affected by a change in the drug supply or suicide contagion.\n\nBy looking at the data on suicides, drug overdoses, and alcoholic liver disease more closely, we can see what these causes look like outside of Case and Deaton's population of interest. Whereas they looked related there, they demonstrate some surprising differences elsewhere.\n\nUnlike the other deaths of despair, rates of drug overdose death have risen steadily for nearly 40 years across multiple age groups and ethnicities. Low-status, blue-collar whites were just one of many groups hit by this increase.\n\nThe standard story about drug deaths is that large pharmaceutical firms pushed hyper-potent prescription opioids on unsuspecting Americans starting in the late '90s. But a surprising analysis released late last year suggests that is just part of a longer story, finding that the rate of drug overdose death has risen continuously-and exponentially-since the 1970s.\n\nActual rates of deadly drug use, as best we can tell, have remained roughly flat since the early 2000s. The share of Americans reporting past-month drug use has risen from 8.3 percent in 2002 to 11.2 percent in 2017 , but that trend is mostly attributable to rising marijuana usage following legalization.\n\nRates of past-month cocaine use have been roughly flat, and past-month heroin use only increased significantly in the past five years -and then only from 0.1 to 0.2 percent of the population. \"Despair\" is not driving an increased demand for deadly drugs. The drugs are just getting deadlier.\n\nIt appears that drug overdose deaths are increasingly unlinked from economic conditions. In a 2018 paper , \"Deaths of Despair or Drug Problems?\" UVA economist Christopher Ruhm finds that while counties which experience lower levels of medium-term economic growth also saw greater increases in drug overdose death, \"the relationship is weak and mostly explained by confounding factors.\"\n\nThe underlying cause of the drug crisis in 2019 is not labor market conditions-Ruhm notes that if it were, the crisis would have abated with the end of the Great Recession. Rather, Ruhm identifies compelling evidence that drug overdose death is better predicted by \"changes in the drug environment,\" specifically the introduction of heroin and fentanyl.\n\nThe exponential increase in overdose death rates is a function not of increasing demand produced by despair, but of an exponential increase in the cheapness and deadliness of supply. That increase is led by the mass switch to heroin and then to fentanyl.\n\nThis supply-side analysis has been confirmed by on-the-ground research. A group of drug researchers found that although fentanyl has become omnipresent , most users lack the resources and wherewithal to identify it. What is more, \"because fentanyl is frequently marketed deceptively as other drugs, users lack information and choice to express demand effectively.\"\n\nTo be sure, \"despair\" is comorbid with drug use-as mentioned, men without work are far more likely to be prescription painkiller users. But drug deaths are not just rising among older people, in \"burned out\" communities, or whites; they are up among young people, among black people, and in places that have not experienced economic decline.\n\nUnlike the other two \"deaths of despair,\" the story of the drug deaths is simple: It is about supply, not demand.\n\nTrends like those cited above-inequality, the decline of marriage and religiosity, etc.-have all been on-going for decades. But suicide only took a sudden and sharp spike upwards at the turn of the millennium, bucking roughly a decade and a half of decline.\n\nWhat changed? What would have caused America to suddenly become so much more despairing in the year 2000?\n\nOne of the answers to this question is deceptively simple: trade normalization with China-what MIT economist David Autor has labeled \" China Shock .\" The differential effect of offshoring on America's blue-collar workers helps explain the initial rise. In a 2018 paper , economists Justin Pierce and Peter Schott showed a relationship between exposure to China Shock and increase in suicides (as well as drug overdose deaths). \"These results,\" they write, \"are consistent with [exposed white's] relatively high employment in manufacturing, the sector most affected by the change in trade policy.\"\n\nToday, suicides remain concentrated among whites and Native Americans (who are frequently ignored in conversations about deaths of despair despite their shocking rates of OD, suicide, and alcohol-associated death). But these groups have always had higher rates of suicide compared with other ethnicities-what explains this disparity is debated .\n\nBut whereas-per Pierce, Schott, Case, and Deaton-the suicide rise started among low-status, middle-aged whites, it appears to have spread. The CDC found that while suicide has most increased in rural (\"noncore\") areas, it has risen significantly across all levels of urbanization, from large metros on down. Suicide is up even in high-status areas like the high schools of Palo Alto .\n\nAnd speaking of high schoolers, suicide has spread from middle-aged Americans across age groups. Among 15- to 19-year-olds, the rate rose from 6.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2007 to 11.8 in 2017. Similar increases are apparent across the board for young adults 20 to 24 and 25 to 34.\n\nThe recency of these spikes, and their cross-age, cross-urbanization appearance, suggests whatever is causing the inversion in the suicide trend has to have taken effect very recently. There is a clear recent story for middle-aged, rural whites in China Shock, but there is not one for the rest of the population. (There is at least one popular explanation, at least for teens, in the rise of social media; but that account is more controversial and less robust than it at first sounds.)\n\nAny large, long-term trend-rising inequality, falling family formation, etc.-used to explain the suicide spike needs to grapple with its recency. It is not clear what is going on, but \"despair\" does not cut it as an explanation.\n\n\"Alcohol\" deaths are the odd man out among deaths of despair. Deaths from acute alcohol poisoning have increased slightly over the past 20 years, rising from 0.1 per 100,000 in 1999 to 0.7 in 2017. But Case and Deaton looked at a different measure, alcohol-related liver diseases, rates of which have risen about 50 percent since 1999.\n\nUnlike drug overdose and suicide, both of which are discrete events, alcohol-associated diseases are a product of years of heavy drinking. Although the range of time spent drinking before onset varies widely , patients who use alcohol heavily for five or more years are at risk of liver disease, particularly if they are in their 40s or older .\n\nThis last fact suggests rising alcohol-associated deaths may just reflect a graying population. Indeed, adjusting the data to hold the age composition constant** shows the increase is less pronounced than it might first seem. (Making the same adjustments to drug and suicide rates do not produce changes nearly as striking.)\n\nStill, the data show an increase in deaths. Some of that may represent an increase in drinking: A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found \"[s]ubstantial increases in alcohol use, high-risk drinking, and DSM-IV alcohol use disorder\" between the period 1991-1992 and 2012-2013.\n\nAnother explanation is economic. One study published last year noted there was an \"inflection point\" around 2009 for liver cirrhosis and cancer. \"Given that the worsening trends began after 2008, a year marked by the global financial crisis and a subsequent economic recession in the USA, a differential economic impact on specific states may explain some of the results,\" the authors wrote of the geographic distribution of deaths.\n\nOther analysis indicates that alcohol-associated diseases are responsive to the price of alcohol. Vox 's German Lopez cites a study which concludes that a \"10% price increase would cut the death rate [from alcohol-caused diseases by] 9-25%.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, the best explanation might just be Case and Deaton's. Most of the increase of alcohol deaths has been among whites, and it has been predominantly in rural areas (urban rates have actually declined.)\n\nIf this is the case, grouping alcohol deaths with suicides and drug overdoses, which have spread through the population and are a product of more than just the present challenges of deindustrializing white America, makes less and less sense from the vantage point of 2019.\n\nRemember this: Nothing is monocausal . That is the basic error \"deaths of despair\" leads so many commentators into-the lure of a neat and tidy picture of social trends, all too often one that confirms our political biases.\n\nIn rising drug overdose, suicide, and alcoholic disease deaths, America is facing three distinct but related challenges. In certain populations-especially the low-status whites on whom Case and Deaton focused-these challenges can be tied to a single cluster of causes. But what is true of one group is not true of another, and focusing on each cause reveals different patterns and/or underlying causal mechanisms.\n\nEach of these challenges are real. But until we stop thinking about them as monocausal, until \"deaths of despair\" gives way to the interlocking but distinct death crises, we cannot begin to imagine how to solve them.\n\nUPDATE: The map of deaths of despair by state was updated to reflect only data on alcoholic liver deaths as defined by ICD-10 code K74. The previous chart included additional deaths identified with other codes, included during previous research and not updated.\n\nPublished under: Drugs , Economy , Financial Crisis , Opioids\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "What Woke's Worth and Why\n\nIn early 2019, Ta-Nehisi Coates delivered the inaugural \"Distinguished Diversity Lecture\" at the Ohio State University. Coates's hourlong engagement, which included a reading, a moderated conversation, and an audience Q&A, cost OSU $41,500.\n\nThe price tag included first-class airfare, a per diem , and private transportation, a contract obtained by the Washington Free Beacon shows. OSU also sold Coates's books, put him up at a four-star hotel that, per his contract, included \"an indoor pool whenever possible\" and provided a green room with two bottles of water and one box of Nature Valley \"Crunchy Oats and Dark Chocolate\" granola. The contract prohibits any fruit with pits.\n\nCoates is a MacArthur \"genius\" and bestselling author, but even accomplished writers typically don't rake in speaking fees nearly equivalent to the median household income of the city they are visiting. That sort of payment, however, is the industry standard for the rock stars of the new \"wokeness,\" a survey of nearly 20 contracts obtained through public records requests shows.\n\nDemand for events like the one Coates headlined has risen even as statistics suggest racism has declined-there were fewer complaints of racial discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2019, for example, than at any point in the last two decades.\n\nSo why is the market for woke still booming?\n\nCommentators left and right have tried to answer this question, with the former attributing the phenomenon to a developing political conscience among white America and the latter chalking it up to an irrational and ever-growing religious fervor.\n\nA look at how well racial progressivism now pays encourages a different view: that big businesses shelling out for top speakers like Coates are responding to the demands of their most-valuable employees, for whom compensation is as much about the opportunity to hear their views and values affirmed as it is about salary.\n\nThe Free Beacon obtained 19 contracts from five \"antiracist\" commentators who gained prominence in the wake of last summer's protests: Coates, the academics Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo, journalists Ijeoma Oluo and Isabel Wilkerson, and the criminal justice advocate Bryan Stevenson.\n\nThe fees they command are big and getting bigger. Nearly half of the payments are for $20,000 or more; just two are under $10,000. Kendi's fees rose to $20,000 last year, compared with $10,000 to $15,000 in 2018-2019. DiAngelo made $20,000 a speech in 2021 versus $15,000 in 2019, and Oluo's speaking fee jumped to $15,000 this year from $12,000 in November 2020.\n\nBoth the speakers and the institutions hosting them are tight-lipped about the rationale for these eye-popping payments. Reached through representatives, the speakers did not respond to a request for comment about why organizations were willing to pay so much for their services. Of the 15 universities from which contracts were obtained, just 5 responded. Two merely acknowledged the event in question had taken place, and three said that events were aimed at improving race relations or promoting diversity of opinion.\n\nThe past half-decade of protests \"calling out\" campus racism and \"canceling\" dissenting speakers cast doubt on these explanations, as increasing wokeness correlates with increasing racial strife. So does research evidence that diversity training programs do not promote racial understanding, and may even reinforce biases. If hours and hours of training can't reduce intolerance, it's hard to see how an hourlong book talk could work real change.\n\nThis logic extends from public universities to the corporate sector, where firms from Disney to Lockheed Martin have embraced woke corporate culture, going beyond legal compliance to publicly support progressive social causes like Black Lives Matter and Democrats' \"voting rights\" laws. What's making these big entities so aggressively progressive?\n\nIf diversity initiatives do not change institutions, they may mollify those who work for them. The progressive institutional turn is likely fueled by the group columnist Josh Barro labeled \"woke labor\"-individuals whose high levels of education make them desirable employees and who are disproportionately likely to be fixated on politics.\n\nHighly credentialed workers-those with college or advanced degrees-are typically political progressives. The correlation is borne out by the ever-growing support for \"wokeness\" among highly educated white liberals. It's also supported by research indicating that better-performing employees at an anonymous management consulting firm were more likely to participate in social responsibility initiatives, and that the most-skilled freelancers are also those most likely to ask for less money after learning about a company's charitable giving.\n\nEven a small fraction of high-status workers can hold outsized sway. As the political scientist Richard Hanania noted , the most politically active people are disproportionately likely to be liberals. Employers can cater to their strongly held preferences without doing too much to alienate the more politically apathetic majority by bringing in speakers, by encouraging employees to celebrate their political identities at work, and by aligning the firm with progressive causes.\n\nA focus on how employees influence corporate decision-making makes sense. If consumers were driving the corporate trend toward wokeness, we should see more corporate differentiation-some firms would specialize in competing for the other side of the political divide. It could also be that top corporate decision makers are themselves woke. But American companies have spent just $250 million of the $50 billion pledged last year toward \"racial equity\" initiatives, suggesting their largesse was motivated more by self-interest than magnanimity.\n\nIf the most desirable employees are increasingly also the wokest, then large firms can use politics as a way to keep them around and to draw in new employees. To some people, being able to be woke at work is worth something, and the money firms shell out for wokeness is a measure of that worth.\n\nIt's not unusual for businesses to offer so-called nonpecuniary benefits like health insurance or gym access. A culture, or having a certain set of values, can be a form of compensation as well, insofar as workers may be willing to forgo pay in order to be a part of it.\n\nCorporations have used such cultural practices to keep employees happy. Research on many of America's largest corporations finds, for example, that firms are more likely to engage in \"corporate social responsibility\" as unemployment insurance payments rise-in other words, that the typically liberal values articulated in corporate social responsibility initiatives serve the bottom line by keeping employees on the payroll.\n\nBy contrast, companies looking to keep politics out of the workplace have suffered consequences. Two tech firms that recently banned political discussion, Basecamp and Coinbase, suffered mass resignations: Roughly a third of Basecamp's 57 employees quit, as did about 60 Coinbase employees. Both firms pay well , but to these employees, that money was apparently less valuable than the political culture of their workplace.\n\nCelebration of political protest, high-profile speakers, and other hallmarks of corporate wokeness are just the other side of this coin. Just as employees leave when the culture changes, they go to places where their values are celebrated-to companies and universities that profess to be woke.\n\nThe diversity industry was worth an estimated $8 billion two decades ago . It's almost certainly grown exponentially since then-not because it works, but because for a select group, the product it sells is often more important than getting paid.\n\nCharles Fain Lehman is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor at City Journal .

      "text": "The Salami Slice Presidency\n\nThe 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston will be remembered not because Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was portrayed in a favorable light, but because a major political talent made his national debut. A young, personable, idealistic, and liberal African-American U.S. Senate candidate from Illinois, Barack Obama, delivered an inspiring keynote address in which he told an anxious nation that \"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America-there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and white America and a Latino America and an Asian America-there is the United States of America.\" And America swooned.\n\nOnly the most cynical among us could have penetrated at the time the gauzy scrim that masked Obama's purpose and ambition as he began his march to the highest office in the land. Little did the audience know that eight years later these supposedly United States would be riven by intense class, race, partisan, and sectarian divisions, as polarized factions struggled to define the size and scope of the federal government.\n\nLittle did the audience know that the man who spoke so eloquently at the podium would find himself, less than a decade hence, embracing and exploiting the very same \"spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of 'anything goes,'\" who \"slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states,\" that he once denounced.\n\nThe Obama legacy is therefore not confined to presiding over the worst economic recovery since World War II. It is distinguished not only by the president's failure to address adequately or imaginatively America's broken tax code and budget process, or by his lackadaisical approach to health entitlements. What makes Obama's presidency ironic and indeed rather tragic is his persistent betrayal of the promises contained in that 2004 speech. The image of Obama as reconciler and unifier grows more distant and faint with each day. The president has not lessened our antagonisms or detoxified our political culture. He has made them worse.\n\nWhat is most remarkable is Obama's obstinate refusal to acknowledge the tensions he has aggravated. \"I don't think you or anybody who's been watching the campaign would say that in any way we have tried to divide the country,\" he defensively told Entertainment Tonight Wednesday evening. \"We've always tried to bring the country together.\"\n\nThis was Obama doing his best impression of Captain Renault in Casablanca , a man just shocked, shocked to find division and anger and hatred in the country he has governed for three and a half years. Not 24 hours before the Entertainment Tonight spot, his vice president had told a largely black Democratic audience in southern Virginia that the Romney-Ryan ticket would \" put y'all back in chains .\" These are the men who are trying \"to bring the country together\"?\n\nAt the beginning of August, the president's affiliated Super PAC released an incendiary advertisement that implied Romney was somehow responsible for the death of a steelworker's wife by cancer. Obama's campaign had featured the same steelworker on a conference call in the spring , before it shifted its focus to what may or may not be in Romney's tax returns and whether the Republican nominee may have once committed a felony . At multiple points during this week's Iowa visit the president himself ridiculed Mitt Romney for taking a family trip with the dog kennel on the roof of the car. This is months after he had described the House Republican budget, which Ryan authored, as \" thinly veiled Social Darwinism \" that is \" antithetical to our entire history .\"\n\nThe attacks and slanders and demands for apologies grew so intense a week before the first party convention that veterans of the mainstream media struggled to find a precedent for the warfare. \"All restraints are gone, the guardrails have disappeared, and there is no incentive for anyone hold back,\" wrote 30-year veteran Dan Balz of the Washington Post . \"This is about as ugly as I've seen it,\" Brit Hume said on Fox . Mark Helprin of Time and MSNBC called it \" nuclear war .\"\n\nThe merchants of snark on the Internet and cable juxtaposed sarcastically the campaign sludge-fest with the candidates' stated desire for a thoughtful contrast between the big choices facing the country. Yet the cynics and smirking pundits missed the point: The importance and clarity of this election is precisely why it has been so dirty and bitter and cruel.\n\nAnemic economic growth and the albatross of Obamacare have pushed Obama's approval rating to worrisome levels for an incumbent . His re-election depends on turning out his base of white liberals, Millennials, and minorities at levels similar to 2008 . Otherwise the game is over. Obama, Biden, David Axelrod, Jim Messina, and David Plouffe know that fear motivates people. The president and his allies have thus spent the last eight months distributing goodies while demonizing the Republicans. Obama's abandonment of his 2004 persona was neither an accident nor a casualty of politics. It was a strategic choice.\n\nThe appeal to liberals began with the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline in January and continued through Obama's hastily arranged endorsement of same-sex marriage in early May. His promises to shift the tax burden increasingly on the wealthy, as well as his rhetorical pose of middle-class populism , also set liberal hearts aflutter.\n\nFor the young, Obama offers subsidies for college tuition , the ability to stay on parental health plans until age 26 , free birth control, an end to the war in Afghanistan , and the prospect of a diverse, nonjudgmental, technological, secular future.\n\nObama has treated the minority vote the most cynically. Striking fear in the black community is part of the strategy. Biden's remarks in Virginia did not occur in isolation. Last year the chairman of the Democratic National Committee accused the Republicans of wanting \" to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws .\" In May, Attorney General Eric Holder told the Council of Black Churches that Republicans have created a situation in which \" some of the achievements that defined the civil rights movement now hang in the balance .\" The controversy over constitutional and popular state legislation to require photo identification at the polls has become so agitated and raw that even mild-mannered authors pen screeds describing half the country as \"oligarchs and racists clad in the skins of dead elephants.\"\n\nThe president's media supporters tried to portray Romney's speech to the NAACP as a sort of racial insult . Shortly after the Republican ticket was announced, Obama donor and rap mogul Russell Simmons wrote that Romney-Ryan \"will destroy our people.\" This week, too, the Obama administration filed a Supreme Court amicus brief defending race-based affirmative action. The racial and ethnic lines have been drawn.\n\nWhen the people's representatives in Congress blocked the DREAM Act amnesty for young, illegal immigrants, Obama took matters into his own hands and declared it policy in June. The executive action went into effect Wednesday. The lines of Millennial-generation undocumented aliens stretching for blocks in America's largest cities testified to Obama's \"slice-and-dice\" approach to politics. ICE agents might as well have handed out \" Obama Biden 2012 \" buttons along with the work permits. Meanwhile the president promises to enact \"comprehensive immigration reform\" in a second term.\n\nThat this Balkanization of the American electorate might have been avoided comes as cold comfort. Whether it was at the 2004 Democratic convention, or Election Night 2008 at Grant Park, or Inauguration Day 2009, or the memorial ceremony for the victims of the Tucson shooting in January 2011, or the televised address on the killing of Osama bin Laden that May, Americans have always responded to Obama when he speaks to them as the leader of the entire nation, not as the leader of a political party or of the progressive movement.\n\nTime and again, however, Obama has missed opportunities to seize the ground of national unity and possibly split the GOP. He could have for example included defense funding in the stimulus bill, or decided to go back to the drawing board on health care after Scott Brown's victory in Massachusetts, or embraced fully the Bowles-Simpson Commission's recommendations in January 2011. He did none of these things. What we got instead was a mobilization of the center-left coalition toward partisan ends that had been on the agenda for years and in some cases decades. What we got was an unshackled and unhinged country whose people are at each other's throats.\n\n\"Alongside our famous individualism,\" Barack Obama said in 2004 , \"there's another ingredient in the American saga, a belief that we're all connected as one people.\" That sentiment may have been true once. It certainly isn't true now. Barack Obama's America is an America coming apart .\n\nPublished under: Barack Obama , Obama Campaign , Obamacare\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

Nearby Jackson Park has no similar statue, but is still named after the seventh president.\n\n\"When I see that, I see a person who fought for the liberties, and I see people that fought for the justice and freedom of white America, because at that moment, we were still chattel slavery, and was three-fifths of humans,\" Duke said. \"Some people out here ask me, say 'Well, you know, he taught his slaves to read.'

      "text": "Critical Thoughts on Music Critics\n\nIf you were a teenager in 1980s London, you had a world of music on your doorstep. The triple detonations of rock 'n' roll, the '60s boom, and punk had seeded the city with dozens of small venues, from crumbling dancehalls like the Hammersmith Palais to basement clubs and the backrooms of Victorian pubs. For little more than the price of a pint or a packet of fags, you could hear just about any style of music you wanted to hear. Age restrictions were printed on the tickets, but not once was I asked for my age.\n\nOur guide to this embarrassment of deafening riches was the trinity of weekly music papers. The New Musical Express was left-wing, prone to fits of critical theory, enraptured by cack-handed indie bands, and hence highly popular with students. It was an NME cover that announced the most influential shift in my generation's taste: In late 1982, Paul Weller broke up The Jam at the height of their success. Returning to his Mod roots, Weller declared for American soul music, posed in French cafés, and launched The Style Council. Weller expressed this shift on the NME 's cover not by dressing with his customary Mod punctiliousness, but by taking off all his clothes, daubing his spindly white torso with body paint, and hiding his shortcomings behind a well-placed shrub. Only a graduate of the Frankfurt School of Rock would have thought this a good idea.\n\nSounds was suspicious of all ideas, in the English tradition. It was the paper of no-nonsense rock, including the heavy metal bands that still emerged from the ex-industrial cities of the provinces like dinosaurs that had dodged the meteor strike. Its politics were as solidly traditional as its taste, and at one point caused it to sponsor a sort of musical Clockwork Orange called Oi!, a racist puddle of white identity politics into which the proletarian end of punk eventually pooled. As you can imagine, Sounds and the NME hated each other.\n\nThe third paper was Melody Maker . The other two papers distrusted Melody Maker because it seemed to have no politics at all. It kept an indecently commercial eye on the charts. It was printed on better quality paper. It declared a cynical neutrality in the shadow class war between the NME , where music criticism aspired to, and Sounds , whose writers suggested they would be just as happy if you used their paper as a rag to clean the engine oil from your fingers. For Melody Maker , music was about making melody. This is why its writers were susceptible to black dance music. Incredibly, the other two papers ridiculed this openness as a lack of seriousness.\n\nWe didn't realize it at the time, but Melody Maker was the future. My generation were Thatcher's Children. The shadow of the war was receding. The shabby, straightened world of our childhoods was being reshaped by the middle-class revolt of the 1979 elections. The old working class had broken down; Thatcher's war on the miners' unions was its Waterloo. By the end of the 1980s, Britain had completed a painful transit from an industrial and imperial economy to a post-imperial service economy. A majority of its people owned their own homes, for the first time in its history.\n\nApart from the losers in the Oi! demographic, we were delighted. The endless recession of the '70s and early '80s had taught us how to have a good time on a short budget. We made the most of these life lessons in the credit and consumption boom that ensued, and which, with occasional interruptions from fiscal reality, kept ensuing until the crash of 2008. We were hedonists, and it was fantastic. We had grown up with political and class conflict as we had grown up with bland food and bad weather. Now that the Old England really was dying, a teenager with a part-time job could take cheap holidays in the Med and drink real espresso.\n\nWe absorbed Paul Weller's style counsel. Music was part of our escape into the consumer future. \"Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young,\" Weller had told us, and we imbibed it all. We really didn't care if it was made by blacks or whites. There had been no shortage of racism in 1950s' Britain, and there was plenty of it in 1980s' Britain too, but the radio and the charts had always been interracial. We loved American music as the sound of freedom. It was all foreign to us, and the sound and the songs mattered more than the color of their performers. But we despised the American division of the Hot 100 from the R&B chart for what it was: the Jim Crow of the airwaves. Jimi Hendrix had to make it in London before the free-your-mind white hippies of California would deign to listen to him.\n\nWe got the new dance music from Detroit and Chicago at once. House was the latest in the succession of black American sounds, from jazz and blues to R&B and soul to funk (which we called Rare Groove), disco, and rap. We heard all of this on the radio, often at odd hours on local BBC stations. A network of independent record shops sold reissues and imports on vinyl. We were heirs to decades of what was then called \"youth culture.\" The grooves of black America were as much a part of that heritage as the banging and crashing of our indie bands. We knew little of the social realities of America, but we spent hours studying Sly's \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" and Funkadelic's \"America Eats Its Young.\"\n\nIt was natural to see Primal Scream and all the other Velvet Underground impersonators on Saturday night, then buy Rare Groove and reggae compilations on cassette at Sunday street market in Camden Town. It was natural that the Sunday session at the Dingwalls club in Camden was where the latest British reworking of American influence happened. The label \"Acid Jazz\" was an inspired attempt to cash in on the tabloid outrage about the Acid House raves which would occupy so many of our weekends in the coming years. Really, it was Rare Groove played by British amateurs, or black music played by white people.\n\nSomething similar was happening in Manchester at the Hacienda club. Again, it was natural that, incited by a new drug called Ecstasy, House music, and James Brown's \"Funky Drummer\" break would cross-pollinate with Manchester's indie rock tradition. We heard the first rumble of the revolution in rock music in 1987: the first Happy Mondays' album, Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic , a lowlife art-funk collage produced by John Cale.\n\nBy 1989, the division between British rock music and dance music had simply collapsed, and Sounds and the NME had joined Melody Maker on the dance floor. At the end of that year, another Manchester band, the Stone Roses, released \"Fool's Gold,\" a shimmering 10-minute groove mixing the House four-on-the-floor with the ghosting of the \"Funky Drummer\" snare, wah-wah funk, and, thankfully buried in the reverb sludge, indie crooning. The three-minute single was dead to us. I spent much of the '90s playing one-finger guitar and pumping a wah-wah pedal.\n\nWe had started as bedroom guitarists. We became studio technicians, learning how to combine the new technology of synths and samplers with real instruments. We didn't realize it, but my generation was returning the rock rhythm section to its roots in black music. The British Invasion bands had imitated that feel, but it had leached out by degrees until nothing was left and rock was the white man's sepulcher.\n\nNone of this crossed over into America, except on college radio and in college towns. As punk didn't break through in America until Nirvana, so the \"breakbeat\" (as we called the \"Funky Drummer\" break and its derivatives) wouldn't break through for nearly two decades. When I toured the United States in 1997 with the James Taylor Quartet, an Acid Jazz group playing Hammond organ funk, the color bar in taste was blatant. The white student audiences in Portland, Oregon, and Burlington, Vermont, thought we were being ironic, and came in fancy dress as Huggy Bear and other pimps. In Atlanta, we played to an almost entirely black crowd, most of them dressed in expensive leisure wear, and members of the audience thanked us afterwards for honoring their music when so many young black musicians didn't care. Today, the same sound burbles away in malls and on Netflix soundtracks.\n\nWe really didn't bother with new American white music. Instructed by the music papers, we had had our teenage ears blown out at early club shows by Hüsker Dü, Dinosaur Jr., The Pixies, and Nirvana. The noise and speed were fun, but we had grown up with Motörhead on the radio: louder-faster alone was not enough. Nirvana in particular sounded grim and inept, a sort of Pixies tribute act gone sour.\n\nIt was clear that something had gone wrong in American rock. Their mainstream bands were disgracefully trapped in the '70s, a mixture of clapped-out cokeheads like Aerosmith and the juggernaut of mediocrity that was Bon Jovi. Their indie bands prided themselves on a mumbling passive resistance. If they couldn't be bothered, why should we buy their records? Their refusal to even attempt syncopation suggested that they, whether they knew it or not, were performing a cliché of whiteness as surely as Public Enemy were performing a cliché of blackness.\n\nThe rot was most obvious in Rolling Stone magazine. We hardly ever looked at Rolling Stone on the newsstand, let alone bought it. We read Lester Bangs on '60s garage bands and Detroit punk. We read Greil Marcus on the Sex Pistols and Situationism, and Peter Guralnick on soul music. We read Fred and Judy Vermorel on fandom, Charlie Gillett and George Melly on the rock business, and Richard Meltzer's The Aesthetics of Rock on the Nietzschean drama of The Doors. We saw Rolling Stone for what it was: the critical equivalent of cancer of the ear.\n\nWe were precocious. We were pretentious. We were right. Rolling Stone had sold out our heritage for a mess of pottage and a little baggie of coke. It kept the white indie bands out, it kept the blacks down, and it kept printing stories about David Crosby and Jackson Browne. Its parasitic dependency on the major labels had created a third-rate professionalization which stifled American rock writing. Nothing paid better than writing for Rolling Stone . Nothing was worse than reading the results.\n\nIt is almost impossible now to understand how important Rolling Stone once seemed, not only in the estimation of the people who wrote for it, but also because it is increasingly hard to understand why rock music seemed to matter at all. The cult of Hunter S. Thompson, running Gertrude Stein a close second as the most overrated writer of the 20th century, suggests how Rolling Stone flattered the self-indulgence of the Boomers, and how empty their pose of rebellion really was. Any magazine of integrity would have refused to print the racist division of American music into the Hot 100 and the R&B charts. Any writer of integrity would have refused to perform the critical equivalent of playing at Sun City.\n\nI must admit that Dave Marsh barely figured in our musicological investigations. We knew him as the author of Born to Run: The Bruce Springsteen Story , a press release masquerading as a biography. An early editor of Creem magazine, Marsh became a regular at Rolling Stone in the '70s. While I was receiving my heterodox musical education as a teenager in '80s London, Marsh was writing a purist's newsletter, Rock 'n' Roll Confidential. More recently, Marsh, ever the gatekeeper, has served as one of the bouncers on the pearly gates of posterity, deciding who gets into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. He has also written for a left-wing website called Counterpunch, which has an unseemly obsession with the Jews.\n\nMarsh changed Rock 'n' Roll Confidential to Rock 'n' Rap Confidential after deciding that rap and hip-hop were \"the most exciting, rebellious, hardest-rocking music of the early '90s.\" That judgment confirms how out of synch Britain and America were by that point. We followed hip-hop. If, like me, you were working as a jazz musician, the rap-jazz crossover of A Tribe Called Quest and Gang Starr was briefly thrilling. We worked with rappers, who were mostly amiable but occasionally sinister comedians, but their fictive transgressions seemed petty compared with the mass illegality of the unlicensed raves we attended in our off hours, and the rappers' unimaginative cycles of loops seemed equally limited compared with the vast electronic vistas that \"dance music,\" as we called it, had opened. Again, it took 20 years for white America to accept House, dance music, and the digital revolution that underpinned both.\n\nDave Marsh and I come from different musical worlds, and not only because, on the evidence of Kick Out the Jams , he cannot play a note. So it is with some surprise that I find myself half-agreeing with the broad chronology of Kick Out the Jams . Like Lester Bangs, he saw at once that Led Zep and The Eagles were impostors. As early as 1991, Marsh saw that a \"white-dominated music industry\" was denying the audible reality of \"the Death of Rock.\" He saw that the MP3 would destroy the economic foundations of the old music business, and twigged in 1999 that \"the deejays who play the records are more important than the singers who make them.\" Having waited in vain for the social revolution, he recognized the radical implications of the technological revolution on the '90s, and he recognized that the apparent absence of politics in the Melody Maker view of the world was really the onset of depoliticization. But his politics addled his musical perspective.\n\nMarsh was exposed to the MC5 at an early age, but this was no excuse after about 1972. The history of popular music, black, white, and blue, proves that a business of fleeting fashions and raging capitalism cannot support radical change in anything other than hemlines or offshore accountancy. Marsh recognizes that music is \"a capitalist system,\" but persists in thinking it can nevertheless precipitate a social revolution. He is understandably angry, because he is perpetually being let down by artists who never agreed to shoulder his ideological burden to begin with (see: Springsteen, B.). As it is written in the Book of Strummer: \"The message on the tablets was Valium.\"\n\nMarsh is a good writer by rock standards; which is to say, a solid second-rater by any other critical standards, and a definite third-rater by the standards of criticism which, like the criticism of literature or classical music, presumes basic technical or historical knowledge on the part of the critic. The absence of which makes his strongest opinions his least substantial.\n\nCountry music \"markets racial antagonism,\" but there's always room for whataboutery about Louis Farrakhan. Wynton Marsalis and his band are not classicists who preserved the glory of African-American music. They are \"smirking prizewinners holding their brothers down.\" Neil Young is Marsh's \"enemy\" because of his \"meathead\" endorsement of Ronald Reagan, but Pete Seeger, of all people, is \"a prodigious talent,\" and his music is preserving the \"golden thread\" that is \"weaving the garment of human survival.\" I am not making this up.\n\nIt is true that Elvis was not a deliberate \"thief\": He was a spontaneous practitioner of musical \"integration.\" It is highly debatable that this happened because of the New Deal, as Marsh argues in the keynote selection, because the New Deal's electrification gave even rural whites access to black sounds on the radio. It is demonstrable that \"integration\" under the aegis of the state is not always the sacred value that Marsh thinks it is. As the brilliant German historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch noted in Three New Deals (2006), the regimes in Germany and Russia were working on similar lines, and also sponsoring the arts.\n\nThe \"musical and moral legacies\" of Frank Zappa are extolled. Madonna's Like a Prayer is \"such an excellent album.\" Marvin Gaye is mentioned only in a drive-by shot about unspecified \"pretensions.\" Frank Sinatra's success came from joining \"with a batch of liars who had in part made their living for decades off swiping Black styles to which the bulk of the American public was denied access.\" This is strange, given that Marsh also tells us that the New Deal gave even rural whites access to black sounds.\n\nMarsh names gentle old Arthur Schwartz as a \"lead fabricator\" and, we presume, racist liar. If there's any \"swiping\" of styles in Schwartz tunes like \"I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan\" and \"Dancing In The Dark,\" they're Viennese. It is musically illiterate and historically ignorant to suggest that the 32-bar standard was created by \"swiping Black styles.\" Its incorporation of the blues is not structural: It was a telling adornment, like Dave Marsh's dunce's hat.\n\nKick Out the Jams contains no serious consideration of Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Booker T & the MGs, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, The Meters, Curtis Mayfield, Parliament-Funkadelic, Lee Perry, the Michael Jackson industrial complex, or Prince. There is hardly anything here about reggae, jazz, Latin music of any kind, or African music, or indeed the rap about which Marsh professed to be confidential. There are, however, strained reflections on the political folk music of Ani Difranco and the second-tier underachiever Phil Ochs, as well as lots of irrelevant political ranting, which is the fool's gold of music writing.\n\nDave Marsh is a Sounds man with NME principles in a Melody Maker world. He was a professional witness to the technological and musical changes which, among other things, wiped out the old music business, and the English music papers too. But his songs remain the same and he cannot find the words to describe the changes. His editors call him \"a writer wrestling with the American empire,\" so I suppose he has his hands full already. But if a rock writer doesn't get a grip on trivia like musical technicalities and historical details, all that remains is an enthusiasm that seems arbitrary because it cannot explain itself and a resentment that seems childish because its self-explanations are trapped in the aspic of teenage onanism.\n\nThis kind of nonsense does not pass for criticism when it comes to any other kind of music. Perhaps this shows rock music's essential inconsequentiality. For only by fantasy and exclusion can rock music stand alone and supreme. The strange thing is, Dave Marsh's obsession with third-rate white acts, and his inability to understand the nature of musical fusion, replicates the color bar he decries.\n\n\"I'm beginning to believe it's impossible to be a competent music critic,\" Marsh wrote in 1994. By then, it was too late for both critic and music.\n\nKick Out the Jams: Jibes, Barbs, Tributes & Rallying Cries From 25 Years of Music Writing by Dave Marsh Simon & Schuster, 336 pp., $28.99\n\nDominic Green is a Wall Street Journal contributor and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society.\n\nPublished under: Book reviews , Music\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Democratic Operative: Rural White Voters Not 'Grateful Enough'\n\nDavid Atkins, a Californian regional director for the Democratic Party and a Bernie Sanders supporter, criticized rural white voters for lacking gratitude in a Twitter thread posted Thursday night.\n\nIn the thread , Atkins wrote that rural voters are \"heavily subsidized, drowning in federal largesse, blessed with political affirmative action & overrepresentation, have all their bills paid by cities and blue states,\" but still \"whine and yell constantly.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidOAtkins/status/1152049970570129409\n\nIn subsequent tweets, Atkins blasted Fox News watchers, claiming that \"The Fox News cult hates the values of the vast majority of Americans who aren't rural white evangelicals and want nothing to do with them.\"\n\nAtkins did temper his criticisms, expressing sympathy for rural whites. \"Don't get me wrong: I'm all about reaching out & showing rural white America that it's the plutocrats that are hurting them, not people of color. Rural white America really is hurting,\" he clarified.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidOAtkins/status/1152135560296747008\n\nRecent studies suggest that rural middle-class whites are facing a complex set of crises that may not abate for the foreseeable future. While mortality rates across the developed world have fallen steadily for decades, the rate for middle-aged, non-Hispanic whites has risen since the late 1990's.\n\nResearch suggested that one major factor in this trend is \"progressively worsening labor market opportunities.\" Labor struggles have been tied to opioid use and declining civil institutions.\n\nThe increase in the suicide rate also started among rural whites, along with Native Americans. However, this crisis has spread across age groups and geographic location.\n\nPublished under: California , Twitter\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
