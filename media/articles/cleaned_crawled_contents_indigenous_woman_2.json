      "text": "Preserving the Future: Indigenous Women in the U.S. and Canada are Taking on Big Oil  -  and Winning\n\nThe following article originally appeared in the Spring 2011 issue of Ms. Magazine .\n\n\"Most people don't know what a subsistence way of life is,\" says Faith Gemmill, an environmental activist from the Gwich'in territories in northern Alaska. \"In other places, if you need anything you just go to the grocery store. Here, it's not like that. We hunt for our food; we fish; we gather. It's the cost of survival for us.\"\n\nOn Alaska's North Slope, where below-zero temperatures and underlying permafrost preclude agricultural development, indigenous communities necessarily rely on caribou and fishing for sustenance. But this subsistence way of life, which for many also bears a deep historical and cultural significance, is daily threatened by encroaching industries bent on extracting the region's abundant fossil fuels-at any cost.\n\nAs a site of major oil exploration since the 1970s, Alaska now produces about 13 percent of the nation's domestically sourced oil, with production steadily expanding across the Arctic. The cumulative effects of this development have impacted local communities in myriad ways. While a 2002 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that industry development displaced subsistence animals, damaged the tundra and exacerbated climate-change effects,Gemmill argues that the long-term impacts on humans are even worse.\n\n\"One community that has been surrounded by oil and gas development reported higher rates of asthma, pneumonia and other upper respiratory illnesses,\" she explains, adding that potential risks are even greater. \"If there were ever an oil spill, there is no way they could clean it up. They admit they don't have the technology to clean up oil on ice.\"\n\nAs executive director of Resisting Environmental Destruction On Indigenous Lands (REDOIL), Gemmill is part of a growing network of indigenous women organizing against oil extraction on their lands, both in the U.S. and Canada. In recent years she has focused on halting Shell Oil's plans to develop offshore drilling in the Chukchi Sea, which borders Alaska's northwestern coast. Shell leased the area from the U.S. government in 2008 for $2.7 billion, but Gemmill has repeatedly frustrated their attempts to begin exploration. Last year, REDOIL won a lawsuit against Shell, effectively halting production until more studies are completed on the potential environmental impacts of offshore drilling.\n\nThe oil industry wields incredible power in communities where exploration is taking place, often dividing residents by offering them economic opportunities-thus complicating activism against the destructive side of the industry's activities.\n\n\"The industry comes into these communities when people are in high school and starts paying men huge amounts of money just to go to trainings-to get them hooked,\" says Kandi Mossett, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. \"It causes tension in the community, because while they're destroying our water supply, they're also providing jobs.\"\n\nWhile men have jobs in the industry, women have taken on the task of leading the activist fight. \"My guess is that 98 percent of the leadership in the activist communities we work with are women,\" Mossett says. \"It's not to say that men aren't worried, but typically they will be the ones working in the industry, on the oil rigs. ...I think women recognize that there is an inherent need to do something, because our children are sick and our future is in trouble.\"\n\nIn Canada, indigenous women leaders have been facing off with the oil industry in communities perhaps even more gravely threatened than Gemmill's.\n\nCanada is the single largest source of American oil consumption, with the lion's share of that oil procured from bituminous tar sands on or near indigenous territories-an effort widely considered to be the largest industrial project in the world. Yet the extraction of tar-sands oil is easily the most destructive of all oil production methods: Not only does it routinely involve clearing ancient boreal forests and strip-mining the soil, it also leaves behind enormous toxic lakes-visible from space-that have been linked to abnormally high rates of cancer among residents of nearby communities.\n\n\"The First Nations folks right downstream from the huge oil project in Alberta are definitely sick, and get more and more sick all the time,\" says Mossett, who has seen firsthand the public-health impacts of tar-sands oil production.\n\n\"There are pictures of all of these deformities in fish-cancers, pus,\" she explains. \"In the moose, they are finding so many cancers. In women, there are reproductive problems.\"\n\nThe human impacts of tar-sands oil production is terribly understudied, but a 2009 report by the Alberta Cancer Board confirmed that cancer rates in the Fort Chipewyan community, downstream from the Alberta mining project, were 30 percent higher than average. Another study, conducted in 2007, revealed dangerously high levels of arsenic, aluminum, mercury and other toxins in Fort Chipewyan's water, sediment and fish.\n\nThe pipeline that carries tar-sands oil into the U.S., moreover, crosses numerous indigenous territories, threatening those lands and water supplies with increasingly common oil spills. What's more, plans are underway to triple tar-sands oil refining and transportation by 2015.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the communities most endangered by oil production are indigenous, according to Caitlin Sislin, the North America director of Women's Earth Alliance.\n\n\"People of color and low-income communities are systematically targeted for fossil-fuel development and waste dumping,\" she explains. \"Federal laws often ease the way for mining and toxic dumping on tribal lands, resulting in widespread contamination and public-health impacts.\"\n\nA bulk of the battle, then, is building up the political power of indigenous communities, ensuring that they have the resources necessary to combat big business and bad public policy.\n\n\"We are trying to build the capacity of community leaders who are on the frontlines of these issues so that they can address these issues themselves,\" Gemmill says. Her organization trains community members who are confronted with massive industrial projects and provides them with legal assistance and political support. Women's Earth Alliance similarly links indigenous women leaders with legal and policy advocates who can, pro-bono, help them fight extractive industry, waste dumping and fossil-fuel production on sacred sites.\n\n\"We're not inventing or imposing any solutions,\" says Sislin. \"Instead, we are responding to the vision articulated by women leaders like Faith and do our best to bring advocacy resources to support the realization of those visions. Our work is about bridging that access gap.\"\n\nWhile these collaborative efforts have produced great victories-from the halting of Shell's offshore-drilling project to the recent delay of an expansive pipeline that would carry tar-sands oil across six states-there is much work left to be done. And the duty of indigenous women to undertake that work, says Gemmill, runs even deeper than simple community obligation.\n\n\"As a woman and a mother I have a sacred responsibility to uphold and nurture life,\" she says. \"And as an indigenous woman, I strongly object to the notion that our children's future can be compromised for short-term economic gain. ...I will do everything in my power to protect and preserve that future.\""

      "text": "Why the elites of Argentina are waging war against the life of Milagro Sala\n\nFar to Argentina's northwest, near the borders with Chile and Bolivia, sits the province of Jujuy. Here, until a few years ago, a major political force of the poor and indigenous had emerged. It is called the Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Association ( Organización Barrial Túpac Amaru ). The name-Tupac Amaru-itself sends shudders across the hemisphere. Both Tupac Amaru I (1545-1572) and Tupac Amaru II (1738-1781) fought off the Spanish, the first as the last king of the Incas and the second as a rebel against the colonial state. Tupac Amaru II was captured after a massive uprising, and then drawn and quartered in the bloodiest way. In the name Tupac Amaru, you have therefore both the rebellion and the hatred of the oligarchy against the poor and the indigenous. The Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Association, which edged closer and closer to power in Jujuy, had to be-therefore-broken into bits.\n\nThe leader of the Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Association is the charismatic Milagro Sala (age 55). She emerged into leadership through her work in trade unions, in the Peronist movement, and in the movement of the indigenous. Over the past 10 years, politicians of the Radical Civic Union-which governs Jujuy-have attempted to undermine and destroy the base created by Sala and the Tupac Amaru group. They have accused members of the group-and Sala specifically-of attempted assassinations and of corruption. When Gerardo Morales-of the Radical Civic Union-was elected governor in 2015, he alleged that the Association would conduct acts of violence in the province. When Sala denied this, and when the Association started a demonstration in Jujuy, Morales had Sala arrested. This was the start of her ordeal.\n\nDictatorship of White Men\n\nOn a sunny September day in Buenos Aires, I met Sala's lawyer Elizabeth Gómez Alcorta, who gave me her view of the case and its implications. The accusations by the State against Sala quickly escalated-from the protest to corruption to allegations that she had organized assassination attempts. The accusations are wild and maddening. In 2018, the criminal court in Jujuy threw out the accusation that Sala had ordered the failed assassination of Alberto Cardozo in 2007. When Sala heard the court's decision, she said that it is a \"small glimmer of hope.\" That Sala spoke of hope is key. In prison, she had attempted to kill herself a number of times. Now, thanks to the intercession of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and a United Nations expert commission on human rights, she is under house arrest. Other accusations remain alive and well. They pile up around her, suffocating her.\n\nElizabeth Gómez Alcorta is a sharp and feisty lawyer. She has no time for half measures. Argentina, she told me, is a \"dictatorship of white men.\" They have gone after this woman, this indigenous woman, with a keen sense of vengeance. The very harshness of the attack on Sala has stilled her organization. There have been no protests in Jujuy for the past three years, largely because of the repression. The arrest of Sala, Gómez Alcorta told me, sends a message across Argentina that the protests of the indigenous will not be tolerated.\n\nWe Are Hostages\n\nOver the past few years, protests by various indigenous communities across Argentina have increased. In Patagonia, for instance, militants from the Mapuche community have fought to defend and reclaim their land. During the presidency of Mauricio Macri, who will likely lose the election in October, promises have been made to agribusiness and mining firms for the exploitation of lands contested by the Mapuche. Macri's government has delivered harsh repression against the activists. The deaths of Santiago Maldonado and of Rafael Nahuel are seen as the deadliest illustrations of this crackdown. Both Maldonado and Nahuel died defending Mapuche lands, the former with the Pu Lofen Resistencia community against Luciano Benetton (of the Italian clothing company) and the latter with the Lafken Winkul Mapu community.\n\nMen like Macri (and his Minister of Security Patricia Bullrich) have no time for the Mapuche. They see them as terrorists. \"They are violent groups,\" Bullrich has said , \"who do not accept the constitution, the national symbols.\" The language of the Mapuche is derided, their culture discarded. Argentina, under men like Macri, has long had a genocidal attitude toward groups like the Mapuche. The Mapuche leader Lonko Juana Calfunao told Mat Youkee, \"we are hostages of states that don't recognize our Mapuche nationality.\"\n\nFor the ruling class in Argentina, \"Madrid is closer to Buenos Aires than La Paz,\" said Gómez Alcorta. As far as men like Macri are concerned, the Mapuche are, as Gómez Alcorta said to me, people \"who do not exist.\" The attack on the indigenous-whether the Mapuche in Patagonia or Sala in Jujuy-Gómez Alcorta said, is a \"war against those who do not exist.\"\n\nFree Milagro\n\nMilagro Sala has said that Gerardo Morales, the governor of Jujuy and her main adversary, is afraid to face her in an election. Sala is close to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the former president and now vice-presidential candidate. Morales, on the other hand, is close to Macri. The persecution of Milagro Sala is more a political matter than a legal one. The allegations and the arguments before courts will continue. But this is not merely a question of the courts. If Cristina-as she is called by all sectors in Argentina-wins the election, the question of Sala's future will be on the table.\n\nSala's lawyer Gómez Alcorta says that for four reasons Sala has not lost. First, she has been moved from pre-trial detention in the prison to her home. Second, she remains alive-not an inconsequential matter when you consider the assassinations of Maldonado and Nahuel. Third, the government went after the Tupac Amaru association and its members, destroying 8,000 houses, three schools, and a health center. This level of repression has not dented the feeling among the community in Jujuy that Sala is their leader. Fourth, the case has not disappeared. Posters and drawings of Sala can be seen across Argentina. Free Milagro ( Liberen a Milagro ) say the signs.\n\n\"The story of Milagro Sala is not finished,\" says Gómez Alcorta. When she is released, Milagro Sala will emerge once more as the leader of her region and now -because of the case-as a symbol of the fight against the old order. It would be a tremendous thing if Milagro Sala-an indigenous woman-could ascend from her prison to the heights of Argentina's political world.\n\nVijay Prashad is an Indian historian, editor and journalist.

      "text": "'Historic and hopeful moment': Senate confirms Haaland as interior secretary\n\nA diverse coalition of progressive and Indigenous figures and organizations on Monday celebrated the Senate's confirmation of Deb Haaland to head the Department of the Interior-making the New Mexico Democrat and Green New Deal supporter the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history.\n\nShe was confirmed by a 51-40 vote in which only a handful of Republicans joined with all members of the Democratic caucus who were present; nine lawmakers, including three Democrats, did not vote. \"I look forward to collaborating with all of you,\" Haaland said in a tweet directed at senators. \"I am ready to serve.\"\n\nWhile climate justice and Indigenous rights advocates have praised President Joe Biden's selection of the congresswoman to lead a department that oversees hundreds of million of as \"a perfect choice,\" both conservative Democrats and Republicans have raised concerns about her positions on fossil fuels.\n\n\"It's clear that Big Oil was afraid of her confirmation-and for good reason,\" said David Turnbull, strategic communications director at Oil Change International. \"The nine senators that voted against her confirmation on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have on average accepted nearly $900,000 from Big Oil, Coal, and Gas over the course of their careers.\"\n\n\"The confirmation of Deb Haaland as secretary of the interior is a tremendous win for Indigenous communities, the waters, parks, and lands across our country, and the climate,\" he added. \"Haaland is a proven climate champion, and will usher in a new era of climate leadership in the Department of the Interior, reversing the tide of the last four years of dirty energy policies enacted by the Trump administration.\"\n\nFood & Water Watch executive director Wenonah Hauter similarly welcomed Haaland's appointment as an opportunity to depart from the planet-wrecking agenda of former President Donald Trump-whose attacks on climate and environmental policies led some campaigners and experts to back Biden's presidential bid.\n\n\"Deb Haaland's historic, pathbreaking confirmation is a victory for Indigenous communities, for the climate movement, and for everyone who wants to undo the Trump-era assault on our air and water,\" said Hauter. \"The massive outpouring of public support for Haaland is a testament to her uncompromising record and her clear commitment to ending the exploitation of public lands by fossil fuel corporations.\"\n\n\"Biden's unambiguous call to end fracking on public lands must now become a priority for the White House,\" she said. \"There is no one better to lead on this issue than Deb Haaland, who understands that our transition away from fossil fuels is an environmental justice priority and a climate necessity.\"\n\n\"In Congress, Rep. Haaland has demonstrated a deep concern for environmental justice, conservation, and climate change,\" said Kathleen Rest, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"We look forward to working with the new secretary of the interior to protect our nation's ecosystems, cultural heritage, and the climate-for the benefit of communities across the country, including tribes.\"\n\nVarshini Prakash, executive director of the youth-led Sunrise Movement, lauded Biden for listening to \"the Indigenous movement groups and allies that pushed for her confirmation, despite the Senate Republicans' unfair, aggressive campaign against her.\"\n\n\"Haaland is not only one of the first co-sponsors of the Green New Deal,\" Prakash pointed out, \"but she believes that achieving Indigenous sovereignty over stolen land is instrumental to transforming our economy and stopping the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"Now, she must wield her power to crack down on fossil fuel corporations and evict companies that drill for oil on public lands and in public waters,\" the activist added. \"We are excited to see the progress she makes and will be standing with her as she pushes us closer to the vision of a Green New Deal.\"\n\nSarah McMillan, WildEarth Guardians' conservation director, and Adam Kolton, executive director of Alaska Wilderness League, highlighted the significance of not only Haaland's well established positions on dirty energy and land management, but also the perspective she brings as an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo.\n\n\"We congratulate Secretary Deb Haaland and celebrate this historic and momentous day when the Department of Interior, which manages more than 450 million acres and houses the Bureau of Indian Affairs, finally has an Indigenous woman to lead the way,\" said McMillan. \"As our country is finally awakening to the injustices that Indigenous people have endured, and in the throes of a climate and nature crisis, we must chart a new path after four years of out-of-control exploitation and devastation.\"\n\nAs Kolton put it: \"We cannot right the wrongs of colonization or undo the history of violence toward and the displacement of Indigenous peoples in our country. But the confirmation of the first Native American to lead any U.S. Cabinet agency, particularly one that is responsible for the stewardship of millions of acres of once stolen and now public land, is a historic and hopeful moment.\"\n\n\"Haaland brings to the job an understanding of the Native American experience and a deep personal connection and commitment to preserving the lands and waters that sustain people and communities across the country,\" he added. \"She was the first U.S. representative to champion the need to pursue an ambitious national goal of conserving 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, and as interior secretary she will play a critical role in implementing President Biden's ambitious conservation agenda, confronting the climate crisis, and advancing the cause of environmental justice.\"\n\nA host of conservation groups in the state she represented in Congress-including New Mexico Wildlife Federation, New Mexico Wild, and Conservation Voters New Mexico-also applauded Haaland's confirmation.\n\n\"The global climate crisis is attributed to settler colonialism and the exploitation of natural resources cultivated from stolen Indigenous landscapes and the mismanagement of those resources,\" said Pueblo Action Alliance director Julia Bernal. \"There needs to be a paradigm shift and having a Pueblo Indigenous feminist perspective in this Cabinet position could instill a lot of hope for meaningful tribal consultation and more importantly tribal consent.\"\n\nBernal explained that \"Haaland will bring that worldview into land and water management practices that will work towards a just transition to a cleaner energy economy and more equitable approaches to better frontline and Indigenous communities who have suffered from the presence of the oil and gas industry.\"\n\nNoting the department's widely criticized history on interacting with tribes, she added that \"places like Chaco Canyon and Bears Ears and the waterways that supply Indigenous people in the Southwest could have longer standing chances if they are managed through a Pueblo Indigenous feminist perspective that implement[s] core values like respect and reciprocity and give[s] personhood to our waterways.\""

      "text": "Canada is waging an all-front legal war against Indigenous people\n\n\"Their Majesties greet chieftains of the Stoney Indian Tribe, who have brought a photo of Queen Victoria.\" Calgary, Canada\n\nCanada is developing a new image: one of burning churches , toppling statues , and mass graves . There are thousands more unmarked graves, thousands more Indigenous children killed at residential schools, remaining to be unearthed. There can be no denying that this is Canada, and it has to change. But can Canada transform itself for the better? If the revelation of the mass killing of Indigenous children is to lead to any actual soul-searching and any meaningful change, the first order of business is for Canada to stop its all-front war against First Nations. Much of that war is taking place through the legal system.\n\nCanadian politicians have said as much, adopting a motion in June calling for the government to stop fighting residential school survivors in court. A long-standing demand , it has been repeated by Indigenous advocates who have expressed amazement in the face of these horrific revelations that the Canadian government would nonetheless continue to fight Indigenous survivors of systematic child abuse by the state.\n\nTo get a sense of the scope of Canada's legal war on First Nations, I looked at a Canadian legal database containing decisions (case law) pertaining to First Nations. I also looked at the hearing lists of the Federal Court of Canada for ongoing cases. My initial goal was to identify where Canada could easily settle or abandon cases, bringing about a harmonious solution to these conflicts. Two things surprised me.\n\nThe first was the volume and diversity of lawsuits Canada is fighting. Canada is fighting First Nations everywhere, on an astoundingly wide range of issues.\n\nThe second thing: Canada is losing.\n\nThe Attack on Indigenous Children and Women\n\nIn his 1984 essay \" 'Pioneering' in the Nuclear Age ,\" political theorist Eqbal Ahmad argued that the \"four fundamental elements... without which an indigenous community cannot survive\" were \"land, water, leaders and culture.\" Canada fights Indigenous people over land, water, fishing rights, mining projects, freedom of movement, and more. The assault on Indigenous nations is also a war against Indigenous children and women.\n\nIn the high-profile case of First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada , laid out in detail by Cindy Blackstock , \"the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations filed a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act alleging\" in 2007 \" that the Government of Canada had a longstanding pattern of providing less government funding for child welfare services to First Nations children on reserves than is provided to non-Aboriginal children .\" The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) found in favor of the First Nations complainants in 2016.\n\nNote that this isn't about the history of residential schools. It's about discrimination against Indigenous kids in the present day . \"In fact, the problem might be getting worse,\" writes Blackstock, compared to \" the height of residential school operations .\" As evidence, she refers to a 2005 study of three sample provinces showing a wide gap between the percent of First Nations children in child welfare care (10.23 percent) compared to a much lower rate for non-First Nations children (0.67 percent). In 2006, following the Canadian government's repeated failures to act on the inequity described in this report (which also included comprehensive suggested reforms that had both moral and economic appeal), Blackstock writes , \"the Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations agreed that legal action was required.\" The CHRT was very clear in its 2019 decision that the federal government should compensate each victim the maximum amount, which addressed the victims as follows:\n\nIn May 2021, Canada, which has spent millions of dollars fighting this case, tried to overturn the CHRT's ruling .\n\nCanada's war on Indigenous children is also a war on Indigenous women. The sterilization of Indigenous women, beginning with Canada's eugenics program around 1900, is another act of genocide , as scholar Karen Stote has argued. Indigenous women who had tubal ligation without their consent as part of this eugenics program have brought a class-action suit against the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, both of which had Sexual Sterilization Acts in their provincial laws from the 1920s in Alberta and 1930s in British Columbia until the early 1970s, and Saskatchewan, where sexual sterilization legislation was proposed but failed by one vote in 1930. A Senate committee found a case of forced sterilization of an Indigenous woman as recently as 2019 .\n\nThe Legal-Financial War on First Nations Organizations\n\nAs Bob Joseph outlines in his 2018 book 21 Things You May Not Know About the Indian Act , Canada first gave itself the right to decide Indian status in the Gradual Civilization Act of 1857, which created a process by which Indigenous people could give up their Indian status and so become \"enfranchised\"-which they would have to do if they wanted to attend higher education or become professionals. The apartheid system was updated through the Indian Act of 1876, from which sprang many evils including both the residential schools and the assertion of Canadian control over the way First Nations govern themselves. In 1927, when Indigenous veterans of World War I began to hold meetings with one another to discuss their situation, Canada passed laws forbidding Indigenous people from political organization and from raising funds to hire legal counsel (and from playing billiards, among other things). The Indian Act-which is still in effect today with amendments, despite multiple attempts to repeal it-outlawed traditional governance structures and gave Canada the power to intervene to remove and install Indigenous governance authorities at will-which Canada did continuously, from Six Nations in 1924 to Barriere Lake in 1995. As a result, at any given moment, many First Nations are still embroiled in lawsuits over control of their own governments.\n\nCanada controls the resources available to First Nations, including drinking water. In another national embarrassment , Canada has found itself able to provision drinking water to diamond mines but not First Nations . This battle too has entered the courts, with a class-action suit by Tataskweyak Cree Nation, Curve Lake First Nation, and Neskantaga First Nation demanding that Canada not only compensate their nations, but also work with them to build the necessary water systems .\n\nCanada dribbles out humiliating application processes by which Indigenous people can try to exercise their human right to housing . When combined with the housing crisis on reserves, these application processes have attracted swindlers like consultant Jerry Paulin, who sued Cat Lake First Nation for $1.2 million, claiming that his efforts were the reason the First Nation received federal funds for urgent housing repairs.\n\nCanada uses the threat of withdrawal of these funds to impose stringent financial \"transparency\" conditions on First Nations-the subject of legal struggle , in which Cold Lake First Nations has argued that the financial transparency provisions violate their rights. Canada has used financial transparency claims to put First Nations finances under third-party management, withholding and misusing the funds in a not-very-transparent way, as the Algonquins of Barriere Lake charged in another lawsuit . An insistence on transparency is astounding for a country that buried massive numbers of Indigenous children in unmarked graves.\n\nWin or lose, the lawsuits themselves impose high costs on First Nations whose finances are, for the most part, controlled by Canada. The result is situations like the one where the Beaver Lake Cree are suing Canada for costs because they ran out of money suing Canada for their land. When First Nations are winning in court, Canada tries to bankrupt them before they get there.\n\nLand and Resources Are the Core of the Struggle\n\nThe core issue between Canada and First Nations is land. Most battles are over the land on which the state of Canada sits, all of which was stolen and much of which was swindled through legal processes that couldn't hold up to scrutiny and are now unraveling. \"[I]n simple acreage,\" the late Indigenous leader Arthur Manuel wrote in the 2017 book The Reconciliation Manifesto , this was \"the biggest land theft in the history of mankind,\" reducing Indigenous people from holding 100 percent of the landmass to 0.2 percent . One of the most economically important pieces of land is the Haldimand tract in southern Ontario, which generates billions of dollars in revenue that belongs, by right, to the Six Nations, as Phil Monture has extensively documented . Six Nations submitted ever-more detailed land claims, until Canada simply stopped accepting them. But in July, their sustained resistance led to the cancellation of a planned suburban development (read: settlement) on Six Nations land.\n\nMany of the First Nations court battles are defensive. Namgis , Ahousaht , Dzawada'enuxw , and Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw First Nations have tried to defend their wild fisheries against encroachment and pollution by settler fish farms. West Moberly , Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Aroland, Ginoogaming, Squamish, Coldwater, Tsleil-Waututh, Aitchelitz, Skowkale, and Shxwha:y Village First Nations challenged dams and pipelines . Canada has a history of \" pouring big money \" into these court battles to the tune of tens of millions-small money compared to its tens of billions subsidizing and taking over financially unviable pipelines running through Indigenous lands-including that of the Wet'suwet'en , whose resistance sparked mass protests across Canada in 2020. The duty to consult First Nations on such projects is itself the outcome of a legal struggle, won in the 2004 decision in Haida Nation v. British Columbia .\n\nFirst Nations who were swindled or coerced out of their lands (or water, as with Iskatewizaagegan No. 39 Independent First Nation's case against Winnipeg and Ontario for illegally taking their water from Shoal Lake for use by the city of Winnipeg starting in 1913) fight for their land back, for compensation, or both. The Specific Claims Tribunal has 132 ongoing cases. In Saskatchewan in May, the tribunal awarded Mosquito Grizzly Bear's Head Lean Man First Nation $141 million and recognition that they never surrendered their land as Canada had claimed they had in 1905. In June , Heiltsuk First Nation won a part of their land back .\n\nFirst Nations also fight for their fishing rights in courts and out on the water, as settler fishers have physically attacked and tried to intimidate Mi'kmaw fishers on Canada's east coast. In June, on the west coast, after the British Columbia Court of Appeals found against Canada , the federal government announced it wouldn't appeal, dropping a 15-year litigation that restricted Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations fishing quotas.\n\nDecolonization Just Might Be Inevitable\n\nWhy does Canada keep fighting (and losing) even as its legitimacy as a state built on theft and genocide crumbles? It's not merely the habits of centuries. It's also the absence of any project besides the displacement of First Nations and the plunder of the land. Canada could take the first step to ending all this by declaring a unilateral ceasefire in the legal war. Too few Canadians understand that this would actually be a very good thing. First Nations lived sustainably for thousands of years in these extraordinary northern ecosystems. Then the European empires arrived, bringing smallpox and tuberculosis among other scourges. Local extinctions of beaver and buffalo quickly followed, as well as the total extinction of the passenger pigeon. Today's settler state has poisoned pristine lakes with mine tailings, denuded the country's spectacular forests, and gifted the atmosphere some of the world's highest per capita carbon emissions ( seventh in the world in 2018 -more than Saudi Arabia, which was 10th, and the U.S., which was 11th). Indigenous visionaries have better ideas, such as those presented by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson and Arthur Manuel , or for that matter the Red Deal and the People's Agreement of Cochabamba .\n\nUnder Indigenous sovereignty, Canadians could truly be guests of the First Nations, capable of fulfilling their obligations to their hosts and their hosts' lands, rather than the pawns of the settler state's war against those from whom the land was stolen.\n\nThis article was produced by Globetrotter .

      "text": "What the Rise of Democratic Movements in Latin America Means for the Rest of the World\n\nAs the people of Latin America build democracies from the bottom up, the symbols of power are changing. What used to be emblems of poverty and oppression -- indigenous clothing and speech, the labels \"campesino\" and \"landless worker\" -- are increasingly the symbols of new power. As people-powered movements drive the region toward social justice and equality, these symbols speak, not of elite authority limited to a few, but of power broadly shared. The symbolism was especially rich last year in Cochabamba, Bolivia, when the new minister of justice made her entrance at an international activists' summit. Casimira RodrÃƒÂ­guez, a former domestic worker, wore the thick, black braids and pollera, a long, multilayered skirt, of an Aymara indigenous woman. As she made her way through the throng, RodrÃƒÂ­guez further distinguished herself from a typical law-enforcement chief by passing out handfuls of coca leaves. Throughout the region, marginalized people are rising up, challenging the system that has kept them poor, and pursuing a new course. In country after country, people are selecting leaders who strongly reject the Washington-led \"neoliberal\" policies of restricted government spending on social programs, privatization of public services such as education and water, and opening up borders to foreign corporations. Of course, there are exceptions, most notably Mexico, where conservative Felipe CalderÃƒÂ3n claimed power after a bruising battle over disputed election results. But the growing backlash has driven old-guard presidents out of power in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Bolivia. And, while there are sharp differences among the new leaders, there is no question that what put all of them in power was a growing outcry against economic injustice. Over 40 percent of the region still lives in poverty, and the gap between rich and poor is the widest in the world. No longer willing to accept perpetual poverty, Latin America's poor are redefining their societies and, in the process, redefining democracy. They are organizing large segments of society into strong, dynamic social movements with enough power to drive national politics. The challenge, of course, is to hold their new leaders accountable, to maintain the strength of the grassroots democratic power, and to go beyond symbolism to make real change. Bolivia's Indigenous President In Bolivia, where indigenous people are the majority, there are already some concrete signs of progress. Evo Morales, the country's first indigenous president, took office in 2006 with the strongest mandate of any Bolivian leader. Catapulted onto the national political stage by his struggles as a union leader defending the rights of coca growers, Morales came to power on the heels of massive popular uprisings that ousted three presidents in as many years. Despite sitting on the region's second largest natural gas reserves, Bolivia is South America's poorest country. In tandem with a wave of privatizations that swept Latin America in the 1990s, the oil and gas industry in Bolivia was opened for business to foreign oil companies, which garnered 82 percent of the profits, while leaving a scant 18 percent for Bolivia's coffers. Shortly after taking office, the Morales government set out to rewrite contracts with private companies. Negotiators increased the country's share of the profits to 50-80 percent by renegotiating contracts with 10 different companies, which will yield billions in additional revenue for the government to sustain its new social agenda. Spurred by his experience as a coca grower, Morales has introduced new policies that challenge the U.S. approach to the \"drug war.\" Coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has special ancestral significance for Bolivia's indigenous people and in its raw form is widely used to treat maladies such as stomach upset, altitude sickness, and stress, in addition to being a part of many Bolivians' daily routine. Under pressure from the U.S. government, previous Bolivian administrations tried coca eradication. Kathryn Ledebur of the Andean Information Network in Bolivia, says that \"local farmers who planted coca as a means of subsistence would often face violent confrontations with the military and security forces who were mandated to destroy their crops, which in essence devastated their only means of livelihood.\" The Morales government has developed a farmer-friendly program that allows small farmers to grow small amounts of coca for domestic consumption, while also implementing a zero-cocaine policy that includes interdiction and anti-money laundering efforts to prevent drug trafficking. In Brazil, a Metalworker is President The political shift in Brazil is also steeped in powerful symbolism. When Luiz InÃƒÂ¡cio \"Lula\" da Silva, a metalworker with an elementary education, rode a wave of popular support to the presidency in 2002, it inspired working-class people around the world. He was re-elected with a comfortable 60 percent of the vote in October 2006. Although his first term was tainted by corruption scandals and accusations from many on Brazil's left that he acquiesced too much to the demands by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for strict fiscal policies, he fulfilled some of his campaign pledges to the poor who form his political base. According to the Center for Economic Policy Research, some 11 million families have benefited from the \"bolsa famÃƒÂ­lia\" -- a monthly cash payment made to poor families in exchange for ensuring that their children stay in school. Signaling more pro-poor policies to come, one of the first acts of Lula's second term was announcing an 8.6 percent rise in the minimum wage. Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution President Hugo ChÃƒÂ¡vez is best known in the United States for his overblown rhetoric against President Bush. But in Latin America, the Venezuelan president is fond of conjuring up the symbolism of SimÃƒÂ3n BolÃƒÂ­var, the \"liberator\" of South America from Spanish rule, who dreamed of uniting the region in a strong bloc. And while it has garnered little attention here, ChÃƒÂ¡vez has used oil windfalls to advance BolÃƒÂ­var's dream. Venezuela has purchased big chunks of Argentina and Ecuador's debts to the IMF, for example, and sold discounted oil to several of its neighbors and even to poor communities in the United States. And Venezuela has signed trade pacts with several countries that include novel bartering arrangements, such as agricultural products in exchange for doctors and other technical personnel. ChÃƒÂ¡vez has devised a regional trade plan to counter the Bush-favored Free Trade Area of the Americas. The Bolivarian Alternative for Latin America (ALBA, for its Spanish acronym) aims to benefit the poor and the environment, and to advance trade among countries within the region. In January, Venezuela and Argentina took another step towards breaking the region's dependence on such neoliberal institutions as the World Bank, IMF, and Inter-American Development Bank, which have conditioned lending on \"free market\" policy reforms and harsh austerity measures. They pledged more than $1 billion to jump-start a new \"Bank of the South.\" Bolivia and Ecuador have since signed on. Within Venezuela, ChÃƒÂ¡vez has made impressive progress in boosting literacy levels and providing health and other services to the poor. He has teamed up with Cuba in cosponsoring a program called Operation Miracle to provide free eye surgery to poor residents from Venezuela, Panama, Jamaica, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and a growing list of other countries. The Venezuelan government is also investing heavily in creating a model of local economic development through cooperatives. On the other hand, ChÃƒÂ¡vez's fossil-fuel-based development plans -- including a proposed gas pipeline from Venezuela to Argentina -- are hardly visionary. As currently planned, the 5,000-mile pipeline will traverse areas of extreme ecological and cultural sensitivity. Several possible routes are being evaluated, but all run through the Amazon. Environmental and indigenous rights groups throughout Latin America have voiced opposition to the behemoth project, and have asked the Venezuelan government to halt all plans until they can be publicly debated. Social Movements Redefine Democracy Some of the most hopeful democratic advances in Latin America are not the result of official policies, but of social movements harnessing their own power. The thousands of poor peasants who make up the Landless Workers Movement (MST) in Brazil have claimed the right to settle on and farm close to 7 million hectares, or 43,000 square miles, of unused land -- a territory a little larger than the state of Ohio. For millions of people who are largely outside of the mainstream economic system, access to land is of paramount importance, as they depend on it for subsistence. Miguel Carter, of the Oxford-based Centre for Brazilian Studies, explains that groups like the MST contribute to the democratic process in important ways. \"By improving the material conditions and cultural resources of its members\" he says, \"the landless movement has fortified the social foundations for democracy in Brazil.\" Indigenous movements, too, have gained ground. In the Amazonian region of Ecuador, after witnessing multinational oil companies for decades cut through the jungles of their ancestral lands in search of petroleum, indigenous women put their bodies on the line against the armed soldiers sent to escort oil workers. Known for fierce resistance to oil exploitation on their lands, the remote community of Sarayacu has so far succeeded in keeping the oil companies out. Throughout Latin America, scores of indigenous peoples have demonstrated that marginalized populations can organize and mobilize effectively enough to topple governments -- as they have done in Ecuador and Bolivia -- despite their lack of material resources and political power. A new characteristic of Latin American politics is greater collaboration among countries with the goal of breaking dependence on the North. In the past, countries were largely in competition for U.S. markets and development aid. Now they increasingly focus on complementing the strengths and weaknesses of one another, and seeking common solutions to their shared problems. One example is the newly formed South American Community of Nations (CSN, in Spanish), an attempt by the 12 countries of South America to create an \"area that is integrated politically, socially, economically, environmentally, and in infrastructure.\" Because the initiative is new, it is unclear whether it will simply become a trading bloc that improves the region's competitive position in international markets, as is the case with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur). Alternatively, it could establish minimum social and environmental standards and the infrastructure not only to link to international markets but also to trade within Latin America. Similarly, in a radical departure from a traditional market-based approach, the Morales government has developed a \"People's Trade Agreement,\" an innovative economic alternative based on principles of fair trade, labor, and environmental protections, and active state intervention in the economy to promote development. Although still in an embryonic stage, \"it is unique,\" says Jason Tockman of the Bolivia Solidarity Network. \"It has both a strong resonance with the alternative visions for social, economic and political integration proposed by the region's social movements, and the weight of state authority.\" The response to President Bush's visit to five Latin American countries in March is yet another sign that Latin Americans are choosing their own path, independent of the United States and its political and economic interests. Along Bush's route, thousands of people in the streets carrying colorful signs and \"Bush Out\" banners sent a clear message: people's movements are alive and well in Latin America, and they aren't falling for the White House's attempt to repackage the same unpopular U.S. policies under the guise of poverty alleviation. At the same time, ChÃƒÂ¡vez was able to gather and rouse into a fervor an estimated 40,000 people at an anti-Bush rally in Argentina, where he announced that Bush was a \"political cadaver\" -- alluding to the president's increased irrelevance in Latin America. After two centuries of the United States treating Latin America as if it were its backyard, organized popular movements across Latin America are changing the dynamics of the hemisphere. By electing more popular governments in eight countries and by organizing tens of millions of people, they have put up strong resistance to the U.S. agenda of corporate-led globalization, and they have created real alternatives on the ground. These efforts, combined with the Venezuela-led effort for alternative regional integration, not only provide the strongest counter-weight to the U.S. agenda anywhere in the world, but also offer multiple paths towards a better future for millions of people in the Americas."

      "text": "Two things you may have missed in Alfonso Cuarón's 'Roma'\n\nRecently, Alfonso Cuarón was awarded best foreign language film and best director at the Golden Globes for Roma . He is fittingly being praised for both technical features and the powerful stories Roma tells about daily life in Mexico in the 1970s.\n\nThe film, however, contains other subtle but important elements that have been largely ignored by critics so far.\n\nTwo of these elements are Mexico's political context in the early 1970s and the ongoing conditions that have characterized domestic workers' lives since. The main character of Roma is Cleo (played by Yalitza Aparicio), a domestic worker based on a woman named Liboria Rodríguez (known as Libo) who worked for Cuarón's family when he was a child.\n\nCuarón situates Roma's characters amid significant historical events: the fight of some Mexicans for social progress and their opposition to a political, authoritarian regime that worked to maintain its privileges through various means.\n\nOne of these means is exemplified in the film by the character Fermín - Cleo's boyfriend (played by Jorge Antonio Guerrero) who belongs to the paramilitary group Los Halcones (The Hawks).\n\nWe know now by various direct sources and United States government declassified documents that high-ranking Mexican government officials secretly organized , financed, trained and armed various groups, including Los Halcones , to help quash social movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nLos Halcones were composed of around 2,000 young men, aged 18 to 29, distributed in squads of 200 members each.\n\nThe squads' leaders were middle-class university students who, for their participation, received free education, weekly stipends and the promise of a bright future in the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI).\n\nThe assailants and hit-men were gang members and working class and unemployed young men. They were paid half of what the leaders received.\n\nLos Halcones were also trained by Mexican military and police personnel who, subsidized by USAID , had previously received training at the International Police Academy in Washington.\n\nA scene from the award-winning 'Roma.'\n\nOn June 10, 1971, around 10,000 demonstrators , mainly students , marched to demand improvements to Mexico's democratic, economic and social conditions.\n\nIn Roma , Cleo and others pass these demonstrators on their way to a furniture store. They also pass, in a depiction of real life, a long row of riot police trucks and idle police officers, while Halcones patiently wait at the corner.\n\nArmed with canes and M1 and M2 rifles, Halcones attacked demonstrators , producing the second bloodiest event in modern Mexican history ( El Halconazo ), only after the Tlatelolco massacre of October 1968 .\n\nIt is estimated that around 120 people were killed and hundreds more injured, including children, women and seniors . Although the military and uniformed police knew beforehand about the attack , they stood by and did nothing .\n\nFermín belongs to the second-tier group of Los Halcones . In the hotel, he confesses to Cleo: \"I owe my life to martial arts [to Halcones ]. I grew up with nothing, you know?\"\n\nPortraying the real Halcones youth, Fermín's participation offered him certain social mobility but only in exchange for committing atrocities.\n\nSome young men's allegiance to Los Halcones and their corrupt decisions were thus mediated by class aspirations, ideology and violence.\n\nLos Halcones' violence also manifested in gender violence. This is depicted in Roma when Fermín dismisses his paternity and threatens to beat Cleo and their unborn daughter if she insists on looking for him.\n\nMoreover, despite his low-class background, Fermín ends the scene yelling \" gata \" at Cleo, an upper class-based insult aimed only at domestic servants,  reflecting the latter's low ascribed social status.\n\nA second element that has not been widely discussed, which Roma touches on, is the historical conditions of domestic workers.\n\nAs of June 2018, there were 2.2 million domestic workers in Mexico . Around 95 per cent are women, mostly young and middle-aged ( some are even children ).\n\nIn 2010, 58 per cent of Indigenous women in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area were domestic workers . Many  migrated from the countryside to the city. This means that, as Indigenous migration researcher Séverine Durin asserts , domestic work is strongly shaped by ethnicity.\n\nIt is not a coincidence then, that Cuarón's former nanny Libo or the characters Cleo and Adela in Roma are (young) Indigenous women.\n\nMexican laws do not offer domestic workers the same rights and benefits that other workers enjoy, such as paid sick days and holidays. They can also be dismissed without warning at any time.\n\nOnly as recently as December 2018, the Mexican Supreme Court determined that it is unconstitutional for employers to deny domestic workers access to social security, meaning mainly access to public health services.\n\nIt is commonplace for domestic workers to face low wages, long working hours and no holidays. Some also experience humiliation, mistreatment and discrimination for speaking their Indigenous language , wearing traditional clothes, practising cultural customs and for their physical traits.\n\nOthers experience forced confinement or sexual abuse by the men of the family or teenage sons. Yet, domestic workers are expected to thank their employers for the \"opportunity\" to have a job.\n\nOnly one in 10 women file a complaint when they encounter a problem with their employers.\n\nDomestic workers with children also need to make extraordinary arrangements for their own children to be taken care of, meaning prolonged separation many times while they take care of other families' children. Their caring and affection not only become commodified, but also dislocated.\n\nSome employers consider domestic workers as \"part of the family.\" However, uneven power relations, class differentials, discrimination and racism make them not really part of the family.\n\nCuarón mentioned that he was forced to recognize several decades later, and only after he started working on Roma , that Libo was, first, a woman, and second, an Indigenous woman. He then realized that Libo belongs to a \"world of affective needs, a world of sexual desires,\" and also to \"a more dispossessed group, a world of injustice.\"\n\nIn Roma , the family members are unaware of the domestic workers' social and personal lives.\n\nWhen Cleo is taken to the delivery room, the grandmother, Teresa, is asked by a nurse about Cleo's second last name, her date of birth and if she has insurance. But Teresa cannot answer those questions.\n\nCleo picks up after the family dog's, feeds the family, prepares the kids for school, puts them to bed, washes and irons the family's clothes and cleans the house. Still, the grandmother ignores everything about Cleo despite living in the \"same\" house (usually, domestic workers sleep and even eat apart from the family).\n\nCleo is \"part of the family\" but she is not really part of the family.\n\nOverall, Roma contains various stories that subtly unveil different forms of violence: poverty, social exclusion and gender-based violence promoted by sexist and misogynistic forms of masculinity.\n\nMoreover, domestic workers' quiet but endless work, which in Roma takes over half of the film, hinders uneven power relations mediated by class, gender, age, affection, ethnicity, race and the urban/rural divide.\n\nThese factors intersect to maintain domestic workers, mainly (Indigenous) women, in subordinate positions. They are conveniently imagined as \"part of the family,\" but they are never really part of the family, neither in Mexico, nor in Canada , nor anywhere else in the world.\n\nThis is a corrected version of a story originally published Jan. 8, 2019. The original story said: \"in 2010, 58 per cent of Indigenous women were domestic workers.\" It should have said: \"In 2010, 58 per cent of Indigenous women in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area were domestic workers.\"\n\nAlejandro Hernandez , Instructor and PhD candidate in Sociology and Political Economy, Carleton University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "The self-centered rich country response to pandemics and crises is wrecking poor countries\n\nMexico-I'm squatting on a round piece of concrete, and a 72-year-old man is sitting in the gutter, his walking stick beside him. He tells me that after being deported from the United States, he has been hiking the streets of Mexico City trying to find somewhere to stay. But all the refuges are closed due to the pandemic, including the one we're sitting outside of, where I volunteer. He has run out of insulin for his diabetes and says he can't walk anymore.\n\nI'm aware that he may not survive much longer. He's the fifth person that day that I have to turn away and I can't stand it.\n\nBack in the migrant refuge, we organize working groups and events to add structure to the empty days and try to prevent tension building up. It's bad enough that many of the refugees here have fled violence, only to wait months for their visas, to now be stuck inside because of the quarantine, unable to work, even informally.\n\nOver a period of less than two weeks, some 7,000 migrants have been deported from the US, with the virus as the excuse. And here too, Mexico is deporting refugees and migrants to the Guatemalan border, even though it is closed and there's no interstate transport operating there. Hondurans and others are stranded, with nowhere to stay and no way to return to their country. Many may be killed if they do return. So far, the contingency measures seem to be doing more harm than good.\n\nHere, we watch the videos of people cheering for health workers in London, and they are inspiring, but they don't really connect. We know our health system won't be able to handle much. We also know that with 65% of the workforce being informal and with no such thing as unemployment benefits, the economic impact of quarantining will be devastating to us. Already, in my city of Puebla, half the population has no access to water, or not enough. Soon, people will get kicked out of homes, and hunger - already on their minds - will likely become common.\n\nThe national government has declared that only essential shops and services can stay open. Those who can, are taking the quarantine seriously. But so many people aren't able to stay at home that it is a bit futile. The woman with the mole stall outside the Oxxo shop near my house is still serving food, the street stalls selling phone cases and gadgets on 8 th street are still there, the indigenous woman who sits on the ground selling beautiful Mexican \"rag\" dolls, is still there. I estimate that around 60% of shops and stalls are still going.\n\nIn Central America and Mexico, only 20% of old people have a pension. Many are still working, in close to slave-like conditions . And in South Africa, distancing is impossible when settlements can have just 380 toilets for 20,000 people. Risk, fear, and violence, are part of life for many in poor countries. Poverty is a never-ending war, and being defenseless and unsafe - health wise and economically, means life is up for grabs all the time. It's understandable then that people react with some self-preserving indifference to the quarantine. And that's why it isn't reasonable to take the Chinese and European models for responding to the pandemic and transplant them on to poorer countries.\n\nWhen I see tweets about \"these sad times\" I feel frustrated. Yes, these are tough times, but things have been horrific for a long time now for the majority of the world - for poorer people and for brown people. But the mainstream media, history books, and movies, teach us to see the world through the eyes of the white first world. That's where the heroes come from, where news matters.\n\nIt has never been considered urgent to update the world on the daily deaths from starvation ( 24,600 ) or on the numbers of people working in forced labor or marriage ( 40.3 million ). Awareness of the savage impact of the US's war on Afghanistan is low. In 2018, there were an estimated 228 million cases of malaria, globally, and 405,000 deaths from it - mostly children. But the people dying are the poorest of the poor, in African countries and in India. Malaria, starvation, exploitation, femicides, slum cities and more are crises that the world won't stop for.\n\nWhen I see tweets about \"these sad times\" I feel frustrated. Yes, these are tough times, but things have been horrific for a long time now for the majority of the world - for poorer people and for brown people.\n\nThe so-called \"third\" world is the dispensable world. The year 2008 was a \"financial crisis,\" but the ongoing global inequality that leaves over half the world living in undignified conditions is not a crisis, it is acceptable.\n\nMeanwhile, the economic and social consequences of the pandemic contingency measures will be much more severe in poorer countries and poorer communities. Already, some 2,500 people are murdered each month in Mexico, and violent crime is only likely to increase as more and more people lose their incomes. Sexual assault rates are also likely increasing .\n\nAdd to this the huge global resource inequality which means that most poorer countries can not respond to the virus in the same way as Europe and parts of Asia, even if they want to. The Central African Republic, for example, has just three ventilators for its population of 5 million people. While the US has around 160,000 ventilators - and that isn't enough, Mexico has just a few hundred .\n\nThe US and Europe are hogging access to medical equipment, masks, and testing materials. The New York Times reported that African and Latin American countries have been told by manufacturers that orders for testing kits won't be filled for months, because almost everything they produce is going to the US and Europe. Prices on these goods have also skyrocketed, making it harder for poorer regions to acquire them. So far, the numbers of confirmed cases in poorer countries are lower, but analysis of those numbers should bare in mind that such countries don't have access to the reagents used for testing and are stuck doing nothing, unable to test even health care workers.\n\nWhile the #StayAtHome movement is an incredible display of human solidarity and of our ability to actually work together for the common good, it also puts the onus of the solution to the pandemic on individual people. And indeed, we are part of the solution. But governments and corporations should be held accountable for the inequalities they have perpetuated and that are decisive in who lives or dies, and how many.\n\nIn this world, where suits and window dressings and hotel lobbies are designed with the utmost care, but health and poverty prevention plans are not, it is pointless to talk about beating this virus without addressing the context it is flourishing in. Along with measures like rent freezes and guaranteeing workers' rights, really addressing a global pandemic involves public health planning that cross borders and confronting global inequality and the climate crisis.\n\nTamara Pearson is a long time journalist based in Latin America, and author of The Butterfly Prison .

      "text": "Inside the Historic Genocide Trial of a Guatemalan Dictator\n\nOn May 10, 2013, history was made in Guatemala. For the first time ever, a former head of state was found guilty of genocide in a national court. And the prosecution of former de facto head of state JosÃ© EfraÃ­n RÃ­os Montt and his chief of intelligence JosÃ© Mauricio RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡nchez was itself an historic first.\n\nThe milestones achieved by the prosecution significantly elevated Guatemala and its system of justice in the eyes of the international human rights community. This trial did not come easily to the Guatemalan courts, and did not proceed smoothly once it got there. Nevertheless, the successful prosecution was hailed by international observers and human rights groups as a major victory for justice -- until the guilty verdict was overturned by the Constitutional Court in a 3-2 decision only 10 days after it was delivered.\n\nThe case against RÃ­os Montt began almost 15 years ago, when victims groups in Guatemala filed the first complaints in Guatemala alleging that RÃ­os Montt committed human rights abuses. Until the appointment of Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz, however, there was no political will in the country to prosecute high-level leaders for human rights abuses. It was in this context that in 1999, Rigoberta MenchÃo, a Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize laureate, initiated a human rights prosecution in Spain against the former general RÃ­os Montt - along with four other former generals - for torture, genocide and state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nRÃ­os Montt became de facto president in a military coup d'etat on March 23, 1982, and the genocide and war crimes for which he was convicted took place over the nearly 17 months he was in power. MenchÃo, a QuichÃ© indigenous woman, lost most of her family and community to the military's attacks on indigenous communities, and has long been an advocate for indigenous peoples' rights. From the beginning, the defendants maintained that the deaths of indigenous people occurred as a result of civil war and were a necessary consequence of the insurgents' guerilla tactics.\n\nThe Center for Justice & Accountability (CJA) joined the prosecution in Spain in 2006 as a popular prosecutor and coordinated an international legal team to work on the case. From 2008 through 2011 the CJA-led legal team brought more than 30 indigenous Guatemalans and a dozen expert witnesses to testify before the Spanish National Court and introduce evidence of genocide and other war crimes. Much of this testimony would later be introduced by the Guatemalan prosecution.\n\nBuilding in part on the evidence developed in the case in Spain, Guatemalan Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz issued an indictment for RÃ­os Montt and RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡nchez for genocide and crimes against humanity on Jan. 26, 2012. Two days later, Judge Miguel Angel GÃ¡lvez, magistrate of the High Risk Crimes Court, ordered Montt and SÃ¡nchez to stand trial on allegations that they ordered 15 massacres against Maya Ixil in three municipalities in the department of QuichÃ©, killing 1,771 people and displacing 29,000. Crimes against humanity is defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court as a number of specific acts including but not limited to murder, torture, extermination, rape, and enforced disappearance \"when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.\"\n\nJudge GÃ¡lvez established that there was legal justification for a trial. Galvez's reasoning was based on both domestic and international law and factual evidence that pointed to the military's identification of the whole Ixil population as subversive, as well as the military's systematic methods of attack on Ixil communities. Presentation of the evidence began on Jan. 31, 2013. Key pieces of evidence in the trial included one of documentary filmmaker Pamela Yates' outtakes, in which RÃ­os Montt states, \"If I can't control the army, what am I doing here?\" Other important evidence included witness testimony of systematic rapes and killings, as well as forensic anthropological evidence supporting their testimony.\n\nFrom the beginning, the defense attorneys lodged (and attempted to lodge) one amparo appeal after another and sought other means to delay the trial. (\"Amparo\" is roughly equivalent to a writ for constitutional protection of individual rights.) Since November 2011, the defense has lodged over 100 procedural challenges. The prosecution repeatedly accused the defense of making abusive use of these amparos and slowing the process of justice. The defense countered that the entire trial was unfair and that the context of civil war - which occurred from approximately 1960 to 1996 - in which the alleged genocide and crimes against humanity took place was sufficient justification for any killings that occurred. The few defense witnesses who testified during the trial attempted to shift blame from the military to the guerillas, asserting both that guerillas had killed the Ixil villagers and that Ixiles had been helping the guerillas and so put themselves in danger.\n\nPreliminary phases of the trial took place in the courts of first instance before Judge GÃ¡lvez and Judge Carol Patricia Flores. Initially, the case was assigned to Judge Flores, but the defense was granted an order for her recusal in November 2011 on grounds of partiality. Judge GÃ¡lvez took over from there, before the case moved on to the three-judge panel in the sentencing court. (In Guatemala, courts of first instance oversee preliminary hearings to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to move to trial. The sentencing courts oversee trials to determine ultimate culpability.) When the trial proceedings came to a standstill on April 18, 2013, it was because Judge Flores determined that her recusal was invalid, and that she should have been the one to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to move to trial.\n\nThe trial began on March 20, 2013, but RÃ­os Montt's two defense attorneys were missing. Another attorney stepped in to notify the panel of judges - chief judge Yassmin Barrios, judge Pablo Xitumul and judge Patricia Bustamante - that he had been called two hours earlier to participate in the trial and sought a five-day delay to prepare for the proceedings. In response to this and other procedural challenges brought by the defense, the panel of judges repeatedly stated that they would not tolerate delays to the judicial process.\n\nNotwithstanding the judges' persistence, after four weeks of trial and the presentation of the prosecution's entire case, the defense finally managed to thwart the judicial process sufficiently to halt the proceedings. The defense counsel declared that the trial was proceeding illegally. They then walked out of the courtroom. The crowd responded loudly, though it had been quiet and respectful in the preceding four weeks of trial and the testimony of over 100 witnesses. There was a great uproar of hissing, clapping and shouting. Red flowers were thrown at the defense attorneys as they left the courtroom. Chief Judge Barrios told security guards to return the attorneys to the courtroom, but the defendants continued to sit alone at their long wooden table until the judges ended the trial for the day. RÃ­os Montt sat calmly with his hands folded in front of him. RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡nchez, in his wheelchair, was similarly unwavering, even as photographers and videographers encircled them, shutters whirring, tapes spinning.\n\nIn line with the defense's declaration, Judge Flores of the court of first instance issued an order that annulled the oral phase of the trial, based on unresolved evidentiary issues. On the following day, the three-judge panel issued a statement that Judge Flores' order was illegal and would not be followed. The defense attorneys had not returned to the courtroom. Judge Barrios stated (based on a translation provided by the Open Justice Society), \"We will not permit the infringement of this tribunal's independence. We are not obliged to comply with an order that violates our jurisdiction. We obey the Constitution, and the Constitutional Court is the only instance that can decide to annul a trial. This is content of our resolution.\" Judge Flores' order provoked a similar response from the international community, and many ambassadors turned out for proceedings the following day to show their support for the trial's continuation.\n\nAnd continue it did. Chief Judge Barrios appointed two public defenders to take the place of RÃ­os Montt's and RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡nchez's attorneys, who had walked out of the courtroom on April 18 and failed to return. Montt rejected his new attorney and called another who had been formerly removed from the case but was later reinstated by the appeals court. The panel then recessed the proceedings until Friday, May 3, 2013, so that RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡nchez's new attorney could familiarize himself with the case. The resumption of the trial was considered a major success, particularly after what looked like a derailing of the process.\n\nIn the final weeks of this trial, the courtroom was packed with crowds anticipating closing arguments, and who feared that the trial would be annulled. The 86-year-old RÃ­os Montt and the wheelchair-bound RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡nchez appeared unruffled even when their attorneys left the courtroom in one of the many defense ploys to thwart the justice process.\n\nCameras were everywhere, with reporters lining the stairs and setting up tripods without regard for aisle space. Young men and women sporting the light blue vests of the United Nations watched attentively as the proceedings spun on below, \"Derechos Humanos\" emblazoned on their backs. Other international observers listened through earphones to translators, who lingered near the speakers to hear above the humming air conditioner.\n\nIndigenous women dressed in brightly colored huipiles and cortes turned out in great numbers for the trial, especially in its waning days, and some indigenous men, notable for their wide-brimmed hats, could be seen scattered throughout the tiered rows of seats. The Ixil Mayan women sat together, a cluster of red skirts and anxious faces - after all, this trial would determine the very specific issue of whether the accused were guilty of genocide of the Ixiles in northern QuichÃ©. The crowd seemed wary but excited, knowing they were seeing history in the making, believing that some form of justice would soon be had. Nothing like this had ever happened. Not in Guatemala. Not anywhere. No former head of state had ever been tried in domestic courts for genocide committed in the same state.\n\nFor another week, the conclusion of the trial remained uncertain.\n\nFinally, on May 10, 2013, the three-judge panel declared RÃ­os Montt guilty on all counts. His former chief of intelligence, RodrÃ­guez SÃ¡nchez, was found innocent. In his nearly hour-long post-conviction statement, Montt noted that the commanding officer in charge of the El QuichÃ© region should be held accountable for the Ixil Mayan deaths at issue in this trial. That officer is now president of Guatemala: Otto Perez Molina commanded troops in the Ixil town Nebaj during RÃ­os Montt's time as de facto president.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the international human rights community celebrated the success of the judicial process in Guatemala, though it remains unclear whether this case will serve as precedent for similar prosecutions, or if it will instead serve as the token conviction for years of human rights abuses orchestrated by many members - both past and present - of the government.\n\nFor now, the only thing that is certain is that the trial is not over. Only 10 days after the guilty verdict was delivered, it was overturned by the Constitutional Court, in a 3-2 ruling, kicking the trial back to where it was on April 19. In fits and starts, justice continues in Guatemala."

      "text": "Are we living through de-dollarization?\n\nDe-dollarization is apparently here , \"like it or not,\" as a May 2023 video by the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a peace-oriented think tank based in Washington, D.C., states. Quincy is not alone in discussing de-dollarization: political economists Radhika Desai and Michael Hudson outlined its mechanics across four shows between February and April 2023 in their fortnightly YouTube program, \" Geopolitical Economy Hour .\" Economist Richard Wolff provided a nine-minute explanation on this topic on the Democracy at Work channel. On the other side, media outlets like Business Insider have assured readers that dollar dominance isn't going anywhere . Journalist Ben Norton reported on a two-hour, bipartisan Congressional hearing that took place on June 7-\" Dollar Dominance: Preserving the U.S. Dollar's Status as the Global Reserve Currency \"-about defending the U.S. currency from de-dollarization. During the hearing, Congress members expressed both optimism and anxiety about the future of the dollar's supreme role. But what has prompted this debate?\n\nUntil recently, the global economy accepted the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and the currency of international transactions. The central banks of Europe and Asia had an insatiable appetite for dollar-denominated U.S. Treasury securities, which in turn bestowed on Washington the ability to spend money and finance its debt at will. Should any country step out of line politically or militarily, Washington could sanction it, excluding it from the rest of the world's dollar-denominated system of global trade.\n\nBut for how long? After a summit meeting in March between Russia's President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping, Putin stated , \"We are in favor of using the Chinese yuan for settlements between Russia and the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\" Putting that statement in perspective, CNN's Fareed Zakaria said , \"The world's second-largest economy and its largest energy exporter are together actively trying to dent the dollar's dominance as the anchor of the international financial system.\" Already, Zakaria noted, Russia and China are holding less of their central bank reserves in dollars and settling most of their trade in yuan, while other countries sanctioned by the United States are turning to \" barter trade \" to avoid dependence on the dollar.\n\nA new global monetary system, or at least one in which there is no near-universal reserve currency, would amount to a reshuffling of political, economic, and military power: a geopolitical reordering not seen since the end of the Cold War or even World War II. But as a look at its origins and evolution makes clear, the notion of a standard global system of exchange is relatively recent and no hard-and-fast rules dictate how one is to be organized. Let's take a brief tour through the tumultuous monetary history of global trade and then consider the factors that could trigger another stage in its evolution.\n\nImperial Commodity Money\n\nBefore the dollarization of the world economy took place, the international system had a gold standard anchored by the naval supremacy of the British Empire. But a currency system backed by gold, a mined commodity, had an inherent flaw: deflation. As long as metal mining could keep up with the pace of economic growth, the gold standard could work. But, as Karl Polanyi noted in his 1944 book, The Great Transformation , \"the amount of gold available may [only] be increased by a few percent over a year... not by as many dozen within a few weeks, as might be required to carry a sudden expansion of transactions. In the absence of token money, business would have to be either curtailed or carried on at very much lower prices, thus inducing a slump and creating unemployment.\"\n\nThis deflationary spiral, borne by everyone in the economy, was what former U.S. presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan described in his famous 1896 Democratic Party convention speech, in which he declared , \"You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\" For the truly wealthy, of course, the gold standard was a good thing, since it protected their assets from inflation.\n\nThe alternative to the \"cross of gold\" was for governments to ensure that sufficient currency circulated to keep business going. For this purpose, they could produce, instead of commodity money of gold or silver, token or \"fiat\" money: paper currency issued at will by the state treasury. The trouble with token money, however, was that it could not circulate on foreign soil. How, then, in a global economy, would it be possible to conduct foreign trade in commodity money and domestic business in token money?\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese empires had one solution to keep the flow of metals going: to commit genocide against the civilizations of the Americas, steal their gold and silver, and force the Indigenous peoples to work themselves to death in the mines. The Dutch and then British empires got their hands on the same gold using a number of mechanisms, including the monopolization of the slave trade through the Assiento of 1713 and the theft of Indigenous lands in the United States and Canada . Stolen silver was used to purchase valuable trade goods in China. Britain stole that silver back from China after the Opium Wars, which China had to pay immense indemnities (in silver) for losing.\n\nOnce established as the global imperial manager, the British Empire insisted on the gold standard while putting India on a silver standard. In his 2022 PhD thesis , political economist Jayanth Jose Tharappel called this scheme \"bimetallic apartheid\": Britain used the silver standard to acquire Indian commodities and the gold standard to trade with European countries. India was then used as a money pump for British control of the global economy, squeezed as needed: India ran a trade surplus with the rest of the world but was meanwhile in a trade deficit with Britain, which charged its colony \" Home Charges \" for the privilege of being looted. Britain also collected taxes and customs revenues in its colonies and semi-colonies, simply seizing commodity money and goods, which it resold at a profit, often to the point of famine and beyond-leading to tens of millions of deaths. The system of Council Bills was another clever scheme: paper money was sold by the British Crown to merchants for gold and silver. Those merchants used the Council Bills to purchase Indian goods for resale. The Indians who ended up with the Council Bills would cash them in and get rupees (their own tax revenues) back. The upshot of all this activity was that the Britain drained $45 trillion from India between 1765 and 1938, according to research by economist Utsa Patnaik.\n\nFrom Gold to Gold-Backed Currency to the Floating Dollar\n\nAs the 19th century wore on, an indirect result of Britain's highly profitable management of its colonies-and particularly its too-easy dumping of its exports into their markets-was that it fell behind in advanced manufacturing and technology to Germany and the United States: countries into which it had poured investment wealth drained from India and China. Germany's superior industrial prowess and Russia's departure from Britain's side after the Bolshevik Revolution left the British facing a possible loss to Germany in World War I, despite Britain drawing more than 1 million people from the Indian subcontinent to serve ( more than 2 million Indians would serve Britain in WWII) during the war. American financiers loaned Britain so much money that if it had lost WWI, U.S. banks would have realized an immense loss. When the war was over, to Britain's surprise, the United States insisted on being paid back. Britain squeezed Germany for reparations to repay the U.S. loans, and the world financial system broke down into \"competitive devaluations, tariff wars, and international autarchy,\" as Michael Hudson relates in his 1972 book, Super imperialism , setting the stage for World War II.\n\nAfter that war, Washington insisted on an end to the sterling zone; the United States would no longer allow Britain to use India as its own private money pump. But John Maynard Keynes, who had written Indian Currency and Finance (1913), The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919), and the General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), believed he had found a new and better way to supply the commodity money needed for foreign trade and the token money required for domestic business, without crucifying anyone on a cross of gold.\n\nAt the international economic conference in 1944 at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, Keynes proposed an international bank with a new reserve currency, the bancor, that would be used to settle trade imbalances between countries. If Mexico needed to sell oil and purchase automobiles from Germany, for instance, the two countries could carry out trade in bancors. If Mexico found itself owing more bancors than it held, or Germany had a growing surplus of them, an International Clearing Union would apply pressure to both sides: currency depreciation for debtors, but also currency appreciation and punitive interest payments for creditors. Meanwhile, the central banks of both debtor and creditor nations could follow Keynes's domestic advice and use their powers of money creation to stimulate the domestic economy as needed, within the limits of domestically available resources and labor power.\n\nKeynes made his proposal, but the United States had a different plan. Instead of the bancor, the dollar , backed by gold held at Fort Knox, would be the new reserve currency and the medium of world trade. Having emerged from the war with its economy intact and most of the world's gold, the United States led the Western war on communism in all its forms using weapons ranging from coups and assassinations to development aid and finance. On the economic side, U.S. tools included reconstruction lending to Europe, development loans to the Global South, and balance of payments loans to countries in trouble (the infamous International Monetary Fund (IMF) \"rescue packages\"). Unlike Keynes's proposed International Clearing Union, the IMF imposed all the penalties on the debtors and gave all the rewards to the creditors.\n\nThe dollar's unique position gave the United States what a French minister of finance called an \" exorbitant privilege .\" While every other country needed to export something to obtain dollars to purchase imports, the United States could simply issue currency and proceed to go shopping for the world's assets. Gold backing remained, but the cost of world domination became considerable even for Washington during the Vietnam War. Starting in 1965, France, followed by others, began to hold the United States at its word and exchanged U.S. dollars for U.S. gold, persisting until Washington canceled gold backing and the dollar began to float free in 1971.\n\nThe Floating Dollar and the Petrodollar\n\nThe cancellation of gold backing for the currency of international trade was possible because of the United States' exceptional position in the world as the supreme military power: it possessed full spectrum dominance and had hundreds of military bases everywhere in the world. The U.S. was also a magnet for the world's immigrants, a holder of the soft power of Hollywood and the American lifestyle, and the leader in technology, science, and manufacturing.\n\nThe dollar also had a more tangible backing, even after the gold tether was broken. The most important commodity on the planet was petroleum, and the United States controlled the spigot through its special relationship with the oil superpower, Saudi Arabia; a meeting in 1945 between King Abdulaziz Al Saud and then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on an American cruiser, the USS Quincy, on Great Bitter Lake in Egypt sealed the deal. When the oil-producing countries formed an effective cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and began raising the price of oil, the oil-deficient countries of the Global South suffered, while the oil exporters exchanged their resources for vast amounts of dollars (\" petrodollars \").\n\nThe United States forbade these dollar holders from acquiring strategic U.S. assets or industries but allowed them to plow their dollars back into the United States by purchasing U.S. weapons or U.S. Treasury securities: simply holding dollars in another form. Economists Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler called this the \" weapondollar-petrodollar \" nexus in their 2002 book, The Global Political Economy of Israel . As documented in Michael Hudson's 1977 book, Global Fracture (a sequel to Super Imperialism ), the OPEC countries hoped to use their dollars to industrialize and catch up with the West, but U.S. coups and counterrevolutions maintained the global fracture and pushed the global economy into the era of neoliberalism.\n\nThe Saudi-U.S. relationship was the key to containing OPEC's power as Saudi Arabia followed U.S. interests, increasing oil production at key moments to keep prices low. At least one author-James R. Norman, in his 2008 book, The Oil Card: Global Economic Warfare in the 21st Century -has argued that the relationship was key to other U.S. geopolitical priorities as well, including its effort to hasten the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. A 1983 U.S. Treasury study calculated that, since each $1 drop in the per barrel oil price would reduce Russia's hard currency revenues by up to $1 billion, a drop of $20 per barrel would put it in crisis, according to Peter Schweizer's book, Victory .\n\nIn 1985, Norman recounted in his book that Saudi Arabia \"[opened] the floodgates, [slashed] its pricing, and [pumped] more oil into the market.\" While other factors contributed to the collapse of the oil price as well, \"Russian academic Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister of Russia from 1991 to 1994 and a former minister of economy, has described [the drop in oil prices] as clearly the mortal blow that wrecked the teetering Soviet Union.\"\n\nFrom Petrodollar to De-Dollarization\n\nWhen the USSR collapsed, the United States declared a new world order and launched a series of new wars, including against Iraq. The currency of the new world order was the petrodollar-weapondollar. An initial bombing and partial occupation of Iraq in 1990 was followed by more than a decade of applying a sadistic economic weapon to a much more devastating effect than it ever had on the USSR (or other targets like Cuba): comprehensive sanctions. Forget price manipulations; Iraq was not allowed to sell its oil at all, nor to purchase needed medicines or technology. Hundreds of thousands of children died as a result. Several authors, including India's Research Unit for Political Economy in the 2003 book Behind the Invasion of Iraq and U.S. author William Clark in a 2005 book, Petrodollar Warfare , have argued that Saddam Hussein's final overthrow was triggered by a threat to begin trading oil in euros instead of dollars. Iraq has been under U.S. occupation since.\n\nIt seems, however, that the petro-weapondollar era is now coming to an end, and at a \" 'stunning' pace .\" After the Putin-Xi summit in March 2023, CNN's Fareed Zakaria worried publicly about the status of the dollar in the face of China's and Russia's efforts to de-dollarize. The dollar's problems have only grown since. All of the pillars upholding the petrodollar-weapondollar are unstable:\n\nBut what will replace the dollar?\n\n\"A globalized economy needs a single currency,\" Zakaria said on CNN after the Xi-Putin summit. \"The dollar is stable. You can buy and sell at any time and it's governed largely by the market and not the whims of a government. That's why China's efforts to expand the yuan's role internationally have not worked.\" But the governance of the U.S. dollar by the \"whims of a government\"-namely, the United States-is precisely why countries are looking for alternatives.\n\nZakaria took comfort in the fact that the dollar's replacement will not be the yuan. \"Ironically, if Xi Jinping wanted to cause the greatest pain to America, he would liberalize his financial sector and make the yuan a true competitor to the dollar. But that would take him in the direction of markets and openness that is the opposite of his current domestic goals.\" Zakaria is wrong. China need not liberalize to internationalize the yuan. When the dollar was supreme, the United States simply excluded foreign dollar-holders from purchasing U.S. companies or assets and restricted them to holding U.S. Treasury securities instead.\n\nBut as Chinese economist Yuanzheng Cao, former chief economist of the Bank of China, argued in his 2018 book, Strategies for Internationalizing the Renminbi (the official name of the currency whose unit is the yuan), Beijing can internationalize the yuan without attempting to replace the dollar and incurring the widespread resentment that would follow. It only needs to secure the yuan's use strategically as one of several currencies and in a wider variety of transactions, such as currency swaps.\n\nElsewhere, Keynes's postwar idea for a global reserve currency is being revived on a more limited basis. A regional version of the bancor, the sur, was proposed by Brazil's President Luis Inácio (\"Lula\") da Silva. Ecuadorian economist and former presidential candidate Andrés Arauz described the sur as follows in a February interview: \"The idea is not to replace each country's national, sovereign currency, but rather to have an additional currency, a complementary currency, a supranational currency for trade among countries in the region, starting with Brazil and Argentina, which are the sort of two powerhouses in the Southern Cone, and that could then amplify to the rest of the region.\" Lula followed up the sur idea with an idea of a BRICS currency ; Russian economist Sergey Glazyev proposes a kind of bancor backed by a basket of commodities .\n\nCurrency systems reflect power relations in the world: they don't change them. The Anglo gold standard and the American dollar standard reflected imperial monopoly power for centuries. In a multipolar world, however, we should expect more diverse arrangements.\n\nThis article was produced by Globetrotter . Justin Podur is a Toronto-based writer.

He teaches at York University in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change .\n\nA look at sub-imperialism and multipolarity in Brazil historically and into the future.\n\nGaleano Names the Problem\n\nIn the Open Veins of Latin America Eduardo Galeano described an 1870 genocidal war of regime change waged on Paraguay by a Triple Alliance of its neighbors, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, on behalf of British imperialism. The target, nationalist president Solano Lopez, died in battle. The country lost 56,000 square miles of territory. Paraguay's population was reduced by 83.3 percent. By the end, Galeano wrote: \"Brazil had performed the role the British had assigned it.\" Before the intervention, \"Paraguay had telegraphs, a railroad, and numerous factories manufacturing construction materials, textiles, linens, ponchos, paper and ink, crockery, and gunpowder... the Ibycui foundry made guns, mortars, and ammunition of all calibers... the steel industry... belonged to the state. The country had a merchant fleet... the state virtually monopolized foreign trade; it supplied yerba mate and tobacco to the southern part of the continent and exported valuable woods to Europe... With a strong and stable currency, Paraguay was wealthy enough to carry out great public works without recourse to foreign capital... Irrigation works, dams and canals, and new bridges and roads substantially helped to raise agricultural production. The native tradition of two crops a year, abandoned by the conquistadors, was revived.\" After the war: \"it was not only the population and great chunks of territory that disappeared, but customs tariffs, foundries, rivers closed to free trade, and economic independence... Everything was looted and everything was sold: lands and forests, mines, yerba mate farms, school buildings.\"\n\nThis article was produced by Globetrotter .\n\nSummarizing all this, Galeano wrote: \"Paraguay has the double burden of imperialism and subimperialism.\"\n\n\"Subimperialism,\" Galeano continued, \"has a thousand faces.\" Paraguayan soldiers joined an intervention against the Dominican Republic in 1965, under the command of a Brazilian general, Panasco Alvim. Paraguay \"gave Brazil an oil concession on its territory, but the fuel distribution and petrochemical business [was] in U.S. hands.\" The U.S. also controlled the university, the army, and the black market as well, of which Galeano wrote: \"Through open contraband channels, Brazilian industrial products invade the Paraguayan market, but the Sao Paulo factories that produce them have belonged to U.S. corporations since the denationalizing avalanche of recent years.\"\n\nElaborating on Brazil's sub-imperial function since 1964, Galeano wrote: \"A very influential military clique pictures the country as the great administrator of U.S. interests in the region, and calls on Brazil to become the same sort of boss over the south as the [U.S.] is over Brazil itself.\"\n\nRuy Mauro Marini Analyzes the Phenomenon\n\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that the leading scholarly authority on sub-imperialism is the Brazilian scholar Ruy Mauro Marini. Mauro's 1977 article was published shortly after Galeano's book. To understand \"global capitalist accumulation and subimperialism\" some background on the theory of imperialism set out by Lenin is in order, and more recent books like Zak Cope's The Wealth of Some Nations and Patnaik and Patnaik's A Theory of Imperialism teach the theory eloquently. The key concepts are unequal exchange and value transfer , magical processes through which the wealthy countries exchange smaller amounts of labor for larger amounts of labor from the poor countries. The mechanisms are many: patent regimes, Western corporate control of Global South resources, denomination of oil and other commodities in U.S. dollars, IMF and Western-bank loan terms and draconian rescue packages, Western arms sales and military training programs-all backed up by the threat of sanctions, coups, invasions, and \"color revolutions,\" which happen frequently enough to remind Global South governments to stay in line. In Imperialism , Lenin described the pressure on wealthy countries to \"go imperialist:\" winners in the Western domestic market invariably consolidate and tend towards monopoly; these winners are invariably coordinated increasingly through banks and financial interests; throwing new investments in to a mature market brings lower returns than they can get in newly opened ones, so the financiers seek colonies to get high returns on their growing piles of capital; the colonies also address their interests in labor and raw materials that are cheap (or ideally, free, through theft).\n\nMauro shows how this dynamic can lead to sub-imperialism if the context is right. Sub-imperialism, he writes, is \"the form assumed by the dependent economy when it reaches the stage of monopoly and finance capital,\" and it has two basic components.\n\nThe first is a \"relatively autonomous\" expansionist policy that functions under the overall umbrella of U.S. hegemony.\n\nThe second is what Mauro calls a \"medium\" organic composition of capital. To explain this concept an example comparison will suffice: an economy with a high organic composition of capital is one where workers use advanced, costly machinery that itself required a lot of labor to produce (the word \"composition\" refers to how much so-called \"dead labor\" went into the machines on which the \"living labor\" is now laboring). These are the workers in the vacuum labs making nanometre-precise computing chips. An economy with a low organic composition of capital is one where workers labor with their hands or simple tools, cutting sugar cane with machetes as day laborers. Their work is called \"unskilled\" and their wages are proportionately lower.\n\nIn 1977, Mauro argued that in Latin America, only Brazil had both the medium organic composition and the relatively autonomous expansionist policy. But what about today? And what about in other regions?\n\nGeneralizing the Concept\n\nAre there sub-imperialists in South Asia? Pakistan exercises its ambitions in Afghanistan under U.S. hegemony. Imran Khan was overthrown in a coup for withdrawing support for the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan; his successors have worked hard to prove their subordination to the hegemon. India meddles in the affairs of its small neighbors like Bhutan and does so under U.S. hegemony; Western corporations certainly have an immense footprint in both India and Pakistan.\n\nIn the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Turkey qualify as sub-imperialists though both showcase how each sub-imperialist is a special case. In Africa, South Africa has been analyzed as a sub-imperialist and tiny Rwanda could well qualify as a Central African version.\n\nWho doesn't fit? None of the U.S. Five Eyes partners (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, or UK) nor Japan, nor Israel, since all are high-income countries with higher than \"medium\" organic composition of capital.\n\nNor do China, Russia, or Iran fit the sub-imperialist mold. They may exercise hegemony-or contest it-in their regions, but they do not do so under the umbrella of U.S. hegemony.\n\nThis brings us back to Brazil and to the changes in the world since the writings of Mauro and Galeano on sub-imperialism.\n\nSub-Imperialism and Multipolarity\n\nUntil very recently, unilateral U.S. hegemony was the basic fact of world affairs.\n\nNo one could contest the U.S. invasions of Grenada, Panama, Iraq, or Haiti or its destruction of Yugoslavia and Libya. But Russia and Iran did contest the U.S. plan to dismantle Syria in 2015.\n\nWhen Yemen voted against the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 1990, they were told that it was \"the most expensive vote they ever cast\" and punished economically. But by 2022 many countries remained neutral in the Russia-Ukraine War despite Western demands that they support Ukraine. India and China ignored Western demands that they refuse to buy Russian energy, expanding a series of options for trading commodities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. African countries need not beg Western commercial banks for development finance: they can examine Western offers side-by-side with the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. In 2023, China brokered a peace deal that restored relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nThese developments reveal a historical change from a unipolar to a multipolar world order. The world has been under unipolar Anglo-American hegemony since the 1750s. There were world empires prior to that (notably the Spanish and Portuguese) but China and India each had around 25 percent of the world economy even at that time; a few centuries earlier, before the devastation of the Americas, the world was even more multipolar, if much less globalized.\n\nIf we are indeed moving away from the unipolar historical pattern, current sub-imperialists have some re-thinking to do: the U.S. umbrella is not what it once was.\n\nSub-Imperialism or Multipolarity? Which Way for Brazil?\n\nWith Lula (Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva) back in the president's office in Brazil as of 2023, the country faced this precise dilemma. In his previous tenure, Lula acted as both a multipolarist and a sub-imperialist. An early proponent of multipolarity (before the moment had even arrived) through his advocacy of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and of Latin American integration, Lula's Brazil played the sub-imperial role as well, leading the morally compromised and disastrous UN mission to take over the U.S. occupation of Haiti. Some of the military officers who led the Haiti occupation helped overthrow Lula's party in the coup that led to his jailing and eventually to Bolsonaro's destructive presidency.\n\nBolsonaro was certainly, symbolically sub-imperialist: he saluted the U.S. flag and marched under the Israeli one. But most of his time in office was characterized by a disastrous COVID-19 response, genocidal policies against Indigenous peoples , and a general incoherence on foreign policy. Bolsonaro participated in a regime change stunt in Venezuela but tried to stay out of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nLula returned to office in a context of weaker domestic left-wing movements but a stronger multipolar context . Lula's Brazil voted with the West in the condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine but Brazil was told by Russian diplomats that Russia understood the vote.\n\nThere are economic considerations beyond the organic composition of capital that can drive Global South leaders back into the criminal arms of the U.S.-dependence on natural resource exports and foodgrain imports are tendencies that are difficult to reverse , especially in democracies like Brazil that are vulnerable to coups or regression when the right-wing returns to power.\n\nPerhaps Brazil will be the vanguard of multipolarity in the Americas, or the sub-imperialist agent undermining BRICS from the inside. The changing world includes possibilities never contemplated by Galeano, Mauro, or Lenin.\n\nAuthor Bio : Justin Podur is a Toronto-based writer and a writing fellow at Globetrotter.

He teaches at York University in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change .\n\nIn January 2023, after five police officers killed Tyre Nichols, President Joe Biden quickly issued a statement calling on protesters to stay nonviolent . \"As Americans grieve, the Department of Justice conducts its investigation, and state authorities continue their work, I join Tyre's family in calling for peaceful protest,\" said Biden. \"Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable. Violence is destructive and against the law. It has no place in peaceful protests seeking justice.\"\n\nThis article was produced by Globetrotter .\n\nIn June 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , Biden made the same call to protesters. \"I call on everyone, no matter how deeply they care about this decision, to keep all protests peaceful. Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful,\" Biden said . \"No intimidation. Violence is never acceptable. Threats and intimidation are not speech. We must stand against violence in any form, regardless of your rationale.\"\n\nIt is a curious spectacle to have the head of a state, with all the levers of power, not using that power to solve a problem, but instead offering advice to the powerless about how to protest against him and the broken government system. Biden, however, showed no such reluctance to use those levers of power against protesters. During the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, when Biden was a presidential candidate, he made clear what he wanted to happen to those who didn't heed the call to nonviolence: \"We should never let what's done in a march for equal rights overcome what the reason for the march is. And that's what these folks are doing. And they should be arrested-found, arrested, and tried.\"\n\nIn the face of murderous police action, Biden called on protesters to be \"peaceful, peaceful, peaceful.\" In the face of non-nonviolent protesters, Biden called on police to make sure the protesters were \"found, arrested, and tried.\"\n\nAre protesters in the United States (and perhaps other countries where U.S. protest culture is particularly strong, like Canada) being held to an impossible standard? In fact, other Western countries don't seem to make these demands of their protesters-consider Christophe Dettinger, the boxer who punched a group of armored, shielded, and helmeted French riot police until they backed off from beating other protesters during the yellow vest protests in 2019. Dettinger went to jail but became a national hero to some. What would his fate have been in the United States? Most likely, he would have been manhandled on the spot, as graphic footage of U.S. police behavior toward people much smaller and weaker than Dettinger during the 2020 protests would suggest. If he survived the encounter with U.S. police, Dettinger would have faced criticism from within the movement for not using peaceful methods.\n\nThere is a paradox here. The United States, the country with nearly 800 military bases across the world, the country that dropped the nuclear bomb on civilian cities, and the country that outspends all its military rivals combined, expects its citizens to adhere to more stringent standards during protests compared to any other country. Staughton and Alice Lynd in the second edition of their book Nonviolence in America , which was released in 1995, wrote that \"America has more often been the teacher than the student of the nonviolent ideal.\" The Lynds are quoted disapprovingly by anarchist writer Peter Gelderloos in his book How Nonviolence Protects the State , an appeal to nonviolent protesters in the early 2000s who found themselves on the streets with anarchists who didn't share their commitment to nonviolence. Gelderloos asked for solidarity from the nonviolent activists, begging them not to allow the state to divide the movement into \"good protesters\" and \"bad protesters.\" That so-called \"antiglobalization\" movement faded away in the face of the post-2001 war on terror, so the debate was never really resolved.\n\nFor the U.S., the UK, and many of their allies, the debate over political violence goes back perhaps as far as the white pacifists who assured their white brethren, terrified by the Haitian Revolution, which ended in 1804, that abolitionism did not mean encouraging enslaved people to rebel or fight back. While they dreamed of a future without slavery, 19th-century abolitionist pacifists understood , like their countrymen who were the enslavers, that the role of enslaved people was to suffer like good Christians and wait for God's deliverance rather than to rebel. Although he gradually changed his mind, 19th-century abolitionist and pacifist William Lloyd Garrison initially insisted on nonviolence toward enslavers. Here Garrison is quoted in the late Italian communist Domenico Losurdo's book Nonviolence: A History Beyond the Myth : \"Much as I detest the oppression exercised by the Southern slaveholder, he is a man, sacred before me. He is a man, not to be harmed by my hand nor with my consent.\" Besides, he added, \"I do not believe that the weapons of liberty ever have been, or ever can be, the weapons of despotism.\" As the crisis deepened with the Fugitive Slave Law, Losurdo argued, pacifists like Garrison found it increasingly difficult to call upon enslaved people to turn themselves back to their enslavers without resistance. By 1859, Garrison even found himself unable to condemn abolitionist John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.\n\nThe moral complexities involved in nonviolence in the antiwar movement were acknowledged by linguist, philosopher, and political activist Noam Chomsky in a 1967 debate with political philosopher Hannah Arendt and others. Chomsky, though an advocate for nonviolence himself in the debate, concluded that nonviolence was ultimately a matter of faith:\n\nThe easiest reaction is to say that all violence is abhorrent, that both sides are guilty, and to stand apart retaining one's moral purity and condemn them both. This is the easiest response and in this case I think it's also justified. But, for reasons that are pretty complex, there are real arguments also in favor of the Viet Cong terror, arguments that can't be lightly dismissed, although I don't think they're correct. One argument is that this selective terror-killing certain officials and frightening others-tended to save the population from a much more extreme government terror, the continuing terror that exists when a corrupt official can do things that are within his power in the province that he controls.\n\nThen there's also the second type of argument... which I think can't be abandoned very lightly. It's a factual question of whether such an act of violence frees the native from his inferiority complex and permits him to enter into political life. I myself would like to believe that it's not so. Or at the least, I'd like to believe that nonviolent reaction could achieve the same result. But it's not very easy to present evidence for this; one can only argue for accepting this view on grounds of faith.\n\nSeveral writings have sounded the warning that nonviolence doctrine has caused harm to the oppressed. These include Pacifism as Pathology by Ward Churchill, How Nonviolence Protects the State and The Failure of Nonviolence by Peter Gelderloos, Nonviolence: A History Beyond the Myth by Domenico Losurdo, and the two-part series \"Change Agent: Gene Sharp's Neoliberal Nonviolence\" by Marcie Smith.\n\nEven the historic victories of nonviolent struggles had a behind-the-scenes armed element. Recent scholarly work has revisited the history of nonviolence in the U.S. civil rights struggle. Key texts include Lance Hill's The Deacons for Defense , Akinyele Omowale Umoja's We Will Shoot Back , and Charles E. Cobb Jr.'s This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed . These histories reveal continuous resistance, including armed self-defense, by Black people in the United States.\n\nEven before these recent histories, we have Robert Williams's remarkable and brief autobiography written in exile, Negroes With Guns . Williams was expelled from the NAACP for saying in 1959: \"We must be willing to kill if necessary. We cannot take these people who do us injustice to the court. ... In the future we are going to have to try and convict these people on the spot.\" He bitterly noted that while \"Nonviolent workshops are springing up throughout Black communities [, n]ot a single one has been established in racist white communities to curb the violence of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\n\nAs they moved around the rural South for their desegregation campaigns, the nonviolent activists of the civil rights movement often found they had-without their asking-armed protection against overzealous police and racist vigilantes: grannies who sat watch on porches at night with rifles on their laps while the nonviolent activists slept; Deacons for Defense who threatened police with a gun battle if they dared turn water hoses on nonviolent students trying to desegregate a swimming pool. Meanwhile, legislative gains made by the nonviolent movement often included the threat or reality of violent riots. In May 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama, for example, after a nonviolent march was crushed , a riot of 3,000 people followed. Eventually a desegregation pact was won on May 10, 1963. One observer argued that \"every day of the riots was worth a year of civil rights demonstrations.\"\n\nAs Lance Hill argues in The Deacons for Defense :\n\nIn the end, segregation yielded to force as much as it did to moral suasion. Violence in the form of street riots and armed self-defense played a fundamental role in uprooting segregation and economic and political discrimination from 1963 to 1965. Only after the threat of black violence emerged did civil rights legislation move to the forefront of the national agenda.\n\nBiden's constant calls for nonviolence by protesters while condoning violence by police are asking for the impossible and the ahistorical. In the crucial moments of U.S. history, nonviolence has always yielded to violence.\n\nAuthor Bio : Justin Podur is a Toronto-based writer and a writing fellow at Globetrotter. You can find him on his website at podur.org and on Twitter @justinpodur . He teaches at York University in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change .\n\nCanada is developing a new image: one of burning churches , toppling statues , and mass graves . There are thousands more unmarked graves, thousands more Indigenous children killed at residential schools, remaining to be unearthed. There can be no denying that this is Canada, and it has to change. But can Canada transform itself for the better? If the revelation of the mass killing of Indigenous children is to lead to any actual soul-searching and any meaningful change, the first order of business is for Canada to stop its all-front war against First Nations. Much of that war is taking place through the legal system.\n\nCanadian politicians have said as much, adopting a motion in June calling for the government to stop fighting residential school survivors in court. A long-standing demand , it has been repeated by Indigenous advocates who have expressed amazement in the face of these horrific revelations that the Canadian government would nonetheless continue to fight Indigenous survivors of systematic child abuse by the state.\n\nTo get a sense of the scope of Canada's legal war on First Nations, I looked at a Canadian legal database containing decisions (case law) pertaining to First Nations. I also looked at the hearing lists of the Federal Court of Canada for ongoing cases. My initial goal was to identify where Canada could easily settle or abandon cases, bringing about a harmonious solution to these conflicts. Two things surprised me.\n\nThe first was the volume and diversity of lawsuits Canada is fighting. Canada is fighting First Nations everywhere, on an astoundingly wide range of issues.\n\nThe second thing: Canada is losing.\n\nThe Attack on Indigenous Children and Women\n\nIn his 1984 essay \" 'Pioneering' in the Nuclear Age ,\" political theorist Eqbal Ahmad argued that the \"four fundamental elements... without which an indigenous community cannot survive\" were \"land, water, leaders and culture.\" Canada fights Indigenous people over land, water, fishing rights, mining projects, freedom of movement, and more. The assault on Indigenous nations is also a war against Indigenous children and women.\n\nIn the high-profile case of First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada , laid out in detail by Cindy Blackstock , \"the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations filed a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act alleging\" in 2007 \" that the Government of Canada had a longstanding pattern of providing less government funding for child welfare services to First Nations children on reserves than is provided to non-Aboriginal children .\" The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) found in favor of the First Nations complainants in 2016.\n\nNote that this isn't about the history of residential schools. It's about discrimination against Indigenous kids in the present day . \"In fact, the problem might be getting worse,\" writes Blackstock, compared to \" the height of residential school operations .\" As evidence, she refers to a 2005 study of three sample provinces showing a wide gap between the percent of First Nations children in child welfare care (10.23 percent) compared to a much lower rate for non-First Nations children (0.67 percent). In 2006, following the Canadian government's repeated failures to act on the inequity described in this report (which also included comprehensive suggested reforms that had both moral and economic appeal), Blackstock writes , \"the Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations agreed that legal action was required.\" The CHRT was very clear in its 2019 decision that the federal government should compensate each victim the maximum amount, which addressed the victims as follows:\n\nIn May 2021, Canada, which has spent millions of dollars fighting this case, tried to overturn the CHRT's ruling .\n\nCanada's war on Indigenous children is also a war on Indigenous women. The sterilization of Indigenous women, beginning with Canada's eugenics program around 1900, is another act of genocide , as scholar Karen Stote has argued. Indigenous women who had tubal ligation without their consent as part of this eugenics program have brought a class-action suit against the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, both of which had Sexual Sterilization Acts in their provincial laws from the 1920s in Alberta and 1930s in British Columbia until the early 1970s, and Saskatchewan, where sexual sterilization legislation was proposed but failed by one vote in 1930. A Senate committee found a case of forced sterilization of an Indigenous woman as recently as 2019 .\n\nThe Legal-Financial War on First Nations Organizations\n\nAs Bob Joseph outlines in his 2018 book 21 Things You May Not Know About the Indian Act , Canada first gave itself the right to decide Indian status in the Gradual Civilization Act of 1857, which created a process by which Indigenous people could give up their Indian status and so become \"enfranchised\"-which they would have to do if they wanted to attend higher education or become professionals. The apartheid system was updated through the Indian Act of 1876, from which sprang many evils including both the residential schools and the assertion of Canadian control over the way First Nations govern themselves. In 1927, when Indigenous veterans of World War I began to hold meetings with one another to discuss their situation, Canada passed laws forbidding Indigenous people from political organization and from raising funds to hire legal counsel (and from playing billiards, among other things). The Indian Act-which is still in effect today with amendments, despite multiple attempts to repeal it-outlawed traditional governance structures and gave Canada the power to intervene to remove and install Indigenous governance authorities at will-which Canada did continuously, from Six Nations in 1924 to Barriere Lake in 1995. As a result, at any given moment, many First Nations are still embroiled in lawsuits over control of their own governments.\n\nCanada controls the resources available to First Nations, including drinking water. In another national embarrassment , Canada has found itself able to provision drinking water to diamond mines but not First Nations . This battle too has entered the courts, with a class-action suit by Tataskweyak Cree Nation, Curve Lake First Nation, and Neskantaga First Nation demanding that Canada not only compensate their nations, but also work with them to build the necessary water systems .\n\nCanada dribbles out humiliating application processes by which Indigenous people can try to exercise their human right to housing . When combined with the housing crisis on reserves, these application processes have attracted swindlers like consultant Jerry Paulin, who sued Cat Lake First Nation for $1.2 million, claiming that his efforts were the reason the First Nation received federal funds for urgent housing repairs.\n\nCanada uses the threat of withdrawal of these funds to impose stringent financial \"transparency\" conditions on First Nations-the subject of legal struggle , in which Cold Lake First Nations has argued that the financial transparency provisions violate their rights. Canada has used financial transparency claims to put First Nations finances under third-party management, withholding and misusing the funds in a not-very-transparent way, as the Algonquins of Barriere Lake charged in another lawsuit . An insistence on transparency is astounding for a country that buried massive numbers of Indigenous children in unmarked graves.\n\nWin or lose, the lawsuits themselves impose high costs on First Nations whose finances are, for the most part, controlled by Canada. The result is situations like the one where the Beaver Lake Cree are suing Canada for costs because they ran out of money suing Canada for their land. When First Nations are winning in court, Canada tries to bankrupt them before they get there.\n\nLand and Resources Are the Core of the Struggle\n\nThe core issue between Canada and First Nations is land. Most battles are over the land on which the state of Canada sits, all of which was stolen and much of which was swindled through legal processes that couldn't hold up to scrutiny and are now unraveling. \"[I]n simple acreage,\" the late Indigenous leader Arthur Manuel wrote in the 2017 book The Reconciliation Manifesto , this was \"the biggest land theft in the history of mankind,\" reducing Indigenous people from holding 100 percent of the landmass to 0.2 percent . One of the most economically important pieces of land is the Haldimand tract in southern Ontario, which generates billions of dollars in revenue that belongs, by right, to the Six Nations, as Phil Monture has extensively documented . Six Nations submitted ever-more detailed land claims, until Canada simply stopped accepting them. But in July, their sustained resistance led to the cancellation of a planned suburban development (read: settlement) on Six Nations land.\n\nMany of the First Nations court battles are defensive. Namgis , Ahousaht , Dzawada'enuxw , and Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw First Nations have tried to defend their wild fisheries against encroachment and pollution by settler fish farms. West Moberly , Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Aroland, Ginoogaming, Squamish, Coldwater, Tsleil-Waututh, Aitchelitz, Skowkale, and Shxwha:y Village First Nations challenged dams and pipelines . Canada has a history of \" pouring big money \" into these court battles to the tune of tens of millions-small money compared to its tens of billions subsidizing and taking over financially unviable pipelines running through Indigenous lands-including that of the Wet'suwet'en , whose resistance sparked mass protests across Canada in 2020. The duty to consult First Nations on such projects is itself the outcome of a legal struggle, won in the 2004 decision in Haida Nation v. British Columbia .\n\nFirst Nations who were swindled or coerced out of their lands (or water, as with Iskatewizaagegan No. 39 Independent First Nation's case against Winnipeg and Ontario for illegally taking their water from Shoal Lake for use by the city of Winnipeg starting in 1913) fight for their land back, for compensation, or both. The Specific Claims Tribunal has 132 ongoing cases. In Saskatchewan in May, the tribunal awarded Mosquito Grizzly Bear's Head Lean Man First Nation $141 million and recognition that they never surrendered their land as Canada had claimed they had in 1905. In June , Heiltsuk First Nation won a part of their land back .\n\nFirst Nations also fight for their fishing rights in courts and out on the water, as settler fishers have physically attacked and tried to intimidate Mi'kmaw fishers on Canada's east coast. In June, on the west coast, after the British Columbia Court of Appeals found against Canada , the federal government announced it wouldn't appeal, dropping a 15-year litigation that restricted Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations fishing quotas.\n\nDecolonization Just Might Be Inevitable\n\nWhy does Canada keep fighting (and losing) even as its legitimacy as a state built on theft and genocide crumbles? It's not merely the habits of centuries. It's also the absence of any project besides the displacement of First Nations and the plunder of the land. Canada could take the first step to ending all this by declaring a unilateral ceasefire in the legal war. Too few Canadians understand that this would actually be a very good thing. First Nations lived sustainably for thousands of years in these extraordinary northern ecosystems. Then the European empires arrived, bringing smallpox and tuberculosis among other scourges. Local extinctions of beaver and buffalo quickly followed, as well as the total extinction of the passenger pigeon. Today's settler state has poisoned pristine lakes with mine tailings, denuded the country's spectacular forests, and gifted the atmosphere some of the world's highest per capita carbon emissions ( seventh in the world in 2018 -more than Saudi Arabia, which was 10th, and the U.S., which was 11th). Indigenous visionaries have better ideas, such as those presented by Leanne Betasamosake Simpson and Arthur Manuel , or for that matter the Red Deal and the People's Agreement of Cochabamba .\n\nUnder Indigenous sovereignty, Canadians could truly be guests of the First Nations, capable of fulfilling their obligations to their hosts and their hosts' lands, rather than the pawns of the settler state's war against those from whom the land was stolen.\n\nThis article was produced by Globetrotter . Justin Podur is a Toronto-based writer and a writing fellow at Globetrotter. You can find him on his website at podur.org and on Twitter @justinpodur . He teaches at York University in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change .\n\nIndia's right-wing government has been deploying all the modern tools of repression against a historic farmers' protest . Much is at stake. For the people of India, their agricultural system is about to get far more precarious. For its farmers, ruin, and bankruptcy for millions, is all but guaranteed. For the government of Narendra Modi and his elite backers, it's a crossroads moment; they calculate that their political power is assured for decades if they can refashion the politics of rural India and force dependency upon the farmers.\n\nThe farmers are protesting because the three farm bills , which were passed by the central government in September 2020, will dismantle the state-run agricultural procurement system in Punjab and Haryana, the breadbasket states of India.\n\nIn its defense, the Modi government has simultaneously claimed that the bills will enable a great modernization and also that nothing will change; the billionaires who will benefit (Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries and Gautam Adani's Adani Group) have denied having any interest in entering the newly privatized business.\n\nThe billionaires have been set loose in the henhouse. As Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty from the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics reported , India's top 1 percent in today's \"Billionaire Raj\" have a similar share of the national income as the top 1 percent did under the British Raj.\n\nThe \"Billionaire Raj\" is preparing to turn India back from a country of hunger (on the 2020 Global Hunger Index , India is 94th out of 107 countries) to a country of famine.\n\nAgrarian Crisis Rooted in British Colonialism\n\nThe roots of India's agrarian crisis are far deeper than the three new laws. The seeds of the agrarian crisis were planted in the soil of British colonialism.\n\nPrecolonial India was characterized by historian H.H. Khondker in 1986 as a moral economy , a \"social arrangement which guarantees a minimum subsistence for all.\" In Mike Davis' book Late Victorian Holocausts: El Niño Famines and the Making of the Third World , he argued that \"Mogul India was generally free of famine until the 1770s. There is considerable evidence, moreover, that in pre-British India before the creation of a railroad-girded national market in grain, village-level food reserves were larger, patrimonial welfare more widespread, and grain prices in surplus areas better insulated against speculation.\" The Mogul state \"regarded the protection of the peasant as an essential obligation,\" relying on \"a quartet of fundamental policies-embargos on food exports, antispeculative price regulation, tax relief and distribution of free food without a forced-labor counterpart-that were an anathema to later British Utilitarians.\" The Marathas , another major pre-British power in India, forced local elites to feed the hungry during famines. The British were horrified, calling this the \"enforced charity of hundreds of rich men.\" The Sikh Empire ruled in Punjab, where many of the protesting farmers are from. Its rulers enacted land reforms even while fighting the Mughals and the British.\n\nThen the British East India Company took over the collection of revenues in Bengal, and the British Empire spread its tentacles across the subcontinent.\n\nHistorian Navyug Gill summarized the British system as follows in an article in Outlook Magazine: the British introduced \"caste-based private property, the tethering of revenue demands to cash payments, and embedding agriculture within global circuits of production and consumption... [A]ctual harvests no longer corresponded to taxation rates, and fluctuations in commodity prices meant drastic swings between modest prosperity and widespread impoverishment. A bumper crop could be rendered worthless by uncontrollable forces in far-off parts of the empire, and yet the revenue would still have to be paid. The bane of those who became peasants was being at the mercy of the state as much as the seasons.\"\n\nThe commodification of food followed-and so did famine.\n\nProviding insights about the extent of famines in India under the British rule, Davis' book highlights that \"[a]lthough the British insisted that they had rescued India from 'timeless hunger,' more than one [district] official was jolted when Indian nationalists quoted from an 1878 study published in the prestigious Journal of the Statistical Society that contrasted 31 serious famines in 120 years of British rule against only 17 recorded famines in the entire previous two millennia.\" The British imposed new humiliations: \"Requiring the poor to work for relief, a practice begun in 1866 in Bengal under the influence of the Victorian Poor Law, was in flat contradiction to the Bengali premise that food should be given ungrudgingly, as a father gives food to his children.\"\n\nAs H.H. Khondker noted , British writer W.H. Moreland in the 1923 book From Akbar to Aurangzeb \"made a distinction between\" \"work famines\" under British imperialism and precolonial \"food famines.\" During the pre-imperialism period, people starved because of actual food shortages. Under imperialism, people starved because they were poor, had no employment, and therefore couldn't be fed under a Victorian morality that said you couldn't get something for nothing.\n\nAn Economist article published in 1883, which was quoted in Dan Morgan's 1979 book Merchants of Grain: The Power and Profits of the Five Giant Companies at the Center of the World's Food Supply , stated , \"A good wheat harvest is still as much needed as ever to feed our closely packed [British] population. But it is the harvest already turning brown in the scorching sun of Canada and the Western States-the wheat already ripe in India and California, not the growth alone of the Eastern counties and of Lincolnshire, that will be summoned to feed the hungry mouth of London and Lancashire.\"\n\nMass death through starvation was the price of enabling the British Empire to build a truly global, militarized economy in grain, under which agriculture in all reaches of the globe could serve imperial designs and food itself could become a weapon. Food insecurity for the colonies purchased food security for the metropole.\n\nGerman poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht once wrote, \"Famines do not simply occur; they are organized by the grain trade.\"\n\nDevelopment experiences between India and China are often compared and can be useful here as well.\n\nPre-colonized China was even better organized than Mughal India. Before the 1839 Opium War , China under the Qing dynasty \"had both the technology and political will to shift grain massively between regions and, thus, relieve hunger on a larger scale than any previous polity in world history,\" as Davis explained in Late Victorian Holocausts .\n\nImperialism in China led to famine there too, the largest of which occurred in 1876. The multiple Opium Wars, which forced the Chinese government to pay massive reparations to its invaders and plunderers, shattered the old food security system. The state \"was reduced to desultory cash relief augmented by private donations and humiliating foreign charity,\" Davis wrote .\n\nIn both India and China, the years of imperialism-the commodification of grain-condemned tens of millions to death by starvation.\n\nFood Security in Independent India and China\n\nPost-Independence, newly sovereign India and China both attempted to get their countries back on the path of food security. Both efforts had initially disastrous results. China had a severe post-Independence famine from 1959 to 1961, worse even than the ones under imperialism. China corrected this trajectory and went on to eliminate hunger and, in 2018, to eradicate poverty as well, as reported at the time by Chinese writer Qin Ling and in Robert Lawrence Kuhn's documentary film \" Voices from the Frontline: China's War on Poverty ,\" which was initially aired on PBS before being pulled in May 2020.\n\nIn stark contrast with China, India did not have a famine since Independence, but has tolerated chronic hunger. In the most famous comparison of the two countries, economists Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen wrote in their 1991 book Hunger and Public Action that :\n\nIndia's National Family Health Survey for 2019-20 showed that in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, sometimes touted as an economic model , 39 percent of children under the age of five have had their growth stunted by malnutrition. The report is full of similar achievements, state-by-state, by the current Indian government. Approximately 25 percent of all hungry people live in India, where around 195 million people are undernourished. Thousands per day, perhaps a million per year, die of malnutrition in India, most of whom are children .\n\nA majority of the population lives in poverty.\n\nIndia's Flawed Agrarian System\n\nNavyug Gill outlined the limited nature of India's post-Independence agrarian system in his article about the roots of the farm bill demonstrations. \"[W]hat was put in place from the 1950s onwards was a system of rules, quotas and regulations meant only to minimize the worst of colonial depredations. The purpose was to mainly fulfil the growing needs of a famine-stricken country while bringing about a modicum of stability for landholders of varying sizes. In other words, the state modified and re-directed rather than transcended the tensions among national food supply, capitalist imperatives and rural wellbeing.\"\n\nLet's go into the details of these measures, using several interviews conducted in different media with agriculture researcher Devinder Sharma as our source material.\n\nFrom India's independence in 1947 until the mid-1960s, India was dependent on food aid from the United States' PL 480 program . The Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were established in the 1960s with the intention of getting India off of this dependence on U.S. food aid. The system was built in tandem with the U.S.-sponsored Green Revolution, which sought to use capital-intensive, high-tech, high-input techniques to increase yields. The danger was that in the absence of such a system, higher yields would lead directly to a crash in agricultural prices, the ruination of farmers, and a British Empire-style cycle of disaster.\n\nTwo pieces were put in place to protect against this. First, government-run markets, the so-called \" mandis ,\" were set up where the government would purchase the farmers' grain at a guaranteed price (which would later be called the \" minimum support price ,\" or MSP) if the private sector could not. Second, the government, through the Food Corporation of India (FCI), would \"mop up\" the surplus production in bumper crop years and move that grain to deficient areas through the public distribution system . The system worked: the Green Revolution yields did indeed materialize. The mandis raised enough in taxes to fund not only the market infrastructure but also a network of village roads and certain rural development funds. Dependence on PL 480 grain was broken. And there were no more famines.\n\nThere were, however, flaws with the system. First, as environmental activist Vandana Shiva documented , the environmental effects of the Green Revolution rendered it unsustainable in the long term. Second, environmental unsustainability was matched by financial instability; the imported American model of the Green Revolution was based on saddling farmers with impossible levels of debt.\n\nThere were also limitations, including a gap in procurement, as Sharma explains : despite the announcement of the MSP for 23 crops, only two (wheat and rice) are actually procured by the government-and without actual government procurement, the mere announcement of an MSP is meaningless. Infrastructural limitations also reduced the system's effectiveness, as Sharma goes on to say : the goal was for farmers to have access to a mandi within 5 kilometers, which would have meant setting up 42,000 mandis . But in more than 50 years, only 7,000 mandis have been established.\n\nThe result of these limitations is that only 6 percent of farmers access the minimum support price (MSP), while 94 percent are dependent on the market, explains Sharma during an interview with Newsworthy. The fact that so few farmers access the MSP is used by government proponents to argue that the farm bills are removing the last fetters on an efficient market. But, Sharma asks , while quoting figures from the National Crime Records Bureau, if the market system is so good for India's farmers, why have 364,000 of them committed suicide since 1995? Why do farmers want an assured-and higher-MSP? The analogy with the labor market is clear enough-if the labor market were as good as free-market proponents claim, why would there be a need for a minimum wage, much less unemployment insurance?\n\nThe private buyers who want to get into the government business have promised that farmers would get higher prices than the MSP from them. Devinder Sharma asked during his interview why they would have any objection at all to a minimum support price, if they planned to pay more. He points out that the state of Bihar, which did away with its APMC system in 2006, sees farmers trucking wheat and rice into Punjab and Haryana to sell at the (now threatened) minimum support price guaranteed in those states.\n\nThe APMCs are accused of being government middlemen, Sharma notes . But the biggest fortunes in the world are already being amassed by middlemen \"wearing a tie and a suit,\" from Walmart to Amazon, who want \"to replace the traditional middlemen\" the government has acted as. India's super-rich, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, are the picture of the American-style, well-connected, monopolist middleman. If the farm bills are not repealed, the new private grain trade will fall into their laps.\n\nYears ago, Canadian agricultural economist Ian McCreary did a study of the Indian food procurement system. In an interview on February 6, McCreary told me that after crunching three decades of numbers, he found the Indian system to be \"quite successful in its objectives\" of providing stable prices and food security. The government assumed the financial risks, of which there were several. On the one hand, low international prices combined with a bumper crop at home would see India trying to store grain (expensive in India) or export at a loss. On the other hand, importing in a year when prices were high could get extremely expensive. But neither of these problems could be solved by privatization, as McCreary explained: \"If the government wanted to contract out the storage, they could have done that within the structure of the current system.\" And even after privatization, if prices rose to the point where millions of people couldn't afford to purchase food, the government would still be responsible for feeding them.\n\nMcCreary had concluded that extending government procurement at the minimum support price to pulse crops from drier and less productive regions would benefit both farmers and those who received food through the public distribution system. While he shared concern for the farmers, McCreary was also very concerned about the food security implications of the new farm bills. \"Poor consumers are going to be very vulnerable in the event of international prices being driven up.\"\n\nThe government weighs these implications against opportunities for Reliance and Adani to make profits in a new market. McCreary further said, \"When you move from a situation where [the] market is controlled and prices operate within a defined range, to one where you're exposed to the market, the players that buy and sell grain to arbitrage have [the] potential to make quite a bit of money.\"\n\nPrivatization of Grain Procurement in Canada\n\nIndia's rulers look to the West for inspiration; but in fact, Western agriculture should be an inspiration to no one. The nightmarish consequences of privatized corporate agriculture are poorly understood by those who see only Western agriculture's productivity and not its real social and environmental costs.\n\nTake the example of Canada. The privatization of government grain procurement in India today under Narendra Modi is analogous to the privatization of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) in 2012 under Canada's right-wing former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Established in 1935, the CWB was a farmer-run, farmer-funded marketing agency that worked through a \"single desk\"-private buyers had to buy from the Wheat Board and could not negotiate prices directly with farmers. Farmers earned more. Former National Farmers Union (NFU) president Terry Boehm estimated before the privatization that \"Wheat Board marketing and single-desk selling bring hundreds of millions more dollars to farmers each year than they would receive in an open market.\" Like India's system, the CWB was privatized amid half-hearted murmurings about \"increased economic opportunities\" for farmers through a rapid and deceitful piece of legislation-in this case, called the Marketing Freedom for Grain Farmers Act. The elected board was dismissed , the assets turned over to their new owners, a joint venture called G3 Global Grain Group. Within two years of the privatization of the CWB, several of the grain companies increased their profits by billions.\n\nLike the APMC, the CWB wasn't perfect-some farmers no doubt had believed they would do better on their own, while others complained about a lack of transparency. These farmers, Boehm says , \"now labor under a system dominated by multinational grain companies that disclose almost nothing.\" Ed Sagan, another NFU member, did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and concluded that an average farmer has probably lost nearly half their income since the CWB was dismantled-a figure confirmed by multiple years of Statistics Canada reports. A chart produced by the union outlines many of the depressing new realities .\n\nMeanwhile, the United States , Canada , and the EU are demanding India produce less locally and provide a bigger market for highly subsidized grain sourced from the metropole. Economist Prabhat Patnaik has noted that \"diversification away from food grain production and importing food grains instead from imperialist countries has been a demand of the U.S. and EU for quite some time.\"\n\nLooking Beyond the West for Solutions\n\nNeither Canada nor the United States offers any kind of model for agriculture. In the United States, farm incomes are on a continuous decline, and rural suicides are on a continuous rise. Throughout Europe and North America, agriculture is heavily subsidized, with the average U.S. farm receiving subsidies of tens of thousands per year ($61,286 in support per farmer, compared to $282 per Indian farmer, by one estimate ). Indian farmers have the suicides, but they will never have the subsidies, nor will they have a fraction of the land per farmer that North American and European farmers have.\n\nThe development advice given to developing countries by the IMF and World Bank for the past several decades has been to depopulate the countryside and move the people into cities. People have moved. They were living in cities at the edge of survival, and when COVID-19 hit, they found themselves unable to survive there, leading to the largest urban-to-rural migration in human history. But more than half of the people of India still make their livelihoods from agriculture, which receives a public sector investment of 0.4 percent of GDP (compared, as Sharma points out in an interview with Enquiry, to 6 percent of GDP in tax concessions to the corporate sector annually, a number that has only grown with recent corporate tax cuts ).\n\nSo what could be done? China recently eliminated rural poverty, but there is little in China's recent experience, with dedicated government and party cadres helping individual rural families with income-generating and income-supplementing initiatives, that India can emulate.\n\nBut there is no reason India couldn't find its own way to eliminate poverty. There is much that could be done, starting with Sharma's suggestions : The minimum support price could be extended to more crops, the price raised, and the number of mandis increased to reach the one-per-5-kilometers goal. The state of Kerala has set a minimum price of 20 percent above the cost of production for vegetables-and the prices end up higher than they announce. In PM Modi's own state of Gujarat, there's a very successful dairy cooperative called Amul . The cooperative model could be fruitfully extended to provide better livelihoods for farmers. Between work produced by national commissions, peasant movements, economists, and policy analysts, Navyug Gill has pointed out that \"real alternative solutions are actually not hard to come by.\"\n\nAs so often occurs in our neocolonial world, it is the colonial baggage that must be discarded. Once it is, solutions present themselves in abundance.\n\nThis article was produced by Globetrotter . Justin Podur is a Toronto-based writer and a writing fellow at Globetrotter. You can find him on his website at podur.org and on Twitter @justinpodur . He teaches at York University in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change .\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council's attempt to defund police may have fizzled out for the moment, but the problem of police violence across the United States is unresolved-and much of it stems from the institution's colonial, counterinsurgency roots.\n\nHere are seven counterinsurgency features of policing and the inequities in the criminal justice system.\n\n1. Counterinsurgency Tactics Are Everywhere.\n\nIn the Canadian province of Ontario, when the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) changed its public transportation fare collection method from tokens to the Presto card, users had a strange experience. Sure, the fare booth was predictably replaced by an inhuman and unforgiving terminal that malfunctions all the time (despite the steep price the province had paid for it). But instead of having less human interaction, TTC passengers found they had more-with fare inspectors who corral passengers into small spaces at stations to test everyone's cards. In counterinsurgency terms, this is called a cordon-and-search operation .\n\nAnother counterinsurgency concept, that of \"hearts and minds,\" can be seen in a public information campaign to shame fare evasion through posters blanketing subway walls and the sides of buses. Riders were infuriated-not just by the campaign itself but also by abuses and racial discrimination by the fare inspectors. Unsurprisingly, spoofs of the TTC's messaging followed, as they did in New York City in resistance to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's fare evasion messaging.\n\nThere is nothing special about Toronto, New York City, or other transit systems that increasingly use these warlike techniques to police customers; what's happening with the TTC and MTA is a relatively mild example of what happens when counterinsurgency methods are the first resort for any urban problem that arises.\n\n2. Police Don't Live in the Communities They Police.\n\nColonial forces are imposed from outside; this prevents too much natural solidarity between the occupier and the occupied. In the United States, the majority of police don't live in the communities they serve . One Newark officer from the Fraternal Order of Police put it succinctly : \"the community hates the police. And you want to put us right in the middle of that with our families?\"\n\nThe polling is consistent with the idea that one group of people is policing another. A July 2020 Gallup survey showed that 70 percent of Black Americans support reducing police budgets, while only 41 percent of white Americans do. Out-and-out defunding is more commonly supported by Black Americans (according to FiveThirtyEight's average of two polls, 45 percent of Black Americans polled support defunding, with 28 percent opposed) and opposed by white Americans (with 61 percent of white Americans opposed to defunding and only 23 percent in support of defunding). The difference in public opinion reflects one group benefiting from police security and another suffering from police violence and surveillance.\n\nAs Richard Rothstein showed in his book The Color of Law , the racial segregation of U.S. cities was brought about by methodical legal means, racially explicit zoning, and the destruction of integrated neighborhoods. This segregation, too, has consequences for the police-counterinsurgency alignment.\n\nIn author James Ron's book Frontiers and Ghettos: State Violence in Serbia and Israel , he compared the methods of state violence used in a \"ghetto,\" where a hostile population is meant to be contained by powerful state control but where law and morality still limit its enforcement due to the nature of oppressor and oppressed living side-by-side; and on a \"frontier,\" where even more devastating warfare is unleashed since state power is more tenuous on targeted populations who don't live among their oppressors, but the bounds of law and morality are weaker.\n\nIn the United States, this theory also has applied throughout its history: domestic ghettos are policed, and frontiers are the sites of total war both at home and abroad. But the more police think of cities as the \"frontier,\" the more violence they will commit against the policed.\n\n3. Police Get Specialized Counterinsurgency Training.\n\nPolice officers are encouraged to take weekend courses in a field called \" killology ,\" developed by retired Army Lt. Colonel Dave Grossman. There, they learn to see themselves as \"front-line troops\" in a war, presumably on the civilians they are policing.\n\nA critic of killology courses, Seth Stoughton, says they steep police in the worldview that \"the officer is the hero, the warrior, the noble figure who steps into dark situations where others fear to tread and brings order to a chaotic world, and who does so by imposing their will on the civilians they deal with.\" Another critic, Craig Atkinson, calls the courses \"fear porn.\" One such training, \"The Bulletproof Warrior,\" was taken by Philando Castile's killer.\n\n4. In a Counterinsurgency, Everyone's a Criminal.\n\nAccording to defenders of law enforcement, the thinking is: If you don't want to be policed, don't commit crimes, right? But the law creates the criminal.\n\nAnd the number of laws for police to identify those criminals is growing suspiciously. American University professor Emilio Viano notes , quoting the conservative think tank the American Heritage Foundation, that \"the 'number of criminal offenses in the United States Code increased from 3,000 in the early 1980s to 4,000 by 2000 to over 4,450 by 2008.' From 2000 to 2007 Congress added 56.5 new crimes every year.\" The staggering number of laws is incongruous to American society's actual concerns, as is evidenced by attorney Harvey Silverglate's book arguing that the average American commits \" three felonies a day .\"\n\nIn this system, the full weight of the law is available to bring down upon anyone at any time.\n\nAnd once it is brought down on you, you have no meaningful right to a trial.\n\n5. There's No Right to a Trial in a Counterinsurgency.\n\nIn TV cop shows, the police are constrained by clever lawyers and fair-minded judges in the courtroom-but in reality, cases almost never go to trial. As Professor Viano writes :\n\nThe fact that 90 percent of cases don't go to trial is the outcome of two Supreme Court rulings described by Michelle Alexander in a 2012 op-ed in the New York Times:\n\nRegardless of the innocence of the offender or the senseless overzealousness of law writing and enforcement, it is standard operating procedure that the accused do not get their day in court. Instead, prosecutors threaten the accused with shocking sentences, and have them plead guilty to something less to get them into the life-ruining prison system.\n\nAlexander noted that the criminal justice system is unequipped for any other way: \"If everyone charged with crimes suddenly exercised his constitutional rights, there would not be enough judges, lawyers or prison cells to deal with the ensuing tsunami of litigation.\" The author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness also argued in the New York Times op-ed that \"crash[ing] the system just by exercising our rights\" could comprise a strategy to combatting the inequities and flaws in the criminal justice system. Blogger Arthur Silber agreed that this strategy could work if done en masse, noting, \"[n]othing short of mass non-cooperation has a chance in hell.\"\n\nBut the price of seeking one's right to trial is prohibitive. Julian Assange is being publicly tortured right now mainly for doing journalism, but partly also for insisting on his rights to a trial. And Aaron Swartz was hounded to death , driven to suicide by a prosecutor applying the standard operating procedure by threatening Swartz with a 35-year sentence for trying to make scientific publications available to those outside of university paywalls.\n\nIn cases relating to the drug war, the goal of police and prosecutors is also to get the accused to turn on one another: in exchange for more lenient punishments, suspects are made to become informants against others-another key element of counterinsurgency and its slow destruction of solidarity in the criminalized, targeted society.\n\n6. U.S. Policing Was Developed in Concert With the U.S. Empire.\n\nConsider one of the founding fathers of American policing, August Vollmer. A U.S. Marine who invaded the Philippines in the Spanish-American War in 1898, he set out to \"reform\" Berkeley's police when he became its first chief in 1909. He used the scientific techniques of counterinsurgency developed by the U.S. empire in the Philippines (a system described in Alfred McCoy's book Policing America's Empire: The United States, the Philippines, and the Rise of the Surveillance State ). Vollmer brought in centralized police records, patrol cars, and lie detectors. Vollmer established a criminal justice program at the University of California, Berkeley in 1916 and wrote books including scientific racist theories of \"racial degeneration\" and crime. He joined the American Eugenics Society and wondered how to prevent \"defectives from producing their kind.\"\n\nSmedley Butler provides another example. The military man famously wrote that he had been \"a gangster for capitalism,\" including that he \"helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in.\" He had done so by, among other things, establishing Haiti's first police force when the Marines occupied that country in 1915 , as Jeremy Kuzmarov describes in his book Modernizing Repression: Police Training and Nation-Building in the American Century . When Butler became police chief in Philadelphia in 1924, he too upgraded police technology and militarized its tactics, including military checkpoints and Marine-style uniforms. The mayor fired him after two years, sending him back to the Marines.\n\n7. Counterinsurgencies Use Auxiliaries.\n\nIn counterinsurgency campaigns, state armies and police work with paramilitaries, who do dirty work with plausible deniability.\n\nAs Alan MacLeod reported on September 28, there were more than 100 vehicle ramming attacks against protesters since the George Floyd protests started in May, many of which \"seem to have the tacit approval of local law enforcement,\" given the lack of consequences.\n\nPortland activist Mac Smiff told the Brief Podcast , \"We call it a shift change. They're all the same people... there's the cops, there's the sheriffs, there's the marshals, there's the DHS [Department of Homeland Security], there's the Proud Boys, there's the Patriot Prayer , it just goes on and on. They just take turns.\"\n\nIt is called impunity: the criminal activities of paramilitaries or proxy forces go unpunished, while the full power of the state is brought down upon the intended victims of counterinsurgency.\n\nThe default counterinsurgency mode is a consequence of being ruled by an elite that sees the whole population as the enemy. The model for policing isn't going to be changed even if Trump is replaced by \" shoot them in the leg \" Biden. The occupied always challenge the legitimacy of their occupiers: the debate about abolition is not going anywhere.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been known to have an interest in eugenics, but despite the persistence of support for this discredited idea over the years, eugenics is a scientific and moral failure.\n\nRecent protests, catalyzed by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, call for an end to racist police violence. With their actions, the protesters have also moved beyond many of the stale policing debates of the recent past. Defund, disband, abolish-people who would never have even heard these words in discussions about the police are now seriously considering them.\n\nThe protests that started with the national strike called by Colombia's central union on November 21 to protest pension reforms and the broken promises of the peace accords have persisted for two months and grown into a protest against the whole establishment. And the protests have continued into the new year and show no signs of stopping.\n\nHuman nature-how we exist, how we live our lives-is at risk. That's the premise of Shoshana Zuboff's book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism .\n\nI wrote Siegebreakers because I can't liberate Gaza or Palestine, but I can dream about it. I wanted it to be a proximate dream, a dream of the next step from now, not a distant dream that depends on too many unpredictable things going right. I wanted to write about how just a few things going right could change the whole thing-to show, through fiction, the real fragility of the apartheid system that always seems so invincible.\n\nAfter withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran last year and resuming sanctions last November, the White House in April announced that its goal was to \"drive Iranian exports to zero.\" To make this drive happen, the White House stopped allowing (my emphasis) countries like India, China, Japan, Turkey, and South Korea to import Iranian oil: dictating to sovereign countries whom they can trade with.\n\nWho can we believe? Political parties and partisan organizations now present not only their own opinions but, as the old joke goes, their own facts as well. Are the Palestinians being shot at the Gaza fence trying to invade Israel, as the Israeli Army shooting them claims, or are they trying to protest their confinement in the open-air prison in which they are being slowly starved, as their spokespeople argue? Is Venezuela's president Maduro a dictator, as Trump says, or did he win a fair election, as the country's electoral council states?\n\nAs we watch a U.S.-backed coup unfold in a distant country, as in Venezuela today, our eyes are drawn to the diplomatic, military, and economic elements of the U.S. campaign. The picture of a scowling John Bolton with a big yellow notepad with the message \"5,000 troops to Colombia\" reveals the diplomatic and military elements. The New York Times headline \"U.S. Sanctions Are Aimed at Venezuela's Oil. Its Citizens May Suffer First\" reveals the economic element.\n\nIn their book Manufacturing Consent , the late Ed Herman and professor Noam Chomsky described how a privately owned free press could function as a propaganda system that deceived its readers quite as efficiently as a heavy-handed government censor.\n\nWhy is it so difficult even for huge countries with large, diversified economies to maintain independence from the West?\n\nAfter the 2016 U.S. election, Barack Obama provided some perspective on the U.S.'s growing fear of Russia; fear that has only grown in the year since.\n\nThe story goes that Einstein's theory of relativity began with a simple question: What if a person could sit on a beam of light? A single inquiry led to an entire field of study, and perhaps the world's most famous scientific breakthrough.\n\nYemen is a small, poor country in a region empires have plundered for centuries. This civil war is a local struggle that has been escalated out of control by the ambitions of powers outside of Yemen-mainly Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt a time when federal employees are prohibited from uttering the phrase \"climate change,\" the right routinely attempts to undermine universities' legitimacy, and tuitions have skyrocketed alongside student debt, it seems perverse that academics would further endanger their mission to educate and enlighten. Yet by embracing a malignant form of pseudoscience, they have accomplished just that.\n\nThis past May, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, sometimes known as the Butcher of Kabul, Afghanistan's most famous and probably most hated warlord, returned to Kabul through a negotiated deal with the government. He arrived in a convoy of trucks, with armed followers brandishing their military hardware. The country's president, Ashraf Ghani, said that Hekmatyar's return would \"pave the way for peace\" with the Taliban. A holy warrior who once refused to shake hands with then-President Ronald Reagan, Hekmatyar reached a hand out to the Taliban: \"Come forward, let's talk about peace and prosperity.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump stood before the U.N. and called for the restoration of \"political freedoms\" to a South American nation in the thoes of an economic crisis. The country in question was Venezuela, but he could have just as easily been describing Argentina, whose right-wing government imprisoned indigenous politician Milagro Sala, has run inflation into the double digits and is in the process of re-imposing the sort of austerity policies that triggered a popular revolt and debt default in 2001."

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\n\nSÃO PAULO (AP) - When Alessandra Korap was born in the mid-1980s, her Indigenous village nestled in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil was a haven of seclusion. But as she grew up, the nearby city of Itaituba, with its bustling streets and commercial activity, crept closer and closer.\n\nIt wasn't just her village feeling the encroachment of non-Indigenous outsiders. Two major federal highways paved the way for tens of thousands of settlers, illegal gold miners and loggers into the region's vast Indigenous territories, which cover a forested area roughly the size of Belgium.\n\nThe influx posed a grave threat to Korap's Munduruku people, 14,000-strong and spread throughout the Tapajos River Basin, in Para and Mato Grosso states. Soon illegal mining, hydroelectric dams, a major railway and river ports for soybean exports choked their lands - lands they were still struggling to have recognized.\n\nKorap and other Munduruku women took up the responsibility of defending their people, overturning the traditionally all-male leadership. Organizing in their communities, they orchestrated demonstrations, presented compelling evidence of environmental crime to the Federal Attorney General and Federal Police, and vehemently opposed illicit agreements and incentives offered to the Munduruku by unscrupulous miners, loggers, corporations, and politicians seeking access to their land.\n\nKorap's defense of her ancestral territory was recognized with the Goldman Environmental Prize on Monday. The award honors grassroots activists around the world who are dedicated to protecting the environment and promoting sustainability.\n\n\"This award is an opportunity to draw attention to the demarcation of the Sawre Muybu territory,\" Korap told The Associated Press. \"It is our top priority, along with the expulsion of illegal miners.\"\n\nSawre Muybu is an area of virgin rainforest along the Tapajos River spanning 178,000 hectares (440,000 acres). Official recognition for the land, or demarcation, began in 2007 but was frozen during the far-right presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, which ended in January.\n\nStill, the Munduruku people celebrated a victory in 2021 when the British mining company Anglo American gave up trying to mine inside Indigenous territories in Brazil, including Sawre Muybu.\n\nStudies have shown that Indigenous-controlled forests are the best preserved the in Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAlmost half of Brazil's climate pollution comes from deforestation. The destruction is so vast now that the eastern Amazon, not far from the Munduruku, has ceased to be a carbon sink, or net absorber of the gas and is now a carbon source, according to a study published in 2021 in the journal Nature .\n\nKorap, however, knows that land rights alone don't protect the land.\n\nIn the neighboring Munduruku Indigenous Territory, illegal miners have destroyed and contaminated hundreds of miles of waterways in search of gold, even though it was officially recognized in 2004.\n\nNow Brazil's new government has created the country's first Ministry of Indigenous Peoples and more recently mounted operations to drive out miners. But Korap remains skeptical of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. She sees his actions as contradictory, noting that while he advocates for forest protection, he also negotiates trade deals with other countries to sell more of the country's top exports - beef and soybeans - which are the main drivers of deforestation in Brazil.\n\n\"When Lula travels abroad, he is sitting with rich people and not with forest defenders. A ministry is useless if the government negotiates our lands without acknowledging we are here,\" she said.\n\nOther Goldman Environmental Prize recipients this year are:\n\n- Tero Mustonen, a university professor and environmental activist from Finland, who led the purchase of peatland damaged by state-sponsored industrial activity.\n\n-Delima Silalahi, a Batak woman from North Sumatra, Indonesia, who organized Indigenous communities across the country to advocate for their rights to traditional forests.\n\n-Chilekwa Mumba, a Zambian community organizer who has fought for and won compensation for residents harmed by copper mining before the UK Supreme Court.\n\n-Zafer Kizilkaya of Turkey, a marine conservationist and conservation photographer who established Turkey's first community-managed marine protected area in the Mediterranean.\n\n-Diane Wilson, an American shrimp boat captain who won a landmark case against petrochemical giant Formosa Plastics over the discharge of plastic waste on the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\n___\n\nIsabella O'Malley contributed from Philadelphia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

It delighted passersby; while Indigenous dolls can be found elsewhere in Latin America, they remain mostly absent in Brazil, home to nearly 900,000 people identifying as Indigenous in the last census.\n\nA business idea was born, and her modest home now doubles as a workshop where she and her daughter produce dolls for a growing clientele.\n\n\"Before, only white dolls existed, then came the Black ones, but Indigenous ones didn't appear,\" said Anambé, 53, wearing a beaded necklace and a headdress of delicate orange feathers. \"When Indigenous women see the dolls, they sometimes cry.\"\n\nSince 2013, Anambé has sold more than 5,000 dolls at local fairs and through social media, mailing them across the country, and she is fundraising to attend a German fair with the aim of exporting to Europe. Her burgeoning business in Rio de Janeiro is a world removed from the Amazonian state of Para, where her life of hardship began.\n\nShe was one of 15 children and Anambé's parents sent her and two sisters to live and work at a plantation. Just 7 years old, she was charged with looking after the plantation owner's toddler. She remembers being rebuked after asking the owner's wife for a doll; she should work, not play, Anambé recalls being told. And she received no compassion when telling the woman that she had been sexually abused. She never received any pay, and complaints often ended with young Anambé locked in a dark tobacco storeroom, alone.\n\nAnambé said she was 15 when the plantation owner forced her to marry his friend, a man two decades her senior, with whom she had a daughter. Anambé soon fled her violent husband, leaving her baby with family.\n\n\"We're fighters, in a fight to survive,\" she said, referring to Indigenous people who regularly face peril from Amazon land grabbers, loggers, ranchers and miners. Before colonization, \"there were millions of Indigenous people in Brazil. Today, there are far fewer. And every passing day, less and less.\"\n\nAnambé worked for years as a cleaning lady in Belem, Para state's capital. But she felt life had more in store for her and that she should seek opportunities in one of Brazil's biggest cities. She hitched an eight-day ride to Rio with a long-haul trucker and thought of him as a godsend, especially because he didn't abuse her.\n\nHer Indigenous features stood out in Rio, and she experienced prejudice. Eventually, she landed a job in a bikini factory and was able to send for her daughter, by then in her twenties. Little by little, they saved enough money to move from their one-room shack to a small home, where she started making clothes for some fashionable Rio brands. With the skills she developed sitting behind her sewing machine, she made her first doll.\n\n\"It's like a mirror,\" said her daughter, Atyna Porã, who now works with her mother. \"Through the doll, we see ourselves, and we have to break down the taboo behind it, because we have always been very discriminated against.\"\n\nAnambé and Porã have expanded their portfolio to include dolls bearing face and body paints of five other Indigenous groups. Each is handsewn, dressed in traditional clothes and carefully painted with a sharpened branch from a tree in their backyard, following Indigenous custom.\n\nWhile they were the first to reach a broad audience using social media, others have followed in their footsteps.\n\nIndigenous fashion designer We'e'ena Tikuna, also born in the Amazon rainforest and now based in Rio, started making Indigenous dolls to dress them in her creations. \"I admire her work, like that of other Indigenous women,\" Tikuna said of Anambé. \"We need that Indigenous representation.\"\n\nAnambé named her first doll after Atyna's daughter, Anaty, which became her company's name. And 20% of proceeds go to her nonprofit, Maria Vicentina, named for her mother and grandmother. Based in Para, it will provide seamstress training to women under duress, growing the Anaty doll operation while helping provide them financial independence.\n\n\"When I left the state of Para, I didn't leave just for myself. I went for other women, too,\" Anambé said. \"Anaty came to give this empowerment to us, Indigenous women.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

May Sarah is the representative plaintiff in the Alberta class action. (AP Photo/Amber Bracken)\n\nTORONTO (AP) - Decades after many other rich countries stopped forcibly sterilizing Indigenous women, numerous activists, doctors, politicians and at least five class-action lawsuits say the practice has not ended in Canada.\n\nA Senate report last year concluded \"this horrific practice is not confined to the past, but clearly is continuing today.\" In May, a doctor was penalized for forcibly sterilizing an Indigenous woman in 2019.\n\nIndigenous leaders say the country has yet to fully reckon with its troubled colonial past - or put a stop to a decades-long practice that is considered a type of genocide.\n\nThere are no solid estimates on how many women are still being sterilized against their will or without their knowledge, but Indigenous experts say they regularly hear complaints about it. Sen. Yvonne Boyer, whose office is collecting the limited data available, says at least 12,000 women have been affected since the 1970s.\n\n\"Whenever I speak to an Indigenous community, I am swamped with women telling me that forced sterilization happened to them,\" Boyer, who has Indigenous Metis heritage, told The Associated Press.\n\nMedical authorities in Canada's Northwest Territories issued a series of punishments in May in what may be the first time a doctor has been sanctioned for forcibly sterilizing an Indigenous woman, according to documents obtained by the AP.\n\nThe case involves Dr. Andrew Kotaska, who performed an operation to relieve an Indigenous woman's abdominal pain in November 2019. He had her written consent to remove her right fallopian tube, but the patient, an Inuit woman, had not agreed to the removal of her left tube; losing both would leave her sterile.\n\nDespite objections from other medical staff during the surgery, Kotaska took out both fallopian tubes.\n\nThe investigation concluded there was no medical justification for the sterilization, and Kotaska was found to have engaged in unprofessional conduct. Kotaska's \"severe error in surgical judgment\" was unethical, cost the patient the chance to have more children and could undermine trust in the medical system, investigators said.\n\nThe case was likely not exceptional.\n\nThousands of Indigenous Canadian women over the past seven decades were coercively sterilized, in line with eugenics legislation that deemed them inferior. In the U.S., forced sterilizations of Native American women mostly ended in the 1970s after new regulations were adopted requiring informed consent.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions describe forced sterilization as a type of genocide and crime against humanity and the Canadian government has condemned reports of forced sterilization elsewhere, including among Uyghur women in China.\n\nIn 2018, the U.N. Committee Against Torture told Canada it was concerned about persistent reports of forced sterilization, saying all allegations should be investigated and those found responsible held accountable.\n\nIn 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged that the murders and disappearances of Indigenous women across Canada amounted to \"genocide,\" but activists say little has been done to address ingrained prejudices against the Indigenous, allowing forced sterilizations to continue.\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian government told the AP it was aware of allegations that Indigenous women were forcibly sterilized and the matter is before the courts.\n\n\"Sterilization of women without their informed consent constitutes an assault and is a criminal offense,\" the government said.\n\n\"We recognize the pressing need to end this practice across Canada,\" it said, adding that it is working with provincial and territorial authorities, health agencies and Indigenous groups to eliminate systemic racism in the country's health systems.\n\nBoyer, the senator collecting data on the issue, recalled once being approached by a tearful Indigenous woman describing her forced sterilization.\n\n\"It made my knees buckle to hear her story and to realize how common it was,\" Boyer said. \"Nothing has changed legally or culturally in Canada to stop this.\"\n\n___\n\nIndigenous people comprise about 5% of Canada's nearly 40 million people, with the biggest populations residing in the north: Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe more than 600 Indigenous communities, known as First Nations, face significant health challenges compared to other Canadians. Suicide rates among Indigenous youth are six times higher than their counterparts and the life expectancy of First Nations people is about 14 years less than other Canadians.\n\nUntil the 1990s, Indigenous people were mostly treated in racially segregated hospitals, where there were reports of rampant abuse.\n\nIt's difficult to say how common sterilization - with or without consent - happens. Canada's national health agency doesn't routinely collect sterilization data, including the ethnicity of patients or under what conditions it happens.\n\nIn 2019, Sylvia Tuckanow told the Senate committee investigating forced sterilizations about how she gave birth in a Saskatoon hospital in July 2001. She described being disoriented from medication and being tied to a bed as she cried.\n\n\"I could smell something burning,\" she said. \"When the (doctor) was finished, he said, 'There: tied, cut and burnt. Nothing will get through that,'\" Tuckanow said, referring to her singed fallopian tubes. She said she hadn't consented to the procedure.\n\nThe Senate committee's work was prompted by a previous 2016 investigation led by Sen. Boyer into about a dozen forced sterilizations of Indigenous women at a Saskatchewan hospital.\n\nIn November, a report documented nearly two dozen forced sterilizations in Quebec from 1980 to 2019, including one woman who said her doctor told her after bladder surgery that he had removed her uterus at the same time - without her consent.\n\nThe report concluded that doctors and nurses \"insistently questioning whether a First Nations or Inuit mother wants to (be sterilized) after the birth of her first child seems to be an existing practice in Quebec.\"\n\nSome women were not even aware they were sterilized.\n\nMorningstar Mercredi, an Alberta-based Indigenous author, was sterilized as a 14-year-old, but didn't find out until decades later when she sought help after being unable to conceive.\n\n\"I went into a catatonic stage and had a nervous breakdown,\" Mercredi wrote in her 2021 book, \"Sacred Bundles Unborn.\"\n\nShe told the AP the cost to First Nations peoples of coerced sterilizations was \"staggering,\" noting the procedures were previously routine in Indigenous residential schools and hospitals.\n\n\"These many generations of Indigenous persons denied life is an effective genocide,\" she said.\n\nThe Senate report on forced sterilization made 13 recommendations, including compensating victims, measures to address systemic racism in health care and a formal apology.\n\nIn response to questions from the AP, the Canadian government said it has taken steps to try to stop forced sterilization, including investing more than 87 million Canadian dollars ($65 million) to improve access to \"culturally safe\" health services, one-third of which supports Indigenous midwifery initiatives.\n\nLast year, the government allocated 6.2 million Canadian dollars ($4.7 million) to help survivors of forced sterilization. It said the Senate report was \"further evidence of a broader need to eliminate racism\" and acknowledged that bias in the health system \"continues to have catastrophic effects on First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities.\"\n\n____\n\nDr. Alika Lafontaine, the first Indigenous president of the Canadian Medical Association, recalls times in his own training when it was unclear whether Indigenous women had agreed to sterilization.\n\n\"In my residency, there were situations where we would do C-sections on patients and someone would lean over and say, 'So we'll also clip her (fallopian) tubes,'\" he said. \"It never crossed my mind whether these patients had an informed conversation\" about sterilization, he said, adding he assumed that had happened before patients were on the operating table.\n\nOne problem, Lafontaine said, is that many First Nations women must fly hundreds of miles south to deliver their babies. \"That happens because we literally did not build any health facilities where Indigenous people live,\" he said.\n\nGerri Sharpe, president of Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada , said health centers serving Inuit women often aren't staffed by Indigenous people, resulting in translation problems. For example, in Inuit culture, people often communicate with facial expressions, like raising their eyebrows for \"yes\" or wrinkling their nose for \"no.\"\n\n\"Doctors will be speaking, and they look to the woman to acknowledge something. When she (raises her eyebrows), the doctor labels it as 'non-responsive,'\" Sharpe said.\n\nDr. Ewan Affleck, who made a 2021 film, \" The Unforgotten,\" about the pervasive racism against Canada's Indigenous people, said the way forced sterilization happens now is more subtle than in the past. He noted an ongoing \"power imbalance\" in the country's health system. \"If you have a white doctor saying to an Indigenous woman, 'You should be sterilized,' it may very likely happen,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nThere are at least five class-action lawsuits against health, provincial and federal authorities involving forced sterilizations in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and elsewhere.\n\nMay Sarah Cardinal, the representative plaintiff in the Alberta case, said she was pressured into having her tubes tied after having her second child in 1977, but the doctor never explained the procedure was irreversible.\n\n\"The doctor told me: 'There are hard times ahead and how are you going to look after a bunch of kids? What if your husband leaves?'\" Cardinal told the AP. \"I was afraid if I didn't go through with it, they would be angry with me, and I didn't feel like I had a say.\"\n\nCardinal only realized she had been a victim of forced sterilization when her daughter, Anita, pieced it together after watching a video in a university class about eugenics and forced sterilization.\n\n\"My mother had always told me she wanted more children but that she didn't have a choice,\" Anita Cardinal said.\n\nMay Sarah Cardinal said she recalled her doctor asking if she and her husband were \"native\" Canadians and wondered why that should make a difference.\n\n\"I would see mothers with their kids and my heart ached not to be able to have more,\" she said.\n\n--\n\nKotaska, the ob-gyn who carried out the surgery that left an Indigenous woman sterile in 2019, was the president of the Northwest Territories' medical association and held teaching positions at several Canadian universities.\n\nDocuments show an anesthetist and surgical nurse became alarmed when Kotaska said during the surgery to remove the woman's right fallopian tube: \"Let's see if I can find a reason to take the left tube as well.\"\n\nKotaska told investigators he was \"voicing his thought process out loud\" that removing both tubes would lessen the woman's pelvic pain, the documents say.\n\nDescribing Kotaska's actions as \"a violation of his ethical obligations,\" investigators suspended Kotaska's medical license for five months, ordered him to take an ethics course and reimburse the cost of the inquiry. The Northwest Territories health department said it was the first time a \"non-consensual medical procedure\" had been referred for investigation.\n\nThe woman is suing Kotaska and hospital authorities for 6 million Canadian dollars ($4.38 million).\n\nThere was no suggestion in the documents that Kotaska was motivated by racism. Kotaska declined to comment to the AP.\n\nThe Canadian government would not comment on Kotaska's actions but said forced sterilization is illegal and prosecutable under Canadian criminal law. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the Northwest Territories said there is no criminal investigation into Kotaska.\n\n\"People don't want to believe things like this are happening in Canada, but cases like this explain why entire First Nations populations still feel unsafe,\" said Dr. Unjali Malhotra, medical officer of the First Nations Health Authority in British Columbia.\n\nDespite Canada's reputation as a progressive society, its continued forced sterilization of Indigenous women puts it alongside countries like India and China , where the practice mostly affects women from ethnic minorities.\n\nIn Europe, forced sterilizations affected more than 90,000 Roma women in past decades in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria. Court rulings, apologies from the governments, reparations programs and modified health policies have mostly stamped out the practice; the last known forced sterilization on the continent was in 2012.\n\nIn 1976, the U.S. found that forced sterilizations happened in at least one-third of the regions where the government provided health services to Native Americans. The U.S. government has never formally apologized or offered compensation.\n\nIndigenous leaders in Canada say an official apology would be a critical step towards rebuilding the country's fractured relationship with First Nations people. Only the province of Alberta has apologized and offered some compensation to those affected before 1972.\n\nMercredi said she continues to endure the repercussions of being sterilized without her knowledge decades ago.\n\n\"Those who subject women to this must be held accountable,\" she said. \"No amount of therapy or healing can reconcile the fact that my human right to have children was taken from me.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Young Indigenous women and girls in the state of Chiapas hope that this historic moment could bring progressive change, gender equality. (AP video by Fernanda Pesce)\n\nPLAN DE AYALA, Mexico (AP) - At 4:30 a.m., the girls and women begin to appear in the dark streets of this rural village of Tojolabal people in southern Mexico. They walk in silence. Some are headed to grind corn to make their family's tortillas. Others fetch firewood to carry home, on their backs or with the help of a donkey. The youngest hurry to finish chores before running to school.\n\nHours later, it's still morning, and it's time to talk. A group of young women and men gathers in a classroom at the Plan de Ayala high school. They've come to discuss gender equality and reflect on the role of women in this remote Indigenous community in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state.\n\nJeydi Hernández, 17, wants to be a veterinarian and play basketball, though her first attempt to form a team failed: \"There were 12 of us, but my friends got married, and there were only four of us left.\" Madaí Gómez, 18, complains that she can't express opinions in her town: \"They think women don't know anything.\"\n\n(AP video by Fernanda Pesce)\n\nTwo Indigenous women lead the workshop, and dozens attend. Years ago, such an initiative would not have been so well-received, they say. But change is coming - albeit slowly.\n\nSeventy years ago, Mexican women won the right to vote, and today the country is on the verge of electing its first woman president . Yet some of the Indigenous women who will vote in Sunday's national election still don't have a voice in their own homes and communities.\n\nIn Plan de Ayala and other corners of Mexico, women can't participate in local government. Men set priorities. They decide how to spend resources: repair the school or the park? Plan de Ayala's women aren't even registered residents, even though they are on voter rolls, so its 1,200 men can only guess at the true population.\n\nWith no official data, it's unclear how many communities operate this way. But it's one of many contradictions for a part of the Mexican population that for centuries has been marginalized. Now, Indigenous women are pushing for change - little by little - with the younger generation often leading the charge.\n\nA young woman cooks tortillas over a fire in her kitchen in Plan de Ayala, a Tojolabal village in the Las Margaritas municipality of Chiapas state, Mexico, Thursday, May 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nOf more than 23 million Indigenous people in Mexico - nearly 20% of the population - well over half live in poverty, according to government data from 2022. And women face the worst of it, with the lowest rates of literacy in their communities and little, if any, rights to own land.\n\nNeither of the two women candidates for president - Claudia Sheinbaum for the governing Morena party and the opposition's Xóchitl Gálvez - have spoken much about Indigenous issues. Still, women in this region can't hide some hope that a woman president could better address some of their most pressing needs: health care and education access, and protection from domestic violence.\n\nThe status of Mexico's Indigenous peoples leaped onto the international stage in 1994 in Chiapas, when Zapatista guerrilla fighters declared war against the government. They aimed not to take power, but demanded that the government address racism and marginalization suffered by Indigenous peoples. The movement had unusually high participation from women.\n\nTwelve days of fighting and years of negotiation culminated in 2001 with a constitutional amendment that recognized the right of Indigenous people to autonomous government; to preserve their languages, land and cultural identity; and to have access to basic rights such as health care and education.\n\nThis allowed many small Indigenous communities to govern themselves and choose their leaders without national political influence. It also meant that the federal government frequently looked the other way when those local customs contradicted basic rights like gender equality.\n\nAfter the uprising, Indigenous women felt encouraged to fight for their rights in their communities. In some places they succeeded. But poverty and inequality persist in many Indigenous communities.\n\nJuana Cruz, 51, is one of the women on a crusade to bring change. She grew up listening to stories of the abuses suffered by four generations of her family forced to work on an estate where they had to speak Spanish rather than their native Tojolabal, a Mayan-family language. She remembers being beaten in school for not speaking Spanish well.\n\nJuana Cruz poses for a photo in the Las Margaritas municipality of Chiapas state, Mexico, Friday, May 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nToday she is one of the most veteran social activists in Las Margaritas, the municipality that includes Plan de Ayala, and director of Tzome Ixuk, which means \"organized woman\" in Tojolabal. Her collective accompanies victims of domestic violence to report crimes, organizes talks to hear communities' needs, hosts workshops for men and women about gender rights, and teaches children Tojolabal. Political parties have approached her, she said, but she rejected their recruitment efforts - she wants to focus on organizing and educating in a politically independent environment.\n\n\"The ability that we have to decide is because we are not (affiliated) with any authority,\" Cruz said.\n\nSix years ago, the Zapatistas and other Indigenous groups elected María de Jesus Patricio, better known as Marichuy, to run for president as their first independent candidate. She faced intense racism and didn't make it onto the ballot. \"But she gave us strength,\" Cruz said.\n\nCruz's own activism stretches back to the Zapatista uprising, when she first heard about \"organizing\" for rights. In the mid-1990s, she demanded water, electricity, sewer and schools for an Indigenous neighborhood in Las Margaritas - demands that prompted dozens of men to attack her, she said.\n\nShe described politicians finding her demands unacceptable - they believed Indigenous people didn't need such things.\n\nA family carries grass they cut for their livestock in Plan de Ayala, a Tojolabal village in the Las Margaritas municipality of Chiapas state, Mexico, Thursday, May 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nSince Cruz and others made those basic demands, there's been progress in places like Las Margaritas, a sprawling township of some 140,000 people spread across about 400 mostly Indigenous communities, including Plan de Ayala. Some people here were born on hugemassive estates where Indigenous workers were treated like slaves. Today, many get by with money sent from relatives who've made it to the United States .\n\nUnwritten rules still govern much of life in the villages. Mexican law prohibits marriage until age 18, but many teens leave home years earlier and live as couples until they can legally wed. The community considers them married.\n\nFor some girls, it's the only way to escape abusive homes - one 15-year-old described to The Associated Press how a relative beat her almost daily.\n\n\"I wanted to get married as soon as I could,\" she said, even though she knew it meant giving up her dreams of continued education. \"I would love to study again, but I still can't because that's the way the rules are here.\"\n\n\"When you marry, you leave school, you leave everything that you have,\" said the girl, whose name AP is withholding because she's a victim of abuse.\n\nIncreasingly, girls and young women are rejecting such norms. That's part of what's discussed in the workshops at Plan de Ayala high school.\n\nAbout a third of those gathered said they would like to continue studying, according to María Leticia Santiz, 28, and Liz Vázquez, 33, who lead the discussion.\n\n\"You all have the ability to make decisions in your communities, in your schools, in your families,\" Vázquez tells the group. \"You are a generation of change.\" Santiz translates to Tojolabal.\n\nLiz Vázquez, left, speaks and Maria Leticia Santiz translates into the Tojolabal language, during a workshop with a co-ed class about gender equality at a school in Plan de Ayala, a Tojolabal village in the Las Margaritas municipality of Chiapas state, Mexico, Thursday, May 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nA buzz spreads through the group. Using the native language generates confidence and shows the youths they can be proud of it, Santiz said: \"There are still young people, women who are ashamed of the language, of being Indigenous.\"\n\nVázquez and Santiz are from a collective called Ch'ieltik, which means \"we are those who grow\" in the Indigenous language Tseltal. The group's goal is to encourage conversation and reflection among young people in some of Chiapas' most closed communities, learn the realities of people there, and provide tools to improve their lives.\n\nSantiz says that in Plan de Ayala, where women have never held positions of authority, some women do want to participate in local civic life.\n\nBut \"they don't dare because they feel they are going to be punished,\" Santiz said. \"The social compacts that the people have sown in them are very ingrained.\"\n\nA family takes a break from cutting grass for their donkeys and cows in Plan de Ayala, a Tojolabal village in the Las Margaritas municipality of Chiapas state, Thursday, May 2, 2024.

However, with help from younger generations, some Indigenous women are pushing for change. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nIn Plan de Ayala, like most rural corners of Las Margaritas, there is little evidence of the coming national election. Posters of Sheinbaum are seen in some places. The face of Gálvez - who has Indigenous roots, with an Otomi father - is not.\n\nVázquez says that personally, she has not connected with either candidate. But in the workshop, she tells the group that a woman becoming president proves nothing is impossible.\n\nSantiz is wary of politicians. \"I haven't seen a change, attention toward the Indigenous,\" she said.\n\nShe said she wishes politicians would be authentic in their outreach to Indigenous communities and not simply use their people to sell an inclusive image: \"Being Indigenous isn't just coming from an Indigenous community,\" she said. \"It's returning and doing things for your community.\"\n\nCarmelina Cruz Gomez gives an interview in Plan de Ayala, a Tojolabal village in the Las Margaritas municipality of Chiapas state, Mexico, Tuesday, April 30, 2024.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nExperts say politicians have long looked down on Indigenous people and have wrongly explained away chauvinistic behavior as the carrying on of ancestral practices. Examples of Indigenous women rising to power - for example, in leading the fight against controversial infrastructure projects like dams - have been minimized.\n\nThe campaigns of the two leading female presidential candidates are notable for what's lacking: any prioritization of gender issues or detailed plans to address issues in Indigenous communities.\n\nSheinbaum insists she will try to reach agreements to compensate for past injustices against some Indigenous peoples. Gálvez has only gone so far as to remind voters of projects she pushed when she was in charge of Indigenous development under a previous administration, two decades ago.\n\nIn Plan de Ayala, Vázquez and Santiz leave the workshop at the high school encouraged. The young men seemed receptive to speaking about equality, and they see signs of change: fathers supporting their daughters' dreams, young women carving out spaces for themselves.\n\nA woman leads her donkey, loaded with goods, in Plan de Ayala, a Tojolabal village in the Las Margaritas municipality of Chiapas state, Mexico, Friday, May 3, 2024.

She's not yet sure about continuing school - she wants to be economically independent and considers herself a strong woman who doesn't take \"no\" for an answer. Maybe she'll stay here and find work. Maybe she'll try making it to the U.S.\n\nThat afternoon, she puts on her soccer uniform and heads to the local field, optimistic that more girls want to join. On the dirt track, teens pass older women wearing traditional embroidered blouses and shiny satin skirts returning from the fields, their bodies stooped by huge bundles of grass hoisted on their backs.\n\nGómez said she believes in the potential of women in her community and thinks Mexico's first woman president could show they can do more even than men.\n\n\"I want gender equality to come, for them to give us that chance to raise our voices, for our voice to be valued the same as a man's,\" she said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Lula will be sworn-in on Jan. 1, 2023. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - Brazil's President-elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced Thursday that Sônia Guajajara will head up a new Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, with a mandate to oversee policies ranging from land demarcation to health care.\n\nGuajajara was elected to Congress in October. She is widely known as the leader of the main umbrella group for Brazil's many Indigenous tribes and is a member of the Amazon Guajajara. This year she made Time Magazine's annual list of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\n\"This is more than a personal achievement,\" Guajajara said. \"It is a collective achievement of the Indigenous peoples, a historic moment of reparation in Brazil.\" The creation of the ministry is \"a confirmation of Lula's commitment to us,\" she said in a tweet.\n\nLula promised to create the Indigenous cabinet department during his presidential campaign. On Jan. 1 he returns to power , having previously governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010.\n\nThe appointment of Guajajara to such a post marks a 180 degree turn from Brazil's current government. Outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro, defeated in October, is an opponent of Indigenous rights and land with a record of racist statements. In 1998, when he was still a fringe lawmaker, he spoke in Brazil's Congress praising the U.S. Cavalry for having \"decimated its Indians\" and regretted Brazil had not done the same.\n\nBolsonaro's promises to develop the Amazon and his defanging of environmental law enforcement led to a surge of illegal loggers, miners and land robbers into Native territory in Brazil. According to local Indigenous organizations, some 20,000 illegal gold miners now operate illegally in Yanomami tribal territory alone.\n\nGuajajara fiercely opposed attempts to legalize these policies, and that opposition was largely successful. She also experienced the murders in 2019 and 2020 of five fellow tribe members who fought against illegal loggers.\n\nAfter the official announcement of her appointment and 15 others in the capital of Brasilia Thursday, several Indigenous organizations, among them the Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon, congratulated her in social media for the nomination.\n\nAn organization of officials who work in Indigenous affairs also congratulated the future minister and the Indigenous social movement in general for the nomination.\n\nThe lands where Brazil's Indigenous peoples live constitute one of the world's most important carbon sinks. The Amazon rainforest acts as a buffer against climate change by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide.\n\nAbout 13% of Brazil's territory is demarcated as Indigenous areas, roughly the size of Colombia. Most of it is in the Amazon and covered by tropical rainforest.\n\n_____\n\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - Senate committee on Human Rights committee member Sen. Yvonne Boyer responds to a question from the media during a news conference, Thursday, July 14, 2022 in Ottawa. Boyer, who has proposed law that would make forced sterilization itself a crime, said the long history of mistrust between Indigenous people and the police made it difficult for many victims to pursue criminal prosecution. \"If a police officer becomes aware of a crime being committed, they have an obligation to investigate,\" Boyer said. \"Why would it be any different for an Indigenous woman being sterilized without consent?\" (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nThe Canadian government says it is urgently trying to end the forced sterilization of Indigenous women, describing the practice as a human rights violation and a prosecutable offense. Yet police say they will not pursue a criminal investigation into a recent case in which a doctor apologized for his \"unprofessional conduct\" in sterilizing an Inuit woman.\n\nIn July, The Associated Press reported on the case of an Inuit woman in Yellowknife who had surgery in 2019 aimed at relieving her abdominal pain. The obstetrician-gynecologist, Dr. Andrew Kotaska, did not have the woman's consent to sterilize her, and he did so over the objections of other medical personnel in the operating room. She is now suing him.\n\n\"This is a pivotal case for Canada because it shows that forced sterilization is still happening,\" said Dr. Unjali Malhotra, of the First Nations Health Authority in British Columbia. \"It's time that it be treated as a crime.\"\n\nKotaska declined to comment to the AP. Last month, he released a public apology , acknowledging the sterilization \"caused suffering for my patient.\" He said he was acting in what he thought was the woman's best interest.\n\nThe Canadian government has said that anyone who commits forced sterilization could be subject to assault charges and that police are responsible for deciding whether to proceed with criminal investigations.\n\nBut the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they would not be investigating Kotaska, because the woman hasn't filed a criminal complaint.\n\nKotaska's statement is \"very likely to not be admissible in a criminal court proceeding\" and the victim would need to let investigators see her confidential medical records, the RCMP said. The police said they \"respect the rights of the victim to seek justice for this through other legal mechanisms and choose which processes she participates in.\"\n\nThe woman's lawyer, Steven Cooper, said she is unwilling to proceed with a criminal complaint and remains traumatized from having participated in a medical board investigation.\n\nLisa Kelly, who teaches criminal law at Queen's University in Ontario, said there is no requirement in Canada's legal system for a victim to participate, if there is other compelling evidence.\n\n\"In this case, there is another doctor and nurse, and possibly others, who could provide credible and reliable evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the patient had not consented to the sterilization,\" Kelly said.\n\nWhile police and prosecutors have discretion, Kelly said, they \"do not have the discretion to simply turn a blind eye to what appears to be evidence of a serious aggravated assault.\"\n\nSen. Yvonne Boyer, who has proposed law would make forced sterilization itself a crime, said the long history of mistrust between Indigenous people and the police made it difficult for many victims to pursue criminal prosecution.\n\n\"If a police officer becomes aware of a crime being committed, they have an obligation to investigate,\" Boyer said. \"Why would it be any different for an Indigenous woman being sterilized without consent?\"\n\nThe woman sterilized by Kotaska sued him and the hospital for 6 million Canadian dollars ($4.46 million), alleging his actions were \"oppressive and malicious.\"\n\nIn May, medical authorities in the Northwest Territories suspended Kotaska's license for five months, forced him to pay part of the cost of their investigation and required him to take an ethics course after finding him guilty of \"misconduct.\" Noting these punishments were now completed, Kotaska said he hoped to \"continue working with humility.\"\n\nEmma Cunliffe, a law professor at the University of British Columbia, called it \"a very light suspension for forcibly sterilizing someone.\"\n\nShe added: \"It sends a very disturbing message that these violations of Indigenous women are not viewed as serious.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)\n\nBRASILIA, Brazil (AP) - Indigenous women in Brazil's capital Brasilia showcased their creations during a fashion event as part of the Third March of Indigenous Women to claim women's rights and the demarcation of Indigenous lands.\n\nUnder a huge white marquee, models in headdresses, necklaces and traditional attire strutted along a catwalk lined with green foliage to the cheers of a couple of hundred onlookers, many of whom had their smartphones out to share the event on social networks.\n\nKajina Maneira da Costa, from the Nukini people in Acre state, near the border with Peru, said she was nervous before taking to the stage, but was proud to be representing her people.\n\n\"There still exists a lot of prejudice. It's not normal to see an Indigenous fashion show,\" the 19-year-old said.\n\nKitted out in a bright yellow dress and headdress, Célia Xakriabá, a federal lawmaker from the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, said on stage that the event was about \"decolonizing fashion.\"\n\n\"Today we showed the power of our creation in clothing ... our headdresses and our ancestry. We participate in politics when we sing and parade,\" Xakriabá added later in a post on Instagram.\n\nXakriabá was voted in during last year's October elections, at the same time as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva defeated far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro .\n\nSince taking office in January, Lula has given significantly more attention to the demands of Indigenous peoples than his predecessor. Bolsonaro opposed Indigenous rights, refused to expand Indigenous territories and had a record of statements critics called racist.\n\nIn Lula's third, non-consecutive term, eight Indigenous territories have been demarcated, and he created the country's first Ministry of Indigenous Peoples , headed by Indigenous woman Sonia Guajajara.\n\nIndigenous women are increasingly center stage on Brazil's political scene, and even within their communities. The Third March of Indigenous Women, which took place from Sept. 11 to 13, is a testament to their growing movement.\n\n\"Indigenous men had visibility, but now women are adding their strength to the defense of their territory too,\" said Ana Paula da Silva, a researcher at Rio de Janeiro State University's Indigenous peoples study program.\n\n\"They are marching to say 'we are here' and it's no longer possible to keep ignoring us,\" she added.\n\n----\n\nHughes reported from Rio de Janeiro.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Photo by Matt Licari/Invision/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Lily Gladstone knows the gravity stories about what she calls the \"epidemic\" of missing and murdered Indigenous people have. But she also values humor in telling those stories.\n\nIn \"Fancy Dance,\" set for a limited theatrical release Friday and streaming release on Apple TV+ June 28, Gladstone plays Jax, who has cared for her niece, Roki, since her sister's disappearance on the Seneca-Cayuga reservation in Oklahoma. As the pair searches for their loved one and prepares for Roki's upcoming powwow, they share moments of unexpected levity baked into the emotional story.\n\n\"You would be very hard pressed to find any Indigenous person in North America today that is not touched by an element of the story very personally,\" Gladstone said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"We all know an MMIP (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Person). It's something that we all collectively kind of grieve and work to fix. ... We stick together and we survive through it by being funny, by finding humor in it.\"\n\nNewcomer Isabel Deroy-Olson, who stars alongside Gladstone as Roki, said the film's humor helps the audience get through the heavier moments of the story - which was also true for the actors.\n\n\"With all of us having a pretty similar sense of humor, we brought that behind the scenes, too, as a way to kind of lift each other up, and that's so true in all of our communities,\" she said. \"We just we like to laugh with each other. Showing that both on and off screen was really important to us.\"\n\n\"You have to keep joy, you have to keep laughter, and you have to keep our optimism in order to survive an ongoing genocide,\" said director and co-writer Erica Tremblay.\n\nErica Tremblay, left, Lily Gladstone, right, and Isabel Deroy-Olson. (Photo by Matt Licari/Invision/AP)\n\nNamed after Jacqueline \"Jax\" Agtuca, who works for the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center, Gladstone's character grows frustrated with the lack of attention or care authorities put towards her sister's case and turns to her community for help in the search. Gladstone said amplifying this kind of story on screen without it being \"shoved down anybody's throat\" can inspire change.\n\n\"By being and embodying a character, a person who's going through the steps of doing that work, you're inviting the audience into that perspective, into that world where they get to learn about the jurisdictional loopholes and the inequities in society that are creating the obstacles for the characters they're rooting for,\" she said.\n\nLily Gladstone (Photo by Matt Licari/Invision/AP)\n\n\"You learn about that obstacle in a way that you have a desire to change it, instead of just hearing about it in a PowerPoint presentation or as a talking point on a news segment that you're going to fast forward through because you're more interested in what the score was for your team,\" Gladstone continued.\n\nWhile movies and shows have broached the subject of missing Indigenous people before, they've often been criticized for coming up short in accurately and respectfully depicting the issue or don't reach a wide audience. Taylor Sheridan, co-creator of Paramount hit \"Yellowstone,\" wrote and directed one of the very few widely distributed films about the topic with 2017's \"Wind River.\"\n\nABC's 2022 drama \"Alaska Daily\" also explored violence against Native women and the lack of attention paid to their cases, but was canceled after one season. ABC had previously put out \"Big Sky,\" a Montana-set drama that premiered in 2020 and caught flak for centering on white victims instead of Indigenous women, who make up the majority of the state's missing and murdered population.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates there are approximately 4,200 missing and murdered cases nationally that have gone unsolved .\n\n\"Fancy Dance\" focuses on the lack of institutional support and jurisdictional issues that make solving cases of missing Indigenous people difficult. In another shift from its predecessors, \"Fancy Dance\" does not show any violence against women on screen, a move that is often viewed as exploitative.\n\nThe film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2023, and despite critical acclaim, it had not been picked up by a distributor until over a year later. Tremblay said the filmmaking team didn't see the offers they were expecting based on how they were \"hitting the checklist of what it takes to make a successful indie film,\" but noted that the film landing on Apple's streaming service is their \"dream ending.\"\n\n\"The lynchpin to the whole plan to get this film out into the world was Lily's continued advocacy of the film and the beautiful moment that that she and all of the Indigenous cast and crew of \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" had last year,\" Tremblay said. \"Lily using some of that shine to aim at \"Fancy Dance,\" I think was critical for us and we're so grateful to be where we're at.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Scenes From Peru\n\nEarlier this year, Peru celebrated the 100th anniversary of the scientific discovery of the citadel of Machu Picchu. Peruvians also held a presidential election, with 49-year-old former Army Lieutenant Colonel Ollanta Humala narrowly winning in a run-off against Keiko Fujimori, daughter of jailed ex-president Alberto Fujimori. Humala, the first leftist president of Peru in more than 30 years, faces a number of challenges as he takes the helm of this diverse nation of some 29 million people. Peru remains a developing country, but its economy is improving and it still has considerable mineral wealth. However, citizens and activist groups remain concerned about ongoing and potential environmental damage from extracting those resources -- and miners have been striking, seeking better working conditions and a larger share of the profits. Gathered here are some recent scenes from all around the Republic of Peru.\n\nPerformers attend a light show at the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, on July 7, 2011. Peru celebrated the 100th anniversary of the scientific discovery of Machu Picchu by American adventurer and archaeologist Hiram Bingham. #\n\nThe ruins of the Machu Picchu citadel, 130 km northwest of Cuzco, Peru, on July 6, 2011. The Inca compound was being prepared for the centennial commemoration of its discovery by American adventurer and archaeologist Hiram Bingham in 1911. Machu Picchu sits at 2,350 meters above sea level in the heart of the Urubamba valley in southern Peru, 510 kilometers south of Lima. #\n\nA girl wearing a traditional regional Andean attire participates in a civic parade on July 6, 2011 in the town of Machu Picchu at the mountain base under the Inca citadel as part of the festivities commemorating the centennial of its discovery. #\n\nThe ruins of the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu are illuminated on the evening of July 7, 2011 during a light and sound show as the final act in the commemorative celebration marking the centennial of its discovery. The complex, which remained unknown to Spanish conquerors, is now visited by up to 250,000 people every year. #\n\nA lifeguard releases Tomas, a lost Humboldt penguin, near a penguin colony on San Lorenzo Island, on January 26, 2011. Tomas was rescued by lifeguards on Sunday after losing his way and landing at the beach of Agua Dulce in the Lima district of Chorrillos. Humboldt penguins, poached for meat and sought after as household pets, are considered an endangered species according the Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture. #\n\nA view of Lima, seen from the top of Morro Solar hill in Lima's district of Chorrillos, on June 16, 2011. #\n\nA cook prepares traditional Peruvian food during the Mistura gastronomic fair in Lima, on September 9, 2011.

Government efforts to halt illegal mining in the area have mostly been futile. The state of Madre de Dios prides itself on its biodiversity and attracts eco-tourists for its monkeys, macaws and anacondas. But an estimated 35 metric tons of mercury is released annually by miners in this state alone, slowly poisoning people, plants, animals and fish, scientific studies show. #\n\nAn illegal gold dredge burns on a river near the Amazon city of Puerto Maldonado, on February 19, 2011. Army forces on Saturday initiated the destruction of illegal gold dredges on the rivers of the southern Amazon region of Madre de Dios where every year, about 50,000 acres of Peruvian rainforest are destroyed and 45 tons of mercury pollute the rivers due to illegal gold mining, according to the Environment Ministry. #\n\nA boy rows a boat on a lake at Pacaya Samiria National Reserve in the Amazon jungle, on September 3, 2011. The Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, measuring close to 5 million acres, is the biggest national reserve in Peru, containing 85 natural lakes which are home to 250 species of fish as well as both pink and gray freshwater dolphins. #\n\nChildren dressed in purple carry a replica of Peru's most revered Catholic religious icon, \"the Lord of the Miracles\", during a procession in Lima, on September 4, 2011. Every year, 2,500 children of the \"Children's Brotherhood of The Lord of Miracles\", between 9 and 15 years old, participate in the procession to carry a 300 kg (661 pound) replica of the religious icon along Lima's main square, before the actual festival in October. The icon's name originated in the 17th century after an earthquake destroyed most of the city, leaving only that mural standing. #\n\nChildren listen to a mass before a procession to commemorate the \"Lord of the Miracles\", in Lima, on September 4, 2011. #\n\nDogs bark at a man dressed as a giant guinea pig during a campaign rally for Peru's presidential candidate Pedro Pablo Kuczynski at Cerro San Cosme in Lima, on April 1, 2011. #\n\nA Quechua indigenous woman votes as she carries her child during the presidential runoff election in Ollantaytambo village in Peru, on Sunday June 5, 2011.

Archaeologists unearthed the remains, part of a massive sacrifice that formed part of a religious ceremony of the pre-Inca Chimu culture for the fertility of the ocean and the land.

      "text": "The Fight Over Sacheen Littlefeather's Heritage Takes a New Twist\n\nJust days before the 96th Academy Awards , the family of activist Sacheen Littlefeather -born Marie Cruz-are being confronted with new claims that she was indeed the Indigenous woman she portrayed herself to be on stage during one of the most famous moments in Oscar history. And her two sisters tell The Daily Beast that the renewed inquiry has brought the trauma of their strained relationship back to the surface.\n\nIn 1973, Littlefeather got on stage to decline the Academy Award, on behalf of actor Marlon Brando , who had won Best Actor for The Godfather . Dressed in buckskins and presenting herself as a Native American, Littlefeather called out the industry's misrepresentation of Native people and in that moment became known as a heroine for speaking up, and for her activism that followed.\n\nWeeks after Littlefeather's death in October 2022, Native journalist Jacqueline Keeler (Navajo, Yankton Sioux) published an investigative piece in the San Francisco Chronicle that deemed her an \"ethnic fraud.\" Citing family stories by Littlefeather's sisters Rosalind Cruz and Trudy Orlandi, Keeler reported that Littlefeather was not part of the White Mountain Apache or Yaqui tribes that she claimed, but was instead of Mexican and European descent. The Academy stood behind Littlefeather, saying in a statement that they recognize \"self-identification.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, as Lily Gladstone (Blackfeet and Nez Perce descent) is poised to become the first Native American actor to win an Oscar for her role in Martin Scorsese 's Killers of the Flower Moon , the controversy is rearing its head once again.\n\nLast week, The Hollywood Reporter contacted Keeler to present new claims that Littlefeather \"had Indigenous ancestry after all.\" Keeler forwarded the request for comment to sisters Cruz and Orlandi since there were family questions she could not address.\n\nIn an email viewed by The Daily Beast, THR 's senior editor of diversity and inclusion Rebecca Sun asked Cruz and Orlandi how well they knew their sister, how close they were to their paternal grandfather George, and whether he \"or anyone on that side of the family ever [spoke] of being partially of Mexican Yaqui descent.\" Sun, who previously broke the news about The Academy's official apology to Littlefeather in 2022, then asked Cruz and Orlandi to provide DNA results from an Ancestry.com test they told her they had taken \"because the genealogical records uncovered do pertain to [their] Mexican heritage.\"\n\nResponding directly to Sun, Cruz wrote, \"As a family, the lengths we've seen ppl go to, to defend our sister without regard to the slander and emotional harm to our family's legacy and our father's good name is heartless. Let me be so brutally honest to say in this case I feel your [sic] the next journalist in line to twist facts by endorsing a myth at our emotional expense.\"\n\nCruz told The Daily Beast, \"We thought [Sun's] questions were intrusive. We spoke the truth about our sister and this feels like a desperate attempt to rehabilitate her [image] at our family's expense.\"\n\nIn another email to Sun, Cruz asserted, \"Our sister and Buffy Sainte Marie are made from the same mold,\" referring to the famous singer-songwriter who was similarly accused of faking her Native heritage . \"Pretendians.\" She added that her Ancestry.com info would remain \"private within our family.\"\n\n\"We were approached by a former colleague of Littlefeather's last fall with genealogical claims that had not yet been made public,\" Sun said in a statement to The Daily Beast on Tuesday. \"The questions I submitted were part of standard journalistic due diligence asking for clarity on what had been shared with me during the course of my reporting, including assertions that the sisters declared to me directly. We are confident that our story presents the new claims with proper context, which in this case necessarily includes the perspective of Littlefeather's surviving family.\"\n\nSun told Keeler and Littlefeather's sisters that the claims stem from a baptism certificate from 1819 that suggested that the sisters' great-great-great grandfather was Indigenous. That record, shared with me by Keeler and shown below, confirms the baptism of the sisters' great-great-great grandfather, Juan Antonio Gonzales Seam, on Yaqui land in present-day Mexico.\n\nKeeler told Sun that the record in question \"describes [Seam] as being born on Yaqui land with the Spanish words 'criollo de la tierra,' and the location 'de yaqui,'\" going on to explain that \"the historian we consulted pointed out that criollos de la tierra refers to migrants from somewhere else.\" She contrasted that with the baptism record below of a Native child who was Apache. In this case, the location is not \"de Apache\" and the child is described as \"Apache hijo,\" or \"Apache son.\" Citing the historian, Keeler wondered why Littlefeather's ancestor's baptism was missing the words \"yacqui hijo.\"\n\nThere are other interpretations of the record in question. Prof. Brian Haley of State University of New York at Oneonta told The Daily Beast that while it could indicate that Littlefeather had a Yaqui ancestor, he stressed further confirmation is needed since errors do occur in parish records. He wrote to me via email that \"one record alone is not enough to confirm Native ancestry, and that there is no evidence of a Yaqui community claiming any family members as their own in this or subsequent records.\"\n\nRichard Manriquez, a distant cousin of Rosalind Cruz and Trudy Orlandi, spent four years researching genealogical records of his family's history. He told me, \"I have traced our (Manriquez) family lines back to Europe in the 1500s and found not a single person who identified as being Native American or Indigenous in Mexico.\" This included research into the Cruz family line.\n\nThe THR reporter's request for the sister's DNA tests raises deeper questions about whether having an Indigenous ancestor in the distant past necessarily makes one Indigenous. Dr. Kim Tallbear, a leading expert on the links between genetic science and the ideas of race and Indigeneity, told me that such DNA tests \"do not point to particular ancestors or Indigenous nations to which they belonged. This is because so-called Native American markers are shared by hundreds or thousands of Indigenous nations across the American continents.\"\n\n\"Indigeneity in Mexico is similar to the U.S.: you have to be part of a community,\" Rick Saenz (Comanche Nation), a researcher on Indigenismo in Mexico, wrote to me in an email. \"This is even more so because there is no enrollment in Mexico [unlike in the U.S. where Native Americans must be officially recognized as citizens of tribal nations].\" He added that if Littlefeather was Indigenous from Mexico, \"she would have said it in her interviews,\" and she \"would have named her Pueblo (Indigenous community and town they reside in) in Mexico.\"\n\nYaqui people in the United States also stress the importance of community. Joe Candillo, a citizen of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, wrote to me by email this week, \"No one person has the right to proclaim themselves Yaqui without going through the formal recognition process set forth by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona and further being accepted formally as a tribal citizen.\"\n\nKeeler pointed out that Littlefeather described herself as White Mountain Apache as she became known as a Native American activist. Claims of being Yacqui emerged decades later, in the 1990s.\n\nTrudy Orlandi recalled a conversation with her sister Littlefeather as she considered adding Yaqui heritage. \"When she was confronted about her claim [of being White Mountain Apache], she became concerned about being outed as a fraud,\" Orlandi said. \"I suppose she incorporated the Yaqui heritage since it was harder to prove she wasn't.\"\n\nHelene Hagan, who was close friends with Littlefeather for more than 30 years, also questioned her claims with the Yaqui people after a visit with Littlefeather to the Pascua Yaqui Tribe reservation in 1992.  \"As far as I know, Sacheen had never been on that reservation before,\" Hagan told me. \"She did not seem to be particularly interested, intellectually or spiritually, in the foundation myth of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe.\" Hagan added that the Yaqui women at the event questioned her behavior from the start, and it was \"only after that visit that she began to mention she was Yaqui.\"\n\nCruz recalls confronting her sister about her supposed Native American identity shortly after her appearance at the 1973 Oscars. \"And throughout our lives, I told her on several occasions that I didn't want to dress up as an Indian and go to powwows as her sidekick,\" she told me by email this week. But it wasn't until after Littlefeather's death in 2022 that her two sisters learned the extent of what they have asserted are lies about their collective heritage and upbringing.\n\nIn a letter to The Academy Museum sent in January 2023 Orlandi wrote, \"After Marie died, I learned that she said we lived in a poor Indian neighborhood in a shack with no toilet, etc. Nothing could be further from the truth.\" Orlandi described growing up in a middle-class family in a mostly white neighborhood, saying she had \"hard-working parents who owned their own saddle shop business.\"\n\nParticularly, they found Littlefeather's description of their father, Manuel Cruz, as an abusive alcoholic deeply offensive. Orlandi wrote in her January 2023 letter to The Academy Museum that it was their paternal grandfather, George Cruz, who was an alcoholic while characterizing their father as a victim who never drank or smoked. \"George's alcoholism and angry temperament landed him in jail more than once and caused my father to be displaced from his home at a young age,\" she explained.\n\nIn that same letter, Cruz said her father lost his hearing to meningitis at age nine and struggled with sickness as he worked to support his family.\n\nManuel died of lung cancer in 1966 when he was 44 years old. \"Both Rosalind and I, along with our mother, were with my father when he passed in the hospital,\" Orlandi wrote to the Academy. \"Sacheen was not there. It was a difficult time.\"\n\nBoth sisters said in their letter that Littlefeather hated their father and was \"ashamed of her Mexican American/Spanish heritage.\" Orlandi added that Littlefeather changed who she was, saying that \"Marie's transformation during her late teens/early twenties into being an exotic American Indian Princess, which included a name change and rejecting her Mexican heritage, was more appealing to her identity.\"\n\nLittlefeather's sisters believe that her Native identity stemmed from mental health challenges she faced throughout her life. In her January 2023 letter to The Academy Museum, Orlandi noted that Littlefeather spent a year at Agnews State Hospital from July 1969 (when she claimed to have been at Alcatraz), and then \"it was one mental hospital after another.\"\n\nOrlandi wrote that her sister wanted to be different and famous from a young age, ultimately settling upon calling herself Sacheen Littlefeather. \"She perfected her identity by becoming immersed into this character,\" Orlandi added. \"I saw the change over time until she became absorbed into this persona even though we have no such identity in our family history.\" Cruz also emailed the THR reporter a scanned copy of the July 1969 admission letter to Agnews State Hospital.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's pending exposé, which sources indicate would be published on Wednesday of this week ahead of the Oscars, comes 17 months after Keeler's investigation found no ties to the Nations that Littlefeather claimed-and just days before Gladstone could take the stage at the Academy Awards.\n\nCedar Sherbert, a filmmaker and citizen of the Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel, sees a clear connection. He even went so far as to suggest in an email to me this week-without evidence-that the larger Hollywood establishment is behind the efforts to dredge up the controversy surrounding Littlefeather's heritage.\n\n\"This feels like a choreographed effort by the Academy to save its investment, to save face,\" Sherbert said, alluding to both the Academy's apology to Littlefeather and the decision to prominently include her in a 2023 exhibit on \"Indigenous Voices.\" He noted that the film industry has a long history of misrepresenting Native peoples and profiting from films that make them look subhuman.\n\n\"But what the industry does have is Sacheen,\" he added. \"And in rehabilitating her, it's attempting to rehab its own dismal track record with Natives.\"\n\nRebecca Sun told The Daily Beast directly on Tuesday that she had not \"communicated with anybody at The Academy\" about her story and stressed that it has been in the works for several months. \"These claims did not originate from anyone affiliated with the Academy, which has had no involvement in this story.\" she said, adding, \"I don't even know if they know that this is happening.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast reached out to spokespeople for both The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and both declined to comment.\n\nBut whatever their origin, resurrecting claims of Littlefeather's Indigeneity is taking its toll on her sisters. Cruz told me this week that the attempt to rehabilitate Littlefeather both abuses her father's memory and victimizes him yet again. \"Say what you want about me, but my father did his best for his family,\" Cruz added. \"My parents were wonderful people and gave us a wonderful life.\"\n\nCruz said she was \"shaking\" as she realized she and her sister would \"have to go through this all over again, fighting off strangers who want to ruin our family's reputation and our father's good name for personal gain.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "With Her New Indigenous Drama, Lily Gladstone Is Unstoppable\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nWatching a diligent artist and actor finally get their due is one of the rare gratifying, non-toxic experiences that Hollywood can offer an outsider. Success is afforded to few, and too often, performers who achieve it end up wasting their talents as the years rush by. That's why watching Lily Gladstone rack up hit after hit has been so damn enjoyable: She's put in the work to earn it, and not one of her performances is exactly the same as the last.\n\nJust two months after her marvelous turn in Under the Bridge , and three months after Emma Stone stole her Oscar for Killers of the Flower Moon (sorry, Stoners!), Gladstone returns with a third knockout in Erica Temblay's debut feature Fancy Dance , which lands in theaters June 21 before streaming on Apple TV+ June 28. As Jax, an Indigenous woman caring for her niece, Roki (Isabel Deroy-Olson), after her sister Tawi goes missing, Gladstone carries the film with the same effortless stoicism she brought to her recently lauded roles. But here, she employs a necessary urgency not seen in those other two performances, one fitting for the first project in Gladstone's recent slate that's set in the present day.\n\nIsabel Deroy-Olson and Lily Gladstone.\n\nThe film is an observant meditation on the modern realities of Indigenous life, set on the Seneca-Cayuga reservation in Oklahoma, which is in disarray after Tawi's disappearance. The gnarled roots of Jax's family only become more contorted when the state interferes with her care of Roki, and what begins as a tense family drama unspools into a pensive road movie. While Tremblay and co-writer Miciana Alise's screenplay is occasionally bogged down by its reluctance to engage with much levity, that's also where Fancy Dance finds its singular point of view. Tremblay emphasizes the ephemeral beauty of specific moments, and how the light we receive from these fleeting instances of pleasure and connection can brighten the darkness that so often consumes our lives. It's in these moments where Gladstone does her most exceptional work, and where Tremblay's thoughtful direction commands the audience, repeatedly asserting that she's a talent to watch.\n\nTremblay makes it immediately clear that she is a master of graceful exposition. In the opening scene, we watch as Jax and Roki work together to pinch a gold ring and a few pieces of tackle bait from a fisherman at a stream near the reservation, before boosting his car too. This is not just how the aunt and her niece get by in Tawi's absence, but how they bond. Jax and Roki's relationship is forged by Jax letting Roki do all of the things that her mother wouldn't allow. It keeps them busy, sure, but it's also a way for Jax to keep Roki's mind off of her mom for a bit, at least until another search party goes out.\n\nJax is all that Roki has, and without her mother around, Jax is also Roki's only connection to her culture. But that safety is threatened when Child Protective Services comes knocking, declaring that Jax is an unfit guardian for Roki because of her criminal record. The law says that Roki must live with a more appropriate guardian, in this case, her white grandfather (and Jax's father), Frank (Shea Whigham). The brief whirlwind of family politics that follows becomes a bit perplexing as we try to immerse ourselves in these existing, prickly dynamics and parse exactly why things between Frank, Jax, and Roki are so strained. But once Tremblay navigates this brief bout of shaky storytelling, Fancy Dance finds itself back on a steady track.\n\nTremblay and Alise dutifully illustrate how the system is stacked against Indigenous families, even when reservation laws are in place to protect them. There's no question that Jax has some questionable dealings, but she's the correct guardian for Roki. She knows her and loves her niece like her own daughter, and with a whole slew of legal red tape now standing between them, Jax worries that not only will they lose Tawi, but they'll lose each other, too.\n\nWatching Gladstone grapple with this reality is quietly staggering. She wears Jax's fear and grief as plainly as the clothing on her back, despite trying so hard to convince Roki that her mother will come home. Jax has been promising Roki that Tawi will turn up at the powwow they attend every year, but now that Frank has temporary legal guardianship, Jax is unable to have unsupervised visits with her niece. It's a revelation that we see both Jax and Roki learn at an awkward family dinner, and one that Tremblay directs with absolute devastation. Jax's resignation is as heart wrenching as Roki's disappointment, and that's far too much for Jax to bear. The only viable solution is for Jax to steal her niece away in the night, hit the road for the powwow, and hope that her repeated assurances that Towi will be there turn out to be true.\n\nLily Gladstone and Isabel Deroy-Olson.\n\nIn its second half, Fancy Dance finds a stronger, electric energy that it rides to its finish. It's in this portion of the movie that Tremblay elegantly hops between those moments of joy, junctures where Roki and Jax can connect on a deeper level with themselves and their Indigenous backgrounds. Their lineage is at direct odds with the colonized world that they move around in, and that conflict creates a push-pull between bliss and fear that keeps Fancy Dance pulsating through the remainder of its runtime. Suspense and discomfort arise from Jax being challenged by her surroundings every step of the way. Things could go south at a moment's notice. One scene where a Homeland Security officer questions Jax and Roki in the parking lot is a particularly uncomfortable standout, made all the more uneasy by the fact that they were buying tampons for Roki's first period, and the bloodstain worsens as time passes.\n\nIt's an intentionally abrasive scene, one that Tremblay directs without leering or embarrassment. Deroy-Olson (who, coincidentally, played a younger version of Gladstone's Under the Bridge character) more than holds her own alongside Gladstone, and the two earn their moment of reprieve when the scene reaches its finish. Their relationship is the film's splendid center, and watching how Tremblay navigates its intricacies is captivating, even if the film's ending might not feel as lived-in as the road that Jax and Roki take to get there. Regardless, Fancy Dance 's imperfections don't necessarily hinder the movie so much as make it more interesting. Its flaws are as subtle and real as the types of familial relationships the movie depicts, and it's rare that a film can wear its blemishes with such deserved pride.\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Fight Over Sacheen Littlefeather's Heritage Takes a New Twist\n\nJust days before the 96th Academy Awards , the family of activist Sacheen Littlefeather -born Marie Cruz-are being confronted with new claims that she was indeed the Indigenous woman she portrayed herself to be on stage during one of the most famous moments in Oscar history. And her two sisters tell The Daily Beast that the renewed inquiry has brought the trauma of their strained relationship back to the surface.\n\nIn 1973, Littlefeather got on stage to decline the Academy Award, on behalf of actor Marlon Brando , who had won Best Actor for The Godfather . Dressed in buckskins and presenting herself as a Native American, Littlefeather called out the industry's misrepresentation of Native people and in that moment became known as a heroine for speaking up, and for her activism that followed.\n\nWeeks after Littlefeather's death in October 2022, Native journalist Jacqueline Keeler (Navajo, Yankton Sioux) published an investigative piece in the San Francisco Chronicle that deemed her an \"ethnic fraud.\" Citing family stories by Littlefeather's sisters Rosalind Cruz and Trudy Orlandi, Keeler reported that Littlefeather was not part of the White Mountain Apache or Yaqui tribes that she claimed, but was instead of Mexican and European descent. The Academy stood behind Littlefeather, saying in a statement that they recognize \"self-identification.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, as Lily Gladstone (Blackfeet and Nez Perce descent) is poised to become the first Native American actor to win an Oscar for her role in Martin Scorsese 's Killers of the Flower Moon , the controversy is rearing its head once again.\n\nLast week, The Hollywood Reporter contacted Keeler to present new claims that Littlefeather \"had Indigenous ancestry after all.\" Keeler forwarded the request for comment to sisters Cruz and Orlandi since there were family questions she could not address.\n\nIn an email viewed by The Daily Beast, THR 's senior editor of diversity and inclusion Rebecca Sun asked Cruz and Orlandi how well they knew their sister, how close they were to their paternal grandfather George, and whether he \"or anyone on that side of the family ever [spoke] of being partially of Mexican Yaqui descent.\" Sun, who previously broke the news about The Academy's official apology to Littlefeather in 2022, then asked Cruz and Orlandi to provide DNA results from an Ancestry.com test they told her they had taken \"because the genealogical records uncovered do pertain to [their] Mexican heritage.\"\n\nResponding directly to Sun, Cruz wrote, \"As a family, the lengths we've seen ppl go to, to defend our sister without regard to the slander and emotional harm to our family's legacy and our father's good name is heartless. Let me be so brutally honest to say in this case I feel your [sic] the next journalist in line to twist facts by endorsing a myth at our emotional expense.\"\n\nCruz told The Daily Beast, \"We thought [Sun's] questions were intrusive. We spoke the truth about our sister and this feels like a desperate attempt to rehabilitate her [image] at our family's expense.\"\n\nIn another email to Sun, Cruz asserted, \"Our sister and Buffy Sainte Marie are made from the same mold,\" referring to the famous singer-songwriter who was similarly accused of faking her Native heritage . \"Pretendians.\" She added that her Ancestry.com info would remain \"private within our family.\"\n\n\"We were approached by a former colleague of Littlefeather's last fall with genealogical claims that had not yet been made public,\" Sun said in a statement to The Daily Beast on Tuesday. \"The questions I submitted were part of standard journalistic due diligence asking for clarity on what had been shared with me during the course of my reporting, including assertions that the sisters declared to me directly. We are confident that our story presents the new claims with proper context, which in this case necessarily includes the perspective of Littlefeather's surviving family.\"\n\nSun told Keeler and Littlefeather's sisters that the claims stem from a baptism certificate from 1819 that suggested that the sisters' great-great-great grandfather was Indigenous. That record, shared with me by Keeler and shown below, confirms the baptism of the sisters' great-great-great grandfather, Juan Antonio Gonzales Seam, on Yaqui land in present-day Mexico.\n\nKeeler told Sun that the record in question \"describes [Seam] as being born on Yaqui land with the Spanish words 'criollo de la tierra,' and the location 'de yaqui,'\" going on to explain that \"the historian we consulted pointed out that criollos de la tierra refers to migrants from somewhere else.\" She contrasted that with the baptism record below of a Native child who was Apache. In this case, the location is not \"de Apache\" and the child is described as \"Apache hijo,\" or \"Apache son.\" Citing the historian, Keeler wondered why Littlefeather's ancestor's baptism was missing the words \"yacqui hijo.\"\n\nThere are other interpretations of the record in question. Prof. Brian Haley of State University of New York at Oneonta told The Daily Beast that while it could indicate that Littlefeather had a Yaqui ancestor, he stressed further confirmation is needed since errors do occur in parish records. He wrote to me via email that \"one record alone is not enough to confirm Native ancestry, and that there is no evidence of a Yaqui community claiming any family members as their own in this or subsequent records.\"\n\nRichard Manriquez, a distant cousin of Rosalind Cruz and Trudy Orlandi, spent four years researching genealogical records of his family's history. He told me, \"I have traced our (Manriquez) family lines back to Europe in the 1500s and found not a single person who identified as being Native American or Indigenous in Mexico.\" This included research into the Cruz family line.\n\nThe THR reporter's request for the sister's DNA tests raises deeper questions about whether having an Indigenous ancestor in the distant past necessarily makes one Indigenous. Dr. Kim Tallbear, a leading expert on the links between genetic science and the ideas of race and Indigeneity, told me that such DNA tests \"do not point to particular ancestors or Indigenous nations to which they belonged. This is because so-called Native American markers are shared by hundreds or thousands of Indigenous nations across the American continents.\"\n\n\"Indigeneity in Mexico is similar to the U.S.: you have to be part of a community,\" Rick Saenz (Comanche Nation), a researcher on Indigenismo in Mexico, wrote to me in an email. \"This is even more so because there is no enrollment in Mexico [unlike in the U.S. where Native Americans must be officially recognized as citizens of tribal nations].\" He added that if Littlefeather was Indigenous from Mexico, \"she would have said it in her interviews,\" and she \"would have named her Pueblo (Indigenous community and town they reside in) in Mexico.\"\n\nYaqui people in the United States also stress the importance of community. Joe Candillo, a citizen of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, wrote to me by email this week, \"No one person has the right to proclaim themselves Yaqui without going through the formal recognition process set forth by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona and further being accepted formally as a tribal citizen.\"\n\nKeeler pointed out that Littlefeather described herself as White Mountain Apache as she became known as a Native American activist. Claims of being Yacqui emerged decades later, in the 1990s.\n\nTrudy Orlandi recalled a conversation with her sister Littlefeather as she considered adding Yaqui heritage. \"When she was confronted about her claim [of being White Mountain Apache], she became concerned about being outed as a fraud,\" Orlandi said. \"I suppose she incorporated the Yaqui heritage since it was harder to prove she wasn't.\"\n\nHelene Hagan, who was close friends with Littlefeather for more than 30 years, also questioned her claims with the Yaqui people after a visit with Littlefeather to the Pascua Yaqui Tribe reservation in 1992.  \"As far as I know, Sacheen had never been on that reservation before,\" Hagan told me. \"She did not seem to be particularly interested, intellectually or spiritually, in the foundation myth of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe.\" Hagan added that the Yaqui women at the event questioned her behavior from the start, and it was \"only after that visit that she began to mention she was Yaqui.\"\n\nCruz recalls confronting her sister about her supposed Native American identity shortly after her appearance at the 1973 Oscars. \"And throughout our lives, I told her on several occasions that I didn't want to dress up as an Indian and go to powwows as her sidekick,\" she told me by email this week. But it wasn't until after Littlefeather's death in 2022 that her two sisters learned the extent of what they have asserted are lies about their collective heritage and upbringing.\n\nIn a letter to The Academy Museum sent in January 2023 Orlandi wrote, \"After Marie died, I learned that she said we lived in a poor Indian neighborhood in a shack with no toilet, etc. Nothing could be further from the truth.\" Orlandi described growing up in a middle-class family in a mostly white neighborhood, saying she had \"hard-working parents who owned their own saddle shop business.\"\n\nParticularly, they found Littlefeather's description of their father, Manuel Cruz, as an abusive alcoholic deeply offensive. Orlandi wrote in her January 2023 letter to The Academy Museum that it was their paternal grandfather, George Cruz, who was an alcoholic while characterizing their father as a victim who never drank or smoked. \"George's alcoholism and angry temperament landed him in jail more than once and caused my father to be displaced from his home at a young age,\" she explained.\n\nIn that same letter, Cruz said her father lost his hearing to meningitis at age nine and struggled with sickness as he worked to support his family.\n\nManuel died of lung cancer in 1966 when he was 44 years old. \"Both Rosalind and I, along with our mother, were with my father when he passed in the hospital,\" Orlandi wrote to the Academy. \"Sacheen was not there. It was a difficult time.\"\n\nBoth sisters said in their letter that Littlefeather hated their father and was \"ashamed of her Mexican American/Spanish heritage.\" Orlandi added that Littlefeather changed who she was, saying that \"Marie's transformation during her late teens/early twenties into being an exotic American Indian Princess, which included a name change and rejecting her Mexican heritage, was more appealing to her identity.\"\n\nLittlefeather's sisters believe that her Native identity stemmed from mental health challenges she faced throughout her life. In her January 2023 letter to The Academy Museum, Orlandi noted that Littlefeather spent a year at Agnews State Hospital from July 1969 (when she claimed to have been at Alcatraz), and then \"it was one mental hospital after another.\"\n\nOrlandi wrote that her sister wanted to be different and famous from a young age, ultimately settling upon calling herself Sacheen Littlefeather. \"She perfected her identity by becoming immersed into this character,\" Orlandi added. \"I saw the change over time until she became absorbed into this persona even though we have no such identity in our family history.\" Cruz also emailed the THR reporter a scanned copy of the July 1969 admission letter to Agnews State Hospital.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's pending exposé, which sources indicate would be published on Wednesday of this week ahead of the Oscars, comes 17 months after Keeler's investigation found no ties to the Nations that Littlefeather claimed-and just days before Gladstone could take the stage at the Academy Awards.\n\nCedar Sherbert, a filmmaker and citizen of the Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel, sees a clear connection. He even went so far as to suggest in an email to me this week-without evidence-that the larger Hollywood establishment is behind the efforts to dredge up the controversy surrounding Littlefeather's heritage.\n\n\"This feels like a choreographed effort by the Academy to save its investment, to save face,\" Sherbert said, alluding to both the Academy's apology to Littlefeather and the decision to prominently include her in a 2023 exhibit on \"Indigenous Voices.\" He noted that the film industry has a long history of misrepresenting Native peoples and profiting from films that make them look subhuman.\n\n\"But what the industry does have is Sacheen,\" he added. \"And in rehabilitating her, it's attempting to rehab its own dismal track record with Natives.\"\n\nRebecca Sun told The Daily Beast directly on Tuesday that she had not \"communicated with anybody at The Academy\" about her story and stressed that it has been in the works for several months. \"These claims did not originate from anyone affiliated with the Academy, which has had no involvement in this story.\" she said, adding, \"I don't even know if they know that this is happening.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast reached out to spokespeople for both The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and both declined to comment.\n\nBut whatever their origin, resurrecting claims of Littlefeather's Indigeneity is taking its toll on her sisters. Cruz told me this week that the attempt to rehabilitate Littlefeather both abuses her father's memory and victimizes him yet again. \"Say what you want about me, but my father did his best for his family,\" Cruz added. \"My parents were wonderful people and gave us a wonderful life.\"\n\nCruz said she was \"shaking\" as she realized she and her sister would \"have to go through this all over again, fighting off strangers who want to ruin our family's reputation and our father's good name for personal gain.\"\n\nGot a tip?

The city's governor, Claudia Sheinbaum, said Tuesday that a statue of the Young Woman of Amajac will replace the Columbus monument, which was taken down last year after indigenous groups threatened to topple it. Sheinbaum said the move was made to recognize how \"indigenous women had been the most persecuted\" during Columbus' period, which opened the door to Spanish conquests. The Young Woman of Amajac, whose first statue was discovered in January, won out over a number of other proposals within the last year. The original statue resides at the city's Anthropology Museum, which will create a replica three times the size of the Columbus statue, per BBC News. The original Columbus monument will not be entirely discarded, however; it will be placed in another park in the city.\n\nMedia Reporter\n\ncorbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "With Her New Indigenous Drama, Lily Gladstone Is Unstoppable\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nWatching a diligent artist and actor finally get their due is one of the rare gratifying, non-toxic experiences that Hollywood can offer an outsider. Success is afforded to few, and too often, performers who achieve it end up wasting their talents as the years rush by. That's why watching Lily Gladstone rack up hit after hit has been so damn enjoyable: She's put in the work to earn it, and not one of her performances is exactly the same as the last.\n\nJust two months after her marvelous turn in Under the Bridge , and three months after Emma Stone stole her Oscar for Killers of the Flower Moon (sorry, Stoners!), Gladstone returns with a third knockout in Erica Temblay's debut feature Fancy Dance , which lands in theaters June 21 before streaming on Apple TV+ June 28. As Jax, an Indigenous woman caring for her niece, Roki (Isabel Deroy-Olson), after her sister Tawi goes missing, Gladstone carries the film with the same effortless stoicism she brought to her recently lauded roles. But here, she employs a necessary urgency not seen in those other two performances, one fitting for the first project in Gladstone's recent slate that's set in the present day.\n\nIsabel Deroy-Olson and Lily Gladstone.\n\nThe film is an observant meditation on the modern realities of Indigenous life, set on the Seneca-Cayuga reservation in Oklahoma, which is in disarray after Tawi's disappearance. The gnarled roots of Jax's family only become more contorted when the state interferes with her care of Roki, and what begins as a tense family drama unspools into a pensive road movie. While Tremblay and co-writer Miciana Alise's screenplay is occasionally bogged down by its reluctance to engage with much levity, that's also where Fancy Dance finds its singular point of view. Tremblay emphasizes the ephemeral beauty of specific moments, and how the light we receive from these fleeting instances of pleasure and connection can brighten the darkness that so often consumes our lives. It's in these moments where Gladstone does her most exceptional work, and where Tremblay's thoughtful direction commands the audience, repeatedly asserting that she's a talent to watch.\n\nTremblay makes it immediately clear that she is a master of graceful exposition. In the opening scene, we watch as Jax and Roki work together to pinch a gold ring and a few pieces of tackle bait from a fisherman at a stream near the reservation, before boosting his car too. This is not just how the aunt and her niece get by in Tawi's absence, but how they bond. Jax and Roki's relationship is forged by Jax letting Roki do all of the things that her mother wouldn't allow. It keeps them busy, sure, but it's also a way for Jax to keep Roki's mind off of her mom for a bit, at least until another search party goes out.\n\nJax is all that Roki has, and without her mother around, Jax is also Roki's only connection to her culture. But that safety is threatened when Child Protective Services comes knocking, declaring that Jax is an unfit guardian for Roki because of her criminal record. The law says that Roki must live with a more appropriate guardian, in this case, her white grandfather (and Jax's father), Frank (Shea Whigham). The brief whirlwind of family politics that follows becomes a bit perplexing as we try to immerse ourselves in these existing, prickly dynamics and parse exactly why things between Frank, Jax, and Roki are so strained. But once Tremblay navigates this brief bout of shaky storytelling, Fancy Dance finds itself back on a steady track.\n\nTremblay and Alise dutifully illustrate how the system is stacked against Indigenous families, even when reservation laws are in place to protect them. There's no question that Jax has some questionable dealings, but she's the correct guardian for Roki. She knows her and loves her niece like her own daughter, and with a whole slew of legal red tape now standing between them, Jax worries that not only will they lose Tawi, but they'll lose each other, too.\n\nWatching Gladstone grapple with this reality is quietly staggering. She wears Jax's fear and grief as plainly as the clothing on her back, despite trying so hard to convince Roki that her mother will come home. Jax has been promising Roki that Tawi will turn up at the powwow they attend every year, but now that Frank has temporary legal guardianship, Jax is unable to have unsupervised visits with her niece. It's a revelation that we see both Jax and Roki learn at an awkward family dinner, and one that Tremblay directs with absolute devastation. Jax's resignation is as heart wrenching as Roki's disappointment, and that's far too much for Jax to bear. The only viable solution is for Jax to steal her niece away in the night, hit the road for the powwow, and hope that her repeated assurances that Towi will be there turn out to be true.\n\nLily Gladstone and Isabel Deroy-Olson.\n\nIn its second half, Fancy Dance finds a stronger, electric energy that it rides to its finish. It's in this portion of the movie that Tremblay elegantly hops between those moments of joy, junctures where Roki and Jax can connect on a deeper level with themselves and their Indigenous backgrounds. Their lineage is at direct odds with the colonized world that they move around in, and that conflict creates a push-pull between bliss and fear that keeps Fancy Dance pulsating through the remainder of its runtime. Suspense and discomfort arise from Jax being challenged by her surroundings every step of the way. Things could go south at a moment's notice. One scene where a Homeland Security officer questions Jax and Roki in the parking lot is a particularly uncomfortable standout, made all the more uneasy by the fact that they were buying tampons for Roki's first period, and the bloodstain worsens as time passes.\n\nIt's an intentionally abrasive scene, one that Tremblay directs without leering or embarrassment. Deroy-Olson (who, coincidentally, played a younger version of Gladstone's Under the Bridge character) more than holds her own alongside Gladstone, and the two earn their moment of reprieve when the scene reaches its finish. Their relationship is the film's splendid center, and watching how Tremblay navigates its intricacies is captivating, even if the film's ending might not feel as lived-in as the road that Jax and Roki take to get there. Regardless, Fancy Dance 's imperfections don't necessarily hinder the movie so much as make it more interesting. Its flaws are as subtle and real as the types of familial relationships the movie depicts, and it's rare that a film can wear its blemishes with such deserved pride.\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nGot a tip?

Gladstone won for her portrayal of Mollie Burkhart in Martin Scorsese's Best Picutre-nominated Killers of the Flower Moon .\n\n\"My friends, fellow actors, I have felt the good in what you have done, in what you do,\" Gladstone began. \"This has been a hard year for all of us.

It's so easy to distance ourselves, it's so easy to close off, to stop feeling. We all bravely keep feeling. That humanizes people, that brings people out of the shadows, that brings visibility.\"\n\nWith her win, Gladstone becomes the fifth actress of color to win the SAG Award for best actress.

      "text": "Marvel's 'Echo' Is Everything a Superhero Story Never Could Be Before\n\nAs an Indigenous woman, I acknowledge that I'm not the Marvel Cinematic Universe 's target audience , which is overwhelmingly white and male. The superhero genre has largely reflected that core viewer with little divergence from what studio execs long ago determined to be a winning strategy. I bought into the idea in my youth, relishing Christopher Reeve as Superman during family movie nights. Those early impressions of his OG Man of Steel performances-arguably still the best , four decades on-made it hard for me to accept superhero portrayals by the likes of Tobey Maguire and Seth Rogen during the aughts and 2010s. As a result, I all but gave up on the genre years ago.\n\nSo you can imagine my pleasant surprise when I learned that Marvel was centering an entire TV series around a deaf female Native American character. Starring Alaqua Cox alongside a cast of notable Indigenous talents, Echo made history with its Jan. 9 debut on Hulu and Disney+. The 26-year-old deaf amputee Menominee/Mohican actress became a fan favorite when her Choctaw/Latin American character, Maya Lopez , was introduced in the 2021 limited series Hawkeye , led by Jeremy Renner . Yet I had my reservations: Would this be an authentic Indigenous portrayal or just another thinly veiled attempt to check the diversity box?\n\nMy cautious optimism shifted to pure delight upon witnessing the premiere's origin story showing Maya's ancestors being transported from an otherworldly cave to the Earth. That scene made me realize the striking similarities between Indigenous and superhero mythologies, often involving supernatural scenarios that impart extraordinary qualities. My contentment continued as I saw Native stars like Graham Greene , Tantoo Cardinal , and Zahn McClarnon lay the groundwork for Maya's backstory as it unfolds in Oklahoma, also known as Indian Country (where many tribal nations were forcibly relocated in the 18th and 19th centuries). And just like that, I was hooked.\n\nFor director and executive producer Sydney Freeland , Echo is a childhood dream come true. \"My inner child is still freaking out,\" says the Navajo filmmaker, whose credits include Reservation Dogs , Rutherford Falls , and the forthcoming Netflix movie Rez Ball . \"I grew up going to powwows and also reading comic books, but those two things never intersected with each other. So it's very moving to be able to bring those two sides of my experience together and share that with the world.\"\n\nIt's a sad truth that Indigenous communities have rarely seen ourselves accurately reflected in entertainment . So it goes without saying that I'm elated to watch a Native woman kick ass. But I'm equally thrilled to see Indigenous characters just exist in a modern world and do everyday (albeit superhero-adjacent) things. As we peel back the layers of Maya's story, even more Native talents take to the screen, including Devery Jacobs , Chaske Spencer , and Cody Lightning .\n\nAlthough it's obviously important to show the historical atrocities that tribal communities have endured (à la Killers of the Flower Moon ), it's crucial to depict Indigenous peoples in a contemporary context to combat Native erasure and misconceptions. As mainstream audiences take in more Indigenous entertainment, we also need to recognize the many traumas that Native groups still deal with today as a result of colonialism, such as disproportionately high rates of poverty , suicide , addiction , and disease . While Echo doesn't confront these issues head-on, it's an apt reminder for viewers to look beyond the screen and examine these very real-world problems. .\n\nVincent D'Onofrio and Alaqua Cox.\n\nSimilarly, I couldn't help but draw parallels between Maya's displacement from her heritage-being forced to move from her rural Oklahoma hometown to New York City as a kid-and that of countless tribal peoples across Turtle Island­. Having experienced disconnection from my Tlingit ancestry , I felt a kinship of sorts with the character as she pieces together her own origin story and has flashbacks of her forebears. In Episode 2, for instance, we see her ancestors playing stick ball while Indigenous dignitaries from the four corners of the Americas watch on. In so many ways, Maya's return to her roots mirrors today's Native renaissance, in which Indigenous lifeways are being revitalized, restored, and rightly celebrated.\n\n\"Native characters are so often misrepresented or portrayed as caricatures, not characters, like the gentle Native, the noble warrior, and the all-knowing elder,\" Freeland tells me. \"We really set out to humanize our characters and make them fallible, complex, and complicated. My hope is that audiences come away with a newfound perspective of both the Native American and the deaf experience.\"\n\nCox is a representation triple threat, serving as a strong advocate for the Indigenous, deaf, and disability communities. Throughout the series, she and her costars communicate using American Sign Language; Cox also shows off her impressive martial arts skills with her prosthetic lower right leg (which Maya was reworked to have too). Her groundbreaking casting defies tired Hollywood tropes, such as showing Indigenous peoples as relics of the past and relegating characters with physical limitations to morally corrupt villains .\n\n(L-R) Zahn McClarnon, Katarina Ziervogel, Graham Greene, and Tantoo Cardinal.\n\nBorn and raised on Wisconsin's Menominee Indian Reservation , Cox attended the Wisconsin School for the Deaf and was working at an Amazon warehouse when friends convinced her to audition for Hawkeye . Her scene-stealing performance in that series as the leader of the nefarious Tracksuit Mafia paved the way for this trailblazing titular role. With Echo , I'm hopeful Cox can help open up the superhero genre to even more wide-ranging representation.\n\n\"Without Alaqua Cox, there is no Echo ,\" Freeland says, noting that her team learned ASL to better communicate with the actress. \"You need somebody who has that charismatic, powerful onscreen presence to carry a show like this, and Alaqua does all of that and then some. I could tell there was a bit of self-doubt during the first couple weeks of filming, but then I watched her evolve into a full-fledged actor over the course of the series. She fell into that character in the most beautiful way possible.\"\n\nIndeed, Echo spells a sea change in the industry, with major studios putting their money where their mouth is-that is, actually investing in stories about marginalized groups, whether that's the Indigenous, deaf, or disability communities (or in this case, all three). This seismic shift has both content creators like Freeland and pop culture aficionados like myself optimistic about the future of inclusive entertainment.\n\n\"From my experience coming up in the indie world, there was always creative interest in telling marginalized stories, but there was very little financial interest,\" says Freeland. \"What's significant about Echo is you have somebody like Marvel putting formidable financial resources behind the story of a deaf female Indigenous character. To have the opportunity to tell this story on this scale is extremely surreal and exciting. From where I stand, this is just the tip of the spear.\"\n\nSo is this superhero skeptic officially back on the bandwagon? If Echo is any indication of where the genre is going, you can count me in. But what I find most exciting about this history-making series is what it means for representation in Hollywood. Let's hope Alaqua Cox's Maya Lopez is just one of countless authentic portrayals of Native Americans to come-as everyday people, extraordinary superheroes, and everything in between.\n\nkate@kateanelson.com\n\nGot a tip?

We plan to stop him - again.\" Nemonte has just published her new memoir titled We Will Be Jaguars: A Memoir of My People . We also speak with her co-author and partner, Mitch Anderson, who is the founder and executive director of Amazon Frontlines and has long worked with Indigenous nations in the Amazon to defend their rights.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe look now at how the people of Ecuador voted in a referendum to block oil drilling in the Amazon rainforest's Yasuní Park. But now the newly elected President Daniel Noboa has said Ecuador is \"at war\" with gang violence and that, quote, \"we are not in the same situation as two years ago.\" Noboa has said oil from the Yasuní could help fund that war against drug cartels. Activists and Indigenous people say they're concerned about his comments, because their victory had been hailed as an example of how to use the democratic process to leave fossil fuels in the ground.\n\nWell, for more, we're joined by someone who helped lead that fight for this referendum and much more. Nemonte Nenquimo is an award-winning Waorani leader in the Ecuadorian Amazon who co-founded Amazon Frontlines and the Ceibo Alliance. Her recent piece for The Guardian is headlined \"Ecuador's president won't give up on oil drilling in the Amazon. We plan to stop him - again.\"\n\nNemonte has just published her new memoir titled We Will Be Jaguars: A Memoir of My People . In it, she writes, \"Deep down, I understood there were two worlds. One where there was our smoky, firelit oko , where my mouth turned manioc into honey, the parrots echoed 'Mengatowe', and my family called me Nemonte - my true name, meaning 'many stars'. And another world, where the white people watched us from the sky, the devil's heart was black, there was something named an 'oil company', and the evangelicals called me Inés.\"\n\nWell, for more, Nemonte Nenquimo joins us in our New York studio, along with her co-author and partner, Mitch Anderson, who's the founder and executive director of Amazon Frontlines and has long worked with Indigenous nations in the Amazon to defend their rights.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! It's an honor to have you with us. Nemonte, I would like you to begin by saying your own name. Talk about the Indigenous nations you are from and the land that you live in, in the Amazon, in Ecuador.\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] Good morning to all of you.\n\nMy name is Nemonte Nenquimo. I am a Waorani woman, leader, mother, who comes from the Waorani territory of Pastaza in Ecuador. All women, in general, Amazonian women, are at the frontlines of defense, giving our lives, because we women are more considerate and we worry about our sons and daughters, so that our daughters can have their living space, water, land, knowledge, values, plants, animals, so that we can live well, freely and with dignity. Now our territory is threatened every day. Why should we, as women, be threatened in our territory?\n\nThat is why I wrote a book about my resistance, about my childhood, from a child's point of view. I grew up between two worlds. The missionaries came talking about saving souls, saying that our beliefs were bad. The oil men came to our territory, flying in helicopters, promising development. They did a lot of damage. They destroyed our water. They contaminated our land. They contaminated our people, as well, by disconnecting us from our knowledge and values. And also the governments and the big organizations come to offer to say that they're going to build national parks, and at the same time they make things worse and take away our territory.\n\nThe struggle that we have lived through is very important, so I would like to contextualize it. It is a long story to tell in detail. So, for me, it is very important. As my father says, \"Daughter, the more the people of the world don't know the jungle well, the more they destroy it.\" So my story and our culture is oral. That is why I transformed this oral story with my husband, Mitch, into writing, so that the world can understand how we Indigenous peoples are living, connected with Mother Nature, with much love and with much respect.\n\nSo, this is a story of resilience, of resistance, so that the people of the world can know the true story of the Indigenous peoples, of all the Indigenous peoples who are living a great, gigantic threat, because this system from here reaches our territory day after day after day. So this message is very important. You can read the book. You can touch and open your hearts and make a real commitment to take action.\n\nWhat am I trying to say with this? The communities and the civil society here, you have to open your hearts and condemn that the companies do not continue to invest in what harms our territory and what exterminates our territory, our knowledge, our culture. So, from here, we have to begin to reeducate ourselves, not to consume what destroys our health, and to reconnect with Mother Nature, to reconnect spiritually, to love Mother Nature again and to heal ourselves. That is what's important.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to get into the battle for the law you had passed in Ecuador. But first, the title of your book in the United States that just came out is We Will Be Jaguars: A Memoir of My People . That's different from the title of your book in Europe that just came out, which is, We Will Not Be Saved . Can you talk about the difference?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] Well, I grew up in two worlds, because the evangelicals came to save the soul, and they brought us diseases, polio. Our grandparents, my grandparents, my aunts died from it. And also the oil companies came to say that they were going to develop the life of the communities, but they destroyed them. And until now, they are contaminating our territory and bringing diseases. And the big oil companies and the governments come with the same intention, without understanding.\n\nThat is why I tried to say, \"We will not be saved,\" as long as they do not listen to the Indigenous peoples, the cosmovisions of the peoples. Sometimes they come with the white man's structures, thinking they are better, that they have better ideas, bringing development proposals, and they are causing destruction. So that is why I tried to say, because I lived it, since my childhood, confused, and my people, my people were spiritually connected with nature, healing, and the evangelicals were talking about saving us and saying that our connection with nature was bad. So they came to do that, destruction.\n\nThat is why I wrote that title, that they cannot continue to treat Indigenous peoples as if we are ignorant, as if we have no knowledge. Indigenous peoples for thousands of years have had knowledge, respect for Mother Nature, love for the Earth. If we women are the land, if they mistreat it, if they destroy it, how are we going to give life to them? How are we going to feed them? So, that is what I'm trying to say.\n\nWe Will Be Jaguars . I mean, in our culture, the jaguar is a god. The jaguar helps us to see the vision in our dream of taking care of the territory. If we die, we will continue to live spiritually as a jaguar surrounding our territory, defending it. So, I, as a Waorani woman, led the fight against the government, to fight against oil, to say, \"We will be Jaguars, ready, always defending, for our children, for your children and for the planet.\" So, that is why I wrote that we will all be jaguars.\n\nAnd now this book is very special, so that the people of the world can learn to respect and we can work together against climate change. While they are talking here about climate change, there are no answers. They are just making promises, the same politicians, the same representatives making the decisions. There is no space for Indigenous women to take action, to have that space together.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mitch Anderson, you're co-author of this book, and you and Nemo are partners, and you have two little ones, a 9- and a 3-year-old. So, Nemo just explained to us what We Will Not Be Saved means and also what We Will Be Jaguars is. But can you explain, as an American who was born in the Bay Area, why We Will Not Be Saved wasn't also the title in the United States of this memoir?\n\nMITCH ANDERSON : Yeah. So, the original title when Nemonte and I began writing the book, we had proposed the title We Will Not Be Saved , because Nemonte describes in the book her experience as a young girl watching the missionaries arrive, talking about this white god in the sky trying to save her people's souls. And she describes all of the harm that was caused. And really, over the course of her life - in the book, she describes it - she learned about this mentality of arrogance that the outsiders, who the Waorani people call the cowori , arrived in their territory with, promising to save their souls, develop their lands, and they caused so much harm. And in the U.K., the title is We Will Not Be Saved .\n\nBut when we published the book in the U.S., I think that they wanted to go with a title that was a little less challenging, I think, a little more optimistic, I'd say. And the title We Will Be Jaguars is also a powerful title, because, essentially, you know, Nemonte describes in the book her people's connection with the jaguar spirits. And even if the oil companies, the governments, the missionaries come in and try to change her people, harm her people, her people will be jaguars, in this life, protecting their lands, and in the afterlife, protecting that very territory that they're protecting now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to what happened last year, Nemonte, in Ecuador, in the rainforest. On August 20th, 2023, Ecuador voted to halt all future oil drilling in Yasuní National Park. Then Daniel Noboa won the presidency in October, about a year ago exactly. You were one of the leaders of this fight to protect Yasuní. Describe the Yasuní National Park, the movement you led, and then Daniel Noboa's changing position.\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] Well, the Yasuní is an ancestral Waorani territory and is one of the world's most biodiverse areas. It gives us oxygen to the planet. To achieve this, the Indigenous peoples united with all the peoples and then with activists, filmmakers, students. We made the people of the cities, of all the civil society understand the importance and also see that throughout the oil exploitation in the territory in Ecuador, in all the country, there has been no development. There has been more corruption, more problems, more death. So it was very evident. And the societies realized that it was very important to protect, to conserve the territory for the future. So this was also the work that we campaigned for.\n\nI also headed Amazon Frontlines. And with other organizations, we made a film so that people could see the Yasuní rainforest and its importance, not only for the Waorani people, but for all the peoples of the planet. Then we achieved this victory in the referendum in Ecuador. In the whole country, we convinced them, and they voted yes to life. That was a powerful sign that I felt, that the people in the cities opened their conscience and opened their hearts and saw what was important was life. So we won. But the president has not met the standards. He should already begin to close and dismantle. And we, the Indigenous peoples, have had enough.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me interrupt for one minute. So, you passed the law first, and this took enormous mobilizing of people across Ecuador. What was the position that Noboa, as candidate, took, after this law was passed, clearly so popular that in order for him to win the presidency, he had to support the bill. Is that right?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] Yes. During the campaign, Noboa said that he was going to respect the Yasuní. But now that he has been elected, he is not respecting it. I would say the politicians, not only Noboa, from my experience, from what I have seen in the presidents, they take office, they make promises, beautiful words in campaigns, but when they are already elected, they do not act with courage and bravery and don't think of asserting the right of the Indigenous peoples, the right to nature, never. That is why the Indigenous peoples are united, ready to confront them. Our territory is our home. It is a living space for the future and for the people of the planet, and our territory will not be for sale.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, the way Noboa is framing it now is they need money to fight drug lords and drug trafficking in Ecuador, and the way to get that money is to bring in foreign companies and to extract more resources to save the country. Your response to that, Nemonte?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] Well, he talks about the economy, the economy, but one day the oil is going to run out. It is not going to be sustaining the future. President Noboa has to care. He has to think about the future. He has to give opportunities. He should be a more important leader in the world that can change and leave the oil in the ground and see the alternative, not the mentality of consumerism, but another form of mentality, a change, to see what can be generated in the future and to see that the Indigenous peoples are respected, that Mother Nature is respected to stop climate change for the world. But many times, the leaders never think that. They just want money now, and there is no solution. That is not the solution for future generations, because Noboa has a great opportunity, because he is a young president who could change the world.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, how do you force that to happen? You are Waoroni leader. You are one of the leaders of the movement that passed a bill that went in the other direction. How do you make that happen now?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] I could say to this that all societies have to take action. Do not let the Indigenous peoples be alone fighting for life. What we Indigenous peoples do, we are the solutions. We are at the frontline. So people from here have to start by not investing in the companies that are damaging the territory, the forest, in general, in all of Latin America. Two, no more promoting the propaganda that the solution is oil, but to see another alternative for energy. Third, the mentality here has to change, to not consume more of the many things that are harmful. By change, I mean really open your heart, reconnect with Mother Nature, reconnect spiritually, heal again. That is the solution. If people here in the cities continue to consume, it is the same. It will affect the Amazon, while we, the Indigenous peoples, are at the forefront.\n\nEnough is enough. We are not going to stop fighting. We are going to be there standing up. We are going to be at the front as warriors and as jaguars. But here, as long as they do not change, as long as they do not stop consuming, it is still going to affect the Amazon. Even if the oil companies do not come, it is going to affect it. So, for me, the work is here, to pressure the politicians, to pressure the companies, not to consume what is harmful, but to heal in the cities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You're here in the midst of a presidential election in the United States, perhaps the most important. You've got the main parties, the Democrats versus the Republicans. On the issue of immigration, they vie with each other, or, you might almost say, agree on many points, is shutting down the border to immigrants coming from Mexico and south from there, including Ecuador. Can you make a direct link between thousands of Ecuadorians and people overall in the Amazon fleeing their land, their countries, because of environmental destruction, because of poverty, because of violence?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] I think that this has happened a lot in the last few years, because the climate crisis in general in the world is very serious. And we must not let that happen. We have to awaken the conscience of the people of the city.\n\nWhy are people not happy? People are fleeing their countries because it not only affects Ecuador, because this system of consumption here provokes armed conflicts. It provokes oil extraction, because the wider world needs that to plunder. They need money.\n\nThat is why we have to look, to balance, to reconnect, to feel again the peace that we want in the society, because Mother Earth is suffering these phenomena that affects all of us. And people are not realizing it. The politicians, with the great power they have, are not realizing it, because they are disconnected. They are not connected with the Earth. They are not connected with their spirituality. They don't have love. They don't have love at all.\n\nSo, people, society, we have to get together, promote, socialize, unite, so we can solve it. We are not going to wait for the government to make the decision in our home. We are not going to allow the government to govern our blood, our territory. So the responsibility is for all of us. That is what I'm trying to say. The responsibility is not for the Indigenous peoples.\n\nWhy do we have to live in our territory daily under threat, day after day? Because the system does not stop, this mentality does not change, this heart does not touch deeply. So the work is here, in the big cities. I try to say, as an Indigenous woman, I see that. As an Indigenous woman, I am seeing that the problem is not in the Indigenous territory. The problem is here, this system. And all of us have to stop the system. That is the message. As long as we do not know life, which is the most important thing, we are going to destroy it. Mother Earth is not waiting for us to save her. Mother Earth is waiting for us to respect her, to love her again, to heal her again. That is the society we have to heal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you are here in New York. You're here for Climate Week, and you've been to Climate Weeks here in the past, though you spend most of your life in the Amazon. What has it been like for you to be here with thousands of people alongside scores of world leaders coming and addressing the United Nations? Do you feel there's been any progress over the years you've come and joined with thousands of activists from around the world on the issue of dealing with the climate catastrophe?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] As an Indigenous woman, we in the communities live as a collective. We women are always at the forefront, because we are concerned about the well-being of the whole community. We are a collective, and we make sure that everything is well. We are protectors, guardians, mothers.\n\nBut what I see about climate change when I arrive here as an Indigenous woman, I look, and there's no space for Indigenous women where they can talk to the politicians. I see that space, and the same politicians are representing, talking, making decisions for the territory, taking resources for the territory, and talking about how to save the environment. But there is no serious way for Indigenous peoples to be allowed at that table, to listen and make decisions, to make a commitment of will and respect. There is nothing. Politicians create their spaces and make their decisions, and that is not going to stop climate change.\n\nWhat I'm seeing very strongly is that civil societies are raising their consciousness. They are waking up. That's a good sign. I mean, because I work with the collective communities, so the work and the role is ours, as civil societies, we have to unite. We have to put pressure on the politicians to look at us, to open their hearts and to become aware and to take the issue of climate change seriously. If, while we are in this space, the Indigenous people come and present their stories, the same politicians come to make decisions and sign resolutions and agreements. This is not a solution for me. It is sad.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mitch Anderson, you have worked on this issue for years. In the early 2000s, you were with Amazon Watch. You've spent a lot of time since then, well over 15 years, in the Amazon. You, together with your partner Nemonte, have founded Amazon Frontlines. But as you come back up into the United States, to your home country, do you see any progress being made? And also, as a person who can see the Amazon from here, from where your family and community was, to where you are living now with your children, with your new community, what do you feel is the biggest misunderstanding we have of the Amazon?\n\nMITCH ANDERSON : Yeah. So, I've been living in the Amazon with Nemonte and her people for the last 15 years. Most of the oil that's produced in the Amazon destroys the rivers and the forests and then is shipped up to California to be refined in California, and then it's distributed to gas stations around the country and made into jet fuel. I don't think that people in the United States truly understand that and truly understand what Nemonte is saying about our consumption patterns and our systemic addiction to oil and how it is devastating Indigenous cultures, their life ways and also their territories.\n\nYou know, in the 1960s, American oil companies discovered oil in the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Peruvian Amazon, made deliberate decisions to dump barrels of oil into the rivers, millions of gallons of oil and wastewater, in order to save money, and created this massive public health crisis. For the Ecuadorian government at the time, they thought that this was going to be their salvation. It was going to take them out of, you know, subdevelopment and poverty. But what it's created over the last 60 years is disparities economically, inequalities, corruption, massive environmental contamination, poverty.\n\nAnd, you know, I think that what Nemonte, her people, youth climate activists in Ecuador have done is they've shown the Ecuadorian people, they've told stories to the Ecuadorian people, they've helped wake up consciousness and say, \"Look, 60, 70 years of oil development, and look where we're at right now. We need to keep the oil in the ground. We need to protect the most biodiverse forests in the world. We need to wake up our imagination, think about economic alternatives, think about regeneration.\"\n\nAnd, you know, the win in the Yasuní, in the most biodiverse forests in the world, is that. It's this model of climate democracy that is an inspiration for the entire world. And, you know, at Amazon Frontlines, with Nemonte, we're a collective of Western activists and Indigenous leaders that are looking to stop the oil industry, the mining industry, the loggers, not let them into the forest, create permanent protection zones, but also work with Indigenous communities to get their land back, because, essentially, Indigenous communities are the ancestral owners of nearly half the remaining standing forest in the Amazon. They are only 5% of the world's population but protect 80% of the biodiversity on our planet. Indigenous peoples are the owners of 40% of the intact ecosystems worldwide.\n\nAnd so, what we've seen here at Climate Week is civil society is waking up. Indigenous peoples are leading the marches. Indigenous peoples are sharing their stories, sharing their positions, amplifying their values. But what we're seeing is that politicians, world leaders of companies are still really committed to sucking the last drops of oil out of the forests, out of the oceans. And we can't afford that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what has this collaboration been like for you, writing the book together? It's Nemonte's memoir, but you did it together, We Will Be Jaguars: A Memoir of My People .\n\nMITCH ANDERSON : So, over the last 15 years, Nemonte and I, her people, Amazon Frontlines, the Ceibo Alliance, we've won a lot of battles. We've beat back the oil industry, protected a half-million acres of forest, set a precedent to protect 7 million acres more, helped lead a movement to protect Yasuní and keep 726 million barrels of oil in the ground.\n\nYet the threats keep coming. Oil companies, the mining companies - the government right now in Ecuador is making designs to do another oil auction, leasing out millions of acres of territory to international oil industry, right at a time when we all know we need to stop oil production. We need to keep the oil in the ground.\n\nAnd so, when Nemonte told me that her dad had told her that the Waorani people have always known that the outsiders destroy what they don't understand, and her dad told her that it's time for her to write her book, to write a story of her people as an act of resistance, to give the world a chance to learn about Indigenous peoples, to understand their connection with the forest, to understand what's at stake, Nemonte asked me to be a collaborator. You know, we're life partners. We're partners in activism. We're co-founders of Amazon Frontlines and the Ceibo Alliance. And she asked me to join her, too, in writing her story.\n\nShe comes from an oral storytelling tradition. And so we spent years together in the mornings, you know, first light, on the canoe, walking in the forest, and I would listen to her tell me her stories. Some stories went back to the beginning of time, thousands of years, hundreds of years, her first memories as a young girl. And, you know, my mission was to figure out a way, with Nemonte, to touch the written word with the spirit of the oral storytelling tradition of her people. And it was a really beautiful process. And we think that - we think that - Nemonte told me that she thinks that her ancestors would be proud of the story that we told.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nemonte, take us on this profound journey you take us on in your book, We Will Be Jaguars . Tell us first about where you were born in Ecuador, in the Amazon, one of the last places contacted by missionaries. You've said, \"The authors of our destruction are the very ones who preach our salvation.\" But start off by talking about your face and the images on your face that, for our radio audience, it is a hue of red across your eyes, from temple to temple, and what that means, and also your headdress.\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] As a child, I grew up in two worlds, very pretty, beautiful, the feeling as a child of seeing the evangelicals flying around, bringing us the word of Jesus, and also seeing our grandparents around us, healing us with plants. So I was a very curious girl. I wanted to discover. I wanted to understand who were these people, the white people, and the grandparents. Who are they? So I grew up in a very nice, very beautiful time, because in our territory, we still lived collectively at that time. Our chakra, our river, our way of living was free, in a big space.\n\nOur culture is the achiote. On the forehead, we paint our eyes to protect from bad energy, and also beauty for the women, who can paint that part of the face and show the identity of our origin as Waorani women.\n\nThe crown is from the feathers of the macaw bird. And for us, the bird is very sacred. And they were very valuable for our ancestors, and we still believe that. Macaws fly. They sit in a tree and start to communicate amongst themselves, and then they plan where they're going to fly to look for food. So, when you wear the crown, it represents a woman leader and that you're united with your family to protect your home and your communities.\n\nAnd the necklace means that you are a leader. It represents power, the power of women. That's our culture. This seed is called pantomo. There are many of these plants in the jungle. And for us, it protects us from bad energy and also gives us good vibes, good energy. And when you go to a ceremony and when you go to meetings, you wear this.\n\nSo, in our culture, it's like 50 or 60 years since we've had contact with the world, with the outside world. And, of course, there is a new generation, and we think about how to describe our knowledge, and our grandparents are already dying. So we have to teach our own culture to the young people, to young leaders, so that they continue to protect their territory and having their own language.\n\nAnd so, it's very important for us to go back, to have our own education system, our own traditional education, and at the same time learn about the outside education system and learn about how to use this knowledge to protect our territory, so there's still forests. And if the forest is healthy, we're going to be healthy. But if the forest is sick and is contaminated, then we're going to start to get sick, and we are going to disconnect ourselves from our knowledge, our language, and we are going to lose everything, as has happened to other peoples who have been disappearing for 500 years. And we do not want our territory and our life to disappear. We want to continue being Waorani with the knowledge of two worlds, valuing our principles.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, take us on the journey from New York, what it will mean for you to go back home to the Ecuadorian Amazon. How long does it take? You will fly in to Quito, the capital of Ecuador?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] Yes, I can describe. To get to my territory from here, from New York, you have to fly to Quito. From Quito, you need to take a bus or a car five hours more to a small town that is called Puyo, Pastaza, and from there, four hours more to the end of the road, where other neighboring Indigenous Quechua people live. And from there, you have to take a canoe, a boat, go down the river to get to where the Waorani territory begins.\n\nAnd then you get to the communities of Daipare, Quenahueno, Toñampare, where I was born and grew up as a child. And then I moved further down. My dad took me further deep into the jungle, to a community that is called Nemompare. And now my dad and my house are in Nemompare. It is the most far-out area and is an area with big trees, beautiful trees, ceibo trees. And there are lots of birds flying around, macaws and other birds. And you can hear the songs of the birds, small and big. And you can see the fish, the anaconda, the jaguar growling, the red monkeys screaming in the mountain. And it is very beautiful. And when you arrive at night and when you look up at the stars and you see the light of the moon, it's very beautiful.\n\nAnd the territory of us is big. There are three provinces: Pastaza, Napo, Orellana. And we live collectively in the territory. But in one area, there's already an oil company operating, in the Yasuní, where our Tagaeri and Taromenane brothers live in voluntary isolation.\n\nWe're trying to defend our right to have our homes and to have our space without extraction, without contamination, where we can live happily and with dignity. And all that we do in my community to protect ourselves benefits not only our tribes. We benefit the oxygen. Eighty percent of the diversity in the lungs of the world comes from our territory. So, that's my message, that even though you are here in New York City and elsewhere, we feel connected to you.\n\nWe need to start to work together collectively and as women. And I work a lot with women in my community, because, as women, we're in the front of this fight. We take care of our bodies, of our health. So, that is my message. I bring the spirit of the jungle woman. And my message, for that very reason, is in the book. I hope you all read this book and reconnect with Mother Nature and connect to love yourself and connect spiritually, to heal us together, to confront the threat, because it is not going to stop. I am sure the threat is not going to stop. So, what we need is to articulate as women. Between Indigenous women and non-Indigenous women, we need to work together.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have just won a major award here in the United States, which you will soon be receiving, the Hilton Humanitarian Prize from the Conrad Hilton Foundation. It's two-and-a-half million dollars to your group, Amazon Frontlines. Can you talk about what that means to you, what you're planning to do with that?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] Well, this recognition is very important for me. It's very important to show what we're doing, as well as our partners, that we can provide resources to the Indigenous communities, because we're on the frontline of the fight against climate change. And this will help us to grow our organization and build our structure and to fight this threat that is coming every day.\n\nThis recognition is not a solution, but it is going to help make us visible, show our fight, and also show it to other actors. The threat is very strong, and it can't just be the Indigenous people in front of the fight. So the whole world needs to come together and push for changes for the future.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Mitch, you are co-founders of Amazon Frontlines. The significance of this for your organization?\n\nMITCH ANDERSON : Yeah. So, Amazon Frontlines, we're a collective of Indigenous and Western activists. And for us, the Hilton Humanitarian Prize is a validation of our model. It's a validation of Indigenous leadership on the frontlines. It's a validation of the importance of Indigenous stewardship of their lands. It's a validation of the world recognizing that to confront the climate crisis, Indigenous folks need to be seen, platformed, empowered, given the resources they need to continue to protect against all these threats.\n\nIt is significant resources that we're going to be receiving, and we're going to be investing those in the frontlines for Indigenous communities that are waging battles to stop the oil industry, to stop the mining industry. And we're also going to be using the award and its visibility to raise more resources, to scale our work, to scale our impact and to ensure that we can protect the entire Upper Amazon, one of the most biodiverse forests on the world, a storehouse of carbon. It's still a carbon sink, and it's one of the most culturally diverse places on our planet. And so, yeah, we're just extremely proud, extremely grateful, honored, humbled, and we're going to get the resources to the frontlines.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As we wrap up, if you can look directly into the camera right there and share your message with the world?\n\nNEMONTE NENQUIMO : [translated] My message is the forest and Mother Earth are important. We need to come to love it, and we need to connect to it. We need to go back to connecting, and we need to heal our bodies, because we give life. The message that I'm bringing is that we Indigenous people are the minority, but our territory is bigger, as well as the diversity that we are giving to the life of the planet.\n\nSo, the threat is coming day by day from the system, and our responsibility is collective. It is not only Indigenous peoples and Indigenous women leaders who have that responsibility. We have to connect with women who are not Indigenous, so we can unite to act for our well-being and the well-being of our children.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nenquimo is a Waorani leader in the Ecuadorian Amazon who founded also the Ceibo Alliance. Mitch and Nenquimo co-founded Amazon Frontlines and just published a new book. It's titled We Will Be Jaguars: A Memoir of My People . We'll also link to Nenquimo's recent piece for The Guardian headlined \"Ecuador's president won't give up on oil drilling in the Amazon. We plan to stop him - again.\" This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nOn Indigenous Peoples' Day, we remember the Indigenous actress and activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who died last week at the age of 75, not long after she received an apology 50 years after she spoke at the Oscars in protest of Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans. In 1973, she accepted an Oscar on behalf of Marlon Brando, who boycotted the ceremony, only to face boos from the crowd, threats of physical violence from the actor John Wayne and mocking by Clint Eastwood. The speech derailed her acting career, but she never stopped speaking out. \"It was critical for the psyche of all our relations to bring awareness to and interrupt the negative interpretation and representation of Native American people by the film television and sports industries,\" said Littlefeather, reflecting on her speech at the Oscars in September, just three weeks before her death.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On this Indigenous Peoples' Day, we spend the rest of the hour remembering Sacheen Littlefeather. She recently died at the age of 75. In 1973, she took the stage at the Oscars on behalf of Marlon Brando, who boycotted the ceremony to protest Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans. Some members of the audience booed and mocked Littlefeather as she addressed the awards ceremony wearing traditional Apache clothing.\n\nLIV ULLMANN : The winner is Marlon Brando in The Godfather .\n\nANNOUNCER : Accepting the award for Marlon Brando and The Godfather , Ms. Sacheen Littlefeather.\n\nSACHEEN LITTLEFEATHER : Hello. My name is Sacheen Littlefeather. I am Apache, and I am president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee. I'm representing Marlon Brando this evening, and he has asked me to tell you, in a very long speech which I cannot share with you presently because of time, but I will be glad to share with the press afterwards, that he very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award. And the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry - excuse me - and on television in movie reruns, and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee. I beg at this time that I have not intruded upon this evening, and that we will - in the future, our hearts and our understandings will meet with love and generosity. Thank you on behalf of Marlon Brando.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Sacheen Littlefeather. The actor John Wayne reportedly attempted to remove Sacheen from the stage but was restrained by six security guards. Clint Eastwood mocked Littlefeather later in the ceremony. In August, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences finally apologized to her. Just three weeks before her death, she spoke at an event organized by the Academy, talked about the night 50 years ago when she arrived at the Academy Awards before that famous speech.\n\nSACHEEN LITTLEFEATHER : It was about 20 minutes to 9:00. And here, the security guards found this couple, myself in a buckskin dress and his secretary dressed in an evening gown. We must have looked like the odd couple. I'm sure they were wondering why are we dressed like that and why are we here.\n\nSo the guards consulted the head executive producer of the Academy Awards, Howard Koch. And so, he came up, and he talked to us. And his secretary, Alice, had the official invitation from Marlon Brando. So he said, \"OK.\" And he told me right then, \"If you read that speech and you go over 60 seconds, I will have you put in handcuffs. You see those police over there? I will have you arrested, put in jail.\" And he said, \"You have 60 seconds or less to represent Marlon.\" I said, \"OK.\" And I had made this promise to Marlon not to touch that Oscar. And so, you could see I wasn't under any pressure that night.\n\nI knew that the creator was with me. I had prayed to my ancestors to be with me that night. And it was with prayer that I went up there. I went up there like a proud Indian woman, with dignity, with courage, with grace and with humility. And as I began to walk up those steps, I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it, and some people may not.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : At the Academy event in September, Sacheen Littlefeather went on to talk about the significance of receiving an apology from the Academy.\n\nSACHEEN LITTLEFEATHER : In response to that apology, I want to say, in 1973, I was a 26-year-old Indigenous woman, a member of the Screen Actors Guild. Very few people of color were finding their way through an impractical society that deliberately set out to erase the existence and diversity of Native peoples. Through genocide, oppression and the unwavering efforts for Indian self-determination, our generation remained hard at work.\n\nAnd we were not the only ones. In 1973, I fulfilled the request of a friend and ally. Marlon Brando asked that I attend the ceremony in his place and refuse the Oscar for Best Actor for the role in The Godfather . And so I did. I knew the impact and the importance of representing all Native people on that night. It was critical for the psyche of all our relations to bring awareness to and interrupt the negative interpretation and representation of Native American people by the film, television and sports industries. Marlon and I knew it urgent to highlight the 1973 American Indian Movement, AIM , occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota. They were experiencing a media blackout. Supposedly, Wounded Knee, South Dakota, was the site where a U.S. missile base was going to be built. I, more than anyone, know the impact of what 60 seconds at the Academy Award can mean then and now, 50 years later.\n\nI had developed a strong sense of self, community and a good sense of humor. Laughter is good medicine. I come from an ancestral matrilineal society where women are leaders, role models and teachers of peace, love, harmony, humility, humanity, truth, conversation, and a coming together in our sacred circle of unity. Others may choose to follow in our ways.\n\nI am here accepting this apology, not only for me alone but as the acknowledgment, knowing that it was not only for me but for all of our nations, that also need to hear and deserve this apology tonight.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Sacheen Littlefeather, speaking in September. She died at the age of 75 on October 2nd.\n\nThat does it for our show. We have two full-time job openings: associate digital editor and people and culture manager . And we welcome back Tami Woronoff! I'm Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The parents and allies are on a \"Justice to Be Seen\" march to call for justice and an investigation. Westwolf was a member of the Blackfeet Tribe and was also Diné, Cree and Klamath. The driver has been identified as Sunny White, a suspected white nationalist whose children are reportedly named \"Aryan\" and \"Nation\" and were in the car at the time of the crash.

I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nThis week, community members in Montana held a series of \"Justice to Be Seen\" walks to demand justice for many Indigenous people killed or hit by vehicles there along Highway 93. They're focusing on Mika, on Mika Westwolf, 22-year-old Indigenous woman struck and killed in March by a driver as she was walking home along the highway in the early morning hours.\n\nThe driver was identified as Sunny White, a suspected white nationalist, whose two children, who were in the car, are reportedly named \"Aryan\" and \"Nation.\" They were in the car at the time of the crash. Sunny White has not been charged in connection with Mika's death.\n\nMika Westwolf was a member of the Blackfeet Tribe, also Diné, Cree and Klamath. She was an avid athlete and poet. This is Mika speaking in 2016 about graduating from Big Sky High School.\n\nMIKA WESTWOLF : My name is Mika Westwolf. I'm a student at Missoula Big Sky High School and a member of the Blackfeet Nation. I am also Navajo, Cree and Klamath. Earning a high school diploma would mean that I could get into a good college or help my people and get a good job. My mom helps me a lot, because she always helps me out with my work when I'm struggling, or she always gets after me to do my work and always tells me to try my hardest and tells me that I can do anything I want if I just put my mind to it. My plans after graduation is to go to the SKC College. What I want to do is there's a program there that, like, you can be a dentist's assistant. And that's what I want to do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mika Westwolf, speaking in 2016. Her life was tragically cut short in March.\n\nAnd for more on the calls for justice in her death, we're joined by in Washington, D.C., by Erica Shelby, a tribal legal advocate for missing, murdered Indigenous women. And we begin in Arlee, Montana, with Mika's parents - her mother, Carissa Heavy Runner, and father, Kevin Howard.\n\nOur deep condolences for your loss. Can you tell us about your daughter, Mika, what kind of person she was, what were her aspirations, and why you're walking now, why you're on this walk to demand justice?\n\nCARISSA HEAVY RUNNER : Hi. Yes, Mika was a very loud, curious, energetic, very intelligent, active little girl, until she was, you know, a young woman. She read a lot. She did a lot of writing. She got to travel all the way to Nepal. She had a love for being outdoors. She wanted to hike everywhere, camp in the mountains, travel. And she wanted to go back to Nepal and climb the mountains there. She fell in love with it there. And she danced powwows since before she could walk, and I had to help her. And she just was a strong, intelligent Native woman. And I know she would be right here. If I wasn't in this situation for fighting for justice for my daughter and it was for someone else, she would be right beside me. She was a little activist.\n\nKEVIN HOWARD : And we're doing this walk. We want Lake County to investigate these kind of crimes, something that in the past they haven't done. So, if they're not going to do it, we're going to do it for them, or we're going to force them to do it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Erica Shelby, you're in Washington, D.C. Explain what you believed happened. Was this an unintentional car crash, just a tragedy, or why you believe that Mika Westwolf may have been deliberately run down?\n\nERICA SHELBY : Well, when we spoke with James Lapotka, the county attorney, he explained to us that, you know, the tox had come back on Sunny. He had also taken it from Mika, which we still don't know why. And she had trace amounts of fentanyl and meth, nanograms.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Sunny?\n\nERICA SHELBY : There was no skid marks, no brake marks - yeah, Sunny White. And so -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The driver.\n\nERICA SHELBY : The driver. And so, I mean, it's not regulated, like THC or alcohol, where you can give it a DUI at a certain percentage. So, how we understood it is, you can - it's legal to have these in your system and be on the road. But if they're trying to tell us that that wasn't a factor in her driving, well, then, it can only leave that this was intentional.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what do skid marks have to do with anything, the fact that there weren't skid marks? What does that say to you, Erica?\n\nERICA SHELBY : You know when you hit a deer. You know when you - we live in Montana. We hit deer. You know when you hit something. And the fact that she didn't brake, that she didn't swerve, that there's no sign of that, tells me - it indicates to me that at least it needs further investigation. And he can go off of - you know, the county attorney, Lapotka, said, you know, that nothing indicated that it was intentional to him. That's very superficial. And he's explained to us that he doesn't make determinations until he gets final reports. So how is he making determinations like that?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what are you doing in Washington, Erica Shelby? What are your plans in bringing this case to the nation's capital?\n\nERICA SHELBY : Carissa and Kevin started this walk. And at the beginning, we didn't know how big it was. And then we got there, and there were so many people. And everybody has the same story about the same players, the same agencies, the same police, the same attorneys. And it's enough is enough. And they've been alienated, and they're isolated, and they're made to look crazy. And they eventually burn out. This system, it breaks us down. Where they're supposed to serve and protect, they're victim blaming. They're breaking us down. They're overcriminalizing us. We're overrepresented in prisons. We're overrepresented in the missing persons cases. We're overrepresented in the murder cases. We're only 5% of the state population, but in 2021 we were 30% of the missing peoples population.\n\nSo, something has to change. And I'm here to get the attention of the people in D.C. - Tester, Daines, Murkowski, Schatz, everybody on that Senate Committee for Indian Affairs -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : All the senators you're mentioning.\n\nERICA SHELBY : - the president, everybody. He was the one who supported VAWA , who wrote VAWA , who got VAWA in there, the Violence Against Women Act. He made sure Indigenous women were included. Now we need him now. He spoke about the MMIW crisis at the State of the Union. He needs to come now and step up and see what's going on, on our rez.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Carissa and Kevin, I want to give you the last -\n\nERICA SHELBY : And it's happening on other rezes, too.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to give you the last word, as the parents of Mika. You are in the last day of the Mika Matters Walk. If you can talk about the significance of ending at the steps of the Lake County Courthouse? We just have about a minute.\n\nCARISSA HEAVY RUNNER : Yes. For me, personally, and I imagine for everyone else, it's going to say a lot, us walking from Arlee all the way to the outside of the courthouse, because we want to hold them accountable. They need to step up. They need to hear us and see us and the other families, hear their stories and the frustration, and not only them, but the world, to listen to our stories and feel our pain, see our pain, that we are trying to make a difference and change and hold those in charge accountable.\n\nKEVIN HOWARD : Lake County has -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Kevin?\n\nKEVIN HOWARD : Lake County has a long history of corruption and unfair blaming of Native Americans. And it's got to be - it's got to be fair and equal. So we're going to hold Lake County accountable. We're going to ensure that the Montana Highway Patrol is accountable. They have a long history of not investigating crimes against Native. If it was reversed, if it's a Native-on-white crime, those are heavily investigated, heavily enforced. So, there's a disparity there that needs to end. So, that's our goal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both. And again, our condolences to you both, Kevin Howard and Carissa Heavy Runner, parents of Mika Westwolf. And I want to thank Erica Shelby, tribal legal advocate for missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

I'm Amy Goodman, as we continue our Earth Day special by looking at how Indigenous people are protecting the Earth, as we follow the journey of Ivey Camille Manybeads Tso, an award-winning queer Navajo filmmaker whose new film shows how corporations like Peabody, the world's largest private coal company, have devastated her homeland. She also connects with Indigenous communities in Colombia, in the Philippines, in Mexico and at standing Rock in North Dakota facing the same types of struggles. This is the introduction to Powerlands .\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : My name is Ivey Camille Manybeads Tso. And this is Dinétah, also known as the Navajo Nation. My family can trace our history to 85 generations with this land. I began working on this film to document our community's struggle against resource colonization. Along the way, I found that we are not alone. This is a story of Indigenous people protecting and rebuilding.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Before we speak with Ivey Camille, this is another clip from Powerlands that features some of the Navajo elders and young land and water defenders in the film.\n\nLOUISE GOY : [translated] They want the land from me. They want to take away my livelihood, the sheep and horses. These are the ways they try to intimidate us. If a horse roams close to the house, they say we have to pay a fee.\n\nLAND DEFENDER : For a long time, people were terrorized with livestock impoundments, having their livestock being forcibly taken away. And, of course, that's traumatic for people, you know?\n\nSPIKE MANNING : They've done things where they've brought big trailers out here and have literally forced people into their homes, you know, with, like, guns. But for someone to point guns at elders and tell them to back up, and for them to just come in here and take what's theirs, you know, it's just not right. And, you know, it really hurts that people do that, you know?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Ivey Camille Manybeads Tso, whose new film Powerlands just won the award for Best Feature at the 2022 American Documentary and Animation Film Festival. She's joining us from Flagstaff, Arizona, where there's a massive wildfire burning very close to where she lives.\n\nIvey Camille, welcome to Democracy Now! Congratulations on your film. But before we talk about the film, can you talk about this fire, that's exploded right now in size, and if it threatens you and your community?\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah. So, the fire started, I believe, Tuesday. We got the alert. It was really rapid, within like 15 minutes. There were like four - three or four evacuation notices that came out, just like literally in rapid fire. You would, like, call somebody to check, and then there'd be another street that was being evacuated because of the massive winds that were happening.\n\nThe firefighters are doing incredible to try to keep, you know, as many homes safe as possible, but there's definitely been loss of homes and loss of property and loss of - just a lot of loss. You know, you hear stories about families who had a 1-year-old, and all they could grab on their way out the door was the child, you know, and so they've lost everything.\n\nBut this community really is incredible and helping everybody get together and stand together in it. On Tuesday, you know, I was out trying to help clear brush from places, especially with elders who had a hard time getting underneath their porches. But yeah, it's pretty close. It's moved a little bit further at the moment. But for about two days the sky was just full of smoke.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, your film is all about sustainability. And, in fact, this fire that's exploded to something like 20,000 acres, fanned by high winds and fueled by the dry grass that you're dealing with - Arizona and the other western states are suffering an unprecedented megadrought brought on by the climate emergency.\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah, and the desertification that's happened around here definitely can be tied directly into Peabody coal and BHP . They were pulling thousands and thousands of gallons of water out every day and, in doing so, made it so that the water resources down below are very depleted, which means that all the plant life is dying quickly, so there's a lot of brush for it to move. And then the winds, as I've heard from recent people, is just - they're going to keep staying this way. We're going to have high winds in this area due to climate change.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to go back to another clip of your award-winning film, Powerlands , on the resistance of Diné, of Navajo youth.\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Younger generations are returning to Dinétah, building unity and resistance.\n\nKIM SMITH : This lake, it's called Morgan Lake. It was built to cool down the power plant, which is one of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the country. They've extracted uranium. They extract oil and gas by fracking. They extract coal. All around, there is this resource colonization, this resource extraction.\n\nMAKAI LEWIS : An average person in Phoenix uses about 200 gallons per day, as far as domestic use. And a person in Big Mountain, they use about 12 gallons a day. You know, corporations and dirty politicians, they're all about money. You know, they want money, money, money, money. I'd like for these guys to have them try to eat money, you know, and see what happens to them; have them drink oil or drink water that's contaminated with oil, you know? I don't think they're going to last.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Ivey Camille, you deal with coal here. Talk more about the largest private coal company in the world, that people, particularly Native peoples, in Arizona are dealing with - Peabody - and the whole issue of how it has affected your livelihoods, your lives.\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah, well, I was born into the resistance out of Black Mesa. The matriarch of my family, May Tso [ phon. ], passed away in 2021 due to COVID . And, you know, we saw that throughout the rez. But so, I've grown up having it impact in my entire life. I grew up knowing about HPL versus NPL and what that meant, and what it meant to carry my name and carry that forward into the world, and how you need to hold yourself as an Indigenous woman, and as well as, you know, I was taught, being raised, that we are shepherds, that we do not own the Earth. We belong to the Earth. And so, in that sense, we have to make it better and continue doing so. And one of the ways to do that currently is to help stop climate change and to help stop this massive extraction of these very precious resources.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, before we move on to the global picture, I wanted to ask you about an issue you refer to in the film - you don't focus on it, but it's certainly one I'm sure you know. Earlier this week, Marketplace published an article titled \"A ban on Russian uranium could impact tribal communities in the Southwest.\" The article reports, \"Some U.S. lawmakers, unhappy with American nuclear power plants' reliance on imported Russian uranium, are pushing for a ban on those purchases. About 16% of the uranium that fuels the electricity-generating facilities comes from Russia, and an additional 30% is imported from Russia's partner nations Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. If the ban comes to pass, the U.S. uranium industry would have an opportunity to ramp up domestic mining. But many Indigenous communities are still reeling from the impact of the last U.S. uranium boom. On Navajo lands, for instance, there are more than 500 abandoned mines, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\" So, that was a report from Marketplace . But the residue of the impact that uranium mining has had on Indigenous communities, particularly the Navajo, the Diné, particularly the Hopi, in Arizona?\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah. I mean, I grew up knowing where the open pits - where they're just filled in with concrete. That's the only protection against them. The miners - the old miners would actually be given blocks, that weren't usable blocks but would still have radiation and uranium in them, and they would build their houses with it, so it would infect, you know, their wives, their children and generations on. So, we're still dealing with those. And all it is to stop those buildings is just a fence. And I've grown up seeing it. You know, we get taught knowing not to drink certain water sources because they are contaminated with uranium.\n\nAnd a lot of people don't have any options. You look at places like Cameron, where it has some of the highest radiation in the entire world, and it's like everyday people are living there and doing their things. And it's right off of 89, which right now is affected by the fire right. But there are tourists and people going through every single day, so it's not just affecting, you know, the Diné Nation. Like, it's affecting everybody who's passing through it. Any truck drivers, tourists, whatever, you're unwittingly and unknowingly being contaminated by these open pits and leftover radiation that we are still attempting to clean up and deal with.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, of course, these uranium tailings, highly carcinogenic. The issue of cancer in the Navajo and Indigenous communities in the Southwest, Ivey Camille?\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah, we're seeing a huge spike within cancer rates. There's issues with pregnancy. There's issues - there's so much that you can see. It's really - just without going into statistics, just looking around, you're seeing people get cancer who it doesn't normally pop up in our family bloodlines. You're seeing people losing certain, like, mental faculties quickly, like way faster than they should be, because of this radiation. You can see the effects all over the rez, and then even in outspreading, outlying areas, because they're also being contaminated. It's not just like contained in a city.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to continue on the theme of your film Powerlands after this break. We're talking to Ivey Camille Manybeads Tso, an award-winning queer Navajo filmmaker. Her film, Powerlands , just won the award for Best Feature at the 2022 American Documentary and Animation Film Festival. Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"In the River\" by Raye Zaragoza, as we continue our Earth Day special here on Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman. We're speaking with Ivey Camille Manybeads Tso, award-winning queer Navajo filmmaker, whose new film Powerlands just won a major award, follows her journey examining corporations like BHP , that have devastated her home, and connecting with Indigenous communities in Colombia, the Philippines, Mexico and Standing Rock facing the same struggles.\n\nWe're going to another clip from Powerlands now. We go to the peninsula of La Guajira in the northern tip of Colombia, close to the border of Venezuela. This is the site of the Cerrejón large open-pit coal mine owned by the U.K.-Swiss-Australian conglomerate of BHP Glencore. This is Ms. Eneida, who's been repeatedly displaced by Glencore, in the film Powerlands .\n\nENEIDA : [translated] They took away our water and our electricity. They took everything away, because we had to leave one way or another, taking things away from us to force us out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A clip from Powerlands . Tell us who Eneida is, as well as what is happening in Colombia now, Ivey Camille.\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah. So, really, Eneida and all of the women in the film are these matriarchs of these communities that's - in traditional Diné culture, we're a matriarchal society. So, they're the ones leading the resistance. They're the ones cooking the food. They're the ones holding these communities. They're the ones holding the space for it. So that's one of my favorite parts of the film, is seeing all these, like, really strong, incredible Indigenous women.\n\nAnd then, in Colombia - oh, shoot, I should have been more prepared - there's still resistance going on. There's a lot - there's a lot to be told about it, and really everywhere. I think, truthfully, the most important thing about the film to know is that it's for Indigenous people, by Indigenous people - or, an Indigenous person - and it's about showing this global scale, because it's Colombia, Oaxaca, Standing Rock, Black Mesa and the Philippines. All of these places seem so vast and far apart, but, truthfully, it's everywhere.\n\nThere were so many places that we reached out to that weren't ready to speak with us at the time, weren't ready to go there. And we are seeing them coming out with their stories now. But, truthfully, so many of these communities, like in Colombia, have no Wi-Fi. They don't have access to being able to reach out to other people. All of the energy is being sourced from these communities, but they get none of it for themselves. And so, having a film like this and showing it and having a way to be able to tell all of these communities, like, \"You're not alone. We're all here with you. And here are more forms of resistance. Here are more people continuing to fight. And, like, please, tell your own stories.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, it's amazing what you show in Colombia. You say the coal from that mine is shipped to Europe, about a third sent to the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas. The mine is taking over about 270 square miles of land, larger than the city of Chicago?\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about all the forms of resistance, from the food to the language, the art, the culture?\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Well, and I think in all of these Indigenous communities, the simple tasks are the ones that preserve our culture and our heritage, because there's a massive genocide going on. They are wanting to eradicate our voices. They want to eradicate our ways of life. They want to eradicate our culture. And so, continuously going out and listening to an elder speak, learning how to cook the traditional foods, learning how to make the traditional clothes, learning how to make the traditional tools are especially helpful going forward in this climate change, because we have obviously lived in extreme climates, and so we know how to farm in desert climates without using up all the water. There's lots of different resources that can go forward just in the Indigenous communities and Indigenous worlds.\n\nAnd I think that those simple things - you know, as a kid going out and listening to my grandma, I am so thankful for the moments that I got to have with her, because every time an elder dies, that entire lifeline of stories and everything dies with them. And so the more people who go out and hear those stories and document them, the more we will have for this preservation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, we're going to continue on your journey, Ivey Camille. Powerlands features the community of Bong Mal in the Philippines, in Mindanao, where Indigenous Earth defenders successfully forced out Glencore's copper mine, a gold-copper mine, in Tampakan in 2015. This is a clip.\n\nEARTH DEFENDER : [translated] The central part of our area here is where they planned to put a wastewater dam. I told our people here to listen to their hearts before allowing the mines in. We know what their intentions are: to seize our resources.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to continue on the journey and then have you put these two together, going from the Philippines to Mexico, to specifically to Oaxaca. In Powerlands , this is one of the Earth defenders, Ivey Camille, that you speak to.\n\nDOMITILLO VELAZQUEZ RODRIGUEZ : [translated] We've seen in other towns that, no, it's not true that wind projects bring benefits. And people realized that. And they decided to fight back with a resounding no. Why? Because we live off the ocean.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Zapatec and other Indigenous communities in the region have for years been resisting wind farm megaprojects that are displacing them from their ancestral lands. And that's particularly interesting as you fight for sustainability. We're talking about wind farms. Work your way backwards. Start here in Oaxaca, and then we'll talk about the Philippines.\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah. Well, one, that clip that you just played, being on set with that man was incredible. I don't speak Spanish, and so I was just feeling what he was feeling, and then getting translated afterwards. But the emotion, the care, the love that is in all of these is evident even without words from these communities. It's incredible.\n\nAnd, yeah, in Oaxaca, you're seeing a massive displacement that's going on. Without proper care and treatment of these wind farms, you're also seeing pollution entering water sources. You know, that's cutting off their food resources. So, what's really incredible about Oaxaca is they are doing the - oh, what's the actual - they are making their own community wind farm that's going to be held to higher standards and also will provide power to that community, because, again, these communities aren't being provided the power that they are giving to the rest of the world. Yeah, Oaxaca was incredible to see these people, so much color and light and everything coming out of it. I think that was one of my favorite places to film, because, without language, like, it was just incredible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And your time in Mindanao, your time in the Philippines, the struggle that is going on there?\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah. So, I was not able to go to the Philippines. My producer, who you've actually had on before, Jordan Flaherty, was there for the Philippines. But, really, it was incredible. Again, the same struggle, the same resistance. You're seeing these people, like, show these foods and these ancestral healing things that I know we have here on the reservation, and you're seeing in every single community we're going to. There's things to treat chronic cough. There's things to treat, you know, like, sore hands, bad backs, even stomach problems that we don't have currently going around. But when we listen to these Indigenous communities, you're finding out the root basic of a lot of the pharmaceuticals that we have also in those, where it originally comes from. And it's brilliant to see.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Ivey Camille Manybeads Tso, as you take us on this journey in this powerful film called Powerlands , talk about why you called it Powerlands . You've been doing this since you were 19. What started you on this path?\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yeah. So, yeah, we've been doing it for about eight years. What really started was - Jordan had been filming in Colombia. I was filming in Black Mesa. And we were looking at the parallels between them, and they're both affected by BHP . And, you know, if you took away the language, I would not tell the difference between Colombia and Black Mesa, besides maybe the monkeys. It is incredible. You know, growing up in Black Mesa, we would constantly have to be careful of, like, what day the mine was going or what things, because you would have the coal coming down and affecting clothing or affecting certain livestock. And it was the same stuff that we were hearing in Colombia. And that was really the beginning of this story, was seeing the parallels.\n\nAnd then, from there, Jordan went to the Philippines. While we were in Oaxaca, that's when I found out about Standing Rock, and so we went up to Standing Rock immediately afterwards. And Kim, who is one of the people featured in the film, was one of the first people to arrive at Standing Rock and set up there. And it's been cool to also see how that transition between communities and the collaboration that's been going. Even recently, Bettina [ phon. ] was in L.A. working with my composer, who's also been on the show, Daniel French, and was able to speak with him as he was making the soundtrack for the film. And it was really cool, because that influenced it, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Ivey Camille, you say, as you cover the resistance around the world, your film is part of that resistance. We have 15 seconds.\n\nIVEY CAMILLE MANYBEADS TSO : Yes, this film is for Indigenous people. You are not alone. We are here. And if anyone else learns something from it, great.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ivey Camille Manybeads Tso, award-winning queer Navajo filmmaker who directed the new film Powerlands , just won the award for Best Feature at the 2022 American Documentary and Animation Film Festival.\n\nFor more of our coverage on the climate catastrophe and the Indigenous struggle to protect the Earth - well, every day is Earth Day here at Democracy Now! - go to democracynow.org.\n\nOh, we have an immediate job opening for a news writer/producer.

Just four Republicans joined Democrats in voting to confirm Haaland, who will manage 500 million acres of federal and tribal land. Haaland will also oversee government relations with 574 federally recognized tribal nations and is expected to address the legacy of uranium mining on Indigenous land and other areas. Leona Morgan, a Diné anti-nuclear activist and community organizer, says that while it's \"impossible to expect one person to correct the centuries of racism and policy that have really devastated our people,\" there is hope that Haaland will use her power to make important changes. \"She will be held accountable,\" Morgan says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Deb Haaland is being sworn in today as secretary of the interior. She is a tribal citizen of the Laguna Pueblo. She becomes the first Native American ever to serve in a U.S. presidential cabinet. The two-term congresswoman from New Mexico was confirmed by the Senate Monday after four Republicans joined Democrats in voting to confirm her: Susan Collins of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.\n\nAs interior secretary, Haaland will manage 500 million acres of federal and tribal land. She'll also oversee government relations with 574 federally recognized tribal nations. During her confirmation hearing, Haaland vowed to work for everyone.\n\nREP . DEB HAALAND : If confirmed, I will work my heart out for everyone - the families of fossil fuel workers who helped build our country, ranchers and farmers who care deeply for their lands, communities with legacies of toxic pollution, people of color whose stories deserve to be heard, and those who want jobs of the future.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : One major issue facing Deb Haaland as interior secretary will be addressing the legacy of uranium mining on Native land and other areas. Thousands of inactive and toxic uranium mines have poisoned Native land and water for decades, many of the mines used to extract uranium for the U.S. massive nuclear arms arsenal. In 2019, a University of New Mexico study found that about a quarter of Navajo women and some infants had high levels of the radioactive metal in their bodies, even though nearby uranium mining had ended decades ago. Last year, Congressmember Haaland was recognized with a Nuclear-Free Future Award for her efforts to address the impacts of uranium mining in the Southwest.\n\nREP . DEB HAALAND : We've seen it firsthand in my home state of New Mexico. Uranium mining harms the health of our population, the environment, and has hurt our economy. The U.S. government has refused to clean up the mess they've made in New Mexico. In 2018, when I was elected, I knew this would be an issue that I would fight for. I've called on the U.S. government to clean up mining sites, compensate uranium workers and rectify the wrong that has been done to Indigenous communities. And I'm not going to let up. I'm committed to fighting for a nuclear-free future.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about Deb Haaland, the Interior Department and the legacy of uranium mining, we're joined by Leona Morgan in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Diné/Navajo anti-nuclear activist and community organizer, coordinator with the Nuclear Issues Study Group and organizer with Haul No!\n\nWe are here on Democracy Now! It's great to have you back, Leona. We did a broadcast with you when we were visiting Los Alamos several years ago. Thanks so much for being with us. Can you start off by responding to the history that Deb Haaland is making today, and then talk about the legacy of uranium mines and what you feel she needs to do?\n\nLEONA MORGAN : Thank you, Amy. It's so nice to be here. I appreciate the invitation.\n\nAnd yeah, Secretary Haaland has done a lot of good things in our state, and I think a lot of folks are satisfied with her performance as a congresswoman. However, you know, you can't please everyone. There are some situations where we do need more attention from Secretary Haaland. She's been excellent at dealing with some of the resource extraction, especially around Chaco Canyon, and also, like you mentioned, highlighting uranium as a core issue. And so, we are very happy. I, as an Indigenous woman, I am confident that she will do what she can as an Indigenous woman to protect our Mother Earth, but it's impossible to expect one person to correct the centuries of racism and policy that have really devastated our people since the beginning of the Department of the Interior, including genocide and relocation. So, we do hope that she can make some historic changes, and I think lot of people are depending on her. And she will be held accountable.\n\nAs for the uranium mines -\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Leona Morgan, for -\n\nLEONA MORGAN : Oh, thank you.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Leona, for those listeners who are not aware of the history of this issue, could you talk somewhat - this is going back to the 1940s that the Navajo Nation was used by the United States for uranium mining for nuclear weapons development. Could you talk about that history and the impact on the Native peoples of your state?\n\nLEONA MORGAN : Yes. So, there are actually 15,000 abandoned uranium mines across the country. And the Navajo Nation is working with the federal government to address at least 523 distinct mines on Navajo Nation. The most abandoned mines are in Colorado. And so, this is an issue that doesn't just affect Indigenous peoples, but everyone; however, uranium mining and production does impact Indigenous peoples and communities of color the most around the world. On Navajo, we have had many health issues resulting from the impacts of uranium mining, which, like you mentioned, started in the '40s. A lot of the mines on Navajo shut down in the early '80s. There is still mining in the country; however, there's no mining in New Mexico currently. And the Navajo Nation has a law against uranium mining and the transport of radioactive materials; however, those laws are always challenged, because there are privately owned lands within the nation and adjacent to the nation.\n\nAnd so, it's very difficult to stop uranium mining and the impacts, as the wind and the water carry contamination across the country without - you know, uranium does not discriminate, and, as people say, radiation does not discriminate. However, it does impact women and children the most. And with the mines shutting down in the early '80s, the cleanup that has begun in the early 2000s - let's say, 2008 was when the Navajo Nation started the first five-year cleanup plan with the U.S. agencies, working together. However, this cleanup is poorly funded, and it is not up to standards that would be acceptable in white communities.\n\nToday, we're dealing with, like I said, 523 abandoned mine sites, but a lot of the issues are the contamination to our water resources, which had implications, of course, with COVID -19. And right now this is one of the major issues, is the lack of water, the contamination of water. So, water quality and water quantity are big issues, because uranium mining was just one industry that impacted us. There was also a lot of impacts from the coal mining that occurred. And so, for the federal government to be depending on settlements from companies is just not enough. The federal government is the responsible party and needs to foot the bill for the mess that it made for its defense purposes and, you know, imperialism around the world.\n\nI work specifically on issues of nuclear colonialism, and right now we are also being targeted because of this idea that nuclear power is going to be a so-called solution to climate change. And people like Bill Gates are talking about new so-called small nuclear modular reactors, which still use uranium and still produce waste, which has - which there is no place to go. I'm sorry, the waste from nuclear power plants, there is no storage or disposal for this waste. And so, right now in New Mexico, we are being targeted with the world's largest nuclear waste storage for waste from power plants. This is all of the power plants in the United States. And New Mexico doesn't even have a power plant. They're saying, you know, to bring it here temporarily, which could be more than a hundred years. And this is not a viable solution for dealing with our national nuclear waste problem. So we need to stop making new nuclear waste. We don't need to continue mining uranium. And we need to stop using nuclear power. And so, Bill Gates is someone that's been talking about this a lot recently, and he does not live near an abandoned uranium mine. He doesn't live near a waste site.\n\nAnd so, these are issues that our people are still dealing with, over four decades after the uranium mining has stopped. We're finally getting attention, but the cleanup that's being proposed, like I said, it's poor quality. One example is in Church Rock, New Mexico, the site of the world's largest uranium spill. The proposal for cleanup there, it's actually in an open comment period right now. There's this idea that the company wants to scrape up mine waste at the Northeast Church Rock Mine and move it. A million cubic yards of mine waste, they want to pile on top of the mill waste, where the site - where the spill from 1979 originated. And the community is concerned because this is in a floodplain. And in the public meetings that were held in 2019, several community members expressed concern that this could result in a second Church Rock spill. But this is what they're proposing as cleanup, which is not cleanup. It is basically making 523 permanent waste sites on Navajo Nation.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in the context of that, your expectations in terms of what Secretary Haaland will be able to accomplish, given the fact that she is in charge of interior, but the cleanup is largely a responsibility of the EPA , isn't it?\n\nLEONA MORGAN : Well, on Navajo, it's five federal agencies working with Navajo Nation, and it is largely EPA Region 9 out of San Francisco. However, the EPA is putting out media that it's - you know, recently there was an article saying they had received over $200 million for cleanup. And some of the information that's being put out there is a little bit misleading - or a lot misleading, as according to Navajo Nation EPA Superfund director Dariel Yazzie. I had a long conversation with him about some of the cleanup and the proposals. And what he's saying is that Navajo has a very limited seat at the table when it comes to making decisions and enforcing our Navajo policy, as well as stronger cleanup standards.\n\nAnd so, we need Secretary Haaland to help to curb the startup of new mines and then also to work with the agencies. There's five federal agencies and the Navajo Nation doing this cleanup. But, like I said, that's only 523 abandoned mine sites, whereas there's over 15,000 in the whole country. And so, we really need federal dollars and better cleanup standards. Right now there's a 10-year plan that's being proposed, and some of the standards for the allowable levels of radiation are much higher than would be acceptable in, let's say, an urban environment or in a white community.\n\nAnd this is really going to impact our people, you know, as uranium and radiation cause health impacts. It takes a long time for these health impacts to show up. And so, right now we are experiencing a lot of the residual effects. One health study, called the Navajo Birth Cohort Study, has found high levels of uranium in newborn babies. And these are babies that are born across the reservation, not just near abandoned uranium sites. And so, we do need Secretary Haaland to push for comprehensive cleanup, as well as comprehensive health studies. And this is, specifically, I'm talking about Navajo Nation, but across the country, as well as protections for our sacred places, because a lot of our sacred places have been mined and are targeted for new mining.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Leona Morgan, we're going to continue to cover these issues in the months to come. Leona Morgan is a Diné/Navajo anti-nuclear activist and community organizer, coordinator with the Nuclear Issues Study Group and an organizer with Haul No!\n\nWhen we come back, a remarkable new podcast called Suave about a man sentenced to life in prison as a juvenile, and a journalist, Maria Hinojosa, who befriended him and chronicled his story, all the way to unexpected freedom.

He is also a member of The Red Nation and an assistant professor of Indigenous politics at the University of Toronto.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nToday is Earth Day, as we bring you Part 2 of our conversation with two Indigenous scholars, who've published a new book today, along with two dozen others, titled The Red Deal: Indigenous Action to Save Our Earth .\n\nIn Albuquerque, Melanie Yazzie is a co-founder of The Red Nation, a grassroots Indigenous liberation group, chair of the board of directors for Red Media, an imprint of Common Notions. The Red Deal is Red Media's first publication. Professor Yazzie is a citizen of the Navajo Nation. She's Diné. She's an assistant professor of Native American studies and American studies at the University of New Mexico. Then we head north, to Toronto. Uahikea Maile is with us, a Kanaka Maoli scholar, activist from Maunawili, O'ahu. He's also a member of The Red Nation, an assistant professor of Indigenous politics at the University of Toronto.\n\nThank you so much, both, for staying with us. President Biden is holding a two-day global Earth summit with some 40 world leaders. China is going to be a part of this conversation. You both, along with other scholars and activists, have proposed The Red Deal . Now, Senator Markey and Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have proposed the Green New Deal. They have many co-sponsors. They've reintroduced it. Professor Yazzie, if you could start by responding to the Green New Deal, what you think works in it, and what The Red Deal adds, as you talk about Indigenous action to save our Earth?\n\nMELANIE YAZZIE : Sure. Thanks again for having us on the show.\n\nSo, we - you know, The Red Nation sat down in early 2019 to read the Green New Deal and to try to think about what is the role of Indigenous people in the larger kind of vision for climate justice and addressing climate change, that is given to us or proposed in the Green New Deal. So, Indigenous people are mentioned twice in the Green New Deal as it currently stands. We're mentioned in relationship to environmental racism - right? - the disproportionate impact of things like resource extraction, pollution, climate disaster, those types of things. And we're also mentioned in relationship to treaties.\n\nAnd so, something that we talk a lot about in The Red Deal , that builds off of the Green New Deal, but perhaps expands it and creates a more comprehensive program that is not yet proposed or fleshed out in the Green New Deal, is around treaties, right? We talk a lot about how treaties are between human beings. They're between nations, between Indigenous nations and the United States. We know the history of treaty making in the United States is a history of broken promises - right? - the U.S. acting absolutely like a predator nation, never upholding treaties, right? A huge part of the land - the current Land Back movement, is kind of captivating Indigenous decolonization movements at the moment, is about honoring and upholding and enforcing treaties, giving treaty lands back - right? - talking about the Black Hills or other kinds of places in North America. And so, we talk a lot about how we need to enforce treaties as a sort of a baseline for kind of meeting Indigenous people in terms of our struggle for climate justice and what we have to say about it.\n\nAnd so, the Green New Deal does introduce that, or at least it centers it, I would say, in the way it talks about Indigenous people. I would say, however, that when - oftentimes the language around treaties, especially in the United States, people often talk about honoring treaties. And, you know, like, The Red Deal , we say we don't want to honor treaties; we want to enforce treaties, because if you're going to enforce treaties, you have to enforce Indigenous laws that are based on being in right relation with the Earth. And that needs to be a premise, right? That needs to be a premise for how we approach addressing climate change as a species.\n\nAnd so we're also talking about applying Indigenous governance, traditions and customary governance, as well as sort of like what undergirds those treaties from an Indigenous perspective, at a much larger scale than what I think is often thought of or that the Green New Deal proposes, right? In order to curb the actual threat that climate change presents to us - it's presenting it to us on a level of a species - right? - on a planetary level. So we believe that we can actually apply these Indigenous principles to a global scale, that we can truly build mass movements, because we believe that mass movements and mass mobilization are what's going to be required, you know, to make sure that we're around in 29 years, by the time the clock ends in 2050.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Professor Maile, in the introduction, you write, both of you write - you pose the question: In this era of catastrophic climate change, why is it easier for some to imagine the end of fossil fuel rather than the end of settler colonialism? You also - the book outlines a plan for collective climate action that can redress some of the problems that you outline. Could you explain what the principles are on which this collective climate action plan is based?\n\nUAHIKEA MAILE : Yeah, certainly. And thanks again for having us on this expanded conversation.\n\nSo, The Red Deal focuses on four main principles, which are clear, comprehensive, like Dr. Yazzie explained, and also pragmatic. This is a radically pragmatic program about Indigenous action to save our Earth, which is not exclusive, but is inclusive.\n\nSo, the first principle of The Red Deal is that what creates crisis cannot solve it. So, for instance, the greenwashing of the U.S. military, which is one of the largest polluters in the world - I believe that the U.S. military emits more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than 100 countries globally. So, introducing green technologies and the utilization of non-fossil-fuel sources and fuel products for the U.S. military is not going to change the ways in which U.S. imperialism transits all over the world in destructive and cataclysmic ways. And so, the idea that the U.S. military being a massive polluter of not just the atmosphere, but obviously the entire Earth, cannot be saved by simply greenwashing it, right? What creates the crisis cannot solve it.\n\nBut this is also true for police protecting property and capital, not people. Even convictions of cop killers can't protect us, as we just recently saw during the trial of Derek Chauvin, who brutally murdered George Floyd. There was a bevy of other police killings. Daunte Wright, Ma'Khia Bryant, these are two Black people in the United States that were murdered by police during a trial for a cop killer that murdered George Floyd about a year ago. What creates the crisis cannot solve it. Prisons disproportionately contain and exploit Black, Indigenous, racialized and poor people. Border Patrol and ICE don't keep us safe, but caged and controlled. And so, we propose, as a baseline, fundamental principle in The Red Deal that what creates not just climate crisis, but violence, cannot resolve it.\n\nThe second principle is that change must happen from below and the left. You know, capitalism is destroying this planet. Some scholars like to throw around the term the Anthropocene to mark the period of time in which human anthropogenic activity has overwhelmed the Earth and led to the current climate crisis that we're in. But other scholars refer to this as the Capitalocene, because this is essentially a period of time, since the preindustrial era, in which the capitalist mode of production, which is also relative to the ways in which consumption occurs, has overwhelmed this planet. And so it is not just all human beings that are destroying this planet. It is a very small amount of human beings that are destroying this planet. And we, in The Red Deal , identify them as the capitalists, the bosses, the fossil fuel polluters, the military, the imperialists. So, in order for change to happen, we see that it must occur from below and to the left, and thus we must destroy capitalism as a system of production, consumption, but also as an ideology. This means building people power, not power for corporations, like a cap-and-trade system would enable, or a carbon tax and pricing system, which just bolsters the financialization of the climate justice movement. But we see that this means building power for people, not corporations, or nonprofits.\n\nThe third principle is that politicians can't do what mass movements can. And my colleague and comrade Dr. Yazzie has already spoken to this. But in the book, we discuss how reform is a compromise. The Green New Deal is a compromise. We must no longer succumb to compromising on a dying planet. Nonreformist reform, which is what The Red Deal advocates for strongly, makes no compromises. So, in the case of the Green New Deal, which its two primary mentions of Indigenous peoples comes from, on one hand, marking Indigenous peoples as passive objects of climate change and global warming that simply experience the disproportionate effects of climate change and global warming, like rising sea levels that are drastically affecting Pacific Island nations, in Micronesia, in Hawaii, where I'm from. This is not the case. Peoples, Indigenous peoples all over the world are protecting their land, their resources, their more-than-human relatives.\n\nIn Hawaii, in 2019, there was a mass mobilization of Kanaka Maoli people to stop a technoscientific project called the Thirty Meter Telescope, which would be the 14th telescope observatory built on our sacred mountain Mauna Kea on Hawaii Island. Even as a technoscientific project that purports to progress mankind and humans by searching for origins of our being in the universe and planets outside of our solar system, that project to hunt for Earth analogs and to find alien life outside of our solar system, to lay conquest outside of our solar system, depends upon the conquest and colonization of our Earth, of Hawaii, of Mauna Kea. And in 2019, a recent iteration of the opposition to the Thirty Meter Telescope mobilized in mass, and we stopped this construction project, which is estimated at $2.4 billion, a multinational corporate project, of which U.S. universities, the Canadian federal government, multiple governments have invested in.\n\nAnd you know what? Across the way, on a different mountain, Mauna Loa, there is an observatory called the Mauna Loa Observatory, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency uses to measure how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere. So, recently, the Democracy Now! website posted a quick little article about how carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has reached an unprecedented level of 420 parts per million. That reading by NOAA was only possible because of the Mauna Loa Observatory's occupation of our sacred mountain, Mauna Loa, across the way from another sacred mountain. And so, we see that structural change must happen, not just simply compromise.\n\nAnd the last is our principle from theory to action. Liberation isn't just a theory. It's a right. And it's a right for people to act. And people have already acted on the ground And The Red Deal was born from that struggle, and it will continue to support that struggle on the ground.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask Professor Yazzie about the Standing Rock Sioux tribal historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who just recently died of brain cancer at the age of 64. Now, she co-founded the Sacred Stone Camp on her own property along the Cannonball River in North Dakota in April of 2016 to resist the Dakota Access pipeline. She said anyone who came to set up a teepee or a tent, she would give food to. She figured a couple dozen people would come. Soon thousands came from around the world. Democracy Now! travel to Standing Rock Labor Day weekend of 2016 at the height of the protests, and we stood with LaDonna Brave Bull Allard at the Sacred Stone Camp, just hours before the Dakota Access pipeline company unleashed dogs and pepper spray on Native water defenders seeking to protect a sacred tribal burial ground. This is what she said.\n\nLADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD : We say mni wiconi , water of life. Every time we drink water, we say mni wiconi , water of life. We cannot live without water. So I don't understand why America doesn't understand how important water is. So we have no choice. We have to stand. No matter what happens, we have to stand to save the water.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was LaDonna Brave Bull Allard. She was really our introduction to the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Professor Yazzie, if you can talk about what you understand about why President Biden said he was reversing a number of President Trump's decisions, who greenlighted Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline, one of his first acts in office; immediately, when President Biden came into office, he nixed the Keystone XL pipeline but hasn't done the same on DAPL , and what you think needs to happen there? And if you can also talk about what's happening with Oak Flat in Arizona?\n\nMELANIE YAZZIE : Sure. So, thank you for playing those beautiful words from LaDonna Brave Bull Allard. It broke my heart. I think it broke the heart of pretty much everyone across Indian Country when we found out a couple of weeks ago that she had passed on in her journey into the next world.\n\nYou know, something I've learned from the Indigenous women who have really led the grassroots movements that we draw from in The Red Deal , the grassroots Indigenous movements - right? - is that the scale - again, I'm going to talk about scale, right? It's not - climate - the Earth tells us, and Indigenous women who are caretakers, the primary caretakers of the Earth, customarily, in Indigenous nations, remind us that this isn't something that's just about us as individuals. It's not even necessarily something that's just about us as Indigenous people, but that the threat that we're facing is a species-level threat, right? It's an extinction-level event or an extinction-level possibility. And so, Indigenous women always remind us - right? - our primary responsibility as human beings in the here and the now is to caretake future - to caretake the Earth now to ensure future generations of life for - to ensure life for the future generations of all people and all life on this planet. So it's very much a life-based movement, which is why \"water is life\" - right? - \"life\" being the operative word, became such a rallying point and has continued to be a rallying point for Indigenous grassroots movements around climate change. And LaDonna was really central to that. So my heart goes out to her family.\n\nIn terms of Biden, you know, canceling KXL but not DAPL , I mean, you know, Biden's - his energy plan, I remember I was reading it back right before he was elected, and then his choice for Deb Haaland - right? - as the secretary of interior. He talked a lot about preserving 30% of public lands by 2030 - right? - reducing carbon emissions - this is why he's having his climate summit - banning fracking, for example, on public lands, which I'm assuming Haaland is going to be carrying out as the DOI secretary. I think the fact that he didn't cancel DAPL has to do with the fact that the transition from so-called dirty energy - right? - so, coal, the things that we talk about in Indigenous movements and view as resource extraction, we categorize as resource extraction - oil, uranium, gas, natural gas, coal - so that the transition from dirty energy to clean energy is one in which he still actually has to cater to the multinational corporations - right? - the billionaires who have actually caused a huge part of the climate disaster in the first place, because those corporations, whether it's ExxonMobil - right? - or Energy Transfer Partners, have already invested billions of dollars, because they see the transition to green energy and green capitalism as the newest source of profit. And so they're already abandoning kind of the dirty energy production line and heavily investing in the clean energy revolution that I think we're going to be seeing over the next four years. And so Biden actually still has to work with those companies.\n\nYou know, Obama - Biden was Obama's VP. Obama heavily subsidized the oil and gas industry, you know, at the beginning of his term as president, because he had to dig the United States out of the economic recession of 2008 and 2009. We're not necessarily in an economic recession right now. But the pandemic - right? - has done crazy things, has really had an impact on the U.S. economy. And so, I think you're going to have to see Biden pick and choose who he's working with in terms of energy corporations, because whether it's dirty or clean energy, it's still energy capitalism - right? - is the name of the game in the United States. And the people and the nations that face the brunt of the destruction of energy development are almost always Indigenous communities, often Black communities. And so, I think that's part of the reason to explain that.\n\nSo, the Oak Flat struggle just continues. I remember - you know, The Red Nation came into existence in late 2014, right about six months before kind of the first flare-up in the Save Oak Flat movement started in the summer of 2015, if people remember. So the struggle to save Oak Flat has actually been really central, I think, to the way Indigenous people have been mobilizing on the ground and framing our struggles over the last decade, as has Standing Rock, as has Unist'ot'en Camp against Coastal GasLink pipeline up in so-called Canada, right? And so, The Red Nation has really grown up alongside these types of movements and these uprisings like Oak Flat.\n\nYou know, the recent decision about the environmental impact statement regarding Oak Flat has been encouraging, but nevertheless, you know, the copper - copper, right? - the resource that is being tried - that Resolution Copper is trying to mine from that sacred land, for the San Carlos Apache, you know, that's copper. And copper is considered a clean energy source. And so this is what I'm talking about when it comes to Biden's clean energy, the transition from dirty to clean energy. Copper is considered a clean energy source. Yet Indigenous people are telling you very clearly that they do not consent to you mining, you know, copper from their sacred lands. So, are you going to mine copper to subsidize and to, you know, invest in the green energy boom that you're proposing to address climate change and kind of to reduce carbon emissions? Are you just going to, yet again, you know, violate Indigenous people and go and mine that copper anyway for this energy economy? And I think, you know, this is what Indigenous people force us to ask ourselves when we're talking about addressing climate change, when we're talking about reducing carbon emissions and global warming and addressing climate change. Are you going to keep violating our consent? Because we keep telling you \"no,\" and you keep doing it, right? And so, these are some of the larger questions I think we need to consider when we're thinking about clean energy. And the Oak Flat struggle will continue, I think, to be a really important element of the Indigenous kind of contribution and leadership in the climate justice movement to come.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Professor Maile, we'd like to end by going back to your book, The Red Deal: Indigenous Action to Save Our Earth . Could you talk about how this is a global fight, as well, the alliances between Indigenous populations and climate justice activists, from Native populations around the world, and their commitment to both climate justice in the form also of decolonization?\n\nUAHIKEA MAILE : Yes, certainly. So, as we've talked already, and my colleague Dr. Yazzie explained earlier, you know, Indigenous people have been fighting environmental injustice since 1492. This is a centuries-long struggle for us as Indigenous peoples. But in 2018, when climate scientists agreed that emissions and warming would reach dangerous levels in 2030, giving us sort of 12 years left to do something, for us, the path forward was clear. It's decolonization or extinction. And land back is the soundest environmental policy.\n\nIndigenous peoples, despite making up 5% of the global population, protect 80% of the Earth's biodiversity. So climate policy should follow the leadership of those most affected, most experienced by and with climate change, not politicians in the command seat of governments causing it. And so what that means for coalitions and alliances between climate scientists, environmental activists and Indigenous peoples is that Indigenous movements stand against extractive colonial projects, not just extractive projects, but identifying their colonial, settler colonial and imperialist structure as extractive projects, while at the same time encouraging action for caretaking relations to protect the Earth and all inhabitants of it, human and more than human.\n\nThis means what we say in The Red Deal , which is that The Red Deal is a program for Indigenous action to save our Earth. And so, this is an intervention into the kind of liberal environmentalist analysis and also activism that is currently taking place on the ground, which doesn't just exclude Indigenous peoples and nations, but, as my colleague Dr. Yazzie said, actually can contribute to settler colonialism and imperialism, not just in the Global North, but in the Global South, as well, in Oceania and beyond. And so, The Red Deal posits that the Global North - in particular, the U.S. and Canada - isn't a leader in climate justice, but actually a leader in climate imperialism.\n\nAnd so The Red Deal makes clear that climate policy must be anti-imperialist. And this means ending sanctions against countries and peoples in the Global South, ending the externalization of climate debt from the North to the rest of the world, right? If the Global North has been the largest hemispheric polluter of the atmosphere and of the planet, then why is it that its debt gets externalized onto countries and peoples that have not committed the same kinds of cataclysmic emissions? This is what climate debt refers to. And we find this a very important coalition to align with countries and peoples from the Global South that are experiencing very similar things that Indigenous peoples are experiencing on a larger transnational scale.\n\nAnd so, this is why the Red New Deal is not only unapologetically Indigenous, but it's unapologetically anti-imperialist, because this is what it means to resist extinction and to work towards decolonization. Decolonization is not a passive project. It is not just decolonizing the mind. It's decolonizing the Earth. It's land back for Indigenous peoples. It's transforming nation-states so that its governance system does not reflect imperialist, neoliberal policies, but reflects the traditional ecological knowledge of Indigenous peoples, where they are, for who they are. And so, this is what it means to decolonize. And this is what The Red Deal purports to actively provide a program that is not just revolutionary, but also pragmatic.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And although we said \"finally\" once, one last \"finally\" for Professor Yazzie. As we sit here now, the first Native American woman heads the Department of the Interior. She is a sister Indigenous leader, like you, from New Mexico. You're at the University of New Mexico. The significance of Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet member, as well, and what your expectations are, Professor Yazzie?\n\nMELANIE YAZZIE : Yeah, in The Red Nation - you know, Deb Haaland, when she was in Congress, she represented my district, and I voted for her, because her district is in Albuquerque. And, you know, I think everyone, especially Native women, in The Red Nation are - and we have a lot of Pueblo women - right? - because she's from Laguna Pueblo - in The Red Nation were incredibly thrilled - right? - when she became a congresswoman and then was chosen as the secretary. You know, and we call her \"Ko'o Deb,\" which is \"Auntie Deb.\" In The Red Nation, that's how we address her and talk about her, in a very endearing way. And so, we got her back. You know, we know what she's facing.\n\nI wrote an op-ed for Gizmodo, Earther, I think it's called, about a couple of months ago, and I talked about the significance of Deb Haaland's appointment as the secretary of interior. And I think, for me, you know, I think about it from the perspective of somebody who's in the movement, right? So I'm an Indigenous woman, but I'm also somebody who's really invested in building movements rather than appealing - right? - to ruling-class politicians in these kinds of positions of power. And so, Deb Haaland - right? - just was - 2019 was the year of the Native woman. I think it was on Time magazine or something like that. And so, Deb Haaland's rise to power in this position is really because of Indigenous women's leadership in grassroots movements, right? It wasn't like some sort of happenstance that she was chosen. I mean, I think Indigenous people have been on the move. But what I'm trying to say is - and this also has to do with AOC proposing the Green New Deal, and she talked about how her successful bid for Congress herself started on the ground in Standing Rock - right? - and was kind of informed by those values. And so, what we're arguing in The Red Deal , and what I think Deb Haaland's appointment reflects, is the strength and the influence of movements themselves, not necessarily voting - right? - not necessarily policy reform, but the movements themselves that have advanced the voices and the strength and the leadership of Indigenous women. And so I think she's sort of a contemporary result of that.\n\nThat said, you know, she's at the head of a department of the United States government that is tasked with two things that have been contradictory, I would say, over the past 10 to 15 years, that have actually created the context for a lot of the uprisings we've seen to protect sacred sites against resource extraction, against oil pipelines, right? The Department of the Interior is tasked with mediating the federal government's relationship with Indigenous nations. That's one of its tasks. One of its other tasks is managing federal or public land, right? And so, what has happened - right? - under Obama and under Trump - Trump actually continued and expanded Obama's energy policy, particularly around fracking - is that the Department of the Interior has mediated and negotiated all the leases for fracking. And so, what that has meant is that a lot of that public land that has been leased out for resource extraction and energy development has actually encroached upon tribal sovereignty and the ability of Native people in communities like Eastern Navajo in northwestern New Mexico, and even, in some case, Deb Haaland's community, Laguna Pueblo, you know, from being able to just live on the land. The land is so heavily polluted and destroyed, not to mention man camps and the increasing numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and people - right? - that attend resource extraction. And so, the policy that has been really consistent around leasing out public lands for energy development has also created intense, repetitive violations of tribal sovereignty. So the DOI is not able to actually fulfill both of its primary functions. And so Deb Haaland inherits this - right? - as she enters the Department of the Interior.\n\nAnd I think it's important for her to - it's going to be difficult, right? - but for her to understand that the Indigenous movement right now is being kind of reformulated and regalvanized around land back. And what Native people mean by \"land back,\" we literally mean we want land back. And a lot you're going to see out of these movements, and we already have, that the primary target right now to begin kind of a larger mass - comprehensive mass land return project is going to be targeted at public lands. David Treuer, an important Anishinaabeg writer, came out with an article in The Atlantic - I think it was just last week or the week before - about how we should return national parks to the stewardship of Indigenous nations, right? That's going to be the first of many appeals and many movements you're going to see from Indigenous people at the grassroots level, that land return needs to start with public lands, because, of course, we know that public land in the United States is stolen land, because that land was born of dispossession, as is private property. But Deb Haaland has jurisdiction and kind of dominion over public lands. And so, how is she going to respond to this Land Back movement, that I - you know, I predict will only continue to grow? So, she's in a difficult position trying - she inherits those contradictions. But she also is in this position partly because of these types of movements. So, we'll just have to see what happens, you know, in the years to come.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both so much for joining us, Melanie Yazzie and Uahikea Maile, new book, The Red Deal: Indigenous Action to Save Our Earth .

Echaquan started live-streaming her experience on Facebook as her pain escalated, and staff at the hospital appeared indifferent to her pleas for help.\n\nIn the footage, Echaquan is seen grimacing as nurses call her \"stupid as hell\". \"Are you done acting stupid? Are you done?\" asked one nurse in French as Echaquan moaned in pain.\n\n\"You made some bad choices, my dear,\" another nurse said. \"What are your children going to think, seeing you like this?\"\n\n\"She's good at having sex, more than anything else,\" the first nurse said.\n\nIndigenous leaders say the video exposes the grim realities of systemic racism that have long gone ignored throughout the country.\n\n\"Discrimination against First Nations people remains prevalent in the healthcare system and this needs to stop,\" the Assembly of First Nations national chief, Perry Bellegarde, said in a statement.\n\nThe Quebec premier, François Legault, condemned the actions of the staff, telling reporters at least one of the nurses had been fired.\n\nBut the premier rejected the notion that Echaquan's death was representative of a broader problem of racism within Quebec, despite a public inquiry concluding the opposite .\n\n\"I really don't think we have this kind of way of dealing with First Nations people in our hospitals in Quebec,\" he said.\n\nThe province's coroner office has announced an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Echaquan's death. The local health board is also investigating.\n\n''We will not tolerate any remarks of that type from our personnel,\" the board said in a statement.\n\nMarc Miller, federal Indigenous services minister, extended his condolences to the community who were traumatized by the \"gut-wrenching\" video.\n\n\"This is the worst face of racism,\" Miller told reporters. \"This is someone who is at their most vulnerable. And they are dying, having heard racist words expressed towards them.\"\n\nContrary to remarks by Legault, however, Miller said Echaquan's death was reflective of broader barriers Indigenous peoples still face in Canada.\n\n\"This is not an isolated event,\" said Miller, pointing to the case of a hospital in British Columbia, where staff allegedly bet on the blood alcohol content of incoming Indigenous patients.\n\nFor those who have experienced similar treatment to Echaquan's, the video marked a jarring reminder of the inequities present within the country's healthcare system.\n\n\"I'm not sure I can adequately explain how watching the video of #JoyceEchaquan's last moments is weighing on me. As an Indigenous woman w/ chronic illnesses the treatment she endured is my ultimate fear,\" tweeted Frances Elizabeth Moore, an Anishinaabe activist and community worker from Timiskaming First Nation living in London, Ontario.\n\n\"I always need to advocate for myself. At times, I've brought others to appointments b/c I did not feel safe going alone. This isn't new. This isn't unheard of. You just haven't been listening. I hope some serious reform comes from Joyce's heroic actions. Rest well sister.\""

      "text": "Indigenous woman alleges she was subject to torture and inhuman treatment in ACT prison\n\nJulianne Williams will tell court she was forcibly strip-searched despite informing guards she couldn't breathe and was experiencing pains in her chest\n\nAn Indigenous woman will this week allege in court that she was tortured and treated in a \"cruel\" and \"inhuman\" way by prison officers who pinned her down, forcibly strip-searched her while holding a knife, and ignored screamed warnings that she couldn't breathe and was experiencing chest pains.\n\nThe ACT supreme court will on Monday begin hearing disturbing allegations about the treatment of Ngunnawal woman, Julianne Francis Williams, while on remand in the territory's only adult prison in early 2021.\n\nThe territory government has kept handheld camera footage of the incident secret, rejecting an earlier request from the Guardian for its release through freedom of information laws and arguing for its suppression in earlier court hearings .\n\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\n\nCourt documents show that Williams, who has consented to being identified , had been moved to the jail's crisis support unit due to her distress at a decision refusing her leave to attend her grandmother's funeral.\n\nA guard noticed her put something down her pants and assumed, wrongly, it was a weapon or other contraband. Williams was, in fact, menstruating and had placed sanitary tissues down her pants.\n\nA team of officers decided to use force to strip-search her. Before they entered the cell, Williams says she was lying on her bed in a \"calm state\".\n\nShe had a pacemaker for a heart condition and a collapsed lung, according to court documents. Prison authorities allegedly knew about her medical conditions, but did not bring a nurse or doctor with them.\n\nWilliams was pinned down. Officers discussed using a knife to cut her clothes off. According to transcripts of the recordings of the incident, one officer asked colleagues \"who's got the knife?\", prompting another to reply: \"I do\".\n\nThe first officer then said to Williams: \"If you comply, I'll get them [your clothes] off you and we'll get this over and done with.\"\n\nWilliams yelled that she couldn't breathe and was experiencing pains in her chest. She alleges this did nothing to interrupt the search.\n\nThe court documents allege two male officers were in the \"immediate vicinity\" of Williams' cell as the strip search was carried out, though a previous report into the incident found \"the search did not occur in front of male officers\".\n\nIt was also watched live in the jail's operation room via CCTV, the court documents allege. The court documents say that Williams agreed to comply if the knife was not used, and she was then taken to a bathroom with two female officers.\n\nThe incident was recorded on a handheld camera. Last year, the Guardian used freedom of information laws - with Williams' consent - to apply for release of the footage. The application argued the release of the footage was clearly in the public interest, given it depicted the alleged mistreatment of an Indigenous Australian behind bars.\n\nThe government rejected the request. It said the footage could not lawfully be disclosed due to secrecy laws related to the ACT's prison facilities, and feared the vision would reveal the identities of prison officers, despite the Guardian indicating a willingness to have their faces blurred.\n\nThe ACT supreme court has also previously suppressed the footage after it was tendered during a bail application made by Williams and her lawyers, Ken Cush and Associates.\n\nIn 2021, the ACT's Inspector of Correctional Services (ICS) released a report finding the search was \"not a last resort as required\" and did not comply with the territory's Human Rights Act. The inspector reviewed the footage of the incident and recorded that the woman had told officers she \"cannot breathe\" at various times while detained.\n\n\"During the use of force there are up to 12 staff in the immediate vicinity, some at times enter the cell, and others stay by the door or in the corridor outside the cell,\" the report said.\n\nWilliams is arguing the search breached her rights under the territory's Human Rights Act - including her rights to not be tortured or be treated in a cruel, inhuman, or degrading way - and is seeking a declaration from the court to that effect.\n\nThe ACT's prison, known as the Alexander Maconochie Centre, is supposed to be human rights-compliant.\n\nJulie Tongs, chief executive of Canberra's Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services, said:\n\n\"The ACT Labor/Greens government should be ashamed of themselves. They hold themselves up as the most progressive government in Australia - definitely not when it comes to Aboriginal issues. It's a huge fail.\"\n\nThe ACT government is expected to argue that many of Williams' allegations were not supported by the evidence. It will also argue that, for something to constitute torture, the ill-treatment must reach a minimum level of severity.\n\nIt will argue that the term \"torture\" is reserved for the deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering.\n\n\"It has been held that interrogation involving 'stress positions', full-time 'hooding', continuous loud noises, sleep deprivation, and deprivation of food and drink did not amount to 'torture',\" the government argues in an outline of its opening argument."

      "text": "'Dead because she was Indigenous': Québec coroner says Atikemekw woman a victim of systemic racism\n\nHospital staff assumed Joyce Echaquan was an opioid addict. She was dying of a rare heart condition\n\nAn Indigenous woman who was taunted by nursing staff as she lay dying in a Quebec hospital would probably be alive today if she were white, a coroner has concluded.\n\nThe death of Joyce Echaquan was an \"undeniable\" example of systematic racism in the province, the Québec coroner Géhane Kamel told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"From the first minute she entered the hospital, a label was placed on Ms Echaquan,\" she said.\n\nIn September 2021, Echaquan, 37, entered a hospital in Joliette, where she told staff she had a heart condition. As her pain escalated and staff appeared indifferent to her pleas for help, Echaquan started livestreaming her experience on Facebook.\n\nIn the footage, she grimaced as nurses call her \"stupid as hell\". \"Are you done acting stupid? Are you done?\" asked one nurse in French as Echaquan moaned in pain.\n\n\"You made some bad choices, my dear,\" another nurse said. \"What are your children going to think, seeing you like this?\"\n\nEchaquan, an Atikemekw mother of seven, died of pulmonary oedema linked to a rare heart condition.\n\n\"Without the video, Ms Echaquan would never have been heard. This observation sends chills down the spine,\" said Kamel.\n\nThe coroner determined that medical staff assumed Echaquan was experiencing opioid withdrawal and thus failed to properly evaluate the medications she was taking. They also ignored the symptoms she described, including heart palpitations.\n\nKamel concluded that Echaquan's initial diagnosis was based on prejudice and that she was not properly monitored before staff transferred her to intensive care.\n\nKamel told reporters that she believed Echaquan would be alive today if she were white, adding that \"large sections of our society deny such a well-documented reality\" that systemic racism is pervasive.\n\nDespite Kamel's recommendation that the provincial government recognise systemic racism, the premier, François Legault, steadfastly denied that systemic racism exists in the province. Legault said he was \"shocked\" by Echaquan's \"unacceptable\" treatment - but he denied it was an example of systemic racism.\n\n\"Is the entire education system, or health system racist? I believe the answer is no,\" Legault said. \"But it's possible that at certain places, there are employees, groups of them, who have discriminatory approaches. But to say that the entire system is racist, I can't accept it.\"\n\nEchaquan's family have said they intend to file a lawsuit against the hospital.\n\n\"She was judged and not listened to and treated accordingly,\" the family's lawyer, Patrick Martin-Ménard, told reporters. \"It's clear to us that we have all the evidence.\"\n\nDetails of the lawsuit are expected in the coming days.\n\nCarol Dubé, Echaquan's husband, said he was committed to changing a system that discriminates against Indigenous families - and one that he believes judged his wife for having had multiple children.\n\n\"Joyce is dead because she was Indigenous,\" he said. \"A woman with seven marvellous children - what she had that was most beautiful was used against her in a system that still allows this kind of tragic situation to happen.\""

Walz can continue serving as the state's governor until the November election, but if he and Harris are successful, Flanagan will take over his gubernatorial duties.\n\nIn fact, a series of firsts would be triggered should the Harris-Walz ticket win: Harris would become the nation's first woman, first Black woman and first person of Indian descent to ascend to the country's top office. Flanagan, already the highest-ranking Native woman in a state-level executive office, would become Minnesota's first female governor and the first Indigenous woman to serve as governor of a US state. And Minnesota's senate president, Bobby Joe Champion, would become Minnesota's first Black lieutenant governor.\n\nConsidered an advocate for children, working families and Indigenous communities, Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, has had a tenure as lieutenant governor that reflects her support for historically marginalized Minnesotans.\n\nIn June, Flanagan and Tina Smith, a US senator, announced the first international United States Department of Agriculture trade mission focused on amplifying Indigenous products. Flanagan advocated for free breakfast and lunch in Minnesota schools, which Walz signed into law in March 2021. And in 2019, Walz signed a bill, of which Flanagan was a champion, to launch the first official meeting of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Task Force.\n\n\"Too often native women at best are invisible and, at worst, we are disposable,\" Flanagan has said. \"That must and that will change.\"\n\nFlanagan also advocated to establish the country's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office, which Walz signed into law legislation in 2021. And last December, Flanagan was voted in as chair of the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association (DLGA), becoming the first Indigenous woman to lead a party committee.\n\n\"Our democracy functions best when it accurately reflects the community and seeks to represent,\" Flanagan said at the time . \"And so for a very long time, women, people of color, Indigenous folks were not at decision-making tables, and too many decisions were made without us. I think if we're going to have strong policies and strong outcomes for communities, women and Bipoc folks need to be at the table.\"\n\nFlanagan, a former Minneapolis school board member, a previous staffer at Greater Minneapolis Council of Churches' division of Indian work, and a past executive director of Children's Defense Fund-Minnesota, successfully ran for the state's house of representatives in 2015 . In 2017, she became a founding member of the state's first People of Color and Indigenous Caucus, according to her official bio.\n\nAs a University of Minnesota student, Flanagan organized the urban Indigenous community for Paul Wellstone's 2002 US Senate campaign. She graduated from the university that year with a degree in American Indian studies and child psychology.\n\nJust two days after Biden bowed out of the 2024 race, Flanagan hosted the first Native American campaign event for the Harris for President campaign.\n\n\"Great Native Voters for Harris event in Phoenix! Arizona may decide the election, but one thing is for sure: Native voters will decide Arizona,\" Flanagan wrote on X. \"In a packed room, I was honored to kick off the first-ever surrogate event for Harris 2024 in the country! Let's go, @KamalaHarris!\"\n\nLater she spoke during a Native women and Two Spirit for Harris virtual call, which connected Indigenous leaders and people from across the country in rallying behind the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"I think Native voters are going to make the difference again,\" Flanagan said on the call. \"We are strategically located in swing states all across the country, and I know that when Indian Country shows up, we win.\""

      "text": "Lupita: the powerful voice of one indigenous woman leading a movement\n\nFilm-maker Monica Wise talks about making her documentary on Mexican indigenous resistance\n\nO ur latest Guardian documentary tells the story of Lupita, a courageous young Tzotzil-Maya woman at the forefront of a Mexican indigenous movement. Over twenty years after Lupita lost her family in the Acteal massacre in southern Mexico, she has become a spokesperson for her people and for a new generation of Mayan activists. She balances the demands of motherhood with her high-stakes efforts to re-educate and restore justice to the world. The film-maker Monica Wise talks to us about her experience making the film.\n\nI was inspired by this historic movement led by indigenous women. I'd spent time in Latin America since childhood and that helped shape my understanding of injustice. I'd learned about the EZLN in college, but I wanted to know what was behind the Zapatista spectacle, and Lupita captivated me with her discourse and strength. I knew immediately that she could be the one to tell the story of 500 years of indigenous resistance, in a contemporary Mexican political context, to a global audience.\n\nI teamed up with a local journalist, Eduardo \"Lalo\" Gutiérrez Pérez, who heads up the communication team for Las Abejas de Acteal , Lupita's organisation. Lalo was thankfully eager to collaborate and had footage from Marichuy's tour as well as many other demonstrations during the last few years. Lalo produced and shot the film with me, and translated the Tsotsil to Spanish.\n\nSince 2017, I'd spent several weeks, then months in Chiapas getting to know Lupita and her family. The most memorable shoot was our first one: Lupita speaking to a vast audience in that Oventic Zapatista caracol. When Lupita took to the stage with her powerful speech, she began in Tsotsil and continued in Spanish: \"My words are true because I lived it, I wasn't told about it, I was present ... So it's not hard for me to believe that injustices like these continue around the world.\" Many in the audience talked about her for days after: \"What a force\", \"She's the survivor of Acteal\" ...\n\nI went back and forth between a slow-paced and lyrical portrait (like the Mexican documentaries Tempestad, A Morir a los Desiertos, Kings of Nowhere ) and a more informational, faster cut (while still driven lyrically), which Mar Jardiel, my final editor, recut in an impressive two weeks. The idea was to put a viewer in Lupita's reality for a few moments, whether you are a Mexican who remembers the Acteal massacre, or an international viewer who had never heard of Zapatistas. And we had to keep it short!\n\nI wanted to use Super 8 film from the beginning and to make a film somewhat from Lupita's point of view to begin to understand who is the woman, the mother, behind the vocera, or the spokeswoman, of her community. The past still hangs over Acteal, where the community continues to hold ceremonies to remember the 45 victims, or martyrs, of the massacre every month. Every time I walked into the community, I'd enter a different world, with different timing, in another language. So the textured film felt fitting to represent this.\n\nWe made the film so that Lupita's voice could be heard, reach new and international audiences, and raise awareness of Lupita and her community's struggle. There has been no justice for the Acteal massacre, the attack by paramilitaries that killed 45 people in Lupita's home town in 1997, including her mother and father. Those who ordered the killings have not been held accountable. The Mexican government recently offered an amicable solution, or solución amistosa, or reparations to a group of survivors with the pretence of justice being served. Las Abejas de Acteal continue to demand a report from Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and will not rest until justice is served in court. They believe this can only happen internationally.\n\nI know work on the film isn't finished until it gets to the right people, those who tell their own story in the film, so we're fundraising and planning a tour in the highlands with Lupita, Lalo and the Abejas organisation for later in 2021. You can join us here .\n\nOur first and only live theatre screening was in Kinoki, the only local theatre in San Cristobal de las Casas, in December 2019. Several members of the crew came, the theatre was packed, and the film received a great response. It was there, with the applause and appreciative Q&A, that I think Lupita realised that her message would be valued locally and around the world, that her sacrifices and all the uncomfortable time behind the camera would be worth it when her message could affect more people.\n\nA few weeks later, on the anniversary of the Acteal massacre, Lupita and Lalo presented it to the Abejas community in Acteal, in a stadium filled with survivors and also Tsotsil youth who didn't know much about their history.\n\nThen Covid hit and we had the world premiere with the Ambulante film festival [the Mexican travelling film festival founded by Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna] in May 2020, which was moved online. It seemed to resonate here in Mexico above all, even for those who didn't know much about the history, and this is another achievement.\n\nThe film had its international premiere online as part of the Sheffield documentary film festival and recently had its New York premiere at Doc NYC . And we won best documentary in the emerging category at the March on Washington international film festival. Our in-person screenings list can be found here.\n\nAbout the film-maker\n\nMonica Wise Robles is a Colombian American documentary filmmaker and journalist based in Mexico City. Much of her work focuses on women's rights in Latin America, exposing human rights abuses through the eyes of female survivors. Lupita , her first short documentary, about a Tsostil Maya activist, is part of the official selection for the following festivals: Ambulante, Sheffield Doc/Fest, Doc NYC and FICG official selection. She is an International Women's Media Foundation, Ford Foundation and Sundance Film Institute grantee. Monica's work can be seen in the Guardian, the Intercept, the Atlantic, the Washington Post, PBS and the BBC, among other outlets.

      "text": "Indigenous women are preyed on at horrifying rates. I was one of them\n\nTwenty-seven years ago I almost ended up a grim statistic, like so many Indigenous women and girls. It's still happening\n\nI was a missing Indigenous girl who beat the odds. Now I'm a journalist and I won't shut up about a genocidal crisis happening in Canada .\n\nI spent my childhood in and out of foster homes. It was a cold and lonely system.\n\nAt age 12 I ran away from a group home with two other girls. It was freedom, or so I thought. I don't even remember exactly how many days I was missing for. Each day blurred into the next.\n\nAt one point two men in their late 20s held me hostage at a downtown apartment in Edmonton, Alberta, where they raped me several times.\n\nAfter fighting for my life for several days, I escaped and fled to the safety of my Kohkum's (grandmother in the Cree language) home.\n\nI didn't tell her of the horrors I experienced. I was in shock. I just wanted to appreciate being with her, feeling loved and safe until I had to return to the woes of the system.\n\nI felt so guilty. I thought what happened to me was my fault because I ran away. I did tell a group home worker I was raped, but nothing was ever done.\n\nThat was 27 years ago. I could've ended up a grim statistic.\n\nIn Canada, Indigenous women and girls are targeted for violence more than any other group. They are 12 times more likely to go missing or be killed.\n\nEvery time I read a headline about Missing or Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) I'm reminded of what could've been. I could've been them, and they could've been me.\n\nAs a survivor I feel obligated to help alleviate some of the agony experienced by the families of MMIWG, other survivors and potential victims of this genocide.\n\nThis crisis has been going on for decades, according to government and police records. If we're honest, however, it's been happening since 1492.\n\nWhite male colonizers raped Native women at epidemic rates and justified their actions because Indigenous peoples were labelled savages and less than human.\n\nThe UN high commissioner for human rights has recognized that the basic inequalities that exist between Indigenous peoples and the rest of Canada are a glaring reminder of the Canadian state's failure to overcome systemic racism, the intergenerational trauma of colonialism and the inadequate provision of specialized services and programs for each community.\n\nMissing Indigenous females are often discriminated against by authorities and labelled \"just an Indian, out partying, on a drunk, or a runaway\".\n\nMost are or have spent time in the foster care system, like me. Many are forgotten and left for dead.\n\nLast month, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) refused to issue an amber alert for 14-year-old Molly Martin, a First Nations girl who disappeared in the company of a 47-year-old man. Her former foster father Darcy Doyle, a white, non-Indigenous man with an extensive criminal record, brought her to a wooded area near Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.\n\nLocal First Nations leaders pleaded for government authorities to issue an amber alert, arguing that Martin's life was in imminent danger. Apparently police didn't believe she was in enough danger to issue an amber alert. I believe it's because she's Indigenous.\n\nHer community, the We'koma'q First Nation, offered a $5,000 reward for her safe return. They searched day and night for her.\n\nMartin was found safe on 22 August and surely has a painful healing journey ahead.\n\nMartin's situation made me think of Tina Fontaine, 15, who was murdered and dumped in the Red River in Winnipeg in 2014. She was Cree, and also a lost child in the system. Her death sparked outcries from across Canada for the issue of MMIWG to be addressed.\n\nLast year I visited Fontaine's grandmother's home, north of Winnipeg, where Fontaine once lived. Being there, learning first-hand about her, seeing her childlike face framed on the walls, sent chills up my spine and broke my heart. She reminded me of myself at that age.\n\nHer accused killer, who was 57 at the time, was found not guilty and walked away a free man. He is white.\n\nA national inquiry into MMIWG first named this crisis a genocide in 2019. In June 2019, Justin Trudeau stood solemnly in front of a few hundred survivors and families at the release of the final report of the inquiry. The prime minister promised to do whatever it took to dismantle the violence ravaging our women and girls.\n\nAn action plan was due in June 2020. The government has postponed it, citing Covid-19. We're still waiting.\n\nOutsiders often have a utopian view of Canada as a strong and free nation that upholds human rights. In reality, the federal government has continually stalled investment in resources to address the genocide of MMIWG and other oppression experienced by Indigenous Peoples. Yet Trudeau easily found billions of dollars to secure a pipeline expansion project.\n\nIronically, industry projects like pipelines are part of the problem. They bring camps of outside workers, mainly non-Indigenous men, to Indigenous areas. These man camps contribute to the crisis of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\n\nOur women continue to disappear and die. There have been approximately 4,000 or more Indigenous murdered or missing women and girls in the last 30 years. That works out to about 133 a year, or three a week.\n\nIf white women were being stolen at this rate there would be worldwide outrage.\n\nI'm a strong, proud Indigenous woman and I was more than a runaway or a lost cause. A generation of women like me are still fighting for our lives. We are resilient, worthy and intelligent; and we deserve to live, to dream and to thrive.\n\nAgainst countless odds my dreams of becoming a successful journalist came to pass. What about all the dreams that have died with our stolen sisters? Who would they have become?\n\nBrandi Morin is a journalist based in Treaty 6 territory, Alberta, Canada"

      "text": "'The families deserve answers': inside the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women\n\nThe sobering docuseries Murder in Big Horn examines the struggle for justice for Montana's missing Native women\n\nH enny Scott was 14 years old, a high school freshman on the Northern Cheyenne Indian reservation in Lame Deer, Montana, when she went missing after a house party in late December 2018. Her family promptly reported her disappearance to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. But the office took two weeks to issue a missing persons report, which \"sat on a desk because the individual was out on vacation\", Scott's mother, Paula Castro, told documentarians Razelle Benally and Matthew Galkin in their new Showtime series Murder in Big Horn.\n\nThere was no official search, no amber alert, no communication. \"We had to do our own investigation and form our own search crew,\" recalled her stepfather, Nathan Stops. Eventually, the FBI stepped in, without notifying Scott's family, and found her body less than 200 yards from the house where she was last seen.\n\nNine months later, when 18-year-old Kaysera Stops Pretty Places went missing after a night out with friends in the same county, Big Horn authorities never notified her family of an investigation. Her body was found five days later, spotted by a jogger in a backyard abutting a busy street less than a mile from the Crow reservation where she grew up, but authorities didn't notify her family for another two weeks.\n\nBoth Scott and Places' cases remain unsolved - Scott's cause of death was ruled hypothermia, though her family says her body appeared to have bruises and a broken nose and that she was wearing someone else's clothes. The cause of death for Places was left undetermined. Their families, who both appear in Murder in Big Horn, have been pushing ever since for answers, with little help from or in opposition to law enforcement.\n\nLackluster responses and languishing cases are the norm for many families of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) , an epidemic in the US and Canada that has in recent years received significant national media attention, though few answers for loved ones. Investigations \"usually end up having to be done by the family and the community members themselves\", Lucy Simpson, the executive director of the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center, told the Guardian. \"In so many of these cases, it's the family that finds their loved one, that does the search to find their loved one because law enforcement doesn't participate, or doesn't feel that it's a priority, or makes excuses based on generally accepted stereotypes about Native people.\"\n\nOver three episodes, Murder in Big Horn examines the MMIW crisis in microcosm and in context, through four families still seeking answers and through the history of cultural and physical violence against Indigenous people in the US. Montana has one of the worst missing or murdered rates for Indigenous women in the country - according to a state report from 2017-2019 , Indigenous people comprised about 6.7% of the population but accounted for 26% of missing persons cases. Big Horn county, in which 65% of the population identifies as Native American, has the worst rate in the state ; by the time Selena Not Afraid disappeared on New Year's Day 2020, she was at least the 28th missing Indigenous woman in the county for the prior year.\n\nBenally, who is Oglala Lakota and Diné, and Galkin, who is white, began work on the series in 2020 after the disappearance of Not Afraid. The 16-year-old was last seen alive in a broken-down car with friends at a rest stop along I-90, the high-trafficked interstate the cuts through Big Horn county - Montana's sixth-largest, spanning parts of the Northern Cheyenne and Crow reservations. Her disappearance marked a turning point in anemic public responses; within hours, there were drones, dogs and officers searching for her. Not Afraid's family camped out at the rest stop, bringing media attention to her disappearance. The New York Times and other national media covered the case. Her body was found nearly three weeks later, less than a mile from the rest stop, in a patch of open land with shrubby grass. Like with Scott, Montana officials ruled her cause of death to be hypothermia.\n\nThe grassroots attention for her case, building on outrage over the handling of Scott's and Places', represented the \"sort of groundswell of advocacy [that] grew to the point that these cases are what got the national attention on the MMIW issue\", Galkin said. Along with sibling producers Ivan and Ivy MacDonald, of north-west Montana's Blackfeet Nation, Benally and Galkin traveled to Big Horn county to meet family members seeking justice. The film-makers explicitly avoided \"extractive storytelling\" in which outsiders parachute in, report quickly and leave, and instead \"tried our best to tell the story as ethically as possible, and also with honor, to ensure that the families were able to speak their truth\", said Benally. \"Because let's be real, this issue needs a platform, and we needed to ensure that the families had a chance to be heard.\"\n\nMurder in Big Horn is thus clear-eyed on the crisis, though less attuned to dire, often faceless statistics than the personal experience of families - Scott's, Places', Not Afraid's, and the loved ones of Shacaiah Harding, who disappeared and was likely trafficked via I-90 in 2018. \"These cases are not true crime stories to us. These cases are our relatives,\" says Luella Brien, a Crow journalist with Indigenous-led Four Points Press whose aunt Deedee Brien was likely killed - the case was never solved - at 17 in 1977, and whose sons attended school with Not Afraid. \"These are not only our sisters, our mothers, our grandmothers, our aunties, our daughters, but they're human beings,\" said Simpson.\n\nThe series also examines, episode by episode, the perfect storm of legal, cultural and historical factors which contribute to disappeared women and girls and unsolved, unhandled cases. There's the immediate factors: the ability of I-90, which bisects Big Horn county, to swiftly move trafficked women and girls out of state. A jurisdictional tangle between state, federal and tribal authorities that allows most cases to fall through the cracks, and prevents the Department of the Interior's newly formed missing and murdered unit from having sufficient power . (Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous US cabinet secretary, announced the launch of the unit in 2021; it has since faced criticism for inefficiency and ineffectiveness.)\n\nMore broadly, there's the history of violence, discrimination and forced assimilation against Native people by the US government, including the reservation system that, the series argues, was designed for Native Americans to fail rather than thrive. The roots of the MMIW crisis, and pervasive indifference to violence against Indigenous women, are found in the history of colonization and \"the lack of respect and humanity that Native peoples have been treated with historically\", said Simpson, which \"still have a holdover in a lot of these federal policies, and as well as some of the ways in which our own communities have internalized some of that\".\n\nWhereas most true crime series usually wind through leads and red herrings and contested interpretations, Murder in Big Horn hits a wall early and often: there are no theories, because there was never an investigation. (The Big Horn county sheriff's office, as well as any active law enforcement representative, declined to participate in the series.) \"The mystery is that there's no mystery,\" said Galkin. \"If you look closely enough, it's clear why these things are happening.\"\n\nBenally recalled filming during the search for Gabby Petito, a 22-year-old white woman who disappeared while vacationing with her boyfriend in Wyoming, and whose case became a national news and social media fixation in stark contrast to many missing Indigenous women . \"As we're interviewing families and we're listening to them talk about how there was no urgency from law enforcement to do any sort of search and rescue, to file a missing person's report, it really had me thinking, 'Well, what does it take?'\" she said. \"What does it take for there to be this urgent response from law enforcement, from society, when one of our girls goes missing?\"\n\n\"I'll always have hope for some kind of justice,\" she added, for the series to reach people who could re-examine the crimes against Scott, Places, Not Afraid and Harding, to \"see if there's something that can be done to find justice for these families. The families deserve some answers.\"\n\nMurder in Big Horn starts on Showtime on 5 February with a UK release to be announced"

      "text": "7 Life Lessons From My Kokum - Who Was Also The First Indigenous Woman In Canada's Senate\n\nAs I walked through Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada, I wondered, \"How did I get here?\"\n\nI was there to serve as a panelist at the Métis Nation's \"Youth Summit on Climate Change,\" which was a huge honor. I couldn't help but reflect on the path that led me to where I am now, in a position that most would consider extremely prestigious. Growing up as a young Indigenous girl with very humble beginnings and a gang-affiliated father, I know that this path could have gone in another direction.\n\nGiven the opportunity, my mother would tell you stories of a fierce little girl who climbed tall trees until the tips swayed in the wind. I was ambitious and focused, yes, but it was the women around me who fostered those ideals within me. And when I think about the matriarchs who have guided me over the years, the first one who comes to mind is my kokum (the Cree word for \"grandmother\") - or G Ma, as we called her.\n\nWhen I walked along Ottawa's canals and stared up at the Parliament Building, I felt her presence. How could I not? She was one of the fiercest advocates for the Métis people. Thelma Chalifoux was the first Indigenous woman appointed to the Senate in Canada. She was also a Mètis woman whose contributions to the country were so enormous that the University of Alberta named a building after her, Canada commemorated her with a stamp , and Edmonton, Alberta, named a school after her.\n\nShe was also just my kokum: a woman whose voice, humor, severity, wisdom, and advice forever live inside of me. It's been seven years since you passed on to the spirit world, G Ma. In honor of her, here are seven lessons that she handed down to me and permeate my bones to this day. I hope they reach all of the women out there looking for motivation - and a little laugh when the struggle gets too heavy.\n\nSometimes, G Ma and I would be eating bannock and sipping tea at the dining table when she would say, \"That Susan is as useless as tits on a log!\" And we would erupt into laughter.\n\nThe phrase implies that a person or people are doing nothing to contribute to a household or community. She taught me early on that when you are a guest in someone's home - or a member of a family unit - you earn your keep and help with whatever they need.\n\nG Ma spent her whole life devoted to activism in Indigenous organizations around fair housing, education, suicide prevention, prisons and abused women. She also helped people battle alcoholism and addiction, which plagues our communities. For better or worse, G Ma was a woman who never rested. And she changed so many lives because of her tenacity.\n\nI was a headstrong and determined child - which makes sense, as I was raised by defiant, determined women. If I had an idea in mind, I needed to make it happen. At first, my pleas involved whining. But G Ma explained to me that a strong argument is far more powerful than an emotional appeal. \"Instead of whining, come up with three logical reasons for why you should get what you want,\" she told me.\n\nTen-year-old me quickly learned how to craft arguments as if our household were a court of law and I were a seasoned litigator. As a grown woman now, having defied all odds stacked against me, I'm proud that this skill was instilled in me early on. I rarely accept a no when it comes to my career aspirations.\n\nMy G Ma taught me to choose my battles and learn how to fight fairly and effectively. Most importantly, I was taught not to stoop to another person's level when they throw a low blow. I remember once, in middle school, a boy in my class made a cruel remark about my incarcerated father. It pierced my solar plexus the way that only certain words can. My first reaction was to try to hurt him physically. But instead, I ripped his glasses off his face and stomped on them.\n\nI then promptly marched myself to the principal's office to turn myself in, eyes stinging from tears. Sitting down with G Ma after this happened and telling her about it, she shook her head: \"Never get into a piss fight with a skunk.\" And as an adult, I know she was right. Some people just play dirty, and it's not worth my energy to engage.\n\nIn the 23 years of having my kokum as my role model before she passed, I don't recall seeing her shed a single tear. After she left her abusive husband in the '50s, she then had her children taken away from her through the Sixties Scoop . She spent seven years getting all her children back.\n\nOf course, I don't recommend tamping down grief and keeping sadness hidden, but I know that her message to me was to not let grief paralyze you for too long. You pick yourself up, and you get on with the mission. Though I allow myself to feel and process, she truly modeled resilience for me - and taught me that our trauma does not define any of us.\n\nOn my 30th birthday, a friend told me how the thing she loves the most about me is that I accept people, without judgment, for who they are in all their fullness and complexity. It was a very generous compliment, and all props go to my G Ma. She taught me that the most valuable thing we can do for another person is to process their flaws with compassion.\n\nWhat if the mistakes we make were not maligned, but instead seen as opportunities for growth? You were not perfect, G Ma, and there were moments when your sternness made me feel small. But still, your goodness will always be the thing that shines.\n\nG Ma created a safe haven in her basement where she kept canned goods, clothing, hygiene supplies and basic materials to help women get back on their feet after fleeing abusive marriages. My Aunty Debbie used to always tell the stories of watching her chase men away from her home with cast-iron frying pans . It was her first and only line of defense, and it worked.\n\nWhenever I think of cast-iron frying pans, I think about how my kokum provided for the women in her community in more ways than one. I hope to be as supportive to any woman who needs an advocate.\n\nAfter I read a eulogy at my G Ma's funeral, one of her friends from the Senate came up to me and shared a story about her. The friend remembered a meeting where a man in the House of Commons started talking over G Ma. She stood up, pounded her fists on the table and said, \"You will listen to what I have to say!\" The room fell silent, all eyes on her, as the story goes. One of the men there said, \"By all means, Sen. Chalifoux, the floor is yours.\"\n\nYou left big shoes to fill, G Ma, and sometimes I hear you when I tap on my keyboard and words emerge on the page. And I can only hope that your voice lives on through me.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "As An Indigenous Woman, I Always Hate Thanksgiving. This Year I'm Terrified Of It.\n\nGuest Writer\n\nI used to think it was enough, every Thanksgiving, to post Wednesday Addams' famous Thanksgiving monologue . Like most Indian kids across the country, when I first saw \"Addams Family Values,\" I delighted in the speech delivered by the iconic little outcast. It was one of the first times I remember feeling seen in pop culture as she rants about the realities of reservations and settler/colonial violence, about selling beaded bracelets by the roadside. Her statement about living in mobile homes resonated so intensely with me that I think my 10-year-old self actually fell in love with Christina Ricci. If I hadn't been already, I was in that moment.\n\nLooking like the Land of Lakes Indian Maiden, match in hand and eyes wide, she looked into the camera and promised to burn the pilgrim village to the ground, and I cheered. I don't think the writers knew what they were doing. This wasn't just another dark remark, pointing to the character's fascination with all things morbid. This was a statement about Indigenous identity.\n\nEach year ― even nearly three decades later ― my feed is flooded with memes that capture the spirit of this monologue. It's a nod to this historical moment in cinematic comedy and a collective acknowledgment of what it communicates. I've seen T-shirts and posters showcasing it. I've even seen beadwork capturing the original princess of goth's likeness.\n\nAs Indigenous people, we have celebrated this speech as a way to laugh through it, to make light of our country's embracing of a hypocritical holiday. Each year it has brought me some small satisfaction to share this on my own social media feeds, to know that it might reach families that were waiting in line for turkey, clambering to make mountains of food, to come together for one night to sit around a table and announce what it was they were thankful for, without ever questioning why. It was small and silly, just something to brace myself against the waves of posts about cranberry sauces and family recipes.\n\nThat victorious moment in which Wednesday holds up her hand, the smile wiped from her pale face, and says, \"Wait. We cannot break bread with you,\" once served as a pivotal moment of truth ― one I felt compelled to share, to laugh at, to help me get through this holiday. But this wasn't enough ― it was never enough.\n\nThis year, as I scroll through the news, I see the warnings against gathering for Thanksgiving, that coming together in the face of this pandemic puts our loved ones at risk. Families are still hellbent on ignoring this advice. Nothing will stand in the way of this antiquated tradition of gravy and pumpkin pie.\n\nWhen my non-Native friends talk to me about Thanksgiving, they are quick to remind me they know about the day's genocidal roots. \"But that's not why we still celebrate,\" they tell me, reassuringly adding, \" We get it. We just like the time off and being together.\"\n\nSome friends go so far as to share the ways they honor Indigenous history around the table at their meals. As they pass the mashed potatoes, as they butter their rolls and drink their wine, they have woke conversations about the real meaning behind Thanksgiving, the brutal history. \"We tell our kids the truth.\"\n\nThey say this like I'm to respond by presenting them a badge of honor complete with a bright gold star and my gratitude. Gosh . Thank you for doing the work. But is it really enough to discuss the destruction of the Wampanoag peoples' food resources and the ways the first settlers nearly starved to death during a period actually known as \"the starving years ,\" had it not been for the Wampanoag's generosity?\n\nI wonder what happens when they get to the part of the story when the pilgrims resorted to cannibalism. Do their children cry when it's revealed that even after rescuing the settlers from starvation, the tribe still suffered violence from the very pilgrims they had just saved? Does the table hold a moment of silence for the lost lands, for the destruction of hunting grounds, of food sovereignty? Is it really enough just to talk about these things?\n\n\"I imagine my woke white friends, sharing their stories of Indigenous struggle. Do they tell their children about blisters and boils? About entire villages wiped out by a new disease?\"\n\nPeople joke about the gross amounts of food brought to the table on Thanksgiving. They laugh about how full they get, about unbuttoning their jeans and napping on the couch next to Grandpa. This feels like a white concept to me ― not just getting unnecessarily full, but making it your goal. Why do this? Is it because we can? If there is a seemingly endless supply of something, is it our nature to consume it? Are we so driven to deplete things?\n\nEven in the current and dangerous state we find ourselves in, masked up to protect ourselves and each other against the virus, people are still fighting over turkey. I have seen empty shelves in stores. I have seen lines wrapped around parking lots as people stand 6 feet apart waiting to get in to Whole Foods. We have been told not to gather and still this need to come together to eat and make statements of gratitude drives us to ignore precautionary measures that could and will save lives.\n\nSomeone asked me what I would be doing this Thanksgiving. I laughed and paused in the absurdity of the inquiry. This question would be ridiculous to me on any given year, but it feels especially ridiculous in 2020. As a Coast Salish woman, I hate this holiday. But as an asthmatic person in 2020, I'm terrified of this holiday. A fear lives in my body. It has been passed down generationally.\n\nThis is not the first pandemic Indigenous people have faced. Along with the tradition of turkey and gratitude, Thanksgiving brings to mind the other things pilgrims brought to Native people. Things like smallpox. I imagine my woke white friends, sharing their stories of Indigenous struggle. Do they tell their children about blisters and boils? About entire villages wiped out by a new disease?\n\nOn the last Thanksgiving spent with my full family, when my great-grandmother was still alive, she sat at the head of the table. I saw the irony of a Coast Salish family gathering to share a meal on this day, but we're a family just like you, and we gathered simply because we could, because we had an opportunity to share a meal.\n\nMy great-grandmother addressed the table, the way I imagine other heads of families do when they say grace. She spoke about the importance of being together in English. She spoke about gratitude. Then she spoke in our traditional language. I don't speak our tribal language. I don't know what it was she said, but as she spoke tears rolled down her cheeks, her words heavy with emotion. I couldn't take my eyes off of her.\n\nThe words came out slow and delicate. She was lost in memory. Perhaps it was the memory of being a child on the Baker river and watching her mother cool a can of condensed milk in the current, taking it out, whisking it with a fork until it became whipped cream. Perhaps it was the memory of a box of raisins gifted to her by a white woman sick with smallpox when she was only 3 years old. Her mother had gone to check on the woman, who was all alone, unable to care for her house or fix a meal. The sick woman gave my great-grandmother raisins. She had never had something so sweet before. Whatever the memory may have been, my great-grandmother was lost in it as she spoke. She looked around the table; she looked at her abundance. And then like any other family, we ate. We got too full.\n\nWhen I answered that question about my Thanksgiving this year, I said I hated this holiday. If I was to ceremoniously eat anything, it wouldn't be turkey or potatoes. I'll most likely eat salmon. I'll make a food I know my ancestors ate pre-contact. This is something I have gratitude for. As are the trees, the ferns that grow out of them, my mom as she tells me a certain root is good for my respiratory health.\n\nI remember my great-grandmother's face that Thanksgiving. The look on it existed somewhere between gratitude and grief. Through my complicated feelings around this holiday, I'm thankful for how precise my memory is, how I can still see each line of her face, and hear the sounds of our language. If she were alive today, I'd hate to miss the opportunity to share a meal, but I would. I would miss her rather than put her at risk.\n\nThis week, a friend tested positive for COVID-19. He contracted it in his place of work ― not out at a bar, not eating brunch, but in his place of work. What gutted me more than the news of my friend struggling through sickness was his response. He was consumed by the fear that he might have exposed his wife, who, like me, sufferers from asthma. That night, I couldn't sleep. Instead I burned cedar. I remembered the times they had opened their home to me, had made me laugh, had been good friends.\n\nIf you are grateful for something, I think it's important to ask yourself why. Examine the idea of thankfulness. We can cherish people every day. People we could not imagine our lives without. To honor them, let's not make statements around a table of food. Let's make their favorite meal and eat it together through a screen. Because however you make your risk assessments, however you justify your levels of safety, consider the people you are eager to break bread with. Consider them in a hospital bed. Consider not being allowed inside the room as they take their last labored breath.\n\nThere is a selfish desire to be close, a hunger to share space with those we love. The history of this holiday is built on selfish desires, the need to fill something. It has been a long time coming, the necessity for checking this holiday. If we cannot do it now, when?\n\nStatements of gratitude are not enough. Teaching your children about the genocide basic to this country's foundation is not enough. And I'm sorry, my beloved first crush, my Wednesday Addams, your face illuminated in match light and smiling, is not enough.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "It Takes A Community To Exploit A Native Woman\n\nEssayist, Columnist, Indigenous Mother\n\nIt takes a community to exploit a native woman. When the exploitation or assault of an indigenous woman is discussed there are comments blaming the woman, or the condition of Indian life, or they say something self-righteous -- failing to see the irony in how awful people who can't empathize appear to the public. Those sentiments, and those attitudes towards human life, are some reasons people can capitalize on our bodies.\n\nThere's animus towards us when we state publicly that we're aware of the threats against us, or that we move through the world sometimes as criminal profilers -- considering a man's age, experiences, and behavior to assess our risk in interacting with him, or coming into his periphery. The pushback to our voices feels like its own conspiring -- it's own threat.\n\nThe threat of exploitation was always present in my life, even after I became a graduate student. There is a difference, though, between an adjunct college teacher's level of exploitation and the super-exploitation Indigenous women are threatened with when we experience poverty, or when we are between jobs, or post-partum with jobs and daycare, or between homes. Because of the lack of concern exhibited within the justice system, and the racial animus towards us in public, the dangers against us are more present and dangerous.\n\nOn welfare, or homeless, or out of foster care, or walking home from school along the highway -- there was looming a threat. Men and women were ready to capitalize on my desperation. The word desperation has been used to belittle people. Even using the word \"poor\" to describe a state I was in has sparked outrage from native readers who tell me, \"We're not poor because we are rich in culture.\" It's a farce, or a silly game of semantics, where denying a woman's desperation, or trying to guilt her for feeling it, seems done for the sake of cultural purity -- that we are unbroken and strong.\n\nWell, you can be strong and desperate. Desperation is momentary, and some people's lives are filled with the agony of those moments -- where there could be one or two days of respite, absent of hunger, and their experiences are real and cannot be filled with our culturally rich geographic locations, or language, or ability to fish, or pick a berry, or make medicine -- those theoretical ideas of 'rich' and 'poor' should be spared for people who can afford the conversation.\n\nPlacing the onus on the victim, without looking at the self and when you've turned a blind eye, or when you've been complicit, is a shameful existence.\n\nWhen a woman is a hundred dollars short on rent or bills there are vultures ready. There are horrible people who exist inside and outside of our communities -- along our highways -- predatory and overt. And then there are the businesses that support the exploitation of women: websites to solicit human trafficking , hotels, bars, camgirl websites ... I won't delve into naming the whole communities that benefit from sex work but fail to protect the human lives involved. These businesses sometimes only turn a profit from us -- from our bodies. Their profit is sometimes based on how deplorable our conditions are -- they thrive on our victimization. It's not a conspiracy theory, but the public often refuses to believe testimony, data, or hard-won truths that have prevailed within their own justice systems.\n\nWhen I was a hundred dollars short, I was lucky to have brothers. When they were short, I had a rez loan shark, who was more honest and gave more finite parameters on lending than any payday loan business, but it was just as dangerous. It was off the rez where I experienced the most predatory behaviour -- people who outright kept cash on hand to buy us.\n\nPlacing the onus on the victim, without looking at the self and when you've turned a blind eye, or when you've been complicit, is a shameful existence. Typically, shame spurs people into action, but sometimes it gives way to obstinacy and hatred. I've seen a lot of hatred for missing and murdered indigenous women, and for indigenous women who have been exploited. It takes more fury and bravery to indict the businesses and everyday people who benefit from exploitation.\n\nNorth America was founded on exploitation -- on the idea that indigenous people were savages, and trying to convince people that the word, the ideology, the mythos of \"savage\" and \"civil\" -- good and bad; winner and loser -- it's a tired trope and humanity is more complicated than binary thinking. Those binaries have willed people into thinking \"capital\" is more valuable than human life, and that survival of the fittest is real, when these people have probably cared for a dying elder in their lifetime, or taken care of a child, or helped a family member in need, without thinking they deserve what they get for being weakened momentarily.\n\nOriginally published at Indian Country Today .\n\nAlso on HuffPost:"

      "text": "Decolonizing My Story As An Indigenous Woman\n\nEssayist, Columnist, Indigenous Mother\n\nPreviously published at Indian Country Today .\n\nTaking colonization from its locus in my narrative, or cultural history, has been an act of decolonization. The small rez I grew up on was full of abstract ideas and action, and disagreement, and then confluence: two rivers meeting at one junction, peaceful or not -- movement felt collective. I wondered, if I came from such activism -- where the knowledge of colonization was prevalent among my family, and within the community school system and culture -- then where could I go from there to elevate myself?\n\nDecolonization is nothing if it does not transform the self and work against oppressive forces: to help the exploited, super-exploited and disenfranchised -- to help the people. For the writers I love, Independence: social, political, cultural, psychological and intellectual independence, it is liberation. The only way I've liberated myself from anything is through story.\n\nMy transformation has come from framework, recalibrating what's important to me and true, and giving myself the ability to change. Before this, I navigated towards the decolonization my mother had envisioned for herself, which felt culturally specific, but based in a pan-Indian ideology that had her attending every conference, gathering, meeting and protest -- which brought about historic change.\n\nThrough practical application she liberated herself: through diet, practice, ceremony, empathy for those around her, discourse, and through her aggressive desire to re-imagine herself as who she wanted to be, in spite of the daily oppressive forces trying to negate her desires and mobility. It's hard to imagine doing better than those who've passed, because for some of us, they were everything -- the way Indians used to be has been engrained in our minds as something more formidable than ourselves, something grander, more pure, better constructed, closer to the origin of ourselves.\n\nIt feels based in Christianity, somehow -- that there was purity, or wholeness, and then us -- those who need reconciliation, who want to make amends. Rejecting this narrative has become part of my politic. I have stopped existing in the binary my parents created for me: white people are bad, we're good, colonization happened, and then what came was reactionary, reclamation -- all we could do, and have been doing, is recovery.\n\nI realized this was incongruent with my cultural teachings, or the value system I was raised within. While my mother told me to resist imitating any Eurocentric way of living, or thinking about the world, I had been putting them at the centre of my story, which is about as Eurocentric as it gets.\n\nIf I am to resist, I must resist making my story Eurocentric.\n\nI don't believe my mother set up the binary intentionally, but when we walked into a store, white women followed her. My mother's grimacing, her anger, the desire for equality -- to a child it looked obvious that there was a good guy and a bad guy, at least when it came to my mother.\n\nMy father, not so much -- but the way that story was framed was also placing racism and trauma in the middle of his story. He was institutionalized; what happened to him was part of a larger story where colonization was the true culprit. It's not that we didn't hold him accountable, it was that his life could not be removed from the tragedy that indigenous identity feels transfixed in. Existing as their daughter, and the descendant of their people, it was difficult to see much beyond how messed up the world is to Indians, and it was hard to focus on much else, especially when I imagined what could have been.\n\nBut I think I must resist that -- to put tragedy at the locus, and to give the culprits a talking part in my play, would be relenting, and giving them too much. If I am to resist, I must resist making my story Eurocentric. I don't need an antagonist, or any convention of story if it's not within me -- I don't need time to be linear. It could simply be my story, the way my people's stories work: as innovation -- play of language, oddity, individual and full of heart.\n\nIt's hard, because I've been victimized in my lifetime, beyond the racism I experience, and moving my story away from the trauma is sometimes impossible. Putting myself into the story as the only true thing moving my life forward, or backward, it's become a power that has helped me regain an affinity for decolonization. Autonomy, in its pluralism, has helped me imagine I can contribute to the things my people are working for. The question is, how can I remove myself from the history of trauma?\n\nBelieving in the fluidity of my culture, working against rigidity is its own cultural reclamation.\n\nI use the word \"remove\" only because I'd like it removed from the centre, placed elsewhere -- where my people and I can be present and stand alone. I've given myself mobility. For my children, I present the truth as more than dichotomous. We exist with double-consciousness, and questions, constant questions, of what the implications are of our words and actions -- my children will know me, and know my ideas shifted to what made for the best community, where unity was in mind over authority.\n\nChaos is imperative to liberation, for me. Liberation is messy -- finding the right language takes a lot of wrongdoing, wrong thinking, and opposition. If there's one thing, it's that my people do not hold agreeing with one another over the truth or betterment. Keeping this in mind has allowed me to pick up political theories, practices and beliefs away from my own foundation. I am using language for transcendence.\n\nI am not bound by the confines of essentialism, or stereotype, or history book representations of us, or the pictures of my people during the smallpox epidemic, and I am also something removed from my own culture. Decolonization isn't necessarily about the reclamation of one's singular culture, but dismantling established control over indigenous people, which includes more than what's in the binary.\n\nTaking apart the rhetoric of \"old ways\" that hinder indigenous women's rights is decolonization, for me, as I know the word. Questioning my own appropriation is decolonization. Allowing a white person into my movement against a settler-colonial state is decolonization, too. Tricky, I know. Near impossible, true. Believing in the fluidity of my culture, working against rigidity is its own cultural reclamation. I don't really have much else, besides story, to rise up where I believe my mother hoped I could be: somewhere unfathomable and removed from tragedy, resistant to be pegged, even by the movements she believed in.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nther"

      "text": "An Indigenous Woman Was Reportedly Killed By A Driver Whose Kids Are Named Aryan And Nation\n\nSenior Reporter, Crime\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Mika Westwolf was walking to her home on the Flathead Reservation in Montana late at night in March when she was struck and killed by a driver who then allegedly left the scene.\n\nDetails quickly emerged suggesting an ideological element to the crash. The driver - identified by police as 28-year-old Sunny White - was with her young children, Aryan, 4, and Nation, 2. Many in the community believe White is a white nationalist and that the crash was intentional. And yet, more than two months later, White has yet to face charges stemming directly from Westwolf's death.\n\nInitially, the Department of Justice reported inaccurately that White had been charged with vehicular manslaughter - in fact, she was only charged with child endangerment, and the children were removed from her care. Those charges were then dropped on April 6 by Lake County Attorney James Lapotka, who told Popular Information he needed \"more time\" to collect evidence, including results from search warrants of White's and Westwolf's phones and toxicology reports performed on both women. He declined to specify why he sought results for Westwolf in addition to White .\n\nNow, more than 10 weeks since Westwolf was killed, her family members say they're frustrated by the pace of the investigation and what they describe as total radio silence from police. They still don't know exactly how Westwolf died.\n\nWestwolf's mother, Carissa Heavy Runner, described her daughter as \"adventurous, fun, energetic, curious and very smart.\" She told HuffPost that Westwolf was an avid reader, wrote poetry and danced in powwows \"since before she could walk.\" Her daughter loved being outdoors, hiking and climbing, and was overjoyed when she was selected to participate in an Indigenous cultural exchange program in Nepal, she said.\n\n\"She came back ready to take on the world,\" Heavy Runner said.\n\nThe family has yet to see any documentation regarding the crash. If White isn't charged over the death, Erica Shelby, a legal advocate for Westwolf's family, believes that there could be enough information to file a wrongful death suit. The priority right now, however, \"is just finding out answers of what happened,\" Shelby told Huff Post. \"We haven't seen anything to indicate to us that this is just a hit-and-run, so we haven't been able to rule anything out.\"\n\nThe Montana Human Rights Network believes that Westwolf's death deserves to be investigated as a hate crime , citing unverified \"community reports\" that White - who the network says its research suggests could be a white nationalist - \"intentionally ran down\" the Indigenous woman.\n\nBut for White, the story doesn't end with the Highway Patrol investigation.\n\nSix days after the crash, police allege, White - who'd lost custody of her kids - broke into the house where her children were staying with their father and took the children, prompting authorities to issue a Missing Endangered Person Advisory. White later pleaded not guilty to charges of felony burglary, felony parenting interference and misdemeanor criminal mischief. She wasn't in custody as of Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation has been marked by bureaucratic delays and unanswered questions.\n\nShelby told HuffPost that as of June 9, toxicology screenings and the autopsy had been completed and that authorities were waiting on a peer review of the crash reconstruction before the lead Highway Patrol investigator could file a report.\n\n\"There was no indication that this was an intentional act,\" Lapotka told HuffPost, citing what he has learned from the Highway Patrol. \"This incident happened sometime before 4:15 a.m. on an unlit, rural section of Highway 93.

      "text": "Driver With Kids Named Aryan And Nation Charged In Crash That Killed Indigenous Woman\n\nSenior Reporter, Crime\n\nA Montana driver with children named Aryan and Nation has been charged with homicide in the March hit-and-run killing of Mika Westwolf, an Indigenous woman.\n\nThe case drew widespread attention and calls for accountability after Popular Information reported that authorities did not immediately charge Sunny White, whom many in the community believe to be a white nationalist, for her alleged role in the death of Westwolf. The 22-year-old, who was an enrolled member of the Blackfeet tribe and is also Navajo, Cree and Klamath, was walking to her home on the Flathead Reservation in the early hours of March 31 when she was struck and killed.\n\nBut on Oct. 18, Lake County Attorney James Lapotka said he had found probable cause to charge White with five felonies, including vehicular homicide, drug possession and child endangerment. The damage to White's Cadillac Escalade allegedly matched debris near the ditch along a highway where Westwolf's body was found. Westwolf died of multiple blunt force injuries caused when White hit her head-on with enough force to propel her body toward the ditch, Lapotka said.\n\nWhite was previously charged with child endangerment, and her young children, who were reportedly in the SUV at the time of the crash, were removed from her care, but Lapotka dropped those charges, telling Popular Information in May that he needed \"more time\" to collect evidence.\n\nWestwolf's parents criticized local authorities for the slow pace of the investigation and for keeping them in the dark about its progress and how their daughter died. Carissa Heavy Runner, Westwolf's mother, previously told HuffPost that one investigator in particular had been \"condescending, negative and almost victim-blaming\" when they spoke. After launching an awareness campaign, she learned that families of other missing and killed Indigenous people faced similar obstacles when dealing with law enforcement.\n\nAccording to the new charging documents, a trooper who searched White's car said he found five syringes, two unopened packages of Narcan and a small makeup tube containing methamphetamine. Toxicology reports indicated that White had fentanyl and methamphetamine in her blood, which was drawn the morning of the crash, Lapotka said. White's cellphone data, he said, placed her at the scene at 3 a.m., when surveillance footage captured a vehicle driving toward and braking at the spot where Westwolf's body was found. According to investigators, another driver said an SUV had passed him near the crash scene driving about 90 miles per hour.\n\nWestwolf's family called White's arrest \"a bittersweet moment\" in an update posted Friday on Mika Matters , the website they created to raise awareness and demand accountability from authorities in Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives (MMIR) cases. While they felt \"a sense of relief and satisfaction,\" they said, it was also \"a painful reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by countless Indigenous families.\n\n\"Mika's family expresses their sympathy and solidarity with all families who continue to endure the heart-wrenching uncertainty and loss associated with MMIR cases. They understand that in this day and age, it is deeply disheartening that such fights for justice are still necessary.\"\n\nMore than 43,000 people signed a petition by asking the Department of Justice to intervene in the case, claiming that local authorities were being \"uncooperative and frustratingly slow.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "We All Need To Confront The Crisis Of Violence Against Indigenous Women\n\nCo-founder, David Suzuki Foundation\n\nIn late September, Inuit artist Annie Pootoogook died tragically in Ottawa. Pootoogook was an award-winning illustrator from Cape Dorset, Nunavut. Her ink-and-crayon depictions of everyday life in the north -- families sitting to eat a meal of seal meat or shopping at the Arctic co-op -- received international acclaim.\n\nIn contrast to the idealized vision many Canadians have of the north, of majestic rock and ice landscapes or charismatic wildlife like polar bears, Pootoogook's drawings often reflected the crushing poverty northern families face and its devastating impacts on their health and well-being.\n\nOttawa police believe Pootoogook's death is suspicious -- she may have been the victim of foul play. If so, Annie Pootoogook is yet another indigenous woman to die violently in Canada.\n\nIndigenous women and girls are at least three times more likely to experience violence than non-indigenous women and six times more likely to be murdered.\n\nOn any given day, thousands of First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and children are living in emergency shelters to escape abuse (though on-reserve shelters remain woefully underfunded ).\n\nThe RCMP hasn't kept accurate statistics on the number of murdered or missing people, but indigenous women's organizations and affected families have reported hundreds of cases of loved ones who have been victims of violent crime. After years of indifference and inaction, Canada's government has finally launched an inquiry into the many lives lost to violence.\n\nAlthough the national inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women won't investigate cases police previously examined, it will look at broader factors that put indigenous women and girls at such great risk.\n\nThese stories are heart-breaking, but the response from indigenous peoples brings hope.\n\nAccording to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women , this includes institutional racism, social and economic marginalization and inadequate access to affordable housing so women can escape abusive relationships. Police forces have often failed to deal with violence against indigenous peoples , and officers themselves have been implicated or charged with assaults and sexual abuse.\n\nHuman-rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Kairos have also drawn attention to resource development in Indigenous territories, where the influx of transient workers -- along with money, alcohol and drugs from outside the community -- puts indigenous women at risk of aggressive harassment and violence by men.\n\nAs environmentalists, we often emphasize the impacts of mining or oil and gas development on wildlife and ecosystems but ignore the staggering social consequences for indigenous communities, especially women.\n\nAmnesty International's research on the social impacts of resource development in northeast B.C.'s booming Peace Region has uncovered numerous accounts of attacks on women and girls, including \"domestic violence, encounters with strangers that ranged from aggressive harassment to brutal violence, including unsolicited offers of drugs and money for sex, sexual assault and gang rapes.\"\n\nThese stories are heart-breaking, but the response from indigenous peoples brings hope. One such grassroots effort is the Moose Hide Campaign, a growing movement of aboriginal and non-aboriginal men dedicated to ending violence against women and children, through education and peer support, encouraging men to develop healthier relationships with the women in their lives.\n\nThe Moose Hide Campaign was created by a young First Nations girl named Raven Lacerte and her father, Paul, in British Columbia. Working with First Nations hunters, they have distributed more than 250,000 small moosehide squares to communities across Canada -- encouraging men to wear the pins as symbols of their commitment to be accountable for their behaviour and to reject violence.\n\nWhat makes the campaign particularly poignant is that Raven and her father made the first pins from the hide of a moose they harvested near the infamous Highway of Tears between Prince George and Prince Rupert, where dozens of Indigenous women have gone missing or been found murdered.\n\nThe inquiry into the crisis of murdered and missing indigenous women and girls is long overdue and is a testament to the hard work and leadership of indigenous women and communities who have spent decades calling for an inquiry. It will proceed over the next few years and will make recommendations to governments, police and other agencies.\n\nWe must also take personal action to end violence by participating in initiatives like the Moose Hide Campaign, which bring people together to promote healing. These are important steps for all Canadians to embrace if we are to advance reconciliation.\n\nWritten with contributions from David Suzuki Foundation Ontario and Northern Canada Director Faisal Moola.\n\nLearn more at www.davidsuzuki.org .\n\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook\n\nAlso on HuffPost:"

      "text": "Deb Haaland's Tough Road Ahead at the Interior Department\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHaaland will have to overcome the Interior's legacy of colonialism and fossil fuel plunder - as well as her boss's moderate centrism.\n\nRep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., makes her way to a group photo with Democratic women members of the House on the East Front of the Capitol on Jan. 4, 2019.\n\nDeb Haaland faces a difficult road ahead at the Department of the Interior, if her nomination by President-elect Joe Biden is confirmed. A tribal citizen of the Laguna Pueblo and a Democratic member of Congress from New Mexico, Haaland will be stepping into a minefield: a mixture of various aims imposed by her party's centrist leadership, tribal interests, progressive causes, and the energy industry. For an Indigenous woman from New Mexico, it will be all the more fraught.\n\nTake something as simple as Smokey Bear, the friendly cartoon character known for instructing children on how to prevent forest fires. \"Smokey Bear is a white racist pig,\" New Mexico Chicano activist Jerry Fuentes once said . For Fuentes, the cartoon represented Big Brother of the Forest Service, which had criminalized small-scale timber harvests and helped sever centuries-old ties Indigenous people and Mexican Americans had with New Mexico's forests. While the Forest Service is part of the Department of Agriculture, Smokey appears on signs and placards in a number of federal lands, including holdings of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs and the vast tracts overseen by the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nSmokey was part of a huge legacy of the U.S. in the region: an annexation following a bloody war of aggression, the creation of public lands carved from Indigenous territories and Spanish land grants that saw the removal of Indigenous and other nonwhite people, and extractive plunder, all of which continue today, pushing us further into climate crisis.\n\nThat legacy is inextricably tied to the Department of the Interior and its present-day role. The Interior describes its sacred duties as protecting the \" natural and cultural heritage \" of the U.S., including a vast wellspring of natural resources such as coal, uranium, natural gas, and oil located on federal and public lands.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn New Mexico, the nation's third-largest oil producer, and also home to 23 tribal nations, where more than a third of the land is owned by the federal government, the Interior played a major role in the state's recent fracking boom. Billions of dollars in oil revenue have filled state coffers from lease sales and investment. In a state that consistently ranks among the poorest and has the highest numbers of murdered and missing Indigenous women , the boom has also threatened the most vulnerable: Indigenous nations and their sacred sites , as well as a desert landscape's precious freshwater .\n\nThat's why Haaland's appointment is so important. She has gained notoriety not only in Indian affairs, but also as a Standing Rock water protector, a supporter of Abolish ICE and Medicare for All, a Green New Deal backer, and an opponent of fracking and drilling on federal lands.\n\nThose positions may put her at odds with Republicans and many Democrats - including her future boss. Though Biden shares some relevant goals with Haaland - calling, for instance, for an end to fossil fuel extraction on federal lands - he has disavowed some of the more progressive positions she holds. He assuaged rich donors last year that \" nothing will fundamentally change \" with his administration and doesn't support the Green New Deal, specifically the calls for universal jobs and health care.\n\nHaaland's true test will be whether or not she toes her party's centrist, corporate line - positions that have grown increasingly hostile toward reforms like Medicare for All, even during a deadly pandemic.\n\nIf the Senate approves her nomination, Haaland will make history not once but three times. In 2018, she and Sharice Davids from the Ho-Chunk Nation became the first American Indian women elected to Congress. Biden's nomination will make Haaland the first American Indian woman to hold a Cabinet-level position and the first American Indian person selected as secretary of the Interior.\n\nRepresentation matters, especially for Indigenous people who have been categorically excluded from top leadership at the Interior, the very institution that governs many facets of their lives. Haaland's nomination comes during a year of racial reckoning. After losing a decadeslong battle with Indigenous activists, two major sports franchises - the Washington Football Team and the Cleveland baseball team - committed to retiring their racist Native mascots and team names this year. But the historic challenges that face Indigenous nations and the necessity to massively decarbonize the world's largest per capita polluter are monumental tasks that go beyond identity and a single administration.\n\nIndigenous and environmental movements will have to apply a special kind of pressure to one of their own as head of the Interior, to not allow Haaland to become mere window dressing for a party that has relied on rhetorical acts of inclusion as a source of legitimacy while suppressing or co-opting demands for radical change. The possibilities for achieving such aims are as much determined by the colonial nature of the Interior - and its history of Indigenous genocide and land theft - as they are by a willingness to organize within and against a state institution that has long served powerful corporate interests from both parties.\n\nThe Interior Department not only manages public lands and national forests but also human life: 578 federally recognized tribal nations, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians. That history to us, as citizens of these nations, has been one of colonial paternalism that puts our lands, resources, and livelihoods into a federal trust relationship. But a lack of \"trust\" runs deep, and for good reason. A recent Indigenous Futures Survey found that 95 percent of Indigenous people distrust the federal government.\n\nCenturies of federal Indian case law have defined that legal relationship as one between a guardian and its wards. The Supreme Court's 1903 Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock decision, which upheld the allotment of Indian reservation lands, laid down the legal principle that tribes have no title to their land at all. What we possess are mere occupancy rights. The consequences have been devastating. By the end of allotment in 1934, 100 million acres of Native land - two-thirds of what remained following dispossession up to 1887 - went into the hands of white settlers. The court upheld that Congress authorizes the Bureau of Indian Affairs, under the authority of the Interior, to dictate the conditions of American Indian life and land. The Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are beholden only to their own sense of morality and justice when it comes to Indigenous people, which has historically worked to the advantage of a land-hungry empire.\n\nIndian affairs were once the charge of the Department of War, prior to being moved to the Interior in 1849. Despite the change, the military waged extermination campaigns against Indigenous nations who stood in the way of Western expansion well into the late 19th century, forcing survivors onto reservations. There, survivors became the Interior's responsibility and faced conditions no less harsh than open warfare. \" Civilization regulations \" - upheld by the Bible and the gun - outlawed Indigenous dancing, religion, and culture. The Court of Indian Offenses prosecuted the defiant, and Indian police carried out the sentences and enforced the law, sometimes with lethal violence.\n\nIndian agents removed children from their families and recalcitrant leaders who refused to cede land, sending them to Bureau of Indian Affairs-run boarding schools that stripped them of their language and culture. By 1900, three-quarters of Native children had been enrolled in boarding schools , a third of whom were sent off-reservation; many never survived long enough to return to their families. Child removal continued even as boarding schools declined in the 20th century. In the early 1970s, an Association on American Indian Affairs report found that more than a quarter of Native children nationwide had been removed from their families ; many were adopted out to white families.\n\nIn the 1960s, Red Power activists called for the abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and a new era of tribal sovereignty. What they got instead was an expansion of Interior powers and protections. The activists pushed for and won important policy gains, such as the Indian Self-Determination Act in 1975, the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1978, and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990; the laws attempted to reverse child removal policies and religious prohibitions, as well as restore tribal autonomy and protections to cultural patrimony. Yet Indigenous people themselves were still largely excluded from executive decision-making power.\n\nThe results of policy reforms have been mixed under recent Democratic and Republican administrations. President Barack Obama's FBI infiltrated the Standing Rock camps against the Dakota Access pipeline. Obama also signed a 2015 law that lifted a four-decade limit on exporting crude oil from the U.S., which, combined with a fracking revolution, greatly increased domestic oil pipelines and production. In 2018, Obama bragged to a group of oil industry elites in Texas about why the United States \"suddenly\" became the world's largest oil producer: \"That was me, people,\" he said . \"Just say thank you, please.\"\n\nObama's successor, President Donald Trump, advanced industry-friendly policy while also rolling back Obama-era environmental regulations . He appointed Tara Sweeney as the assistant secretary of Indian Affairs, a former oil lobbyist and the second Native woman to hold the position. Trump's Interior leadership, including Sweeney, was the first administration to take land out of trust since President Harry Truman. Trump also rolled back protections for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, two national monuments and sacred Native sites in southern Utah.\n\nWhile Deb Haaland has stated that she intends to \"be fierce\" by addressing the Interior's violent colonial history, reversing Trump-era environmental rollbacks, and empowering Indigenous nations, Black descendants of people enslaved by the Five Civilized Tribes have asked Haaland whether she will be fierce for them too. The harrowing accounts of how tribes from what is now known as the southeastern U.S. were pushed into Oklahoma reservations is well known; less considered is the history of the enslaved Africans these tribes, collectively known as the Five Civilized Tribes, brought with them to Indian territory. Some were kept in bondage even after formal emancipation or until the tribes signed treaties with the Union after the Civil War. Their descendants are called Freedmen. In 2019, Haaland co-sponsored legislation that removed housing protections for the Freedmen in Oklahoma reservations. In recent history, the Five Civilized Tribes have variously implemented a de facto Jim Crow policy of disenfranchising Freedmen.\n\nHaaland is in a unique position to confront that history head-on and correct her past mistakes. The question is whether she can radically change the Interior's Smokey Bear image, which for so many is a face of white, colonial repression. Regardless of what Haaland is capable of doing, one truth will remain the same: Whether under Obama, Trump, or Biden, Indigenous people are the most advanced and confrontational arm of the climate justice movement . Although Haaland allegedly wasn't Biden's first pick for the Interior, her nomination was only possible because of relentless grassroots Indigenous organizing. It's up to her to listen to those movements - who will move forward with or without her.\n\nUpdate: December 29, 2020, 6:15 p.m. This post has been updated to include that Smokey Bear is a symbol of the Department of Agriculture that appears in some of the Interior Department's land holdings.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Tribal Liaison in Minnesota Pipeline Review Is Sidelined After Oil Company Complains to Governor\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDanielle Oxendine Molliver, who the state brought on to consult with tribes about Enbridge Energy's Line 3 pipeline, resigned citing lack of transparency.\n\nPart 17\n\nA controversial proposal for a tar sands oil pipeline has led indigenous leaders in Minnesota to threaten an uprising similar to the one near Standing Rock last fall. That conflict began with what tribes described as the federal government's failure to properly consult with nearby tribal communities prior to permitting the Dakota Access Pipeline project.\n\nIn July, Danielle Oxendine Molliver, the tribal liaison brought on by Minnesota's Department of Commerce to consult with indigenous leaders about Enbridge Energy's Line 3 pipeline, resigned in protest of what she called a flawed environmental review process that lacked transparency, professionalism, and fairness.\n\nIn a resignation letter submitted on July 24, Oxendine Molliver stated, \"There are a multitude of reasons why I have come to this decision. The single most important one is the failure of the state of Minnesota to fulfill its obligations of good faith and fair dealing with the tribes in connection with the Line 3 project.\"\n\nShe added, \"I feel as though my resignation is the only option to maintain my integrity, commitment, and standing with the tribal communities as both a liaison and indigenous woman.\"\n\nIn an interview, Oxendine Molliver told The Intercept that the department had not adequately responded to the concerns of tribal members and had marginalized her after Enbridge claimed she was being overly sympathetic to indigenous pipeline opponents.\n\nA moment of clarity came as Oxendine Molliver packed her bag on June 5 to fly to rural Minnesota for the first of 22 public meetings on the draft environmental impact statement she helped write. A superior at the Commerce Department called to inform her that instead of being stationed at a table to field questions about the pipeline's impact on tribes, Oxendine Molliver would be directing guests to the cookies and coffee.\n\nDanielle Oxendine Molliver, pictured in Cloquet, Minn., on Aug. 10, 2017, resigned from her role as tribal liaison working on an environmental review for the Enbridge Line 3 pipeline.\n\n\"I just kind of laughed,\" Oxendine Molliver said. \"It means Enbridge has the authority to call the governor's office, who then has the authority to control the permitting process.\"\n\nThe governor's office declined to comment on a personnel matter. In a statement, Ross Corson, the director of communications for Minnesota's Commerce Department, told The Intercept that because Oxendine Molliver \"has left state employment, she is not in a position to claim what specific concerns are, or are not, being addressed in the final EIS, which is still being prepared.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\n\"In this process, the agencies do not advocate for a particular position, but must act as impartial fact-finders for the commission, which also extends to the role of the tribal liaison. Complaints about any possible bias are treated seriously,\" Corson added.\n\nEnbridge spokesperson Shannon Gustafson stated, \"We're committed to following the regulatory process for the Line 3 replacement project and only ask that it be a fair and equitable process for everyone involved.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Mark Dayton extended by a week the deadline to publish the final environmental impact statement, to August 17, \"in order to provide the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) with the best possible information on which to base its decision.\" He noted that the EIS included more than 2,860 public comments. Additional hearings will follow its publication, after which the Public Utilities Commission will use the statement to determine whether the pipeline can go forward.\n\n\"Don't pride yourself on being the state that is better than DAPL,\" Oxendine Molliver said. The process \"is not transparent.\"\n\nAn Enbridge tank farm in an aerial photograph taken above the Athabasca Oil Sands near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, on June 19, 2014. Photo: Ben Nelms/Bloomberg News/Getty Images\n\nEnbridge's Line 3 pipeline reaches from the center of Canada's tar sands region in Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, with most of its 364-mile U.S. portion passing through Minnesota. Line 3 has ruptured multiple times since it was built in the 1960s, resulting in a 1.7-million-gallon spill in 1991 and a 252,000-gallon disaster in 2002, among other accidents. Today, it is corroded and cracked. Given its degraded state, by 2008 the pipeline's capacity had been reduced. As a penalty for another million-gallon spill in 2010 on a different corroded Enbridge pipeline, the company signed a consent decree with the federal government agreeing to replace Line 3 by December 2017 or undertake additional efforts to prevent ecological harm.\n\nThe decree happened to serve Enbridge's interests, providing a new argument in the company's efforts to pressure Minnesota's government to approve a proposal to replace Line 3 and greatly increase its capacity. The new line would expand the 34-inch pipe to 36 inches and increase its current capacity from 390,000 barrels per day to at least 760,000 barrels, closer to what it originally pumped. Meanwhile, the old line would remain in the ground, its combustible material removed and its ends sealed shut.\n\nFive bands of Ojibwe have filed as intervenors in opposition to the Line 3 replacement plan. Affected tribes have expressed concern about leaving the decaying line, which passes through the Fond du Lac and Leech Lake reservations, in the ground. Although the proposed new route does not cross reservation boundaries, it cuts through wild ricing lakes, hunting grounds, and other sacred areas to which indigenous people also have legal rights. And given that tribal members are disproportionately low-income, impacts on their well-being require careful consideration in the environmental review process.\n\nOxendine Molliver, who previously worked as a tribal liaison in Minnesota's Human Rights Department, was recruited and loaned to the Commerce Department late in the process to meet with the tribes and ensure their perspectives were included in the draft environmental impact statement. Her hiring was announced on March 28, a month and a half before the draft would be released, on May 15.\n\nWith only weeks to meet with 11 tribes and incorporate their concerns, Oxendine Molliver began flying to tribal areas around the state. \"I thought better late than never. I came in thinking really optimistically,\" she said. \"No one's going to be pro-pipeline, but how can we get it transparent, so their story is told in the document?\"\n\nThe meeting that led Enbridge to report her to the governor's office was on May 31, with the Minnesota Chippewa tribe. Oxendine Molliver introduced herself as a member of the Lumbee tribe from North Carolina: \"As a working mother and as an activist and as someone who wants to participate, I am honored to see you all make that happen for your families, and I am honored by the gentle way you have pushed the systems in which you have to work.\"\n\n\"Folks [have] said to me offline, 'I don't know how you do it. I don't know why as a native you even want to discuss the pipeline or be involved at any level on a project like that,'\" she said. \"You've got to infiltrate - you've got to be part of the system. We need more leaders, we need more people who are qualified who have the traditional knowledge, who have the sovereign knowledge, who have the language, culture - we need those folks to be in the systems with which we have to operate.\"\n\nShe told attendees that the draft environmental impact statement did not offer any opinions, only facts that could guide decisions. However, she assured the audience, \"I think that there are conclusory comments there if we really listen.\" She read aloud a portion of the draft:\n\nAny route, route segment, or system alternative would have a long-term detrimental effect on tribal members and tribal resources. The impacts cannot be categorized by duration (short-term or permanent) or by extent (region of interest, construction work area, permanent right-of-way). It is also not possible to determine which alternative is better when each alternative affects tribal resources, tribal identity, and tribal health.\n\nIf Enbridge had had its way , there would be no environmental impact statement at all. The process is not always required for pipelines and is frequently controversial. In 2015, a Minnesota court sided with environmental groups and forced the state to undertake the impact statement process for both Line 3 and another controversial proposed Enbridge pipeline, Sandpiper, which would have transported oil obtained via fracking from North Dakota's Bakken region. After years of pushback from indigenous and environmental opponents, Enbridge axed the Sandpiper project in fall 2016.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers launched an environmental impact statement for the Dakota Access Pipeline, at the height of the NoDAPL movement. The process, which would have delayed construction, was effectively canceled by President Donald Trump when he took office in January.\n\nBy June, trains loaded with pipes began rolling into Minnesota. A final decision from the state about whether Enbridge's Line 3 replacement can be built isn't expected until April 2018. Photo: Provided by Sheila Lamb\n\nBy June, trains loaded with pipes began rolling into Minnesota. A final decision from the state about whether Enbridge's Line 3 replacement can be built isn't expected until April 2018.\n\nAfter being sidelined, Oxendine Molliver spent meeting after meeting ushering guests to the refreshments, but at a final meeting held just for tribal members, on June 27, she was struck by images presented by Sheila Lamb, who is Ojibwe and Cherokee and has long been involved in environmental activism. They showed long lines of pipe being transported by truck and rail, and stacked inside a fence.\n\n\"There are staging areas already,\" Lamb said, according to a transcript of the proceedings. \"The newest one is between Kettle River and Rice. It is a huge fenced area with barbed wire on top, the whole nine yards, where they're taking the pipes to. We're talking trucks running every 10 to 15 minutes carrying in pipes. As of yesterday, there were 35 carloads of pipes just that we could count sitting right in Carlton.\"\n\n\"Is this already a done deal?\" Lamb asked the Commerce Department officials. Her question touched issues that extended beyond the scope of the environmental impact statement. Enbridge has already started construction in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, as well as on the 12-mile segment in Wisconsin. Minnesota is the last state that hasn't granted regulatory approval, giving it huge sway in determining the future of the pipeline.\n\nJamie MacAlister, a project manager for the Commerce Department, replied to Lamb, \"[Decision-makers] don't know that there's pipes stacked up out here. In fact, I didn't know there was pipes stacked up out here until I came to this meeting.\" She added, \"Enbridge does not have any permits. They're not allowed to do any construction until they receive those permits.\"\n\nIndeed, Enbridge lacked any permit to begin building the pipeline. But that didn't mean the company couldn't start getting ready. It had received five construction stormwater permits from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in 2015 for Line 3 storage yards along the proposed routes.\n\nBut Oxendine Molliver says the Commerce Department avoided making that clear. A few weeks after the meeting, she arranged a sit-down with Lamb and the department's commissioner, Mike Rothman, who expressed concern and told Lamb the department would look into the issue, according to Lamb and Oxendine Molliver. Shortly afterward, Oxendine Molliver said she was told by two Commerce Department officials that Enbridge did have permits, but the department was \"keeping it on the down-low.\"\n\nWhile construction of the pipeline itself still required the Public Utilities Commission's approval, Oxendine Molliver said she \"was horrified\" by the department's lack of transparency in response to questions from tribal members. She requested that the staging issue be noted in the EIS, but was rebuffed.\n\nAs the department began to finalize the text, she noticed other issues that tribal members had raised were missing from the document. In May, the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa contacted the Minnesota Department of Transportation after hearing that highway construction had begun on top of a native cemetery. After halting the project, the agency found human remains at the construction site. The burial site is not far from Enbridge's preferred pipeline route. Tribal members expressed concern about the adequacy of gravesite databases and the cumulative impact of seeing relatives' graves desecrated alongside construction of an unwanted pipeline. Oxendine Molliver asked that language be added to the text.\n\nOther issues were described in ways that failed to convey why they were meaningful to communities near the pipeline route. The draft included a section on the history of the Sandy Lake Ojibwe community, for example, describing how in 1850, thousands of Ojibwe were forced to migrate from Wisconsin in order to receive the annual supplies promised to them in treaties; when only three days' worth of supplies arrived, hundreds of people died. The draft did not mention that the group's descendants still live in the area, many of them in poverty. And a reader would have to compare maps to understand that the pipeline would pass near Sandy Lake, cutting across the route native community members use to reach another Ojibwe community to the south.\n\nAnd there were things left undone, Oxendine Molliver said. The June 27 meeting with tribal members had not been transcribed, and she said her communications with Commerce officials suggested comments collected there would not be reviewed or incorporated. Broader questions she raised were dismissed. Would the document address the cost to taxpayers of legal actions taken by environmental and indigenous groups related to the pipeline? Would it note that transporting new tar sands oil into the country conflicts with state initiatives, such as Dayton's membership in the U.S. Climate Alliance ?\n\nIn her last days as tribal liaison, Oxendine Molliver began hearing complaints from Commerce Department management. She was asked to cancel a planned trip to visit a reservation. She was pulled into a meeting and told that they weren't sure it was working out. She saw all this as retaliation. As the final version of the EIS was sent to consultants to be finalized, without many of the changes she'd requested, she submitted her resignation letter.\n\n\"My best-case scenario was they were going to do this really awesome environmental impact statement, and the facts would be just so staggering,\" Oxendine Molliver said. \"I thought if you have this document, and the tribes have intervened, you can't put your finger over your ears and be like lalalala for too long.\"\n\nAt the meeting that led Enbridge to complain about Oxendine Molliver, Winona LaDuke, a longtime environmental activist who played a key role in the movement to kill Sandpiper, described her takeaways from the draft environmental impact statement. \"When you go all the way through it, it says, we heard you. We heard that your people are hurting. We heard that your people can barely hang on. We heard that this is the only land you have. We heard that this is the only wild rice you have. We heard that your communities are already under a lot of duress. We heard that your communities are already sick from contaminants,\" she said. \"But mitigation is gonna be good.\n\n\"We don't want to throw down a camp like Standing Rock, but this is not Morton County - you're not getting another pipeline through here,\" she added. \"And there are hundreds of Ojibwe people and thousands of other people that are going to stop that line if you approve a permit. So we'd just like to stop it before we get to that.\"\n\nOpponents of Enbridge Line 3 publicly launched two camps on Wednesday, one on the White Earth reservation and another near the Fond du Lac reservation.\n\nThe final decision on the pipeline isn't expected until next April.\n\nTop photo: Enbridge is already storing pipes along the proposed route in Minnesota, despite lacking approval to build the new Line 3 pipeline.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "A Native American Activist Followed Her Mother's Footsteps to Standing Rock. Now She Faces Years in Prison.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOglala Lakota Sioux activist Red Fawn Fallis pleaded guilty to two federal felonies, all but assuring she will receive a substantial prison sentence.\n\nPart 11\n\nAfter spending a year in jail awaiting trial, Oglala Lakota Sioux activist Red Fawn Fallis pleaded guilty last week to two federal felonies related to her arrest while protesting the Dakota Access pipeline. As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped the most serious charge against her, which would have carried a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence with the possibility of life imprisonment.\n\nFallis was arrested on October 27, 2016, during a large-scale law enforcement operation to evict pipeline opponents from a camp alongside North Dakota Highway 1806. After officers tackled Fallis and pinned her on the ground facedown, they allege that she fired three shots from a revolver underneath her stomach, which did not result in any injuries. Last month, The Intercept revealed that the gun in question belonged to a paid FBI informant who was in a romantic relationship with Fallis. The informant, Heath Harmon, had infiltrated the protest camps starting in August 2016 and was near Fallis's side for much of the day leading up to her arrest. Red Fawn Fallis stands outside the federal courthouse in Bismarck, N.D., on Dec. 8, 2017. Photo: Tom Stromme/The Bismarck Tribune/AP As a condition of the plea bargain, federal prosecutors dismissed the count of discharge of a firearm in relation to a felony crime of violence, and the state of North Dakota, which had previously charged Fallis with attempted murder, agreed not to reinstate or pursue any charges related to the incident. Prosecutors have recommended Fallis receive a seven-year sentence, although U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland can still impose up to 10 years in prison based on Fallis's guilty plea to civil disorder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Fallis's attorneys are recommending a sentence of 21 to 27 months, including one year of time served.\n\nRed Fawn Fallis stands outside the federal courthouse in Bismarck, N.D., on Dec. 8, 2017.\n\nIn a statement explaining Fallis's decision to accept the plea deal, the Water Protector Legal Collective cited several negative pretrial rulings issued by Hovland, as well as the likelihood of jury bias based on a survey of potential jurors revealing strong antagonistic feelings toward anti-pipeline protesters. U.S. Attorney David Hagler declined to comment for this story. A Morton County Sheriff's Department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile law enforcement frequently cited Fallis's case to advance a narrative of anti-pipeline protesters as violent extremists, her supporters see her legal plight as only the latest episode in the U.S. government's long history of hostility toward indigenous people who push back against powerful government and corporate interests. More than 50 people turned out to support Fallis at her federal hearing in Bismarck on January 22; many expressed sadness and outrage about her likely prison sentence.\n\n\"As indigenous people, we're simply not allowed to act in defense of our children, land, or traditions without incurring severe punishment,\" said Eryn Wise, a member of the Jicarilla Apache and Laguna Pueblo nations who worked with Fallis at Standing Rock. \"We're horrified they took another person from us who we may not get back for a long time.\" Law enforcement officers move in to force Dakota Access pipeline protesters off private land in North Dakota on Oct. 27, 2016, where they had camped to block construction. Photo: Mike McCleary/The Bismarck Tribune/AP\n\nLaw enforcement officers move in to force Dakota Access pipeline protesters off private land in North Dakota on Oct. 27, 2016, where they had camped to block construction.\n\nFallis's arrest in October 2016 occurred amid a highly militarized police raid on land that would still belong to the Great Sioux Nation had the Fort Laramie treaties of 1851 and 1868 been honored. In a pretrial motion, Fallis's attorneys attempted to raise the issue in her case, arguing that the government had a burden to establish the law enforcement operation as lawful by addressing treaty rights in court. But Hovland refused to allow consideration of this broader historical context, instead making several orders to limit the case's scope. \"This is not a complex case,\" Hovland insisted in a January 2 order .\n\nFallis's attorneys also filed several motions asking the government to disclose information related to the sweeping surveillance activities of public law enforcement and private security contractors hired by the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. Drawing in part on stories and documents published by The Intercept, they argued that Fallis's case could not be considered apart from this intrusive intelligence gathering, given that an undercover informant employed by the FBI had initiated a relationship with Fallis, and then made available the gun she was accused of firing.\n\nAs The Intercept previously reported , Harmon said he was recruited by the FBI after approaching his brother, a Bureau of Indian Affairs police officer, about \"being an observer\" of the protest movement. He gave conflicting accounts about the gun. On the morning after Fallis's arrest, he filed a report with the Mandan Police Department claiming it had been stolen two to three weeks prior. Later, in an interview with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, he said he'd last seen the weapon a few days before Fallis's arrest, having left it in her trailer at the water protectors' Rosebud Camp.\n\nDefense lawyers for Fallis sought additional materials regarding Harmon's activities as an informant, contending that prosecutors had only turned over \"sparse summaries\" of his communications with the FBI rather than the more detailed reports that likely existed if the bureau followed its standard protocols. They also requested information on other covert operatives at Standing Rock. In a pretrial hearing, one of the officers who helped arrest Fallis had testified that law enforcement received a briefing on the morning of October 27, 2016, from either a law enforcement or private security infiltrator who was posing as a protester. Hovland ruled against these requests for discovery information.\n\nDefense filings suggest the documents turned over by the government still included some new information on Harmon's activities. He had been \"instructed to collect information on potential violence, weapons, and criminal activity,\" a defense motion noted, adding that Harmon's FBI contacts had recommended that he receive extra compensation to keep him \"motivated for future taskings.\" The defense motion suggested that Harmon had been slated to testify against Fallis had her case gone to trial as scheduled.\n\nAdditional discovery requests rejected by Hovland pertained to the activities of private security agencies. Fallis's attorneys had challenged the legality of police operations at Standing Rock due to law enforcement's close collaboration with TigerSwan, a security firm hired to protect the pipeline. An ongoing lawsuit filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board alleges that TigerSwan illegally provided security and investigative services in the state after having been denied a license to do so. A civil trial in that case has been scheduled for October 2018.\n\nFollowing The Intercept's publication of a \" links chart \" prepared by a North Dakota fusion center identifying Fallis as a leader of the protest movement more than seven weeks prior to her arrest, defense lawyers asked the judge to compel the government to turn over all intelligence collected about Fallis and her activities. The judge ordered the government to \"disclose all relevant information\" concerning Fallis, including but not limited to her placement on the chart - but such disclosure will no longer be required given Fallis's decision to accept the government's plea offer.\n\nAn activist holds a sign outside the Army Corps of Engineers' office to protest the Dakota Access pipeline, March 10, 2017, in Washington, D.C.\n\nAmong the water protectors who gathered at Standing Rock, Fallis was known for her work as a medic and mentor to younger activists. According to Mia Stevens, a family friend, Fallis had dedicated her work to her late mother, Troy Lynn Yellow Wood, a prominent activist with the American Indian Movement.\n\nFounded in 1968, AIM fought for the legal rights and cultural survival of indigenous people. According to Phyllis Young, a Standing Rock Sioux tribal member and longtime AIM member, Yellow Wood was at the center of many of the group's struggles and helped to establish Women of All Red Nations, which fought for an end to forced sterilization of indigenous women, among other causes.\n\nBy traveling to Standing Rock, Fallis was almost literally following in her mother's footsteps. In 1974, Young said, members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe invited AIM to an area at the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers known as Sacred Stone, which would later become the site of the first NoDAPL camp.\n\nUntil the 1978 passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, it was illegal for indigenous people to practice many of their traditional spiritual ceremonies. Standing Rock traditionalists decided to carry out a pipe ceremony at the site and sought AIM's protection to do so. Yellow Wood was among the AIM members who responded to that call, Young said.\n\nMany of Fallis's supporters contend that her stature as a politically active indigenous woman played a central role in drawing the attention of law enforcement. \"They just could not stand for us as Indians to talk back to them, and most of all, they couldn't stand for us as women to be talking back to them,\" Young said.\n\nIn early May, Fallis was granted a three-day furlough from jail to attend a memorial in Denver for her mother and grandmother. Young, who accompanied her to the ceremony, said Fallis had a emotional reunion with family members before receiving blessings at traditional ceremonies organized on her behalf. \"They honored her far into night,\" Young said.\n\nBut while an older generation of AIM activists sees Fallis as having carried on the work of the organization, her case also represents a continuation of the infiltration that created fissures within AIM in the 1970s. Standing Rock Sioux tribal member Ladonna Allard, who hosted the Sacred Stone Camp, says people in the movement are \"trying to deal with the whole fact of Heath Harmon and how he was able to get so close to everybody.\"\n\nAfter spending a year in jail following her arrest, Fallis was transferred to a halfway house in Fargo. Earlier this month, federal marshals re-arrested her after she failed to attend a mandatory adult education course and returned late to the halfway house. At the January 22 hearing, both prosecutors and defense attorneys expressed supported for returning Fallis to the halfway house with the addition of GPS monitoring.\n\nWhile Fallis's case has been one of the highest profile among the hundreds filed against anti-DAPL protesters, she is not the only one to face harsh penalties for her role in the protests. On January 21, attorneys for Michael \"Rattler\" Markus, another pipeline opponent charged with federal crimes related to the October 27 raid, announced that they had arrived at a plea agreement with the U.S. government. Prosecutors will drop the most serious charge against Markus - use of fire to commit a federal felony offense - in exchange for his plea of guilty to civil disorder. Prosecutors and the defense are jointly recommending a prison sentence of 36 months.\n\nA sentencing hearing for Fallis is scheduled for May 31. Her attorneys intend to call several witnesses, defense attorney Bruce Ellison said at the hearing in Bismarck. Ellison is also a longtime attorney for Leonard Peltier, a member of AIM who was imprisoned for the killings of two FBI agents in the 1970s, in what many indigenous activists and human rights groups have labeled a wrongful conviction.\n\nAccording to Eryn Wise, a member of the International Indigenous Youth Council, the young people who grew to admire Fallis at Standing Rock have only grown more determined as they've followed her case, particularly given the urgency of climate change and other environmental degradation, as well as the prevailing sense that their traditional lands remain under occupation by the U.S. government.\n\n\"What's happened to Red Fawn has only inspired the youth to pursue this line of work more,\" Wise said, \"because they realize that without people standing up like she has, there won't be a future for anybody.\"\n\nTop photo: Danielle Giagnoli carries a sign in support of Red Fawn Fallis during a \"Stand With Standing Rock\" demonstration against the Dakota Access pipeline in Santa Ana, Calif., Nov. 26, 2016.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Stealing Children to Steal the Land\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nNaomi Klein speaks to the legendary Manuel family about the uncovering of a mass grave of 215 Indigenous children.\n\nLast month, the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation uncovered a mass grave of 215 children on the grounds of a former residential school in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nThis week on Intercepted: Naomi Klein speaks with residential school survivor Doreen Manuel and her niece Kanahus Manuel about the horrors of residential schools and the relationship between stolen children and stolen land. Doreen's father, George Manuel, was a survivor of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, where unmarked graves of children as young as 3 years old were found. Kanahus's father, Arthur Manuel, was also a survivor of the Kamloops residential school. This intergenerational conversation goes deep on how the evils of the Kamloops school, and others like it, have reverberated through a century of Manuels, an experience shared by so many Indigenous families, and the Manuel family's decadeslong fight to reclaim stolen land.\n\nWarning: This episode contains highly distressing details about the killing, rape, and torture of children.\n\nIf you are a former residential school student in distress, or have been affected by the residential school system and need help, you can contact the 24-hour Indian Residential Schools Crisis Line: 1-866-925-4419\n\nAdditional mental-health support and resources for Indigenous people are available here .\n\n[Musical introduction.]\n\nNaomi Klein: Welcome to Intercepted, I'm Naomi Klein, guest-hosting this special episode.\n\nFirst, a warning. This episode contains highly distressing details about the killing, rape, and torture of children. If you are a survivor and need to talk, there is contact information in the show notes.\n\nI am speaking to you from unceded Coast Salish territory in what is now known as British Columbia. The land where I live is the traditional territory of the Shíshálh Nation.\n\nThese kinds of land acknowledgements are so common in Canada that they have become a kind of bureaucratic formality. They are spoken at the start of pretty much every public gathering. They are the first words on the website of my son's elementary school. They are affixed to email signatures of public officials and university professors.\n\nAnd often, these acknowledgements are heartfelt. But too rarely do we settlers think about what they actually mean.\n\nIf we are on Indigenous land, and those lands are unceded, that means they were never sold or surrendered under war or treaty. Which means that the underlying title of these lands is still held by their original inhabitants. Which begs the question: Why am I not acknowledging that with more than words? Why do I pay taxes to the municipal, provincial, and federal governments - instead of to the Shíshálh Nation?\n\nAn even more troubling question might be: Why was this land available to me and my family? What cleared it of its original inhabitants, moved them onto reserve, and in too many cases, onto the streets? What was the precise mechanism of land dispossession?\n\nThere is no one answer to that question. A labyrinth of laws and ordinances did much of the work, unilaterally adopted and coercively enforced. But that's not all it took. And part of the answer to the question of how this land was cleared arrived almost exactly two weeks ago, when, a few hours' drive away, a mass grave was discovered.\n\nCNN: The discovery is astounding, and so too the anguish, leaving the community members in much of Canada reeling. The remains of 215 children -\n\nWBUR: - whose remains were found in a mass grave at a former residential school in British Columbia -\n\nFrance24: - found at a mass grave in the Kamloops Indigenous school shocked and saddened the nation.\n\nThe unmarked grave, we learned, contains the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old. It is on the grounds of a former school that was run by the Catholic Church, called the Kamloops Indian Residential School. It was a huge institution and Indigenous students were sent there from across the province and even beyond, including from where I live.\n\nTwo weeks have passed, but the revelation that there is a mass grave at a school that operated well into the 1970s is still incredibly raw and shocking. To be clear: It was not a shock that residential schools were violent, twisted, sinister places. Canadians knew this already because we have been told many times. A massive class action lawsuit against the government by 86,000 residential school survivors ended in a settlement agreement - a settlement that included the creation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2008. In 2015, the TRC issued its final report.\n\nThe findings were harrowing, and we heard all about it.\n\nSen. Murray Sinclair: Over the time of our mandate, the commission heard statements from survivors, gathered documents, and worked to create a number of calls to action aimed at addressing the damage that was done. The calls to action are centered around a core challenge in Canadian society: a broad lack of understanding of the unjust and violent circumstances from which modern Canada has emerged, and how the legacy of residential schools is part of that history, and of our country today.\n\nNK: We heard about Indigenous children ripped from their parents, separated from siblings and relatives, beaten and whipped for speaking their language. We heard about priests and nuns who told children that their ceremonies, their art forms, their parents, their grandparents, their ways of knowing were not just wrong but satanic, a sure route to hell.\n\nThe TRC report told of young bodies, ravaged by starvation-level rations; of days filled with forced manual labor; of braids of hair chopped off on arrival; of thin school uniforms wholly inadequate for frigid Canadian winters. It told of TB and other infectious diseases left to rampage through the schools.\n\nWe heard about the systemic sexual violence - the rapes - by priests, Catholic brothers, and nuns. One school, St. Anne's in Ontario, had a crank-operated electric chair.\n\nNow this did not take place in a few dark corners where no one was looking. It took place on an industrial scale: 150,000 Indigenous children went through Canada's residential school system over a century and half. And this was official state policy: enrollment in the schools became mandatory in 1920.\n\nWhen the TRC issued that final report, it described this deliberate attempt by church and state to destroy Indigenous peoples' culture and group coherence as \"cultural genocide.\"\n\nBut Murray Sinclair, the respected Indigenous judge who chaired the TRC, insisted that he had not actually been able to do his job - that being to uncover the full truth. Indeed, he had only scratched the surface.\n\nMS: The one aspect of residential schools that really proved to be quite shocking to me, personally, was the stories that we began to gather of the children who died in the schools - of the children who died, sometimes deliberately, at the hands of others who were there, and in such large numbers. Survivors talked about, during the time that they were there, about children who suddenly went missing. Some of the survivors talked about witnessing children being buried in large numbers into mass burial sites.\n\nNK: The survivors kept saying it. The trouble was proving it. The TRC's mandate was to document the abuses at the schools, and to chart a path towards reconciliation. It was not set up to investigate potential mass murder or negligent homicide of children, nor did it have the financial resources or legal powers for such an undertaking. Yet that is precisely where the testimonies of survivors were leading - to crimes against humanity under cover of education.\n\nIn 2009, one year into the Commission's work, Sinclair and his colleagues requested $1.5 million to follow the leads about the existence of mass burial sites on school grounds. The government of Canada, then headed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, shut them down, actively choosing to keep the nation's crimes buried.\n\nHere is Murray Sinclair again:\n\nMS: We had no expectation that this would be a part of the work that we were doing, so we asked the government to allow us to conduct a fuller inquiry into that part of the work of the TRC in order to explore that on behalf of the survivors and Canadian public. We submitted a proposal, because it was not within our mandate and we asked that it be funded by the government. And that request was denied. And so, largely, we did what we could, but it was not anywhere near what we needed to accomplish and what we needed to investigate.\n\nNK: The fourth volume of the final TRC report is entitled \"Missing Children and Unmarked Burials,\" and it contains many more questions than answers. That's because so many children died inside these institutions - at many times the rates outside of them - that the religious orders who ran them stopped keeping official count, the ultimate expression of their disdain for Indigenous life. The TRC was able to identify 4,100 children who died while attending the schools, but Sinclair now estimates that the true number could be 15,000 - or even more.\n\nUnable to uncover the full truth - which is, after all, the purpose of a truth commission- the TRC called for a full investigation of potential burial sites, as well as efforts to identify remains. And it called on religious orders and all branches of governments to unseal their records relating to these deaths.\n\nWhen he took office in 2015, Justin Trudeau, promised to make justice for First Nations his government's top priority. And when he issued an apology to survivors of residential schools, he wept:\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau: On behalf of the Government of Canada and of all Canadians, that this burden is one that you no longer have to carry alone.\n\nNK: And yet, in the six years since the TRC's report - years the Trudeau liberals have been in continuous power - only 10 of its 94 calls to action have been completed, and virtually no actions have been taken to get at the truth of those missing children: how many, where they are, who they were, and how they died.\n\nIt was in that torturous context that some Indigenous communities took matters into their own hands. Tired of waiting, the tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation hired experts in ground-penetrating radar to examine the land surrounding the former Kamloops Residential School. That's how it found evidence of those 215 children's remains. The search of the property is ongoing, which means there may well be more macabre discoveries in store.\n\nAnd not only in this one community in British Columbia: With federal funding finally flowing, other First Nations have begun their own searches. The Kamloops school, after all, was just one of 139 residential schools investigated by the TRC, and Murray Sinclair says that there were actually 1,300 such institutions across the country, many of them privately run.\n\nHere is Sinclair again:\n\nMS: We know that there were probably lots of sites similar to Kamloops that are going to come to light in the future. And we need to begin to prepare ourselves for that. Those who are survivors of the residential schools, including the intergenerational survivors need to understand that this evidence is important to make available to Canada so that Canada can understand the magnitude of what it is that they did and what it is that they contributed to.\n\nSince the revelation of what was discovered at Kamloops has come to light, I have been inundated with phone calls from survivors, by the dozens if not hundreds, now. They've called me often just to cry, just to tell us, \"I told you so. I told you that this had happened. And now we're beginning to see it.\" And in their voices I can hear not only the pain and the anguish, but also the anger that they were feeling about the fact that nobody believed them when they told those stories.\n\nNK: That anguish is surfacing across Canada, this nation that sits atop so many First Nations. The anguish can be heard in ceremonies in cities, towns, and reserves [sounds of a mass drumming circle], in a mass drumming circle held on the Canada-U.S. border; [sounds of horns honking] in convoys honking as they drive past the Kamloops school. It can be seen in the mountains of teddy bears, flowers, and in rows of tiny shoes lined up in front of government houses and on the sites of former residential schools.\n\nAnd there is plenty of rage. The Trudeau government is under fire and so is the Vatican.\n\nAhead of the July 1 holiday weekend, #CancelCanadaDay has been trending. And hundreds of professors at Toronto's Ryerson University, named after a key architect of the residential school system, have begun referring to their institution as X University. Last week, protestors pulled a monument of Ryerson to the ground and the statue's head showed up on a stick on an Indigenous blockade called 1492 Land Back Lane.\n\nIn short, Canada - the good, the benign, the smug - is having an identity crisis. As well it should.\n\nSteve Paikin [The Agenda]: If Canada was able to look away about the tragic legacy of the Indigenous residential schools in this country, that's clearly no longer true.\n\nNK: The question is: How deep will it go?\n\nDuring these weeks of hand-wringing, one topic that has received less attention is \"Why?\"\n\nWhy did the state and church collaborate in these machineries designed to break the spirit and unmake the identities of 150,000 children? What did that cruelty serve?\n\nThe surface answer is uncontested. In the infamous words of former Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, the role of the residential school was to \"take the Indian out of the child.\"\n\nFather Carion, an early principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School definitely got that memo. He wrote: \"We keep constantly before the mind of the pupils the object which the government has in view ... which is to civilize the Indians and to make them good, useful, and law-abiding members of society.\"\n\nBut is that the whole story? Did all of this violence really flow from the idea that Indigenous people needed to be \"civilized\" in order to save their souls? Or did that racism, that white supremacy, serve some other purpose as well?\n\nThere is one sentence in the multiple-volume Truth and Reconciliation Commission report that provides an answer - an explanation for the deeper \"why?\" behind these sinister schools.\n\nIt says this: \"The Canadian government pursued this policy of cultural genocide because it wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to Aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resources.\"\n\nIn other words, we are back where we started: with land.\n\nThis was not just about one culture thinking itself superior to another and imposing its ways through brutality - though it was certainly about that too. Underneath that supremacist logic, it was also all about land. About a fervent drive by European settlers to gain control over lands that were rich with precious metals they wanted to mine, and profitable trees they wanted to fell, and fertile soil they wanted to farm. Lands that, at least in British Columbia, had never been ceded. Lands that in other parts of the country, were covered by treaties that agreed to share the territory with settlers, not surrender it for limitless development and extraction.\n\nAnd one way to gain control over land that is occupied by other people is to shatter the social and familial structures of those people - alienate them from their languages, cultures, and traditional knowledge, all of which are intimately land based. Oh, and another way - maybe the most effective way to get the job done - is through sexual violence. Because nothing spreads shame, trauma, and substance abuse more effectively. And these schools were rape mines, generation after generation.\n\nAnother way of thinking about it is this: The torture at the schools was not sadism for its own sake but sadism in service of a broader, highly profitable purpose - land theft on a grand scale. The schools cleared the land more effectively than any bulldozer could.\n\nThat is what I want to talk about for the rest of the show with two extraordinary guests: The relationship between stolen children and stolen land, between unmarked mass graves and the colonial lie of empty lands.\n\nThese are vast subjects, so to bring them to a human scale, we are going to look at them through the lens of a single Secwepemc family, the First Nation on whose territory the mass grave was found - a family whose members were abused, through multiple generations, by the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Yet, nevertheless, a family at the absolute forefront of the struggle for Indigenous self-determination and land defense, in Canada and internationally: the legendary Manuel family.\n\nSome background: Before his death in 1989, George Manuel helped found the modern Indigenous rights movement, forging international alliances from Greenland to Guatemala. He was elected National Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations), he was president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, and was the founding president of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples. He wrote the landmark book \"The Fourth World,\" and was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize several times. George Manuel was also a survivor of the Kamloops residential school.\n\nHis son, Arthur Manuel, was a towering intellectual and strategist who wrote two key texts that function as roadmaps of decolonization: \"Unsettling Canada,\" published in 2015, and \"The Reconciliation Manifesto: Recovering the Land, Rebuilding the Economy.\" I was honored to write the foreword for both of those books and I reported on Arthur's creative legal work on many occasions. Arthur died suddenly and prematurely in 2017. Like his father and two siblings, he was a survivor of the Kamloops residential school.\n\nThough George and Arthur are the best known, they were part of a larger family of artists, writers, healers, and land defenders, all united by the core principle that Indigenous land title is non-negotiable - and that true justice will only come when settler states start returning large amounts of land to Indigenous jurisdiction.\n\nTwo of the carriers of that legacy are with me today: Doreen Manuel, George's daughter, is an award-winning filmmaker, educator, and multi-talented artist, currently serving as director of the Bosa Centre for Film and Animation at Capilano University. She is also a survivor of the Port Alberni residential school.\n\nKanahus Manuel, Arthur's daughter, is a Secwepemc land defender and co-founder of the Tiny House Warriors, a grassroots movement that has built solar power tiny homes on wheels and placed them in the path of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project. She is currently on trial for her land defense work, as are two of her sisters. Their trial is a reminder that even as politicians apologize for the crimes of residential schools, the underlying crime of Indigneous land theft is not history. It is very much a crime in progress.\n\nTo start us off, Doreen reads a passage about the Kamloops school from the biography of her father, \"From Brotherhood to Nationhood.\"\n\nDoreen Manuel: For nine-year-old Manuel, the personal struggle with the outside world began a few months later when a cattle truck pulled up to the reserve and the Indian agent called out the list of names of children who were to be shipped off to the Kamloops residential school. George Manuel's name was on the list. He was about to be thrown into what he later called \"the laboratory and the production line of the colonial system.\"\n\nThe arrival of the truck was a traumatic moment for the whole community. A Secwepemc woman who attended the school around the same time as Manuel recalled that many of the younger children viewed their forced departure as a punishment for something they had done wrong.\n\nThe Kamloops school was run by the Catholic oblate order who were assisted on the girls' side by the Sisters of St. Anne. Their monopoly over the Secwepemc would last until the 1960s and it was, as Manuel saw it, the greatest gift the Dominion of Canada made to the church.\n\nIn later years, he would suggest that Native people should launch a class action suit against the Vatican for the abuse generations of Indian children suffered at the hands of the priests, Catholic brothers, and nuns. That abuse included poor diet, a prescription of Indian language, forced labor, and a military-style discipline that was enforced by beatings.\n\nOne student of the Kamloops school recalls that the whole purpose of the institution seemed to be to crush the pride in themselves as Indians. Manuel recalled that there was so little time spent in actual learning that after two years at the school, he could only barely write his own name. What he and most other students remember most clearly and painfully about the school was not the hard work which, at times, was spurred on by beatings, but the hunger. As Manuel put it, \"Hunger is both the first and last thing I can remember about that school. Not just me. Every Indian student smelled of hunger.\"\n\nNK: Thank you, Doreen.\n\nDoreen Manuel, Kanahus Manuel, welcome to Intercepted and thank you for agreeing to speak to me during such a difficult time.\n\nDoreen, I'd like to start by asking you to share whatever feels appropriate about the Kamloops school and the space it occupied in your life while you were growing up.\n\nDM: My first memory of that school was visiting my older brothers and sister in that school with my mom.\n\nIt's important to understand that in my dad's time, he got taken there against his will and against the will of his family, and in my older brothers' and sister's time, and in my time, we were taken there because of assimilation that had already happened. You know, my mom and dad were both tortured in the schools they were in. And they knew how bad they were. And yet they took us there.\n\nPartly it was because we were starving. There wasn't enough food at home. I remember eating chicken feed, that was all I had to eat, all day long, for days. And it was because there was no food. We had eaten the chickens and there was nothing else to eat. And so that starvation came from all of the laws that the colonizers were placing on us. We weren't allowed to hunt or fish. So there was just no food to be had, even though the food was in the bushes and we could have gone and gotten it at any time if we were allowed to. Otherwise, if we tried, my parents would wind up in prison and we would wind up in residential school anyway.\n\nSo I remember visiting my brothers and sisters in there, and it was like visiting somebody in prison, the way my mom and I were treated as they brought us in there, and the visit was supervised. And then we left. And when they came out of there, they were different than when they went in. And in my experience, when I went, my brother Arthur actually taught me how to fight. He taught me how to punch and kick and I was 8 years old. And he was giving me fighting lessons. And really, it's one of the things that helped me survive in there because one of the first encounters I had was I was jumped by one of the girls. And it was because of his teachings that I was able to fend for myself as an 8-year-old child.\n\nYou know, we've always talked about graves. In fact, that's the basis of one of my first films, \"These Walls.\" I had a vision that I thought was an actual real experience, but the more I thought about it, I realized it wasn't. I was walking up the hallway at the residential school, that residential school with an elder, and she came up to a wall, and she touched it, and she said, \"I think this is the wall they're buried in.\" And she meant the babies, children and babies of the school.\n\nSo I went to the school and I walked the hallways looking for that exact same hallway, and I found the hallway but I couldn't find the wall, so I didn't understand it. But then I had a nightmare that was so real. I turned the two things into a short film called \"These Walls\" and it's about murdered and missing babies.\n\nGrace Dove as Mary [from \"These Walls\"]: I saw the babies.\n\nAndrea Menard as Claire [from \"These Walls\"]: What? What did you say?\n\nGD: I saw the babies. In the walls. [Crying hysterically.]\n\nNK: Doreen, I watched that film recently. It's so harrowing. And, of course, Murray Sinclair, the chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in his statement recently talked about how they had heard about infants.\n\nMS: Some of the survivors talked about infants who were born to young girls at the residential schools who had been fathered by priests, having those infants taken away from them and deliberately killed, sometimes by being thrown into furnaces, they told us.\n\nNK: I'm wondering if you believe that we haven't heard the worst yet?\n\nDM: No, no, you haven't heard the worst yet. My mom went to the residential school in Cranbrook. And she witnessed firsthand her close friend being murdered by a nun. The nun just threw that little girl down the stairs like a rag doll and her neck snapped.\n\nIn that same school, the girls didn't ever want to go into the infirmary, they never wanted to be sick. Because if you were sick, and you went in there, that's where you got raped. The priests would go one by one to the girls every night and rape every one of them. My mother got raped in there, and she watched her friends getting raped in there. And one of those women got pregnant. And then they threw her out of the school, they called her a whore.\n\nI was waterboarded in there. I was held under the water till I passed out. I was 8 years old. Well, the reason they did that to me was because I wet my bed. I wet my bed because I was scared. I had to fight for my life. I was just a little kid, I was frightened, I had no idea what was going on. I didn't know why dad left me in there; I didn't know where mom was. So I wet my bed every single night.\n\nThings went on in the bathroom that I heard about, like girls were raped in there, different things were happening to girls, if you got up at the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. So I didn't want to go in there. And I didn't. And they started strapping me for wetting my bed. And when that didn't work, it moved on to harsher and harsher punishments, until it got to that - just sheer frustration because they thought they could beat it out of me, beat a different behavior out of me.\n\nAnd this is my history. And that's just one experience of my own that I endured. And, you know, the things that my mom and dad talked about, the stories I've heard ... I interviewed a man in Vancouver here and he told me that he was one of the kids that buried the children, him and two other boys, that when a child died in that school, at nighttime, when everyone else was asleep, he had to go and wrap the body. And these two other boys, they were young teenagers, had to carry the body out, dig the grave, and put them in the grave. And he carries that memory, how many kids he had to do that for that they killed.\n\nAnd there was starvation. My mom told me she was on cook duty. And she'd go down extra early in the morning to try to pick as much mouse shit out of the oatmeal as possible before cooking it. Even when I went, it was like that. They didn't take the greatest care. There were mice and rats in those buildings and they were shitting all over, in the food, and that's the food we'd get. And if we didn't eat our porridge, our one scoop of porridge every morning, they'd save it for lunch. And that we'd have to eat at lunch. If we didn't finish it all at lunch, we'd eat it for dinner. And it would go on and on like that. So, you know, what are your choices? Eat that or starve.\n\nNK: Kanahus, I want to bring you into this conversation.\n\nThis huge red brick building was on your territory, on Secwepemc territory, and I was hoping you could just maybe describe about how it reverberated down to your generation and the space that building occupied in your life and imagination, knowing what it did to your father, and grandfather, and so many others.\n\nKanahus Manuel: This brick building is a massive brick building that in current day takes up a lot of space in the City of Kamloops. So as a child growing up, we always frequented the closest town, which was Kamloops, and we always saw that brick building, and we knew that was the Kamloops Indian Residential School. We knew our father attended Kamloops Indian Residential School. And we knew our grandparents also attended that. And that wasn't the only school. But that was the one that we saw every day, or almost every day, or every time we frequented that area.\n\nAnd the school, when it was formed, it wasn't just Secwepemc, it wasn't just the Indigenous people from from our area, it was the Okanagan, it was the Stellat'en, it was the Tsilhqot?in, it was the Dine'. It was all the surrounding nations and even other places across Canada where children were forced to go. So it's affected us a lot, and just the visual of having to see it every day impacts us on a daily basis.\n\nI raised four of my children out of that system and not putting them into any type of public school system because I felt that every single public school system ties to the residential school because it was a way to indoctrinate the colonial ways, and values, and education into the children, and I never wanted to push my children into that.\n\nDM: So those schools, they did a number of different things, like even without the abuse, the institutionalization of entire generations of a nation of people. It means the breaking and elimination of our family system. And, you know, you can compare our family system to any other family system, it was the same. It's where we learned how to care for one another, how to be a parent, how to love, how to build healthy boundaries, how to understand the world, and then they removed our culture and our language and replaced it with cultural shame. And all of the negative things that were told to us in the school like we're stupid, whores, no good for nothing, lazy. Those are the everyday messages we received, instead of, \"You are loved, you are kind, you are wonderful, you can do anything that you want in this world.\" The messages that white kids were getting were completely opposite to the messages we were getting.\n\nAnd when you raise children like that, they come out of the school and you see the effects of it. You know, I myself, many of us in the family, struggled with substance abuse. And we went through a period in our younger life where we really, really struggled hard just to try to break that messaging. And then what happens is then you turn into a workaholic perfectionist, and you work yourselves to death. So in our family nobody lives past 67. That's pretty young to die. Nobody lives past 67.\n\nNK: Kanahus, do you feel comfortable talking about some of the intergenerational trauma that gets passed on? We hear that phrase all the time. But sometimes this kind of clinical language drains the words of meaning. What does it actually mean to be in a community where so many of the adults went to those schools, and grew up with that abuse, and grew up with those systems of shaming and separation?\n\nKM: One of the things that is very important for us, just as our Manuel family, too, is to talk about that trauma that comes out of that school, the sexual trauma, the abuse, like my auntie Doreen was just talking about. But a lot of the children that went to the schools were sexually abused: the boys were raped, the girls were raped, and those are the things that we really need to talk about in order for us to heal. We need to talk about the abuse, we need to expose the abusers in order for these same things to not happen to our family.\n\n[Words in Secwepemc.]  I can't speak my language, I can say words, but that's the impact that drives so deep in my soul that I want to speak my language so bad and I'm speaking the language of our colonizers, of the enemy that is still committing genocide on us. And our songs and dances, one of the things that they ripped from us, they didn't want us to sing. They didn't want us to dance, and even now, to this day, when we're reviving our Secwepemc songs and dances, and we're calling the women, \"Come, dance with us! We know these dances and songs now,\" [a Secwepemc song plays quietly], even some of the women that went to residential school or those men that went to residential school, it's still so hard. They want to dance so hard, but they can't. It's that fear. And it's what they beat into our people.\n\nAnd this generation, and my generation, and as being a daughter of someone who was a residential school survivor, but became a strong, powerful Indigenous leader for our nation - for our land - and always connecting it back to the land, and I think that's the biggest part that has helped heal me and my generation, is just hearing the words of my grandfather.\n\nGeorge Manuel: Expand the powers that you have. Show us we can control our fishing rights, show us we can control our hunting rights, show us we can control education, show us we can control our whole destiny through our own political institution.\n\nKM: And my father:\n\nArthur Manuel: We cannot say we're part of Canada when we're systematically made poor because they do not recognize that we own our own land, our own territory.\n\nKM: How our family feels and thinks when they stand up for the land, it empowers us. It gives us the power. What gives us more power than the next people that are dealing with that abuse and that intergenerational trauma and effects, it's when we're able to stand up and fight back.\n\nAnd we know that Canada is the abuser. It's the biggest abuser out there to even force our families into these schools. Let's expose it. Let's point the finger at them and say, \"No, these policies, these laws, these are all very illegal, they're outdated, these are human rights violations. And what is the solution? Well, you ripped us off the land to put us in those schools. That's why. You ripped us off our land; that's where our culture comes from. You ripped us off our land; that's where our language comes from, our family systems comes from.\"\n\nAnd so it's the land that we need to continue to focus on, that's going to be what's going to heal all the atrocities that came from that residential school, is by going back to the land, by fighting for the land, because the land is what's going to revive everything for us. Once we have our land, we have enough land base to practice our culture and our language.\n\nNK: There's a huge amount of anger being directed at the Catholic Church, especially after the Pope expressed his sorrow about the mass grave in Kamloops, but stopped well short of issuing an actual apology.\n\nKanahus, your father wanted an apology and a renunciation from this Pope, but not only for residential schools. Before he died, Arthur wrote this very powerful open letter to Pope Francis. Can you read a part of it for us?\n\nKM: \"I'm a member of the Secwepemc Nation from the Interior of British Columbia, Canada, Canada's most Western province, and we are still fighting against the bitter legacy of European colonialism that has been given a legal basis by one of your predecessors Pope Nicholas IV. Pope Nicholas IV charters gave the Church's blessings to the slave trade and legitimized genocide against what he described as \"pagans and Saracens,\" which included everyone in the world other than the European Christians. This began the organized, international, European assault, with the goal of stripping the world of its wealth and reducing its people to servitude. The goal of raw theft and enslavement remained the same, and they are still the ultimate legal justification for European colonialism in the Americas as well as the ultimate constitutional basis for settler colonialism. That is why my people - and Indigenous peoples around the world - have asked you to publicly renounce the Doctrine of Discovery and the papal bulls of Pope Nicholas IV. You alone in the world have the power to do this, and such an act would help to restore the faith of many of my people and the justice of the church. It will also, in no small measure, assist us in winning justice here in Canada, because those church doctrines remain, more than 500 years later, the core legal justification for the confiscation of our land and subjugation of our peoples.\n\nNK: So there's finally a national discussion happening about residential schools. Some cities are even canceling Canada Day this year, which I think Arthur probably would have approved of. But Kanahus, you've been saying on social media that the discussion still isn't going far enough. And you wrote the other day, and I'll quote here, \"They took our kids to take land. Now, no one wants to remember that it was about the land.\"\n\nDoreen, what is still being missed, do you think, about the economic interests that the schools served, about the \"why\" behind these monstrous institutions?\n\nDM: Back then, with the residential schools, it was to break generations of children down, inflict cultural shame on them, make them not want to be Indigenous, take away the language, so any tie to the land. You remove the language, you remove this strong bond with the land, and then the culture, take that away. So you've got people not even wanting to look Indigenous.\n\nLook at how many billions, and billions, and billions of dollars the government steals off of our land and resources, and in usage, every single year. Of course it's about the land. You can't walk outdoors and not be taken care of by us. It's our resources and our land that pays for every single street, every single highway, every single lamppost, every single service that's offered to every single citizen, that's ours. And they're making use of it and then have the audacity to be racist against us, when they are living off of us. Their survival - every day - is because of us. Because of the theft that is still going on.\n\nKM: When all this news came out, even saying that this is the largest of all the residential schools in Canada, it's not a coincidence that the largest residential school in Canada is actually built and operated in the largest unceded lands in Canada. Secwepemc is 180,000 square kilometers of territory. This is unceded land: no treaty, no purchase, no land agreement, no cede or surrender with Great Britain, not with Canada, not with British Columbia. This land remains unceded and unsurrendered to this day, Secwepemc lands.\n\nAnd everything that Canada has done to usurp our lands, to commandeer our trade routes, all of this - to take control of our lands is to take control of our wealth. They built these schools to get access to the land, and to assimilate. And it was very important for them to assimilate and to indoctrinate, because we are warriors, we are land defenders, we are healers. It made us depend on that land. We depended on that land so much for our basic survival, for who we are. But they wanted to get to that land, and they wanted to log, and they wanted to mine, and they wanted to build all their highways, and their railways because those were all built while those kids were in that school, while the families were broken, because of the theft of their children.\n\nAll types of industry, that was their foot in the door, because they removed any type of resistance from that land. And that's when we first saw the first murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls, is when all of that came in, the gold mining, those were the first man camps that came in with those highways and railways; and then the laws, with the Indian Act, and forcing the reservation system and into these residential schools, it was all a part of a big policy to remove us off the territory.\n\nAnd my father was very clear when he told the world that we only live on 0.2 percent of our Indigenous territories.\n\nArthur Manuel: When you add up all the Indian reserves in Canada, all of them, we have 0.2 percent. That's how come we're poor. That means Canada and the province under the Queen owns 99.8 percent. That's why Ontario is rich, that's how come B.C.'s rich, is because those governments claim that.\n\nKM: You look at our territory and you look at that Kamloops Indian Residential School, they removed all of our people to that 0.2 percent because that Kamloops Indian Residential School was also located on the Kamloops Indian Reserve at that time. And what those schools did was they really tore down and tore apart the way that we governed ourselves, because as Indigenous people - and the majority of Indigenous people - we really follow our matrilineal line, where it's the females, it's the grandmothers, and the mothers, and the aunties, and the ones that really care for their nation and the health of their children and nation, that are really the decision makers when we talked about our governance. And now with this indoctrination with the residential school, we see a lot of that has switched, where it has really become this indoctrinated patriarchy that has affected our Indigenous communities as well. And that comes from decision-makings when it comes to our lands.\n\nDM: One of the most difficult things that I personally endured as an Indigenous woman, that the residential school inflicted on Indigenous women, is that it reconditioned the way that men understood the woman's relationship to the family as leaders, and to the community as leaders. And I had gotten so stone cold in the residential school that I stopped crying at one point and I never shed another tear for a great deal of my life.\n\nAnd of all crazy things, that's what my dad liked the most about me. He always said I wasn't like the other women in the family. And so he trained me in leadership. But he trained me to be an organizer, and a planner, and a fundraiser, and because I followed him around everywhere, I learned how to speak. And I did learn all the other things my brothers learned, but I didn't learn it because he was teaching it to me, I learned it because he was role-modeling it to me. That was a different way than my brothers.\n\nAnd I always remember this thing my dad told me. Him and I were kind of arguing about something - something ridiculous - and I turned to him and I said, \"What are you trading me for? What position are you thinking I'll hold in leadership?\" And he turned to me, and he said, \"Oh, I'm not training you to be a leader. I'm training you to support a leader. I'm training you to marry a leader and support that person and build and turn them into a leader.\" And I got really offended. And he said, \"I don't mean to offend you,\" he said, \"but look at how many women chiefs there are.\" And at that time, there was next to none. And he said, \"I don't know how fast our men are changing to accept a woman leader. And I don't want to train you for something that won't exist, maybe even in your lifetime.\"\n\nBut I think more women have to push themselves into that role, the role that they were born to serve in, and not allow this colonial way of thinking to seep in. We see things clearly. We see what we fight for, it's always in front of us, our children. And that reminds us of the children that will come.\n\nAnd some men are capable of doing that. But many are not. And that is the key to get us out of this trouble, is the fierce fight that has to take place and the focus that has to happen.\n\nKM: If we're talking about revival of our cultural ways and practices, if we're talking about people wanting to support Indigenous people, and solutions, and healing that comes apart with these residential schools, we have to talk about the land and we have to talk about the governance. We will remain connected to our lands forever and always - Secwepemc [words in Secwepemc]. My aunties, they made sure I know how to say that, \"Secwepemc territory forever and ever.\" And we know that by speaking our language, and all of these things that they tried to take from us, along with our lands, but the more that we fight for it, the more that we empower ourselves, and the more that we lead as an example, because some families aren't strong enough, because they've been abused so much by the system and by the state, by these residential schools, but we are strong enough, so we can lead, so we can help our people see it's our land, and I'm here dedicating my life to the land, here with my children on the frontlines fighting the Trans Mountain Pipeline because I believe so deep in my soul, that my family did the right thing by coming out of those residential schools and saying, \"No, we're gonna fight for our lands. And this is our contribution to our nation.\"\n\nNK: Kanahus, as you mentioned, being on the front lines of this huge struggle against a major pipeline expansion that would carry bitumen from the Alberta tar sands to the coast and go through many, many waterways in Secwepemc territory.\n\nThe last time I was in your territory, there was a huge gathering of people on the banks of the Thompson River, singing, and lighting a fire, and vowing to resist this pipeline. But the Canadian government has been pushing through since then; it has nationalized the pipeline, bought it from the American company, which backed out of the project, in part because of the economic uncertainty posed by the exercise of Indigenous title and rights.\n\nAnd so one of the cruelest I feel ironies of this moment is that on the day that the news came of the discovery of this mass grave in Kamloops, Kanahus, two of your sisters were in court in Kamloops defending themselves on charges related to their resistance to this pipeline, and you yourself are in court on other charges. The last time I saw you, your wrist had been broken by the police as part of a very rough arrest. What does it say that three Manuel daughters are in court on charges resisting this pipeline and what these schools were all about in the first place, which was dispossession from land?\n\nKM: As Indigenous people, we have a right to say no to these pipelines and these projects and to federal consultation meetings that they're trying to get Indigenous consent, but when we say no, we are criminalized. And it shows that these policies and laws, to silence Indigenous people are still systemic, it's still there in every fabric of Canadian society.\n\nThe RCMP played a big role in the removal of Indigenous children from their families. They're the ones that went to the communities and they actually physically removed the children from their communities and families and forced them onto the cattle trucks, however they were transporting the children. But still, to this day, the RCMP are still playing a really crucial role in the genocide of Indigenous peoples, because it's the colonization that is the act of war. And the colonization is the dispossession of Indigenous peoples from our lands.\n\nEven to this day, when we're talking about injunctions, the RCMP are the ones that are used to actually physically remove and arrest Indigenous peoples from the land, and put them in jail, and give them charges for obstruction of justice if they refuse to leave areas where injunctions are. I'm millimeters outside of the injunction zone. And these are illegal in that they are violating our international, Indigenous human rights, that we have rights to land and self determination.\n\nThis pipeline is tearing up the homes of Indigenous peoples up around the Alberta tar sands. They're dying of cancers at a rate no other Canadian will ever know, unless they live around the Alberta tar sands. This is how they want to kill the Indian, now, is destroy their land. They took them from the schools to destroy the Indian. Now they're taking the land from us, destroying as much as they can through their industries.\n\nNK: Do you feel something is shifting? Do you see more people making the connections between the schools, and the land, and the RCMP as you see these statues falling and these ceremonies happening? Are we in a true reckoning?\n\nDM: I think a lot of people are still fairly early in their wellness, because it was not that long ago that the apology came and a lot of people saw the apology from the government to us over residential school as just a farce.\n\nBut to me what I saw was that: OK, sure, it was a farce. Yeah, sure, it was a well-worded, very carefully, meticulously worded document that had a purpose from the government's point of view. From my point of view, it made it more known. People know what a residential school is now.\n\nFor instance, I went into the dentist's office over a year ago. Something about being in the dentist chair spurred a memory of being hurt at a dentist chair at residential school, and I started crying and I couldn't stop, but I didn't want the residential school to take another day from me, I didn't want to be ashamed of my grief and run out of there and then have to come back at another time. So when the dentist came in, I asked him, \"Do you know what a residential school is?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And I said, \"I was abused in a residential school and part of the abuse took place in a dentist chair, and I'm sitting in this dentist chair having a memory, but I still want you to fix my teeth. Can you do it?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And he was so gentle and kind through the whole process. He helped my healing process.\n\nSee, before the apology, I'm not sure that would have happened. Before all of the testimonies that were taken all across Canada were done, I'm not sure that would have happened. But that just happened not that long ago, where people were giving testimony. And, you know, this uncovering of these graves at the Kamloops residential school was actually supposed to happen a long time ago. I remember. I was living around there at that time when it was supposed to happen, and I was anticipating it. But it didn't happen then. So it's like it's waves that we're going through, and healing that we're going through.\n\nI don't think our fight is getting exactly easier. I think we're getting better at fighting. And with every time we get better at fighting, we teach the younger people how to get better at fighting. So I wouldn't say we're losing any ground, but it's a slow move forward.\n\nNK: Your family has been in the struggle through many generations, through so much terror and trauma. What is the through-line? What connects all these years of organizing and activism?\n\nDM: The common thread to me, of all of the work that my father and brothers have done, is working to create a future for the future generations. I mean, those are all strategies. But every strategy is put in place thinking about those future generations. How are we going to make sure that we don't lose more of our Aboriginal title of rights, lose more control over our education or lose more ground? To me, decision-making in the Indigenous community is simple: Hang on to the land and Aboriginal title and rights for the future generations. Arthur talked about it all the time. He wasn't doing that work for himself; he was doing it for his grandchildren that were yet to come.\n\nKM: I feel that Indigenous peoples have a big job to do. We can take all this time, a whole lifetime of healing. But I take what radical freedom-fighters teach me. And they say: No, what happens in 10 years, in revolutionary years should happen in two years. That's the type of speed that we need to be starting to work on if we're going to really see change in our generation. That's the revolutionary time that we are working in because the 500 years that they took from us, we gotta make that back. And it's work. It's every waking minute of your day that you are reversing what the Canadian government tried to do. And the way that we are reversing it is we're bringing back our ways and replacing it with our ways again.\n\nAnd so we have a lot of work. And this is urgent, crucial work that needs to be done, or else Canada will have accomplished its goal in eliminating us and assimilating us, exterminating us and disappearing us and making us Canadians. But we'll never ever, ever be a Canadian. Because as long as we're here, and as long as our blood continues to flow, and these creeks continue, and these rivers continue to flow, there will always be Secwepemc.\n\nWith these remains and this mass grave they're uncovering this for everybody to see. They wanted to cover us up, like my sister said. But we're the seeds, and we're growing, and there's nothing that they're going to do to stop this from happening.\n\nNK: That was land defender Kanahus Manuel and award-winning filmmaker, Doreen Manuel.

      "text": "Donald Trump's New Policies Could Make It Harder for Torture Survivors to Get Asylum\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA forensic evaluation by a doctor can be key for asylum-seekers to win their case. New detention and deportation policies may make the exams harder to get.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Twitter rants this weekend about \"dangerous caravans\" of migrants approaching the United States were followed by an announcement on Monday that the White House will push for legislation to make it harder to seek asylum in the United States. It's the latest in a string of decisions from the administration that have rattled the hopes of persecuted people looking for refuge in the country. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that he will get rid of a policy that allows asylum-seekers to have a full hearing before an immigration judge - his method of streamlining a backlogged asylum system that he claims is subject to \"rampant abuse and fraud\" and \"is being gamed.\"\n\nDespite the federal government's new public skepticism about asylum-seekers, many of them have endured unspeakable violence, leaving psychological and physical scars. For torture survivors in particular, a forensic evaluation by a doctor is one of the best ways to prove the harm they suffered before arriving in the U.S., providing professional documentation of the persecution they faced back home - and likely would still face if they returned.\n\nBut advocates and lawyers are worried that not enough people are getting access to physical and psychological exams in a timely manner, and that the Trump administration's policies to detain asylum-seekers by default and fast-track deportations are making the work more difficult.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nA forensic evaluation is not mandatory to file for asylum, and it doesn't mean it will be granted. But because they say it has become increasingly difficult to win an asylum case, more attorneys, like Jason Dzubow, a Washington-based immigration lawyer who blogs about asylum at The Asylumist , are seeking exams for their clients.\n\n\"For an asylum client who has visible evidence of torture or other harm, a forensic exam can make the difference between a grant and a denial,\" says Dzubow. \"A good forensic exam by a qualified physician demonstrates that the harm was caused by physical violence, as opposed to disease or even an accident. That type of solid evidence is very convincing to adjudicators, who rarely get strong corroborative evidence.\"\n\nThe majority of exams are performed pro bono by medical professionals who receive specialized training from organizations like Physicians for Human Rights, or PHR, the largest provider and coordinator of forensic evaluations in the U.S. for the past two decades. They receive between 60 to 100 forensic evaluation requests every month, about half of which are for psychological examinations. While most New York City-area clients will be seen because there's a density of providers who can perform forensic evaluations, fewer trained professionals exist in places like Houston or Los Angeles, says Homer Venters, of PHR. Around 90 percent of asylum-seekers who undergo a PHR evaluation are granted the right to remain in the United States, compared to just 43 percent overall. But Venters says that only about half of asylum-seekers manage to access a forensic evaluation at all.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions delivers a speech titled \"The Crisis Facing Our Asylum System\" at the Executive Office for Immigration Review, on October 12, 2017 in Falls Church, Virginia.\n\nDiego was 16 and working as a fruit vendor in El Salvador when MS-13 gang members beat him and left him for dead after he refused their attempts to recruit him.\n\n\"There were seven guys right there, including El Pilon\" - the local gang leader - \"with guns, machetes, everything,\" Diego told The Intercept in a phone interview. (\"Diego\" is a pseudonym, used to protect his family still in El Salvador.) \"They were beating me in my in face, in my stomach. One guy he hit me in the head really bad. When I started talking again, he cut my right hand with a machete. It was bleeding everywhere.\"\n\nDiego survived, but after another run-in with MS-13, in which he witnessed a colleague shot in the head, he fled, traveling undocumented through Guatemala to Mexico, then entered the U.S. and settled in Virginia, where he applied for asylum. Thirteen years after arriving, he now has a wife, two daughters, and a semblance of normalcy. But painful memories live vividly in his mind.\n\n\"It's really hard sometimes for me to speak about it because I try to forget everything and leave it behind, and just come into a new life,\" he said.\n\nAs many as 1.3 million torture survivors have arrived in the U.S. as refugees since 1975, according to the St. Paul, Minnesota-based Center for Victims of Torture. Around that time, survivors were from Vietnam and Southeast Asia; in the 1980s and 90s, from the Balkans, including Bosnia and Croatia; today, they come from all over, but most asylum grantees are from China and from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, three countries marked deeply by gang violence.\n\nThe number of asylum-seekers who claim to have survived torture is unknown. In fiscal year 2017, 54,853 people were referred to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for asylum interviews, and in 2016, the latest year for which data is available, 20,455 people were granted asylum in the U.S.\n\nAlison Beckman at the Center for Victims of Torture said her team has seen survivors with severe eye damage from being made to stare at the sun, ongoing pain from forced tooth extraction, and trauma from sexual violence. \"I had a client once who was handed a telephone and two relatives, his mother and his sister, were on the other line,\" she said. \"He was asked who should be the one tortured. [These are] impossible choices.\"\n\nForensic evaluations aim to prove that someone meets the definition of a refugee : a person who can't return home \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" Trained medical professionals will talk to asylum-seekers about what happened, before carefully examining mind and body. They hope to match marks on the body to the details of their testimony. Diego has at least seven scars from his torture, discolorations from machete stabbings and pistol beatings.\n\nSomeone might have trouble with their memory, or with testifying about their experience consistently, because of their experience. That could lead to questions around their credibility or raise suspicions that they are lying, said Judy London, a lawyer and teacher at the Asylum Clinic, a joint project between UCLA School of Law and Los Angeles-based law firm Public Counsel.\n\n\"An expert evaluation can help with that, because it considerably boosts the credibility issue,\" said London. \"The psychological harm is part of the persecution. It's relevant to demonstrating the harm they've suffered and the continued harm they fear.\"\n\nForensic evaluations help buttress the legal case, and they can also make it easier for asylum-seekers to navigate the psychological breakdown that can be brought about by trauma. Diego, who underwent an evaluation last year and is now receiving psychological care, has been waiting four years for an update on his asylum case, and says his life is in limbo. He's concerned about the presence of MS-13 gang members in the U.S., and is terrified for his family back home. \"I'm really scared,\" he said. \"I'm not really sleeping.\"\n\nSyrian 10-year-old Amjud Moustafa Rifat uses his shirt to wipe away tears on Feb. 20, 2018, in Columbus, Ohio. His father, Rifat Moustafa, an international lawyer who says he was tortured for protesting human rights violations, was granted asylum; his wife and four other children followed in 2016, before President Donald Trump was elected.\n\nImmigration attorneys say they've seen a definite shift in how asylum policies are enforced under the Trump administration. Previously, asylum-seekers who entered the country and did not have a criminal record or any hint of a criminal wrongdoing would generally not be held while they waited for their case to be heard. Similarly, those whose appeals were denied would usually not be detained during the appeals process. That's changing, with more asylum-seekers locked up, and for longer . Families are increasingly separated in detention , and there have also been allegations of people being turned away at the border or pressured to retract their statements of fear.\n\nIn fact, border officials and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have become so aggressive with the detention of asylum-seekers that attorneys say they are left with less time and flexibility to help their clients obtain the exam that could make their case.\n\nPetra Veras-Rizwan, a Massachusetts-based immigration attorney, is hopeful that a forensic evaluation will benefit her client, an indigenous woman from Guatemala who sought asylum after fleeing ongoing violence, but a long detention has delayed the process.\n\nThe woman's original request for asylum was denied, and she tried to appeal the decision. Unbeknownst to her, the appeal filed by her previous lawyer never reached the government, either because it was lost or late. Some time later, the woman presented herself for a routine check-in and was detained by ICE because there was no record of her appeal. ICE held her from October 2017 until March 2018, when she was released on bond.\n\nProlonged detention was potentially dangerous for the woman because she's recovering from a gunshot wound in her leg and dealing with a blood-clotting condition, anxiety, and depression. Veras-Rizwan said her client is a perfect example of how ICE is abusing its recently expanded power: She doesn't have an order of deportation, is in an appeals process, and doesn't have a criminal record, but was being held in a facility that isn't equipped to deal with her illnesses.\n\n\"I know it will help her case,\" Veras-Rizwan said of a medical evaluation. While she was never prevented from accessing her client, getting an exam in detention is very difficult, Veras-Rizwan said, because getting a doctor to perform the evaluation requires permission from the county jail. She also needed a translator, as her client doesn't speak any English. Free for now, the woman will get an evaluation at a provider's office.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection official told The Intercept that the agency \"has not changed any policies affecting asylum procedures,\" and that it \"adheres to law and policy on processing asylum claims and does not tolerate abuse of these policies.\" ICE press secretary Jennifer D. Elzea said in a statement: \"Aliens processed for removal may receive their legal due process from federal immigration judges in the immigration courts.\" She added that \"immigration judges in these courts make decisions based on the merits of each individual case. ICE officers carry out the removal decisions made by the federal immigration judges.\"\n\nDespite this official insistence that nothing has changed, advocates and lawyers worry that their access will be more limited and their work made harder.\n\n\"I don't think we know how bad it can be,\" Venters says.\n\nOne solution might be performing more evaluations in detention centers - the L.A.-based Program for Victims of Torture recently received funding for that very purpose - or even on the other side of the U.S. border. Dzubow said evidence collected before asylum-seekers reach America could help a case, but might not be given as much weight as an evaluation that takes place inside the U.S.\n\nSupporting survivors of torture has historically been an issue championed by both sides. The Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998 was reauthorized and amended last year to authorize $25 million a year for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to fund treatment centers for victims of torture. But calls for \"extreme vetting,\" travel bans, and constant shifts around immigration policy have sent many asylum-seekers into a spiral of despair. Those who have survived torture continue to be hypervigilant and afraid in their new surroundings. Some who are allowed to remain in the United States as their status is being processed are now afraid to sign up for health insurance or go to the emergency room for fear of being flagged, said Beckman, of the Center for Victims of Torture.\n\n\"We talk about our clients have post-traumatic stress disorder, but when you're living under this threat of constantly being returned to your country, to potentially be tortured again or even killed, there's no 'post' in post-traumatic stress,\" she said. \"To be able to feel safe is a precursor for healing, and this climate is making it tough.\"\n\nMeanwhile, torture survivors like Diego will continue living in a suspended reality until the final decision is made in their asylum case. They'll work and take care of their families, reminded of what they escaped with each glimpse of a scar.\n\n\"I try to forget everything,\" Diego said. \"I just want to live my life with my daughters in peace.\"\n\nTop photo: Emergency personnel put a woman on a stretcher after relatives helped her walk to a police station on Aug. 20, 2017, in La Lima, Honduras. In Honduras, rival gangs, including MS-13 and Barrio 18, tightly control territory, earning money from extortion and drug trafficking.\n\nWAIT!

But workers have no pay if they don't work.\"\n\nMariano Guadalupe Vallejo, the Mexican general who colonized California's Sonoma County, remains an admired figure to this day. A local authority erected a monument to the general as recently as 2017. The darker side of this history is typically overlooked .\n\nIn 1838, according to records , Vallejo executed 35 of his Indigenous workers as suspected cattle thieves. When a smallpox epidemic struck the area, he inoculated his own family but left around 2,000 Native workers, likely Wappo, Southern Pomo, and Coast Miwok people, to die unvaccinated.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nToday, with its fame as one of the world's most important wine-producing regions, Sonoma County supports a tourism industry centered on grape growers' connections to the rolling land - a landscape that, over the last few years, has been increasingly consumed by wildfires. After a particularly brutal fire season last year, lifestyle magazines and national newspapers alike expressed concerns about the local industry and the impact of wildfire smoke on the wine.\n\nOnce again, Indigenous workers were often left out of the story . Largely from regions of Mexico, the workers toiled in smoky evacuation zones, struggled to access health care, and went without government support when the fires made work impossible.\n\nOn a cool autumn day last month, farmworkers inserted themselves into the narrative. Tourists were streaming into Simi Winery to immerse themselves in the storied winery's Harvest Celebration - at $145 for a ticket, a meal, and, of course, wine pairings. As the well-heeled attendees arrived, a group of farmworkers, their families, and supporters picketed, chanting and playing drums.\n\nThe price tag for the meal, according to North Bay Jobs With Justice, which helped organize the protest, roughly matches what a farmworker gets paid for collecting 1 ton of grapes.\n\nThe protest organizers, led by workers, had been trying to meet with Simi Winery's owners since September, but the winemakers never replied. No mom and pop shop, Simi Winery is owned by one of the largest alcohol companies in the world, Constellation Brands, a Fortune 500 firm valued at $44 billion that includes Modelo Especial and Corona beers in its U.S. portfolio, as well as other popular brands.\n\nThe farmworkers had sought to invite Simi - as well as more than 30 other local wine-related businesses - to commit to meeting five demands tailored to the needs of fire-stricken workers.\n\nThe workers are fighting for disaster insurance to cover wage losses when it's too dangerous to work, as well as hazard pay for high-risk shifts - such as when wineries are granted waivers to allow workers to labor in evacuation zones. The workers also want community safety observers to be allowed into the evacuation zones to assure that safety standards are upheld and for safety information to be distributed in Indigenous languages. Finally, they want clean bathrooms and clean water available even when the fires are burning nearby.\n\nIn response to The Intercept's questions about the workers' demands, Alex Wagner, vice president of communications for Constellation Brands said in a statement that the company has a \"long history of providing competitive pay and benefits, a safe and sanitary workplace, and a culture where team members feel welcome, valued and respected.\"\n\nUnable to get an audience with some of Sonoma's largest winemakers, the farmworkers resorted to their picket at Simi Winery - hoping that putting their story in front of winery patrons might put pressure on their employers to come to the table.\n\nToday, the idyllic Sonoma County experience that visitors flock to is made possible by workers inhaling toxic smoke as fires burn nearby.\n\nMaria Salinas, a Chatino farmworker from the Oaxaca region of Mexico, described what harvest season is like now. \"You're working and you're smelling the toxic smoke,\" she said. \"And you don't want to protect yourself with the masks, because it's too hot, so you're breathing all of this. After work, you feel like sneezing and spitting. The saliva is black. If this is just what you're spitting, how must it be inside? What about your lungs?\"\n\nSalinas, who is involved with wildfire organizing as a leader with the Indigenous workers' group Movimiento Cultural de la Unión Indígena, has asthma that has worsened with the smoke: \"I have to use my inhaler constantly.\"\n\nLast spring, organizers among the farmworkers conducted a survey of about 100 colleagues to identify demands. The results showed that, even without the wildfires, 61 percent of respondents earned less than $2,500 a month and 45 percent said they were underpaid for the work they did. Four out of five respondents said the pay was not enough to support their families, and fewer than a quarter had employer-provided health insurance.\n\nThe survey elucidated the specifics behind a common dynamic among the farmworkers: They can't afford not to work, even when conditions become unsafe.\n\nNorth Bay Jobs With Justice pointed out that in 2020 the federal government provided $63 million in fire-related insurance payouts to Sonoma County wineries, yet provided no comparable support to the people who work the land. Many of the workers are undocumented and ineligible for most income replacement programs.\n\n\"We don't have protection,\" said Salinas. \"We can't count on anyone to come tell us, 'If you don't have a job, take this for the rent.'\"\n\nThe struggles of farmworkers weren't the only stories the survey told. Many people commented on their connection to the land.\n\n\"It is a privilege to work the land and experience every part of nature. It is giving life to the world we live in,\" said one worker. Another said, \"My father taught me to work and harvest from the land. It is very sacred.\"\n\nMany of the farmworkers hail from rural parts of Mexico and speak Indigenous languages, such as Triqui, Chatino, Mixteco, or Maya. Nine out of 10 respondents said they had been discriminated against for speaking their Native language.\n\nThe workers' demand for safety information to be available in Indigenous languages speaks to something deeper than physical security. In 2000, the Mexican government classified some dialects of Salinas's first language, Chatino, as endangered.\n\n\"As an Indigenous woman speaking my own language, I do feel proud of speaking it. I feel that it is the most valuable thing I have,\" Salinas said in Spanish, her second language. Her dream is that her people's language will be passed on to Chatino children.\n\nAs the harvest season closes, no Sonoma County winery, grape grower, farm labor contractor, or vineyard management company has agreed to the campaign's demands, though a few businesses have been meeting with organizers.\n\n\"On the whole, we've not been received with open arms with these demands,\" said Davin Cardenas, the organizing director at North Bay Jobs With Justice.\n\nMeanwhile, Simi has been doing its own Sonoma County storytelling with a big-budget brand campaign centered on its place in the area's history. Videos filmed by an Oscar-nominated cinematographer tell of how Isabelle Simi took over the winery in 1904 at age 18, after her father and uncle, who migrated from Italy to establish the winery, both died.\n\nThe video depicts Simi dusting herself off and harvesting the grapes alone, through grit and determination - no workers in sight. She heroically keeps the winery afloat through Prohibition years and, in 1934, opens Sonoma County's first tasting room - a space where all the members of the community can gather, according to the video.\n\nAs part of the campaign, Simi has partnered with actor Reese Witherspoon's book club. \"Together, these female-led brands will spotlight diverse narratives and deepen connections within the community by offering readers and drinkers more ways to engage with these stories and each other,\" the executive vice president of Constellation Brands said in a statement .\n\nThe workers are now inviting the Simi community to spotlight a different narrative. As Salinas put it, \"The people who make this dream possible are the workers; we work so hard. And us - when are we going to enjoy this?\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Brazil's Coronavirus Catastrophe Is Spreading Into the Country's Vulnerable Interior\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAfter ravaging Brazilian cities, the coronavirus pandemic is moving into Brazil's interior, where hospitals are unprepared for the crisis.\n\nJason Silva was 24 years old when he caught the coronavirus in the Brazilian Amazon town of Altamira. He played soccer, practiced martial arts, studied physical education at a local university, and was active in a group that protested environmental and social damage caused by the region's hydroelectric dams, such as the notorious Belo Monte.\n\nAccording to Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro - a populist pandemic denier who attacks isolation measures and dismissed the pandemic as a \" little flu \" - Silva's age and physical condition should have protected him from the virus. Bolsonaro, who is 65, claimed his own athletic background would protect him from Covid-19. After revealing he had caught the disease on July 7, he said young people had no reason to fear it.\n\nInstead, Silva got sicker and sicker. He tried to go to the hospital but was only admitted after four visits to a local health center and a social media campaign by friends and family. Just days after arriving at hospital, on July 6, Silva died .\n\n\"I will always remember how amazing, intelligent, smart, lively, and kind he was,\" said his girlfriend Victória Paes, a student who worked with Silva delivering lunches. \"He gave out a positive energy that infected anybody nearby.\"\n\nWith 2.098 million confirmed cases and 79,488 deaths , as of July 20, Brazil's Covid-19 catastrophe is the world's second worst , after the United States.\n\nSilva's death is part of the latest - and troubling - wave of casualties to the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil. After ravaging major cities , the virus is spreading to Brazil's sprawling interior. Brazilians like Silva are dying in remote towns whose health systems can't handle the caseload. And doctors and health specialists say Bolsonaro's dismissal of the pandemic has confused Brazilians, eroded lockdowns, and helped propagate Covid-19.\n\n\"When you don't communicate in a scientific and technical way, you confuse less educated people, and transform a pandemic that needs a technical response into a political struggle,\" said Julio Croda, a professor of medicine who until March ran Brazilian Health Ministry's Transmissible Diseases and Immunization Department. \"It's very detrimental.\"\n\nIn Brazil, those states that were hit hard with the coronavirus as it began to spread throughout the country are seeing obits slow down . These areas are ramping down isolation measures and opening up parks, restaurants, and gyms. In the interior of the country, however, deaths are rising.\n\nThe city of Dourados had 3,729 cases as of July 20, nearly a quarter of all the infections in its interior state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Andyane Tetila, an infectious diseases specialist working for its state health service, said hospitals may soon be unable to handle the load.\n\nBolsonaro's stance \"did not help anything,\" she said. \"We see it as a big problem.\"\n\nBrazil's interior is especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. According to government research institute Fiocruz, in February, 90 percent of Brazilian municipalities did not have intensive care beds and 59 percent did not have respirators. In Altamira, two hospitals serve nine municipalities around them; the town now has 28 intensive care beds for 340,000 people - but had just 18 when Silva died.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Though Argentina has a quarter of Brazil's 212 million population, it has only 6 percent of its caseload. Bolsonaro, on the other hand, argued isolation measures would cause economic damage and unemployment, and instead fought against lockdown.\n\n\"The collateral effects of the measures to fight the coronavirus cannot be worse than the actual illness,\" he said during a television address in March. Mask-less, he repeatedly mingled with crowds of far-right supporters, even riding a horse among them. Tasked over Brazil's towering number of victims, he said: \" So what ?\"\n\nBolsonaro is popular in Amazon towns like Altamira, where 63 percent of voters cast their ballots for him in the 2018 election. Last month, business owners there demonstrated against closures.\n\n\"The president's posture is a big part of why the population doesn't practice social isolation,\" said Renan Granato, a doctor in Altamira. \"He has a lot of supporters here.\"\n\nJason Silva was appalled, his girlfriend said, by the amount of people in town without masks (for instance, crowding supermarkets), as well as the president's pandemic denial.\n\nLeft/Top: Photo of Jason alone was taken on Day of the Tree in the municipality of Brasil Novo, state of Pará on Sept 21, 2019. Right/Bottom: Jason (right) and Welinton Freitas (left) on June 6, 2020, at the Água Azul settlement in Altamira, state of Pará. Photos: Coletivo de Comunicação do MAB\n\nAs coronavirus cases grew, Silva and fellow activists from the Movement of Those Affected by Dams, a national network that deals with the ill environmental and societal effects of hydroelectric and industrial dams, distributed food to poorer Brazilians who lost work or income during the pandemic. Coronavirus hit poorer Brazilians living in densely packed communities especially hard . Local and national networks have sprung up to help them.\n\nAmid his mutual aid work, Silva washed his clothes every time he got home and isolated as much as he could.\n\nHe first got sick on June 16. When admitted to the municipal hospital, he had a fever over 102 degrees, a scan that showed 25 to 30 percent of his lung compromised, and a low readout of 87 percent blood oxygen saturation level, Paes said. Two days later, Silva was transferred to a state government-run hospital - the only one in the region with intensive care beds.\n\n\"There is always a queue for both hospitals,\" said Granato, the doctor in Altamira who trained as a surgeon but is now working in intensive care. \"The beds in wards and intensive care are at maximum capacity.\"\n\nOn June 19, construction was finished on a field hospital in Altamira which will have 60 beds - including 10 for intensive care - but it only opened on July 17.\n\n\"The municipality of Altamira currently faces problems with intensive care beds,\" a spokesperson for the city government said in an email on July 10. He said the city's legal obligation was \"basic care\" and that Silva was given oxygen in the municipal hospital as he waited for an intensive care bed. \"The municipality profoundly regrets the loss of another life,\" he said.\n\nBrazil had a head start on the pandemic. Its first Covid-19 cases were reported in February. In March, states like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo closed schools and shops and introduced isolation measures pushed by Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, a doctor.\n\nIn March, Bolsonaro declared that less than 800 people would die of coronavirus in Brazil. His health ministry, though, circulated a six-figure death toll projection if nothing was done, said Croda, the professor and former ministry official.\n\nOfficial warnings were watered down. In mid-March, the Health Ministry put out a bulletin. Shortly after, it was amended and now reads \"recommendation excluded for technical revision.\" The revision never came: Until days ago, the ministry's site still said it was \" updating guidance on isolation and social distancing \" and has recently removed the phrase - without providing the guidance.\n\nDo you have a coronavirus story you want to share? Email us at coronavirus@theintercept.com or use one of these secure methods to contact a reporter.\n\nAs the Brazilian summer turned to fall, in March, Bolsonaro issued a decree giving him powers to decide what could and could not stay open. Brazil's Supreme Court overruled him and decided states and towns could take their own decisions and that Bolsonaro did not have the power to \" exercise a genocidal public policy ,\" as one judge put it.\n\nA Health Ministry spokesperson suggested to The Intercept that the federal government was now behind a more regional approach. \"The actions should be taken in accord with the needs of each region,\" the spokesperson said in an email. She added that the Health Ministry has funded 9,200 intensive care beds and contracted over 6,000 health professionals.\n\nMandetta, the health minister, was giving detailed daily briefings that public health experts applauded. Before March came to a close, however, Bolsonaro's government would intervene. He set up a \"crisis cabinet\" and installed his chief of staff, retired Army Gen. Walter Souza Braga Netto, to lead public policy on the pandemic.\n\n\"The health ministry was no longer leading Covid actions,\" said Croda. The shift caused him to leave his post. In April, Mandetta was sacked .\n\nBrazil's Covid-19 strategy began to fall apart.\n\nMandetta's successor was Nelson Teich, an oncologist who resigned a month later after refusing to back Bolsonaro's insistence on pushing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatment - a drug pushed by Bolsonaro's ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, and which has not been proven to help Covid-19 patients. In May, Brazil recommended the drugs for even mild Covid-19 cases. On July 7, after testing positive, Bolsonaro appeared in one video with a pill in his hand and declared: \" I trust hydroxychloroquine , and you?\"\n\nThe health ministry said it has distributed 4.4 million chloroquine pills, millions of which were produced by the army . Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has revoked the emergency authorization for both drugs because of \"known and potential risks\" - some of which can be fatal\n\n\"They are focused on treatment with no scientific proof,\" said Croda. \"The Ministry is doing nothing from the technical point of view.\"\n\nThe sense that Bolsonaro's government is adrift was confirmed for many in May, when video of an expletive-filled ministerial meeting was released by order of a Supreme Court judge.\n\nThe pandemic was barely mentioned. Human Rights Minister Damares Alves alleged Indigenous people in the Amazon were being deliberately infected with Covid-19 to hurt the president: an extraordinary claim other participants ignored. Bolsonaro seemed more worried about the future of his own government. \" We still don't know ... where our boat is going,\" he said, citing the virus. \"It could be heading toward an iceberg.\"\n\nA worker from the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health assists 19-year-old Janete Vasconcelos da Silva, an indigenous woman from the Tupinamba tribe and 8 months pregnant and who has been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, after bringing her to a hospital in Santarem, Para State, Brazil on July 17, 2020.\n\nBrazil still has no health minister. Interim Minister Gen. Eduardo Pazuello is one of a number of military officers now in the ministry but has no health experience. \"What's most frightening is the quantity of military officers they put there. Career technicians were removed to nominate colonel, captain, and sergeant,\" Mandetta told the O Globo newspaper in comments published July 15. \"It's absurd.\"\n\n(The ministry \"has a technical staff of qualified employees who maintain the normality of its activities,\" the spokesperson said.)\n\nBrazil's Covid-19 statistics have also come under scrutiny because of widespread underreporting . Brazil has performed 2.1 million antibody tests - 945,000 of them in private laboratories - the health ministry said, and 2.6 million less accurate \"fast\" tests - less than one-tenth of what Teich had promised to buy. The United States, by contrast, has done almost 50 million tests, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In June, Brazil's health ministry even stopped publishing total numbers of deaths and cases, until a Supreme Court judge intervened and ordered the reporting to resume.\n\nJesem Orellana, an epidemiologist with Fiocruz, said he believes Brazil's total deaths could already be as high as 90,000 to 100,000, because many victims are buried without tests or even reaching a hospital. He and four other researchers calculated 22,000 excess deaths in just four cities - Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Manaus, and Fortaleza - from February 23 to June 13, compared to the averages from 2015 to 2019 for the same periods.\n\nIn the Amazon city of Manaus, where Orellana is based, overloaded hospitals turned sick people away and victims were buried in mass graves when cases peaked in April. Deaths at home in Manaus and outside hospitals increased 363 percent from February 9 to May 10, compared to 2019, he said, a rise driven by Covid-19. Some of the excess deaths from other causes, here, occurred when people were unable or too scared to go to overloaded hospitals.\n\n\"This shows the size of the collapse,\" Orellana said.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nBrazil's public health service, called SUS, serves 70 percent of the population who don't have health plans. In 2016, under President Dilma Rousseff, Brazil won plaudits for its handling of a Zika epidemic blamed for thousands of cases of the birth defect microcephaly . Now an epidemiologist at Fiocruz in Brasília, Cláudio Maierovitch was one of the Health Ministry officials in charge of that response. He believes that under Bolsonaro, Brazil's government has failed. \"There is no national plan,\" he said. \"This has been a flagrant omission by the government.\"\n\nIn some parts of Brazil, civil society, private companies, and NGOs have stepped up to fill the gap, building field hospitals and buying respirators and protective equipment.\n\nWhen Covid-19 cases spiked in May, the isolated Amazon town of Tefé improvised its own \"semi-intensive care\" beds with respirators. Doctors Without Borders has helped train primary care staff to care for seriously ill patients in the town. The region had seen 81 deaths as of July 19.\n\n\"Towns and states had to act for themselves,\" said Laura Crivellari, a doctor in Tefé. \"We felt very alone.\"\n\nAs of July 19, Altamira had reported 2,708 Covid-19 cases and 75 deaths. \"The cases are rising,\" Granato said.\n\nJason Silva's death showed the cost of local communities needing to fend for themselves in an uphill battle. His mutual aid work amid a crisis of resources did not go unnoticed by the community: Silva was widely mourned in Altamira.\n\n\"I'll never forget how he loved to help people,\" said Victória Paes. \"He made a difference.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "As Execution Looms, Mounting Evidence Points to Melissa Lucio's Innocence\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrial jurors, forensic experts, and Texas lawmakers push for Lucio's life to be spared ahead of her April 27 execution.\n\nAs Johnny Galvan flipped through YouTube videos on his flat-screen TV, Melissa Lucio's face smiled back at him. She did not look like the woman he'd helped send to death row almost 15 years earlier. Here was a young Lucio posing in a feathered '80s haircut, a hint of teal eyeshadow matching her outfit. There was an older Lucio laughing, her infant son John sitting in her lap. But then there was a more familiar image, the one repeatedly printed in the newspaper: Lucio's mugshot; her eyes seemingly vacant, her mouth turned downward.\n\n\"Melissa Lucio is set to be executed on April 27,\" a reporter said in a news segment from the previous week. \"People that support her, though, say she was wrongly convicted and that her daughter's death was an accident - and that that so-called confession was coerced.\" The report cut to a clip of state lawmakers calling for clemency, led by a representative from North Texas. \"As a conservative Republican who has long been a supporter of the death penalty in the most heinous cases,\" he said, \"I have never seen - have never seen - a more troubling case than the case of Melissa Lucio.\"\n\nMelissa Lucio and her son John Lucio.\n\n\"Wow,\" Galvan said softly. For a moment it looked like he might cry. Galvan was one of the jurors who convicted Lucio in 2008 for killing her 2-year-old daughter, Mariah Alvarez. The little girl's lifeless body had arrived at the hospital in Harlingen, Texas, covered in bruises; at trial, medical witnesses described it as the worst case of child abuse they had ever seen. Despite his horror, Galvan had been reluctant to impose a death sentence on Lucio. For a time, he was the lone holdout, but he'd ultimately voted for death. Now he feared that he'd made a grave mistake. \"If I would have had the knowledge that I have now, Melissa would be free,\" he said.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt was a Tuesday in late March, and Galvan had been discussing the case for almost two hours. His uneaten lunch sat on the coffee table in his apartment in Brownsville, Texas. A large U.S flag hung above a large air rifle; on the opposite wall was a painting he'd gotten at Goodwill of an Indigenous woman next to a basket of jalapeño peppers. Galvan once worked as an art teacher in public schools. But at the time of Lucio's trial, he'd been unemployed. \"I told whoever was selecting the jury ... 'Look sir, I can't be here, I have to be out there looking for a job. I'm responsible for my kids,'\" he recalled. \"And he said, 'This is a job!'\"\n\nIf Galvan had not been so stressed about finding work, perhaps he would have held out longer against the death penalty. But he felt pressured by his fellow jurors, who were also anxious to go home. One of them pointed to the Gospel of Matthew, which suggested that people who hurt small children should be thrown into the sea with a millstone around their necks. For Galvan, a devout Christian, the Bible passage was enough to persuade him.\n\nGalvan thought about the case only occasionally in the years following Lucio's trial. He never seriously considered that she would be put to death until he saw a news story in the Brownsville Herald in early March, which said she had been given an execution date. The next day, a lawyer and two law students showed up at his apartment. They asked him questions about what he remembered and shared information he'd been unaware of at trial. In a subsequent declaration, Galvan admitted that no evidence stood out to him that proved Lucio had murdered her daughter. \"The fact that you can't pinpoint what actually caused Mariah's death means that she shouldn't be executed,\" he said.\n\nRelated A Bogus Bite Mark Sent Him to Prison for Murder. Alabama Wants to Keep Him There.\n\nIn fact, there were a lot of things that bothered him about the case in hindsight. Lucio's defense attorney went to work for the district attorney's office shortly after the trial. The DA himself later went to federal prison on corruption charges. Then there was Lucio's supposed confession on the night her daughter died. Jurors were shown footage of the more than five-hour interrogation. To Galvan, Lucio seemed less like a woman admitting to murder than a mother blaming herself for her daughter's death. He remembered a Texas Ranger pushing Lucio to hit a doll like she had beaten Mariah - then demanding that she show him how she'd also bitten her daughter. At trial, \"they showed us something that looked like a bite mark, but we couldn't tell,\" Galvan said. \"I think she was just giving into the interrogation.\"\n\n\"I used to live in the poorer sections of Brownsville,\" Galvan said. There were a lot of struggling families living in rundown apartments like Lucio's. She tried to tell authorities that Mariah had fallen down some stairs, but no one believed her. In retrospect, the account rang true. \"It could have been any of us,\" Galvan said. Now, as he searched for the latest videos about the case, Galvan's voice was heavy with remorse. \"We were overtaken by the tragedy that happened,\" he said. \"We probably wanted to blame someone. But we went the wrong way.\"\n\nTexas death row inmate Melissa Lucio, dressed in white, leads a group of seven state lawmakers in prayer at the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, Texas, on April 6, 2022.\n\nGalvan is one of four jurors who now say they wished they'd been given more information before voting to sentence Lucio to death in 2008. A fifth, who served as an alternate, said that she believed Lucio should get a new trial \"with the benefit of an actual defense.\" Their affidavits are among hundreds of pages of exhibits included in a request for clemency that Lucio's attorneys filed on March 22 with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\nLucio's clemency petition makes a convincing case that her life should be spared, arguing that faulty forensics could see her sent to the execution chamber for a crime that never happened. A host of experts have raised serious questions about the evidence used to convict her, including an interrogation built on coercion and a superficial medical inquiry that amplified a spurious and prejudicial claim that Lucio had bitten her daughter.\n\nLucio \"ended up on death row through a horrific combination of investigative missteps and a prosecution unhinged from the truth,\" the petition reads.\n\nBut realistically, clemency in Texas is a long shot. The board is made up of individuals appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, and they generally do the governor's bidding . Since Abbott assumed office in 2015, the board has recommended clemency in just two capital cases. Abbott accepted the board's recommendation in one of those cases - an intervention that came less than an hour before the scheduled execution. Under Texas law, Abbott's power is limited to granting a one-time, 30-day stay of execution. Any additional relief requires a recommendation from the board.\n\nWith the likelihood of clemency so grim, the push to save Lucio has been increasingly driven by an unlikely source: the Texas House of Representatives. An unprecedented bipartisan group of representatives - more than half the members of the Texas House - wrote a letter imploring the board and Abbott to stop Lucio's execution. Their efforts have been led by Republican Rep. Jeff Leach and Democratic Rep. Joe Moody, who also co-chair the chamber's Criminal Justice Reform Caucus.\n\nThe facts surrounding Mariah's death are \"still in grave dispute,\" Leach said at a press conference shortly after Lucio's clemency packet was filed. \"The system literally failed Lucio at every single turn. And I am going to do everything that I possibly can in the coming days, in every way possible, legal, constitutional - and maybe in some ways we haven't thought of yet - to delay and to prevent Ms. Lucio's execution.\"\n\nLeach and Moody also traveled with several of their colleagues to the prison where female death row prisoners are held for a meeting with Lucio that included a prayer session in one of the prison's stark white rooms. Two weeks later, they convened a meeting of the House's interim Criminal Justice Reform Committee to question Cameron County District Attorney Luis Saenz, who had requested Lucio's execution date. The whole situation was clearly troubling to Leach.\n\n\"To say I'm wrestling with the very existence of the death penalty in Texas would be a dramatic understatement,\" he said .\n\nMelissa Lucio with her daughters Mariah and Adriana.\n\nAt the heart of Lucio's case is the question of whether her daughter's death resulted from repeated physical abuse, as the state contends, or a tragic accident. Lucio has maintained since the beginning that Mariah fell down a hazardous staircase in the days preceding her death, and experts who have since reviewed the case at the behest of Lucio's lawyers say the toddler's injuries were consistent with such a fall.\n\nBut no one ever investigated the possibility that Mariah's untimely death was the result of an accident. Instead, from the beginning, the authorities seized upon child abuse as the only explanation. According to the clemency petition, the cops and the doctors who testified against Lucio based their determinations on faulty assumptions and flawed science.\n\nNo one seemed more certain of Lucio's guilt than the cops who arrived at the ER and took her to the station for questioning. As The Intercept previously reported , Lucio's interrogators - an assembly line of cops that included Texas Ranger Victor Escalon - deployed a mix of guilt-presumptive and coercive techniques known to produce false confessions , particularly from vulnerable individuals like Lucio, whose life had been defined by abuse and trauma. The cops repeatedly showed Lucio graphic photos of her dead daughter and then fed her suggestions about what might have caused the injuries, suggestions that Lucio then parroted back to them.\n\nJust after 3 a.m., as the marathon interrogation was coming to a close, Escalon pulled his chair close to Lucio, who looked dazed and weary, and showed her a series of photos of Mariah's bruised body. He asked her to demonstrate on a plastic baby doll how she'd inflicted the various injuries. \"Don't hold back,\" Escalon told her. \"Do it and get it over with.\" He said they would start with the \"bite mark.\" There were two on Mariah's back, he said. \"Just re-enact how you did it.\"\n\n\"Do I have to?\" Lucio asked. Yes, he replied. Lucio held the doll upright with its back to her face and told Escalon that she just put her mouth there and bit her. Escalon asked why she did it; Lucio said she didn't know.\n\nDavid Thompson, a certified forensic interviewer whose report is included in the clemency package, concluded that the outcome of the interrogation was wholly unreliable. Thompson is president of Wicklander-Zulawski & Associates, a law enforcement training organization that advocates for evidence-based interview approaches. \"Lucio's admissions occurred after multiple examples of fact-feeding, revealing of evidence, and modifications of her story,\" he wrote. \"This created a contaminated confession.\"\n\nThis guilt-presumptive approach spilled over into the medical investigation. Emergency room doctor Alfredo Vargas testified that Mariah's injuries, including abrasions on her back that he labeled \"bite marks,\" showed that she had been horribly abused. Dr. Norma Jean Farley, the forensic pathologist who autopsied Mariah, also concluded that the child had been beaten to death. Trial records indicate that before Farley even cut into the body, she'd already made up her mind. \"I mean, it would have been evident to a first-year nursing student,\" she testified. The bite mark was \"obvious,\" Farley told the jury, because it was a \"big bite!\" She said it looked as though the person who bit Mariah had dragged their teeth across her back, creating a painful wound.\n\n\"There appears to be a bite with raking, where it just pulls the flesh off the back?\" prosecutor Alfredo Padilla asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Farley replied.\n\nTo Dr. Adam Freeman, a forensic dentist, this testimony was nonsense. \"It is so inflammatory to walk into a courtroom and say, 'This is a big bite mark. It was made by an adult; the skin was raked and peeled back,'\" Freeman said\n\nThe most basic problem with Farley's assertion is that bite-mark evidence is neither valid nor reliable . To date, it has been implicated in at least 35 wrongful convictions and criminal indictments. Yet, for years, practitioners have claimed the ability not only to detect which injuries left on skin were made by teeth, but also the ability to match a given injury to the dentition of a particular person. In 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission recommended a moratorium on its use as evidence in criminal prosecutions.\n\nBut even if it were a valid practice, Freeman argues, Farley was not qualified to opine one way or another. She hadn't been trained in the discipline and no forensic dentist ever provided a report or took the stand to back up Farley's bald assertion. As such, her testimony that the mark on Mariah's back was the result of an adult bite served no other purpose than to prejudice the jury. \"If I were in a courtroom,\" Freeman said, \"and saw pictures of a dead baby and then heard that description, and I think you'd probably, too, you'd say, 'Let's hang the bastard,' right?\"\n\nDr. Thomas Young, a veteran forensic pathologist in Kansas City, Missouri, who first reviewed the case as part of Lucio's state post-conviction appeal, opined in 2010 that the abrasion Farley, Vargas, and the cops decided was a bite mark was consistent with a scrape incurred from a fall down a flight of stairs.\n\nYoung concluded that Mariah had died from a blunt head injury, consistent with a fall, with \"delayed effects\": brain swelling with repercussions that developed over several days, including a blood-clotting disorder that can cause extensive internal and external bruising.\n\nSeveral doctors who reviewed the case and provided declarations for the clemency package agreed, including renowned pediatric forensic pathologist Dr. Janice Ophoven. Ophoven said that there was forensic evidence that Mariah was suffering from that coagulation disorder - known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC - which can result from trauma. Falls, she noted, \"remain the No. 1 cause for traumatic brain injury in children of Mariah's age,\" and Mariah had a history of falls, including one at day care in 2006 after which she'd lost consciousness.\n\nThe medical evidence was \"consistent with a cause of death related to a fall down the stairs two days before Mariah's collapse,\" Ophoven concluded. \"There are several potential causes and contributions to Mariah's injuries and death that have nothing to do with intentional force.\"\n\nThe failure to consider Mariah's history of falls or her family's account of the days preceding her death is problematic, because child abuse is a diagnosis of exclusion. \"Medical guidance, including from the American Academy of Pediatrics, is clear that before determining whether injuries were caused by child abuse, physicians must rule out coagulopathies, such as DIC,\" Dr. Michael Laposata, chair of the Department of Pathology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, wrote in a declaration.\n\n\"Dr. Farley's inverted approach critically left key evidence uncollected and obscured the true story of Mariah's death,\" the clemency petition reads.\n\nThere is another key piece of evidence the doctors reviewing the case noted: In the hospital, well after Mariah had been found unresponsive and then declared dead, her body temperature was recorded at over 100 degrees, meaning that before death she'd been battling an infection. How that factored into Mariah's demise went unexplored. Such an elevated temperature would be consistent in a child who has DIC. But it would be \"highly unusual\" in a child who died as a result of abuse, Dr. Harry Davis wrote in his declaration.\n\nDavis's declaration contains another troubling revelation: Although Vargas testified at Lucio's trial that he was the emergency room doctor on duty the night Mariah died and had declared her death, Davis said that he was the attending physician - and thus the primary doctor responsible for directing her care. He recalled Mariah being brought into the hospital unresponsive; his efforts to revive her failed. He was the one - not Vargas, he said - who pronounced Mariah dead. Davis said that Vargas, who worked in a different division in the ER where less acute patients were treated, came to assist him later, after he'd already begun treating Mariah.\n\nWhile Vargas, who died in 2015, readily endorsed the state's child abuse narrative, Davis would not have been so quick to do so, he said. In large part that came down to Mariah's elevated temperature. \"I know State investigators prosecuted Mariah Alvarez's death as abuse. I have had considerable doubt about this conclusion,\" he wrote. \"The presence of active infection at the time of ... death suggests alternative medical explanations for the bruising and internal bleeding that should have been explored.\"\n\nAlthough Mariah's medical records would have included Davis's name and notations about her fever, he was never contacted by police, prosecutors, or the defense. Roughly eight months after Mariah's death, Davis moved out of Texas. \"I was never asked to testify,\" he wrote. \"In fact, I was not even aware there was a trial. I would have testified to what I've said here.\"\n\nMelissa Lucio's daughter Mariah, who died in 2007.\n\nThe office of District Attorney Luis Saenz is on the fourth floor of the Cameron County court complex in Brownsville's historic district. In late March, the reception area was decorated for Easter, with a large artificial tree and plush garden gnomes in bunny ears. The DA's mission statement appeared in large block letters on the wall: \"To protect the public by providing a safe community while safeguarding the rights of victims and above all to see that justice is done.\"\n\nAfter being elected in 2012 to replace disgraced District Attorney Armando Villalobos, Saenz launched a special unit to combat domestic violence, complete with a dedicated vehicle that sat in the courthouse parking lot. Dramatic window decals showed women's faces partially covered with scrawled messages like \"HELP\" and \"I thought he loved me.\"\n\nYet Saenz has thus far been unmoved by those who explain how Lucio's own history as a survivor of sexual abuse and domestic violence impacted her case. The clemency packet included a letter signed by dozens of Texas organizations and advocates combating domestic violence, who echoed what many experts have said about Lucio's interrogation: \"Contrary to what we know are the best practices for engaging with trauma survivors, the police who interrogated her employed coercive techniques designed to intimidate her and extract a confession.\"\n\nElsewhere in the parking lot was a pair of lawn signs that had been placed by Death Penalty Action. One read \"WATCH THE FILM\" in English and Spanish, a rallying cry referencing the documentary \" The State v. Melissa .\" For weeks, activists and family members had stood vigil outside the courthouse, pausing only after Lucio's eldest son, John, successfully approached Saenz during his lunch hour. \"I don't want anybody to feel I'm out here trying to cause problems,\" John politely told the DA, \"but I know for a simple fact that my mother is an innocent woman.\"\n\nJohn urged Saenz to consider the materials in the clemency packet - particularly the statements from the jurors who said they had not been given all the facts at trial. Approached by The Intercept, Saenz refused to say whether he'd read the jurors' declarations yet. \"I'm not giving any interviews about the Melissa Lucio case,\" he said. \"I've got a lot of other work in addition to that.\"\n\nIn late March, John and his wife, Michelle, pulled up at a cemetery just north of Harlingen. Mariah was buried in a small plot toward the back, where the land gave way to a tangle of mesquite and wildflowers. The grave was unmarked aside from an angel statuette left by a family friend years back; John was in the process of getting a headstone. One Easter they laid down a miniature fence and some colorful eggs. \"It was very, very beautiful,\" John said.\n\nIn his signature black \"Free Melissa Lucio\" T-shirt, John spoke quickly, almost frantically, about the campaign to save his mother's life. Although he'd never planned to stand idly by as the state tried to kill his mother, he had no idea what to do after she got her execution date. \"I was lost, I was confused,\" he said. \"What do I do next?\" He was grateful to the activists who had attracted public support for Lucio on a level he'd never imagined. One lawmaker had even urged him not to make funeral plans.\n\nJohn Lucio calls for a halt to his mother's execution in Harlingen, Texas, on Feb. 9, 2022.\n\nStill, the high-profile organizing has taken a toll on the family. With Lucio's story more prominent than ever, old traumas resurfaced, aggravating wounds that had never healed. The anguish and upheaval from Lucio's death sentence was embedded in a letter from her children and declarations included in the clemency petition, which described her as a loving mother whose execution would devastate her family. \"By killing her you will be killing me too,\" her daughter Melissa wrote.\n\nOver the phone, Johnny Galvan, the former juror, expressed dismay that Saenz had brushed off questions about Lucio's case. Maybe he would call himself. \"If he's the only person that can do something from Brownsville, I should be in touch with him,\" he said. \"And I'm not just anybody. I'm one of the jurors.\"\n\nGalvan never reached the DA. But two weeks later, on April 12, he stood before members of the Criminal Justice Reform Committee at the Texas State Capitol in Austin. Galvan has poor eyesight, so his daughter Carmen read a statement to the lawmakers on her father's behalf, which urged the governor to intervene. \"The idea that my decision to take another person's life was not based on complete and accurate information and a fair trial is horrifying. ... If I could take back my vote I would,\" she read. \"I will be haunted by Ms. Lucio's execution if it goes forward.\"\n\nAfterward, Saenz himself joined the meeting remotely. It was the first time he had publicly addressed Lucio's case. For those who hoped Saenz might stop the execution, his exchange with the lawmakers was disappointing, even surreal. The DA seemed indifferent to the new issues raised in the case - and unaware of the basic facts, including when, exactly, Lucio was scheduled to die. He denied that he could simply withdraw Lucio's death warrant, even though her execution date had been set at his request. Instead, he pointed to the courts, where there are several issues still pending. If the courts didn't act before the execution, Saenz said he would step in - before immediately contradicting himself, saying he had no legal reason to intervene.\n\n\"My hope is that the right thing is done - by somebody,\" Leach, the committee co-chair, said. But he told Saenz what the DA already knew: \"You have the power right now, singlehandedly, tonight, to withdraw this request.\" After all, there was no harm in delaying Lucio's execution - certainly not compared to the harm of executing a potentially innocent woman.\n\nLeach acknowledged John Lucio and his family, who were seated in the audience. \"They are your constituents. And they are begging you to just press the pause button,\" he said. \"Has a single member of the victim's family requested you or urged you to set this date for execution?\" Saenz had no answer to that question.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

Annelize Tozetto / Revista Vírus\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n518 years ago, the territory now known as Brazil was invaded by a Portuguese fleet and colonized. Many of the indigenous peoples who inhabited the land died from diseases, were killed, or enslaved. The indigenous population was reduced to less than a million, and their land was taken away and exploited. These land seizures didn't just effect insurmountable damage to the native ecosystem; they also, by concentrating property in the hands of a very few, wrote inequality into the foundations of modern Brazil.\n\nThis is why, more than five centuries later, Sônia Guajajara, a Guajajara indigenous woman from northeast Brazil's Arariboia region, says her pre-candidacy for the presidency in this year's elections represents a paradigm shift. Brazil's indigenous population may number less than a million in a population of over two hundred million, but their political struggle has reached a strength and visibility in recent years that makes it hard to deny their importance in struggles over class, imperialism, and financial capital. Their struggle is an urgent one; in 2016 alone, 118 indigenous people were murdered. These assassinations tend to be connected to the continued attempts by agribusiness to push onto indigenous land, though they are also rooted in racism.\n\nGuajajara, who has been a member of the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) since 2011, will formally run as PSOL's vice-presidential candidate alongside Guilherme Boulos of the Homeless Workers' Movement (MTST). However, the party and the campaign have pushed for a \"co-candidacy\" arrangement in place of the traditional presidential/vice-presidential ticket. In this way, they're hoping to dispute the hierarchy of the traditional ticket and promote an equal, three-way alliance between the PSOL, indigenous peoples, and the MTST. A specialist in linguistics, a mother of three, and the best-known indigenous leader at home and abroad, she forms part of the coordination of Brazil's most notable indigenous organization, the National Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB).\n\nBoth Guajajara and Boulos present a leftist political project that is distinct from the one carried out by Workers' Party (PT) presidents Lula and Dilma Rousseff; in fact, they formed the leftist opposition during the PT governments. Nevertheless, in today's climate, they have stood in solidarity against the political-judicial persecution of Lula and the increasingly violent expressions of \" anti-petismo \" (anti-PT sentiment) in Brazil.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with Jacobin , Guajajara speaks about the current state of indigenous struggles in Brazil, the state of environmental politics, the relationship between indigenous organizing and the Left, and the meaning of her presidential candidacy with PSOL.\n\nToday, a central part of the indigenous struggle in Brazil is about land rights. But you often place this struggle in the context of the fight against racism, and as part of a centuries-old struggle for indigenous people's right to exist. Can you speak more about that?\n\nYes, we're also fighting racism, especially institutional racism. In recent years, it's proliferated, and become more visible. For us, if we overcome these [barriers] we can finally enter other spaces too. If we have our lands, we'll have a fulfilled life, because it's through the land that you can exercise your citizenship as an indigenous people. To be able to live together with our people and with nature itself guarantees our culture, our traditions, our rituals.\n\n[Today's] violence has arisen from the conflicts over land. The agribusiness sectors, animal farming, land and housing speculation; they want to access indigenous territories, leading to a lot of conflict and murders. And there's the racism, which is connected to the speeches made by public personalities, by conservative congressmen, by fascists. They've been saying [racist] things a lot, helping society feel backed up to be publicly aggressive towards others. This has intensified.\n\nSo you'd say that the racist discourse employed by public personalities and congressmen has worsened in the recent period?\n\nIt has worsened a lot. We've always felt a certain degree of indifference among Brazilians towards indigenous people. But it was a matter of ignoring us. It's a minority of society that knows about the existence of indigenous people in our country. They know that originally [during colonization] there were indigenous people in Brazil, but they don't know about our contemporary existence.\n\nIn the last few years, indifference and ignorance has decreased. But they also began to attack us. Today there are attacks through social media, but also violent attacks leading to deaths. Last year there were a lot of deaths. In the south, Victor Kaingang was decapitated in his mother's arms. This year there was a Xocleng teacher in Santa Catarina. There was a Guarani in Rio de Janeiro, a Tapirapé in Mato Grosso, and a Tremembé in Fortaleza. These four murders happened all in the first month of the year. This racism has become very evident, in a very brutal way. It's not just talk anymore, they're killing us.\n\nWould you say that these racist agitators are confronted more often by indigenous communities now? Are indigenous communities more organized now, more capable of voicing themselves against the structure of white supremacy in Brazil?\n\nWe've always been around and doing our struggle, resisting to protect our territories. Our struggle against mega-projects and the current economic development model. For 518 years we've gone about our struggle to survive. The struggle to exist is something we have to undertake every day, day by day. But now we are mobilizing in a more systematic way. We've increased our mobilizations in Brasília and connected them to other regional struggles. If we go and have a big mobilization in Brasília, we'll do it at the same time in other states. If we call people to stop some anti-indigenous measure at the capital, we call and people come. APIB today has a good level of visibility, and it's very broad, beyond the national level.\n\nWe've managed to cross borders, denounce what's going on internationally too. We've been denouncing products produced in unsettled indigenous territories and conflict areas, and called for the international boycott of these products. We've been denouncing ecocide, like what happened at Rio Doce and is now happening at Bacarena, Belo Monte.\n\nWe continue to reference Belo Monte as an attack against ndigenous peoples, because today we're already suffering its consequences. The consequences are real and we show them as negative examples of hydrodams. I think that this has impacted the legal structures and the agribusiness sectors that we're confronting.\n\nEven if the public sees us as \"just\" the indigenous peoples, our struggle isn't small. We're really confronting the Brazilian state, its negligence, its denial of rights. T o do this we have to confront the agribusiness owners, the business elite, the media itself, the traditional press. Social media has really helped us with this. Today we don't need traditional media as much to have the reach we do. All of this is going to reach the ears of the people. This growing visibility is definitely bothering those in power a bit more.\n\nIs there a difference between when indigenous issues were translated through a white lens, as with the traditional media, and now, when it can be your voice directly?\n\nIt makes a difference. In the traditional press we say things, and they cut and edit to take away what's not in their interest or what could hurt their allies. Sometimes what we say gets taken out of context and obtains a different meaning. Sometimes what we say in the traditional media ends up interpreted against ourselves. It's very dangerous depending on who interviews you.\n\nHow have you and APIB been received internationally? How do they react to the stories you tell? Are the reactions different from the ones you get when trying to be heard in Brazil?\n\nHere our ability to denounce things and to speak out is still very restricted. But today we're getting more visibility. Some of it is negative visibility, related to discrimination and hatred. But among social movements, the understanding of the importance of indigenous struggles - how they impact us, the environment, and life in general - is growing.\n\nBut it's still difficult to get people to understand the meaning of being indigenous. Most people can't translate it, they look at us as the \"other.\" People make some room for the \"Indian\" to speak, but most of the time we're just invited to sing and dance; as exotic beings to embellish the place. So we feel that even as social movements try to include us, they still end up expressing a certain kind of prejudice.\n\nDid the Left forget about the indigenous people for some time?\n\nIt did, it totally did. It isolated us. They'd call us to go to certain places, it looked good, we took pictures, they could say they were supporting us. But it was very isolated in general. I think that one way we found to break through this was to get closer, as APIB, to artists and celebrities. They have a different audience, sometimes shared with our own, but it's way broader. The singers, actresses, they'd come closer and understand our cause; the importance of the territories, of the forest, ecosystems like the Cerrado. How protecting these territories would also protect the water. The discussion worldwide about climate change is also important because it relates to things that us as indigenous peoples have been saying all along.\n\nSo people who wouldn't usually listen to indigenous peoples suddenly become interested when it's coming from a celebrity's mouth?\n\nPeople don't want to listen to us. They don't want to understand. When we get an artist to say it, then they go \"Wow, that guy said this. He supported it!\" It's almost as if we get credibility through it.\n\nThis reminds me of the response to the mobilizations against the Belo Monte dam. That dam was a longtime project that went through different phases and under different names, depending on the government behind it. And through all those phases, the indigenous resistance was always there. But the visibility of the resistance depended on others embracing it, no?\n\nYes, [the Belo Monte project] used to be called Kararaô. And it's curious that people only remember the Belo Monte struggle, because there were many other struggles, that were just as important, that didn't reach the same level of visibility. The biggest struggles - those that reached a high level of visibility and achieved international support - were Belo Monte and Raposa Serra do Sol [an indigenous reservation that landowners tried to reclaim]. Raposa Serra do Sol we won; we got our land settlement. Belo Monte we lost, and now we have Belo Monte stuck in our throats.\n\nIn 1989, under a right-wing - I'd say far-right - government, we stopped the Belo Monte dam project. This time was under a leftist government [that of the Workers' Party (PT)] but we couldn't stop the project. It went through anyway and we had to swallow it. It's really complicated when you see so many political contradictions. [With these contradictions] we can't really tell which noise we have to make to be effective.\n\nWhat was the logic behind the PT pushing through with a project like this?\n\nIn the beginning we had a guarantee by the government that they wouldn't just go ahead with Belo Monte. They were going to consult us. But later [the attitude was] it happens, or it happens. There wasn't another option. It was a project seen as very important for the country, for the nation, and they couldn't go back on it. It was, in a way, \"Well, you don't matter. Whatever the consequences, we'll go through with it.\" It was very, very bad what happened in the end with the construction of the Belo Monte dam.\n\nOn the one hand, there's the developmentalist view that pushes projects like the Belo Monte dam and views indigenous people as standing in the way of progress. On the other, there are environmentalists that value indigenous people for  your role in conservation - but their support stops there. How do you relate to these environmentalist groups?\n\nThere are a lot of environmental institutes that say they support us, that they're with us, but they only really care about preserving a piece of forest so it remains intact. They stand up for the environment but sometimes don't care about who's in there; the people, their social rights. It's like only the environmental agenda matters.\n\nIn recent years this has improved, and they're finally understanding that to move forward with the environmental struggle, you can't be disconnected from the indigenous struggle. You have to fight for indigenous rights, and if you fight for indigenous rights, one of the results, because of our way of life, will be environmental preservation.\n\n[The improved relationship with environmental groups] has given us a jump in visibility. So much that last year, through APIB, I was at Rock in Rio to send a message to the whole world about the rights violations in the Amazon. I also denounced the alliance between economic power and political power in Brazil, and called for land settlements.\n\nThis also means that in the capital, the annoyance with us has grown. The landowning representatives in Congress, the agribusiness, they're more worried. They realized that we gained some strength due to this web of support with the environmentalists and the artists. So they began to attack us more and incite more violence against us.\n\nGiven this, is the Left itself becoming more aware? Is it waking up to the indigenous demands? Because on the other side, we can see that the Right is also trying to get some indigenous peoples on their side.\n\nRight-wing politicians pretend they're good guys, they get close, and they co-opt leadership by promising that they'll solve some of our crucial problems. They try to buy [indigenous] leadership out with small things or even by outright fooling them. Then they go and publicize that they have indigenous support for their own agenda. This is bad because it misleads the public about the positions defended by the indigenous peoples. The indigenous movement is invested in preventing this kind of co-optation, but we can't fix it everywhere because everyone is in need right now. We need social policies and support, so people are ready to believe the politicians that offer them that.\n\nOn the other hand, the Left is now realizing it needs to value us more. We have a new way of participating in the political parties now, that goes beyond us just being members.\n\nIs the Left finally seeing you as not just indigenous leadership but as political leadership in general?\n\nYes. It's important for us to be there not just for the photo ops; but also to overcome our underrepresentation in political and institutional spaces. It's a beginning. We're trying to put forward more indigenous candidates and get the parties to support them. It's complicated because the parties have difficulty with welcoming new leadership -whether they're indigenous or not.But it's harder when they're indigenous. There's an opening now, though.\n\nYou're currently a pre-candidate for the presidency Brazil through PSOL, together with Guilherme Boulos in a co-candidacy arrangement. Does this signal a realization within PSOL that to go forward with the anticapitalist struggle, you have to bring in different types of knowledge from different social movements?\n\nYes, and the recent discussion around global warming has favored this exchange. The whole world is seeking solutions, and in this context, there's no way of denying indigenous peoples. If you compare our way of life to any other, ours is the way that preserves the most, that takes care of nature the most. It's the way that avoids emissions. So there's no way you can ignore ancient knowledge and the traditional, indigenous way of living.\n\nThis helped to push people, and the party itself, to understand that as indigenous people we're not just fighting for ourselves, but can contribute a lot. The Paris Accord helped to promote [this idea], that we need to value scientific knowledge but also include traditional knowledges by first nations and indigenous peoples. Still, we have to fight to define how this recognition should happen in practice. We don't want that acknowledgement to mean commodification of the places we live in and defend.\n\nOne of the themes of your campaign is \"Brazil, 518 years later,\" referencing the start of colonization and the long history of indigenous struggle. Is this a way of reclaiming history from a dominant narrative?\n\nIn Brazil, they've erased this genocide from the country's history. They talk about the \"discovery\" of Brazil by [Portuguese explorer] Pedro Álvares Cabral and then skip to us fighting for our land settlements today. The five hundred years in between is absolutely annulled. The history books still treat us like the ancient indigenous peoples that Cabral encountered, who were exotic and walked around naked and wore feathers everywhere. They don't really talk about the struggles and the resistance.\n\nAnd then people, based on this, turn to us and ask \"Are you a real Indian?\" - I hear that every day. What do you mean by real? I'm real, I'm here. But people express ignorance about what it is to be indigenous. They think that if you're in the city, you speak Portuguese, and you use [modern products], then all of sudden you can't be indigenous anymore. Either you're stuck in the forest, never leaving, or you're not an Indian anymore.\n\nThe rest of our history - the killing, the genocide, the sexual violence against indigenous women - people just don't think about it. Sometimes you even hear people say proudly that they descend from indigenous peoples because their grandmother was \"captured with a lasso.\" They don't connect this with the violence their grandmother and their great-grandmother suffered. And it's the same thing for black people in Brazil. That's why one of our goals is to fight for visibility, so that they know what really happened and that our existence today is the result of a lot of resistance. So to say \"518 years later\" is powerful because it carries a lot of history, a history that isn't really told.\n\nDo you think being a pre-candidate to the presidency of Brazil, as an indigenous leader, will make people take notice of how your politics is important for changing society?\n\nI think so. Even those who didn't recognize us before have to really see us now. They have to understand that we're fighting for the highest institutional position of power. This is big. We're there not just to represent the indigenous and environmental struggles, but also the reconstruction of society that the world needs.\n\nSônia Guajajara is a leader of the Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), and pre-candidate for the vice presidency of Brazil with the Party for Socialism and Freedom (PSOL).\n\nSabrina Fernandes is a Brazilian eco-socialist organizer and communicator with a sociology PhD from Carleton University, Canada.

Thorpe spoke to Jacobin about a centuries-long struggle for justice.\n\nLidia Thorpe is a lifelong fighter for First Nations people in Australia. (Lidia Thorpe / Facebook)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLidia Thorpe is a Gunnia-Gunditjmara woman, a lifelong fighter for First Nations people in Australia and a proud supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2017, Thorpe became the first Aboriginal woman elected to Victoria's legislative assembly. Just three years later, in June 2020, she was preselected by the Greens to represent Victoria in Australia's senate - once again, becoming the first Aboriginal woman to assume that role.\n\nThorpe was born in housing commission flats in Collingwood, Melbourne. She dropped out of high school early, survived domestic violence, and raised three kids as a single parent. More than anyone in parliament, Lidia Thorpe is justified when she says that \"I've met hardship head-on, which enables me to meet my constituents at eye level and not from a position of power looking down.\"\n\nOn October 6, Thorpe was sworn in. She wasted no time making good on her promise to shake things up when she entered the chamber defiantly , one fist raised, wearing a possum skin cloak and carrying a message stick bearing 441 marks - one for each First Nations person who has died in police custody since 1991.\n\nIn just under two months, Thorpe has shown the power that a radical voice in parliament can have. She has used her position to defend sacred trees - up to eight hundred years old - in Djab Wurrung country , in central Victoria, against the state government's plans to destroy them to make room for a highway. Thorpe has also spoken out against the mass incarceration of indigenous people , pushed for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags to be flown in the senate , and advocated for a Green New Deal.\n\nLidia Thorpe is also at the forefront of a developing movement for Indigenous sovereignty, and has argued powerfully, including in Jacobin , for a treaty between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. She has opposed tokenistic and unrepresentative facsimiles of a treaty designed to co-opt or neutralize the Aboriginal liberation movement.\n\nDennis Rogatyuk spoke to Lidia Thorpe about her views on these often complex issues, the inspiration she takes from international struggles, and the transformative politics she will fight for in the senate.\n\nLet's start with a bit about you. Could you tell us about your background?\n\nI come from a strong line of matriarchs. All of my life, my mum, my grandmothers, and their grandmothers have fought for the rights of our people. So, fighting against injustice is something that became normal to me. And that's what I continue to do - it's my responsibility as a sovereign indigenous woman of this country.\n\nBut you know I never thought that I'd end up in politics. It's not a career choice - it's just something that happened, a continuation of the fight for justice for our people and for people who don't have a voice. In this country, poor people, women, the land, and the water - they don't have a voice either. So to be the first indigenous senator for Victoria is incredible. But it also shows how far behind Australia is in ensuring that indigenous voices are heard in the federal parliament.\n\nYou have advocated for indigenous sovereignty very effectively for a number of years now - and it's become one of the most visible political issues in Australia. In particular, you've argued that a treaty must be a first step toward genuine reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Could you run us through your thinking on this?\n\nAboriginal people have never ceded our sovereignty. We've never ceded these lands or waters to the colonizing power. And we've been fighting for justice for almost two hundred and forty years. We've survived mass murder. We've survived massacres.\n\nAnd today we are still trying to survive a more sophisticated approach, which still amounts to genocide and oppression. I'm talking about things like Aboriginal deaths in custody and the removal of children. We have twenty thousand children that are being taken from their families in this country right now - and that's more than the stolen generation.\n\nWar was declared on our people two hundred and forty years ago, when the invaders and the colonizers came here. They've never ended that war. There's never been a peace-making instrument that can bring us together. Constitutional recognition won't do that. Changing the date of Australia Day won't do that. Changing the flag won't do that. We need a peace treaty that will bring people together and stop this regime that is oppressing our people and this country.\n\nWe are the only Commonwealth country in the world that doesn't have a treaty with its first people. It's 2020 - we have the solutions to the injustice that continues. It's time, and we should be able to self-determine our own destiny, as the first people of these lands. We are the oldest continuing living culture on Earth, and we are only 3 percent of this population.\n\nThe instruction from the colonizers was to wipe us and our language out, to take our children, and to take our land. Their plan was to annihilate us, to get rid of us altogether. But they failed. We survived. We are still here and it's a testimony to our resilience and our strength as indigenous people of these lands - and we're not going to give up.\n\nOur support is growing, as you can see with the Black Lives Matter rallies. Australia is waking up to these injustices. And the more people that acknowledge and accept the true history of this country, the more people will come with us, to fight for a treaty in this country.\n\nEarlier in 2020, you published a piece with Jacobin , in the lead up to Australia Day - which is better known to Aboriginal people as Invasion Day. Many on the left argue that the date of Australia Day should be changed, while some others argue that the day should be abolished altogether. What's your take on this issue?\n\nInvasion Day is January 26. That's what it obviously means to us. So when we see Australians partying and drinking and celebrating January 26, it's as though they are dancing on our ancestors' graves. It's so hurtful. And to change the date of Australia Day is only kicking the can down the road - it's not addressing what the day represents.\n\nIf we just change the date, it's not going to change anything for us on the ground. We need to address what that day represents. We need to address what happened - the genocide and the massacres. Until we do that, we can't think about changing the day. We can't think about symbolic gestures that really don't mean much at all to Aboriginal people of these lands.\n\nChanging the date won't change the oppressive behavior of the government or the systemic racism that we endure every day. I believe that if we are ever going to change the date, it would need to be the day that we make a treaty. Only when we truly mature as a nation and acknowledge what's happened can we all move on together.\n\nI'd like to ask more about a treaty with the First Nations in Australia. As you know, the Victorian government has taken steps toward negotiating a separate treaty with Victoria's Aboriginal communities - but as I understand it, you have been quite critical of that, both in terms of its legitimacy and the process surrounding it. Could you explain a little more about your views on this one?\n\nI've been part of those conversations for a number of years now. I was there at the beginning, when the Victorian government came to Aboriginal people asking if we wanted constitutional recognition. At a meeting between over a hundred Aboriginal people from across Victoria and the government, we unanimously voted down any form of constitutional recognition. We said we wanted a treaty first.\n\nSo the Victorian government went off and started this treaty process. They did it in a way that suited them, and they handpicked who they wanted around that table. They didn't go with the thirty-eight nations that already exist in this state. We already have structures that allow those thirty-eight nations to decide who their representatives are - but the government chose not to go down that path.\n\nInstead, the government chose to handpick [indigenous] corporations that they already deal with. So, when we went to a vote over the remainder of the seats, only 7 percent of Aboriginal Victoria participated. Ninety-three percent of Aboriginal people in the state did not vote.\n\nHow can you go forward with only 7 percent participation? That's a real problem. You can't respect the thirty-eight nations that have existed for thousands of years before colonization on that basis. If the government has a top-down, heavy-handed approach, then the process is illegitimate.\n\nWhile they log our country and cut down eight hundred year-old trees , it's pretty hard to think that the government is working in good faith. All we ask is that any treaty process in this country includes the right to representation. It needs to include the voices of all the clans and nations across this country. We won't accept a colonized version of a treaty. It's got to put the people first.\n\nSimilarly, many indigenous sovereignty advocates have argued that the Uluru Statement from the Heart is a step toward recognizing Australia's First Nations, and have supported the push for an amendment to the constitution. Do you see this as a step forward?\n\nThe Uluru Statement has got some beautiful elements to it, particularly its commitment to truth-telling and a treaty. But in my view, we can't rely on the colonizers' constitution. And this is what I hear from grassroots Aboriginal people and activists right across this country.\n\nThe constitution was born in 1901 and it had no regard for Aboriginal people. It had no regard for women. And yet there's a kind of urgency to the calls for Aboriginal people to be included in the Australian constitution. But I feel that this is a type of assimilation, that would redefine us as \"Indigenous Australians.\" It could also potentially negate a treaty process or prevent it from going further.\n\nInstead, we should go back to calling for a treaty. We need to have those conversations, and we need to ensure that they are in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We also need to ensure that there is free prior informed consent, and we need the clans and nations across this country to decide what they want.\n\nI can guarantee you now that there are thousands of Aboriginal people across the country that don't agree with constitutional recognition. Also, elements of the Uluru statement concealed a hidden agenda - but it wasn't hidden to grassroots people. A lot of other things contribute to the problems with the Uluru statement, in terms of how people were treated and excluded from those meetings.\n\nWe support the Uluru statement. But it's important to get the sequence of events right. We want truth-telling first, then we want a treaty next. And finally, constitutional recognition can be part of a treaty negotiation. But before that, we need to end the war in this country. The only way that we can do that is to negotiate a treaty.\n\nWhat do you think the indigenous sovereignty movement in Australia can learn from the struggles of First Nations peoples elsewhere? I'm thinking, in particular, of Māoris in New Zealand/Aotearoa, Native American peoples in North America, and the Aymara, Mapuche, and Quechua peoples - to name just a few - in South America.\n\nThere's a lot we need to learn from one another. Treaties have been made and broken in other parts of the world. So, we need to work in solidarity with one another. We all have experienced the oppressive colonial violence and we've survived. Now, we need to work together to empower our people at the grassroots level and continue our uprising.\n\nOur land is talking to us. Our mother is talking to us. Our water is talking to us. We know that with climate change, we're heading down a really dangerous path. Our countries need the indigenous peoples of those lands to rise up now.\n\nAll of that is due to colonial violence and colonial oppression, which only believes in ripping the country up before selling it off, to create power and wealth. Indigenous people don't work like that. Indigenous people work in harmony with their land, water, and their people and their animals, in a way that sustained ourselves and the land for thousands of generations.\n\nSo we need to come together now. COVID-19 has only exacerbated inequalities in all of our countries. Now, we need our allies - and we need white people across the world to stand with us and call out inequality and injustice, and start holding these governments to account. We need to keep up the pressure, because at the end of the day we have the numbers and the power. We need to activate that now, to change the system.\n\nThe struggles of the First Nations around the world have led to some important victories, particularly in South America. Today, the constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia are not only dedicated to the original owners of the land, but define those countries as plurinational states and enshrine efforts to overcome centuries of colonialism. Do you think some of those examples could offer a model for a plurinational state in Australia?\n\nWhy not? These are the conversations that our people need to have. We have been shut down at every turn, and as a people we've been oppressed for so long. So I'd like my people to look at those models, to find ways that we can move forward. On the surface Australia looks so fine and dandy but scratch the surface and you see how Aboriginal people are treated in our own country. It's hard to survive in this country as a black person.\n\nSo, we want to work with our brothers and sisters in parts of the world where they've managed to rise above that colonial oppression. We are already connected - but we need to widen that and build between First Nations and indigenous people around the world.\n\nWe are already rising up - and part of that is building connections with our brothers and sisters from all over the world. In Madrid last year [ at the COP25 convention ], we talked about that. I connected with indigenous brothers and sisters from around the world who are experiencing firsthand the effects of climate change.\n\nJust being in that room and understanding our struggle was incredibly powerful. I heard stories about what their people - their women, particularly - are experiencing, and it's exactly the same as what's going on here. We need more of those opportunities.\n\nOne of the things that holds us back from that is the everyday struggle for survival. It's so hard to get time to have those yarns. But I think we need to be more strategic, which means making time to strategize worldwide about how we're going to kill off these oppressive, colonial regimes.\n\nTurning back to Australian politics, the Greens have scored some impressive wins recently, especially in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). In the former, the Greens doubled their representation, while in the latter, the Greens have formed a coalition government with Labor. And of course, left-wing Greens such as yourself and Adam Bandt have become more visible. Do you think this reflects a broader shift in the electorate?\n\nAbsolutely. As a black woman I don't describe myself as left, right, or center. I am an indigenous woman and my values are about country, water, and people. If that makes me a leftie then so be it. But that's just another label that the colonizers give you.\n\nAs part of the uprising I was talking about, people are becoming more aware of what the Greens are about. Yes, we're still a very white, privileged party - we want to decolonize the Greens too, which means making space for black people like me. We've got a new senator-elect from Western Australia, an Aboriginal woman. So, there'll be two black women in the Senate.\n\nThis is part of the reason why the Greens are growing in numbers and popularity. Following the Victorian local government elections, the party now has thirty-six councilors. There's one council [The City of Yarra], with a Greens majority.\n\nEven so, there are still many people who don't understand the Greens. They tend to see us as privileged, white leftists. But I would encourage those people to take a deeper look into we stand for. It's very much the same as what indigenous people stand for.\n\nWith regards to the Greens-Labor coalition in the ACT, we can hold Labor to account and help to make Labor better. I've negotiated with Labor in the Victorian Parliament and now in the federal parliament - even if Labor says we can't work together, we know we can. It happens on the ground, and we can continue to make a difference by holding them accountable to the people.\n\nAs the new Greens senator for Victoria and a Gunnai-Gunditjmara woman, your entrance into parliament was a powerful statement on behalf of Aboriginal Australians. How was it received in Australia's conservative-dominated parliament? And what's your experience in parliament been like so far?\n\nI didn't expect the gesture to be so popular and get the media attention that it did. I only thought about raising my fist as I entered the night before - it wasn't pre-planned.\n\nI was frustrated to enter parliament and to be forced to swear allegiance to the colonizing Queen. I wasn't comfortable with that. So, I felt a need to demonstrate my resistance and my people's resistance. Raising my fist was also a way to acknowledge the Aboriginal people who have died in custody, at the hands of the system.\n\nI didn't expect to see a lot of backlash [from the conservatives]. But of course there was - they said that I'm in there to divide the nation, and that I only have one agenda, to represent the First Nations people of this country.\n\nWell suck it up, sunshine! The conservatives also need to be held accountable for the way they spread misinformation. They need to understand and acknowledge the true history of this country - and that's all I'm about. And if that feels uncomfortable to you, if that forces you to look at yourself in the mirror and ask what kind of person you are, I think you can grow from that.\n\nI see the good in people - even in right-wing racists. They must have a good heart in there somewhere, if they could just open that heart and see where we're coming from, and how hurtful colonization is to the First Nations of these lands. If they can do that, maybe they'll come along with us one day on this journey. I still hold hope for that. No one is born racist.\n\nIt seems as though your election to the senate echoes the election of leftists elsewhere, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and Ilhan Omar in the United States. What do you hope to push for in Australia's parliament, and do you take inspiration from their successes?\n\nI am a very big fan of AOC. I watch her speeches and I am just in awe. I say to myself, \"If only I was that smart, if only I could speak like that.\" I didn't have the education; I left school at fourteen and I've been playing catch up ever since.\n\nI'm so inspired by her strength, her resilience, her presence, her agency, and her articulation of the struggle - and how she calls people out. I love that. I'm learning from her more than anything. So, when people tell me that I could be the AOC of Australia, I think \"No way! She's just too amazing.\"\n\nBut we can support each other in solidarity. After all, it's not easy speaking up as a black woman. You saw recently the racism and the sexism that I received in my first month in parliament. That's not new to us - we  experience that all our lives. Even as black children, we experienced that.\n\nCalling that out and having a yarn with one another helps keep us strong. And that's what keeps me strong - seeing other black, indigenous, or POC women calling the system out for what it is.\n\nI'd also like to ask a little more about the Greens. As you know, it's been a difficult year, not just because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also because of the economic crisis. And on top of that, the climate crisis hasn't gone away.\n\nThe Greens have been very effective this year - some would argue that they are becoming the leading opposition party. Could you tell us a little more about the solutions the Greens are advocating for - for example, a Green New Deal?\n\nThe Green New Deal is a way forward that this country needs to take seriously. At the same time as we've produced record carbon emissions, this country has become more unequal. The Green New Deal is about tackling the climate crisis that we have right now. And it's also about addressing inequality by creating sustainable industries and employment options, so that people can transition out of fossil fuel industries that contribute to the climate crisis.\n\nWe need to transition out of coal and out of logging. My grandfather worked and died in coal-fired power stations, because those were the only jobs available at the time. The dirtiest coal-fired powered station in Australia is on my own country, Gunnai country. So, I know a lot of people who work in those power stations and who rely on them for their livelihood.\n\nWe need to create pathways and solutions for those workers to transition into more sustainable industries, so that they don't lose a dollar out of their pay packet. Coal is dying around the country, and around the world in fact. So, we need to make sure they can transition into sustainable jobs that will last much longer.\n\nThat's how the Green New Deal addresses the inequality that so many people in this country face every day, and not just black fellas. We've got a homelessness crisis and a housing crisis on our hands, so it's also about building more public housing for our most vulnerable people. I grew up in public housing, so I know what that can do for somebody.\n\nHaving a home allows you to then get a job and it creates safety for your children. Those public supports allowed me to get a head start in life, and eventually get a job and become self-sustainable and economically independent, as a single mother.\n\nI'd like to finish the interview by returning to the international stage. In the United States, Trump has been defeated at the polls. In Bolivia, a left-wing indigenous party - Movement Toward Socialism - has reclaimed the government, ending over a year of authoritarian rule. And finally the people of Chile have voted overwhelmingly to discard the Pinochet-era constitution and initiate a process of drafting a new one.\n\nHow do you feel about these struggles around the world? Do you believe they can inspire radical change here in Australia?\n\nAbsolutely. There's an uprising that connects indigenous people around the world because we are so intrinsically connected to our country, water, people, and animals. And we are the solution. We are the solution to climate change. We're the custodians of these lands; we can heal our lands and heal each other. There is a higher power that's saying to indigenous people all around the world - it's our time.\n\nThe colonizers have got this wrong for so long. They've destroyed so many indigenous societies around the world and disrupted our connection with our lands. Now, it's time to rise up and fix that. It's time to rise up and bring the rest of the world with us and say - \"Come with us, we have the solutions. We want you to connect with our country the same way as we do because that will heal you too.\"\n\nWe've got to move away from colonial oppression, rise up, and connect more with our land, water, and people. Do what's right by our land. Our mother land is calling all of us now and she is angry. You can see that the cyclones - they call them natural disasters - but that's our mother calling us, crying out for us to come to her and heal her. We need to do that as a human race. We have a responsibility to do that.\n\nLidia Thorpe is a Gunnai-Gunditjmara woman and Greens senator for Victoria.\n\nDenis Rogatyuk is a journalist at El Ciudadano , a writer, contributor, and researcher with a number of publications including Jacobin , Tribune , Le Vent Se Leve , Senso Comune , the GrayZone , and others.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Evo Morales's Movement Toward Socialism party won big - and it would have even performed even better without the undemocratic scheming of the Right.\n\nAn indigenous woman casts her vote during regional elections on March 7, 2021 in Laja, Bolivia, thirty kilometers outside La Paz.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nMarch 7 marked the first local elections in Bolivia since the coup of 2019 that ousted former president Evo Morales. After a fresh surge of popular mobilization finally compelled Jeanine Áñez's \"interim\" regime to hold national elections last October, the Bolivian people voted in a landslide to return to government the same political party - the progressive Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) - that had been driven from power by the coup the previous year.\n\nSince the election of Luis Arce Catacora, MAS has weathered repeated coup plots, but President Arce has held firm. Indeed, the arrest of Áñez and a number of her former ministers and ex-commanders over the weekend - a story causing much scandal in the international press - indicates that justice might finally be seen for those families of the dozens massacred, and many hundreds injured, during the violent ousting of Morales from the presidency.\n\nIn local elections, MAS has again had a strong showing, and seems to have swept the country in the vote for governors, regional assemblies, mayors, and city council people. The significant exception is the cities with wealthy enclaves, which identify as mestizo. Final results should be known once rural votes from far-flung hamlets are counted. (The electoral observer mission of Parlasur opposes the quick count of votes because it \"generates confusion.\")\n\nAs Bolivian journalist Ollie Vargas has noted , \"there is not a single organization that is challenging MAS at the national level. MAS is Bolivia's only political party with a physical presence in every municipality, in every region, and every culture within the country.\" In the cities, the lay of the land is quite different, and it is here that the right-wing head of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in Bolivia, Salvador Romero, has had a major influence.\n\nIt is thanks to decisions made by him - allowing ultra-right, corrupt candidates to run for office, despite the clear legal impediment to their candidacies - that the TSE has helped secure the right-wing capture of cities like La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Potosí. El Alto and probably the regional capital of Pando have been won by woman candidates who had once been members of MAS.\n\nSalvador Romero has a long and dubious history on the Right. According to the Honduran historian and PhD student of history at Yale, and immigrants' rights organizer Cristian Padilla, Romero was a key player in the coup d'état in Honduras in 2009, maintaining deep connections to the Honduran elite, as well as with the US foreign policy establishment.\n\nThe Honduran coup took place on the day of a democratic referendum on constitutional reform. The military seized progressive president Manuel (Mel) Zelaya, taking him first to a US airbase and then into exile, thus launching Honduras into its most tragic decade since the republic was founded, and from which it has yet to emerge.\n\nSalvador Romero worked in Honduras from 2011 to 2014 to legitimize the coup regime and the ensuing elections, paid on the books by a US-created agency, the so-called National Democratic Institute (NDI). Although Romero is head of the elections process unfolding amidst high tension in Bolivia, he left Bolivia and went to Honduras this week, where he is an electoral observer of their primary elections.\n\nPrior to his directorship of the NDI in Honduras, Salvador Romero had nurtured his relationship \"with the US Agency for International Development or US AID in Bolivia.\" According to documents made available to WikiLeaks, Romero worked closely with US ambassador Philip Goldberg, who was expelled by former president Evo Morales in 2008 following the revelation of the ambassador's intimate association with right-wing elites that were planning to secede from Bolivia.\n\nRomero's role as the head of the electoral tribunal has been instrumental for the outcome in the major cities, and three of Romero's decisions in particular have changed the course of the elections. First was Romero's decision to allow the right-wing candidate for mayor of La Paz, Luis Larrea, to remain in the race, even after he had broken election rules that forbid media appearances in the days leading up to an election.\n\nA doctor and media personality, Larrea has been a key player in a medical strike called by private physicians, in opposition to the government's new legislation to regulate fees for private practitioners as well as medicines. For figures like Larrea, the idea of health care as a public good - a policy championed by MAS - is heavily contested as a limit on their income. Private doctors lived high off the hog during the eleven months of the coup regime and presided over one of the worst-managed COVID-19 crises on Earth.\n\nAdding salt to the wound, the leaders of the private physicians' association had agreed to the MAS government's new law regulating prices for health care, but then broke their word and went out on strike. It was the exact moment when mass vaccinations were just beginning and elections were around the corner.\n\nAccording to an investigation by the national human rights defenders' office, some 80 percent of hospitals and clinics refused to join the strike. The public was not impressed by the striking doctors' arguments either. But for reasons that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal is not required to divulge, the original sanction against Larrea's candidacy was subsequently reversed.\n\nIn another opaque decision, a former military officer who has just won the mayorship of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa, was also removed from the race only to be reinstated by Romero at the last minute. That Reyes Villa was allowed to run is astonishing : he does not live in Cochabamba, he is himself in trouble with the justice system, and prior to his recent return to the country during the coup regime, he has not resided in Bolivia for ten years. One of these infringements alone should have been enough to disqualify Reyes Villa from the race.\n\nAs a young man, Reyes Villa served in the military during the height of the South American dictatorships, and trained at the US \"School of the Americas\" whose torture manuals are public knowledge and whose graduates committed many of the region's crimes against humanity. Early in the era of Evo Morales, he emerged as a national leader of the secessionist movement that sought to divide the country, with guidance from the same US ambassador who tore apart Yugoslavia, Philip Goldberg.\n\nMore recently, Reyes Villa was mayor of Cochabamba in the 1990s, and fled from Bolivia under investigation for a slew of corruption charges. He formed paramilitary shock groups to attack peaceful marches of the Indigenous. He would not have returned from his US exile had Jeanine Áñez not welcomed him back as a hero of the Right. Both Reyes Villa and Luis Fernando Camacho, the winner of the governorship of the agro-industrial powerhouse of Santa Cruz, dream of seceding from Bolivia to create a politically fascist republic in the country's lowlands.\n\nThe winner of the La Paz mayoral race, Iván Arias, should also have been excluded from running thanks to various corruption charges against him, most notably as the minister of public works, a role to which he was appointed by Áñez. He was a prominent member of the coup government from the very beginning.\n\nIván Arias tried everything short of physical assault to injure his main competitor for the mayorship of La Paz, MAS candidate and early frontrunner César Dockweiler. (Dockweiler's company  constructed the network of cable cars that linked La Paz and El Alto during Morales's era.) Arias ran a persecutory campaign against Dockweiler, falsely accusing him of corruption, sedition, and terrorism. It was such smears that destroyed Dockweiler's early lead in the polls.\n\nThrough these actions, Salvador Romero has all but handed over these populous cities to mayors who view MAS as their sworn enemy, and who in their careers so far, have created and celebrated paramilitary machines.

Mídia NINJA / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBrazil's right wing has gotten ahead through a series of dirty tricks. The 2015 impeachment of Workers Party (PT) president Dilma Rousseff, pushed through despite the absence of any \"crime of responsibility,\" is the most notorious example. Now, through similarly slick manuevers, they're seeking further restrictions on reproductive rights. This, in a country where already one woman dies from a clandestine abortion procedure every nine minutes.\n\nCurrently, abortion is legal only in particular cases, such as when there's a direct threat to the life of the pregnant person, or when the pregnancy results from rape. It's these exceptions that the conservative and Evangelical parliamentary front is seeking to destroy. Through a variety of proposed bills and amendments, they may eliminate the right to abortion completely .\n\nOne proposal sought to establish conception as the moment when life begins. But that was taking too long, so the front decided to push their agenda through a different bill, called PEC 181, which would extend maternity leave for mothers of premature babies.\n\nThe tactic was simple: find a bill that women of all political visions will support, work directly with the women involved, create an emotional narrative about the connection between a mother and her child, and insert, somewhere in there, what's known in Brazil as a \"turtle\" clause: a provision snuck into a separate, unrelated bill. If the bill is time sensitive, the \"turtle\" clause might get pushed through without due public debate.\n\nEduardo Cunha , the previous parliamentary leader, who also drove Rousseff's impeachment, is responsible for writing the anti-abortion turtle clause in PEC 181.\n\nSo far, this strategy has made some headway. But in seeking to eliminate the right to abortion altogether, conservatives may have overreached. Women in Brazil are ready to fight for the few reproductive rights they still have left.\n\nThe Evangelical church is the major social force driving Brazilian conservatives' political project. Brazil is still the most Catholic country in the world, but the Catholic population has fallen while the Evangelical community has grown.\n\nThough there are different strands of Evangelism, it's the mega-church, prosperity gospel, morally conservative kind that has a national political project in Brazil. Unlike the Catholic church, the Evangelical churches have invested heavily in electing their pastors and members to all levels of political representation. They also work to establish relationships with the judiciary, the executive, and high-ranking bureaucrats and successful businessmen. Mirroring the televangelists and mega-churches of the United States, they preach financial prosperity as the path towards a \"nation chosen by God.\"\n\nTheir federal parliamentary front consists of almost two hundred congressmembers, acting in tandem with other powerful fronts. Prominent among these are agribusiness, business, the construction sector, and, crucially, the family front: 238 congress-members whose families have pursued political power in Brazil for decades now. Together, these fronts acted in opposition to Rousseff and have helped to keep Michel Temer as president despite his abysmal approval rating.\n\nMembers of the Evangelical front come from different parties, from the extreme conservative right to the moderate left, including the Workers Party. Though they don't vote together on everything, they collude on issues involving religion and traditional family values.\n\nTo expand their social base beyond the churches from which they emerged, the family front stokes moral panics, especially around \"concern for children.\" These panics have united conservative churches with liberal-conservative movements and parties - including some that attempt to project a non-partisan, independent image, like the Free Brazil Movement - in outbursts against the left, the LGBTQ community, and feminists, accused of corrupting \"our children.\"\n\nIn September, the front sparked a frenzied movement to close a queer art exhibit , claiming it promoted incest, pedophilia, and religious heresy. Then there was the campaign against São Paulo's Museum of Modern Art, for admitting children to an exhibit involving artistic nudity. These culminated into a generalized crusade against art and progressive intellectual work, setting the stage for the outrageous physical confrontation against Judith Butler and her partner Wendy Brown when they visited Brazil earlier this month.\n\nButler symbolizes the enemy for conservatives, since, according to them, she supports not only feminism and queer \"corruption,\" but also bestiality, Marxism, and communism. For the Right, the moral panic is part of a broader project of promoting anti-leftist sentiment, especially as elections approach.\n\nThe Right's moral panics and anti-leftist campaign tend to converge on a single target: women, and their growing presence in the political field. Feminist action gained widespread visibility with the June 2013 protests , when a hike in bus fares sparked a generalized social revolt. Women took a leading role in the protests and were key in keeping the movement's demands progressive. They took to the streets en masse to denounce conservative pastor Marco Feliciano and Eduardo Cunha, sparking \"Cunha Out!\" demonstrations organized by the Left.\n\nAll sectors of the right wing, whether conservative, neoliberal, or hybrid are driven by fear of the momentum behind such feminist action.\n\nThat's not to say that Brazil's feminist movements are entirely cohesive or united. The normalization of sexism in leftist organizations, the influence of both liberal and radical feminism online, and the disconnect of that feminism from class-based struggles all work to fragment the women's movement. Yet, for the Right, feminism is seen as a homogeneous movement: the Left's tool for attacking the status quo. And they're only partly wrong. Butler may not be the \"Marxist witch\" her protesters believe her to be. But the currents she represents - questioning gender norms, struggles against rape culture, and a focus on women's collective problems - do tend to open space for leftist ideology.\n\nThis poses a threat to the Right as leftist women have started coordinating explosive popular campaigns and mobilizations. They filled the vaccum created by the official left's uneven mobilization against the neoliberal government. In an interregnum period, marked by a highly fragmented left plagued by the PT's contradictions and sectarianism, Brazil's \"feminist spring\" has helped keep popular stagnation at bay.\n\nWomen have been prominent in the anti-Temer mobilizations, and are starting to demand more representation within leftist parties, unions, and movements. The Right is particularly concerned about the growing presence of leftist women as political representatives. The 2016 municipal elections saw the rise of feminist city councillors, even in places where conservatism was on the rise. Names such as Sâmia Bonfim , Talíria Petrone , Fernanda Melchionna , and Marielle Franco , among others, are becoming more well-known despite the right's attacks.\n\nWomen have also started to populate the higher levels of politics. Luciana Genro was The Party  of Socialism and Freedom's (PSOL) presidential candidate in 2014; the United Socialist Workers Party (PSTU) recently made Dayse Oliveira their vice presidential candidate; and there are talks about Áurea Carolina , a black feminist who won the most city council votes in Belo Horizonte, and Sonia Guajajara , an indigenous woman leader of growing prominence, as potential names in next year's presidential race.\n\nThis puts the right in a delicate tactical position: if they attack women frontally, they have to brace for the potential whiplash of women's mobilizations across the country. Just in the past week, there were dozens of mobilizations against PEC 181 and there are bound to be many more if the men in congress trying to push the bill don't abandon it. The turf wars are intense, with conservative men spreading outrageous lies about feminist eugenics schemes to abort male babies. This plays out in the mainstream media, as well as online, where the Brazilian right has managed to keep a loyal and growing base of followers.\n\nThe stakes of this battle are high. Brazilian women still need and get abortions despite the laws against them. Some estimates put them at two thousand abortions per day. The majority of the women who can pay for safe (or at least safer) clandestine procedures are white and middle- and upper-class. The majority of women who can't - and who risk it with trafficked pills and homemade procedures - are black and live in the poor peripheries; these are the people who bear the brunt of conservatism.\n\nWhat the Right underestimates is how the abortion debate unites these women of vastly different backgrounds across Brazil. And that includes religious women: groups like Catholics for the Right to Decide act as pioneers within and outside their own circles. Even Evangelical women are taking a stand, with the recent creation of the Evangelical Front for Legalizing Abortion.\n\nIf leftist organizations and their feminist sectors play this right - summoning women to stand up to the right to choose motherhood or not, whether or not they would have an abortion themselves - feminist acts of resistance for reproductive justice may get the masses stirring again in Brazil.\n\nSabrina Fernandes is a Brazilian eco-socialist organizer and communicator with a sociology PhD from Carleton University, Canada.

But absent real leverage from labor, it's likely to be continually watered down into a toothless slogan for NGOs.\n\nSolving the ecological crisis requires a mass movement to take on hugely powerful industries.

On his first day in office, he took down the White House's climate policy web page and replaced it with his \"America First Energy Plan.\" On his fifth day, he signed executive orders approving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, rolling back the modest gains of the climate and indigenous anti-pipeline movements. In a speech proclaiming what he called \"American energy dominance,\" he excitedly announced that the country had \"more than 250 years' worth of clean, beautiful coal.\" He appointed fossil fuel industry hacks to his cabinet. He sold or leased public lands at an extraordinary scale. He unleashed an unprecedented wave of deregulation rescinding more than a hundred environmental rules for industry.\n\nWhile no one on the Left will fondly remember the Trump era, we have to understand what his defeat means. Donald Trump's offensive environmental agenda - both offensive to the polite belief in science and offensive in the sense of actively pushing environmental destruction - created utter despair among environmental activists. Yet it also created a kind of delusion. The presence of \"post-truth\" Trump in office intensified the sense that environmental struggle is, at its core, a struggle over knowledge and science. For example, a movement of professional liberal activists organized a \"March for Science,\" explicitly disavowing politics. The organizers asserted the march \"is not a political protest,\" let alone a struggle over material control of resources. There became a sense that if we could simply eject the \"denier in chief\" and install a Democrat who \"believes science,\" we could start to take the necessary action to solve the climate and ecological crisis. The election of Joe Biden as president is stoking these hopes.\n\nBut we've seen this movie before. When it comes to the climate crisis, offensive Republican environmental destruction is only slightly worse than enlightened Democratic Party environmental destruction. After eight years of a pro-fossil fuel George W. Bush administration, President Barack Obama announced in a victory speech : \"This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\" Yet, if anything, the age of American energy dominance was not a Trump creation but a product of the Obama era. Beyond rhetoric, fossil fuel extraction expanded much more under Obama than under Trump. The climate change believer even bragged about this in a 2018 public event: \"Suddenly America is the largest oil producer . . . that was me, people . . . say thank you.\"\n\nWe are entering a kind of hamster-wheel cycle of environmental politics where new horizons of hope appear simply by removing a Republican from office. Today, as in 2008, a new set of deadlines are being discussed (2035 and 2050) that are far enough away to stall dramatic action and close enough to appear scientifically credible. Yet this cycle always delays what is obviously needed: confrontation with the powerful industries responsible.\n\nWhen comparing the political possibilities of 2020 and 2008, there are some major differences. First, as predicted, the climate crisis has intensified to the point where no serious person denies something is very wrong. The wildfire-induced Black Summer of 2019-2020 in Australia was followed by yet another summer in North America marked by smoke-darkened skies and supercharged hurricanes. As I write this, even oil and gas companies are relenting under investor pressure to announce their plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. These ongoing effects are merely the product of roughly 1.2 degrees of warming above preindustrial levels; experts think we will likely reach 1.5 degrees by 2030 and 2 degrees between 2034 and 2052. 7 Frankly, the climate system does not care if the president believes climate science. We are approaching our last chance to ignite a massive transformation of our entire industrial and energy system.\n\nSecond, there is finally a policy program with the potential to generate the kind of mass popular support needed to achieve it: the Green New Deal (GND). The program aimed to solve inequality and climate change with a straightforward working-class program based on public investment, a job guarantee, and economic rights to health care, housing, and a living wage. While the Right has consistently used class-based appeals to mobilize opposition to environmental policies, the Left has finally come up with a class-based environmental politics.\n\nAs I will detail below, however, all the excitement around the GND was predicated on the idea of the Left occupying state power; a prospect that crashed on the electoral realities of 2020. We now face a neoliberal Biden presidency and the slimmest of Democratic margins in both houses of Congress. There are still far too many right-wing Democrats who can stall a GND agenda (not to mention Biden himself). What we need now is a sober analysis of the balance of class forces to understand what is and is not possible. We also need to recognize the ongoing danger of Biden and the Democratic Party - still staunchly a party of capital - assimilating the more radical GND coalition into the dead-end conciliatory politics of compromise and half measures. With the excitement of the Bernie Sanders presidential runs behind us, our only option now is to commit to strengthening working-class organization in the workplace and beyond, where durable political commitments and power can be built.\n\nWhat follows is a narrative history of the climate stalemate over the last twelve years. We still need to understand the almost inexplicable level of inaction on what many describe as the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced. The last four years have built momentum toward real transformation, but the last year shows some concerning trends of movement conciliation before the fight really begins.\n\nIt can be easy to forget the real sense of momentum in climate politics in 2008. Al Gore's 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth and the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007 created a clamoring sense of urgency. The planet was sending even more alarming signals : in 2007, the extent of Arctic sea ice reached a record low. Like today's Sunrise Movement, there was a fresh activist group (350.org) organizing mass protests calling for action.\n\nThis momentum built steadily up until the fall of 2008 with two world-historic events: the largest financial crash since the 1930s and the election of an insurgent candidate as US president named Barack Obama. As many point out, the origins of the very notion of a Green New Deal can be traced to this period. The November 24, 2008 issue of Time featured an image of Obama superimposed over an image of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (headline: \"The New New Deal\"). In fact, what Kate Aronoff and coauthors call the \"faux Green New Deal\" was limited in ambition. Yet we shouldn't forget that many on the Left were already calling for a more radical version of it. In October 2008, the Nation ran a piece by Van Jones rejecting what he called \"eco-elitism\" in favor of \"eco-populism.\" He advocated \"building a New Deal coalition for the new century\" that would include labor unions, environmentalists, students, faith groups, and social justice activists. 1\n\nBy January 2009, with the economy in free fall and the Democrats in charge of the executive and legislative branches, one couldn't imagine more favorable conditions for transformative change. Yet even before Obama took office, his commitment to a left program to rescue the economy and climate was already in doubt. His cabinet appointees were directly advised by a Citigroup executive. Obama fought to limit the ambition of his stimulus package in order to attract Republican support. In the end, it didn't even exceed $800 billion. Although the stimulus contained significant money for renewable energy, emissions were basically flat during his eight years in office.\n\nIn 2007's Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency decision, the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases should be regulated through the Clean Air Act, giving the Obama administration full executive authority to tackle the problem. Obama chose not to take this route. Instead, he proposed new legislation by compromising with Republicans and industry. The result was a neoliberal free-market policy: a cap on emissions combined with trading of emission credits (\"cap and trade\"). As Theda Skocpol shows in excruciating detail , Obama made no effort to mobilize the public but rather created a behind-closed-doors process of what she calls \"corporatist bargaining\": elite negotiation between state leaders and powerful interest groups. At the core of this process was the US Climate Action Partnership - an alliance between the large environmental organizations like Environmental Defense Fund and polluting corporations such as Caterpillar and Duke Energy. The arcane market-based policy obviously generated no positive public enthusiasm. Instead, it emboldened an emergent Tea Party opposition, who deemed it \"cap and tax.\"\n\nThings went from bad to worse in 2010. In spring of that year, Obama announced a major offshore drilling plan as a fig leaf to industry to garner support for the doomed \"cap-and-trade\" legislation. On April 2, 2010, he boasted : \"It turns out . . . that oil rigs today generally don't cause spills. They are technologically very advanced.\" Eighteen days later, the largest maritime oil spill in US history (Deepwater Horizon) occurred. Even worse, after narrowly passing the House, the cap-and-trade legislation failed in the Senate, and, after Obama's drubbing in the 2010 midterm elections, climate legislation was considered \"off the table.\"\n\nThings were not any better in international climate negotiations. Again, we forget just how much optimism surrounded Obama's election and the 2009 United Nations meeting in Copenhagen - called \"Hopenhagen.\" Yet it was climate believer Obama who hijacked the meeting :\n\nThe key moment at Copenhagen was when President Barack Obama burst into a room where the leaders of all four BASIC [Brazil, South Africa, India, and China] were meeting in private, and together . . . set aside the existing negotiating texts entirely and drafted their own deal.\n\nThey argued a binding agreement was too \"top down\" and that they wanted a more flexible \"bottom up\" (grassroots?) approach. In the end, Obama continued the United States' long-standing role as the key barrier to international cooperation. The 2015 Paris Agreement - while historic - was simply a fulfillment of Obama's Copenhagen vision of a purely voluntary agreement with no enforcement teeth.\n\nAfter another crushing defeat in the midterm elections of 2014, Obama attempted to salvage his climate legacy by doing what he should have done on day one: using the Clean Air Act to directly regulate greenhouse gases. His Clean Power Plan was ambitious, but too little too late - it got held up in the courts before being repealed by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, Obama's true legacy was the explosion of oil and gas extraction during his eight years in office. At its peak in 2015, crude oil production was up an astonishing 89 percent since January 2009. Despite some notable victories to halt the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, by the end of his term , \"fossil fuel companies had added enough pipeline to encircle the globe almost seven times, all with the approval of the executive branch.\"\n\nThis record should give us pause when considering the fledgling Biden administration. What explains Obama's conciliatory deference to the fossil fuel industry? For an explanation, we have to look beyond the typical stories of corruption and contributions to political campaigns. As Kevin Young and coauthors argue, Obama's subservience to the fossil fuel industry is more rooted in the \"structural power of business.\" Their study shows how Obama was held hostage by a sustained \"capital strike\" - banks holding on to cash and industries refusing to hire. On the environmental front, transformative action was blocked by a \"threat, constantly reiterated by energy companies, that aggressive regulations would trigger retaliatory actions by the polluters that would disrupt the flow of investments into the energy sector on which the economy depended.\" Given that we are currently experiencing another massive economic crisis - and that Biden actually received notable contributions from fossil fuel companies - the idea we can push Biden to the left through political lobbying and rhetorical persuasion is not likely.\n\nIn a case of silver linings, the election of a deranged reality star as president in 2016 emboldened the Left. Having united behind the nearly successful 2016 Bernie Sanders run, Trump's victory - combined with Hillary Clinton's incompetent campaign - felt like the death knell of Third Way neoliberalism. Frustration with the neoliberal center pushed left environmental movements to more confidently distance themselves from standard market policies like carbon pricing. For much of the 2010s, the carbon tax was seen as common sense: it was included in Bernie Sanders's platform, and Jacobin ran articles promoting its policy advantages. By 2017, it was clear that neoliberal market tinkering underestimated the scale of the crisis. As Aronoff put it in her formative essay \"No Third Way for the Planet\" : \"Framing the carbon tax as a silver bullet for the planet's ills runs a deadly serious risk of obscuring how big the changes physics demands really are.\" Additionally, carbon pricing could easily be framed by the Right as \"costs\" to everyday working people. On cue, the 2018 French \"yellow vest\" movement proved you can't implement a climate agenda through carbon taxes on the back of an already strapped working class.\n\nA consensus formed on the climate left that we needed to construct political demands that were less about wonky market fixes and more about delivering real material benefits. In early 2018, climate activists were arguing that the GND could be the \"Medicare for All of climate change.\" The urgency was intensified by the famous October 2018 IPCC report , which suggested that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees required \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\"\n\nThe GND exploded onto the scene in mid-November 2018, when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez teamed up with the Sunrise Movement to occupy the office of Democratic Party leader Nancy Pelosi. This sit-in for a GND - with signs reading \"Green Jobs for All\" - created massive media attention and excitement in the climate policy community. It is notable that Ocasio-Cortez chose climate as her first policy intervention, just weeks before being sworn in as an elected member of Congress. She understood that the scale of the crisis contained all the elements of resurrecting a left working-class agenda: confrontation with corporate power, redistribution from the rich, and massive public investment based on a job guarantee.\n\nAfter the sit-in, Ocasio-Cortez's office, along with left think tanks like New Consensus, started working out the details of what a Green New Deal could look like. The official rollout came in February 2019, with the introduction of the nonbinding Green New Deal resolution, cosponsored by Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts senator Ed Markey. This rollout was, unfortunately, badly botched. Ocasio-Cortez's office released an FAQ document to the media. The document - which appeared to be written by her then-chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti - was not only poorly written and sloppy but contained alienating environmentalist language like describing a long-term goal to \"fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes.\"\n\nOf course, the FAQ document was immediately taken up by Fox News to paint the GND as a liberal austerity plot by elite do-gooders to take things away from the working class. Congressman Rob Bishop from Utah held an event where he accused the GND of wanting to \"control [his] life\" and take away his right to eat hamburgers: \"If this goes through, this [hamburger] will be outlawed.\" He took a bite while his allies pleaded, \"Pass it around!\" This event was specifically reacting to a comment by Ocasio-Cortez suggesting people could eat fewer burgers. While such a statement is undoubtedly true, it shows how difficult it is for the environmentalist left to maintain message discipline and highlight material gains. The typical scolding around what we must all give up plays directly into the Right's hands.\n\nLater in 2019, Bernie Sanders announced his own Green New Deal platform . Many scientists immediately heralded it as the first presidential climate plan that matched the scale of the crisis. In contrast, his apparent progressive rival Elizabeth Warren's plan promised to green the military. Much of the pundit class focused on the plan's price tag of $16 trillion, but its most radical and distinctive aspect was Sanders's proposal to expand publicly owned electricity. Taking its cue from a People's Policy Project proposal for a green Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Sanders proposed expanding the TVA, in addition to a plan to \"pour funding into the four existing 'power marketing administrations' that are overseen by the Energy Department.\" One In These Times headline read, \"Bernie Sanders Calls to Seize the Means of Electricity Production.\"\n\nSanders's plan was exceptional because - unlike much public power activism that focuses on local control or municipalization - it sought large-scale nationwide restructuring of the electricity industry toward public control and planning. This is exactly the approach we need, since we are not likely to \"municipalize\" individual utilities one community at a time. Neoliberals criticized this plan because it would create a public option for electricity that distorted the market. As Third Way energy expert Joshua Freed put it, \"What the Sanders proposal would do is create an 800-pound federally owned power gorilla that would make it very hard for the existing generators to compete.\" Given that it is those very same generators who continue to burn fossil fuels to make profit for investors, isn't that exactly the point? No other Democratic Party contenders, however, were willing to say this out loud.\n\nAs we know, Sunrise and the larger climate movement got behind the Sanders campaign - but it failed. This loss had unavoidable implications for the entire Green New Deal project that had gained such momentum between 2018 and 2020. I offer three critical appraisals. First, the GND was a breakthrough for environmental politics in its assertion of a working-class program . Yet we should keep in mind a difference articulated by trade unionist Andrew Murray - and repeated by Leo Panitch and coauthors - between a \"class-focused\" and a \"class-rooted\" politics. The recent resurgence of the Left - what Anton Jäger calls \"left populism\" - is clearly a politics for and not of the working class. This was decidedly the case with the Green New Deal. It was a brilliant policy framework but still one formulated by academics, think tanks, and NGO professionals: a politics of the professional class for the working class. Perhaps most of the energy behind GND organizing was driven by aspirant professionals: high school and college students involved in the Sunrise Movement, Zero Hour, and the student climate strike. Although Sunrise boasts an army of young activists and employs militant language, it was itself born from the environmental NGO complex - its origins include a $50,000 grant and office space from the Sierra Club Foundation in 2017. It also runs a political action committee (PAC) that raised $2.3 million in the 2020 election cycle.\n\nThe professional-class base behind the GND allowed much of the activist language specific to this class to infiltrate the program. Although Sanders and the People's Policy Project advanced a national public power plan, activists focused on more localist \"community-owned, and community-accountable\" visions of public power , like a small solar co-op in Brooklyn. These not only fall into the trap of what Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams call \"folk politics\" - an emphasis on the small-scale, local, and grassroots against any large-scale vision of social change - but are obviously out of step with the scale of the climate crisis, which will not be solved one Brooklyn co-op at a time.\n\nSecond, much of the organizing between 2017 and 2020 was predicated on the intoxicating promise of the Left winning state power - particularly at the executive level. Prior to defeat, Panitch and coauthors excitedly described the Corbyn and Sanders movements: \"Nothing like this has happened in at least three generations.\" They speculated about what a \"socialist-led government\" would face and suggested that much of the Left was still marked by a \"failure to prepare adequately for the challenge of transforming state apparatuses.\" Similarly, Mike McCarthy, writing in Jacobin , warned that \"our first 100 days could be a nightmare.\" Now, the nightmare is simply the harsh electoral realities. But the entire GND program had to be delivered through the state. This was so alluring because, as Christian Parenti and Andreas Malm rightly argue, it is hard to imagine such a scale of transformation being achieved without the coercive and fiscal power of the state. After all, it was the state that delivered the original New Deal - much of which consisted of tremendous new investments in energy infrastructure.\n\nThird, the theory of change was backward. Sanders had promised that, once in office, he would awaken the sleeping giant of the working class and build an extra-electoral mass movement to confront Wall Street, health insurance conglomerates, and the fossil fuel industry. It was unique that the \"organizer in chief\" understood that he alone could not implement his agenda. Yet Sanders himself probably suspected that winning state power before achieving mass working-class organization is not how it works. The necessary hordes of formerly disillusioned working-class voters did not turn out in the primaries as we hoped. Quite the opposite - the threat of Sanders led to a turnout surge among suburban liberals and people Matt Karp termed \"Halliburton Democrats.\" Too much of the existing working class is still beset by apathetic cynicism, or what the late Mark Fisher called \"reflexive impotence\": \"[People] know things are bad, but . . . know they can't do anything about it.\"\n\nIt is clear that a working-class politics - let alone a \"socialist-led government\" - cannot be conjured from nothing. We will need to build capable working-class organizations first (e.g., strong unions, media, and other infrastructure), before we can expect to vie for state power. As Jane McAlevey asserts , there are still no shortcuts to building power. The Green New Deal and Bernie Sanders's campaign were always a shortcut. Given the intense timeline we are facing on climate change, they were a shortcut worth pursuing.\n\nIn March 2020, the position of Bernie's campaign went from front-runner to certain defeat in a matter of weeks - followed by the onset of COVID-19. The GND activist base quickly recalibrated strategy, from building a movement around a candidate we wanted to \"pushing\" the candidate we were stuck with. In April, a coalition of neoliberal Democrats, large environmental organizations, Sunrise, and other GND leaders was announced called \"Climate Power 2020.\" In May, Julian Brave NoiseCat, a staffer at Data for Progress, declared that the movement was ready to align with the Democrats: \"We're moving from a phase of contention and division within the party . . . into one of alignment.\" Strategically, one could say these alliances were necessary to defeat Trump, but it was a jarringly rapid shift from militancy to assimilation.\n\nThe most notable collaboration was the Unity Task Force on Climate Change - one of six task forces intended to unite the Biden and Sanders wings of the party. This task force included Ocasio-Cortez and Sunrise cofounder Varshini Prakash, as well as establishment figures like John Kerry and conservative Democrats like Pennsylvania representative Conor Lamb. Out of the negotiations came Biden's climate plan in July, which was heralded for its historic ambition. It featured a goal of spending $2 trillion and completely decarbonizing the electric sector by 2035. The plan seemed to signal Biden's endorsement of the Green New Deal, but two months later, both Biden and his vice presidential pick, Kamala Harris, refused to admit this on the debate stages.\n\nSince Biden's win, Sunrise and other GND advocates have been laser-focused on his cabinet appointments. Biden has created two new cabinet-level climate positions and wants to put climate at the center of all the cabinet agencies' activities. The appointment of New Mexico representative Deb Haaland as interior secretary - an indigenous woman and a supporter of the Green New Deal and Medicare for All - was probably the most significant win on this front. But, overall, the New York Times reports , \"Mr. Biden remains a centrist, establishment politician. And he is crafting a centrist, establishment administration.\" If Obama's cabinet picks represented a right-wing administration handpicked by Citigroup, Biden promises a move to the center-right. The once-militant GND movement also shifted to less confrontational and choreographed rallies meant to \"push\" Biden left. As a journalist reported at a late-November rally , \"Their posture was less confrontational than two years ago.\"\n\nTo give credit, the GND movement has clearly shifted the \"Overton window\" of what is possible in climate politics. From 2008 through 2016, the main policy debate was between neoliberal market schemes - either carbon tax or cap and trade. It is quite impressive to see that Biden's plan doesn't even mention carbon pricing and focuses much more on public investment and \"good union jobs.\" Yet simply granting radical GND activists \"a seat at the table\" will in no way guarantee them the power to implement their agenda. The fact is that Biden's $2 trillion climate plan is just as unlikely to pass Congress as Obama's cap-and-trade legislation was (even with the Senate). The Democrats' Overton window only appears to shift what can be proposed, not what can be implemented.\n\nBiden appears poised to reproduce Obama's commitment to what Skocpol called \"corporatist bargaining\" - bringing all the stakeholders to the table, including the affected industries. As Jane McAlevey reminds us , this \"confuse[s] access for power.\" It is this kind of bargaining that leads to industry-friendly half measures like cap and trade or the Affordable Care Act. Even Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve and the new Treasury secretary - a pick that progressives have largely welcomed - is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council: a collaboration with major oil and gas firms that remains committed to carbon pricing as the sensible approach to solving the climate crisis. Just recently, Biden's pick for \"climate envoy,\" John Kerry, was quoted as saying about oil companies , \"I'm reaching out to them because I want to hear from them . . . I'm listening to what their needs are.\"\n\nThe main problem remains that the GND movement is still, at its core, based in professional-class activist networks in academia, NGOs, and think tanks. Take one of the key demands of the Biden plan emerging out of the Climate Unity Task Force: 40 percent of Biden's $2 trillion in spending was to be allocated to so-called frontline communities. This is the name for communities most at risk from climate disasters (e.g., coastal communities) as well as those directly exposed to risks from fossil fuel systems (e.g., black communities along the \"cancer alley\" of chemical production on the Gulf Coast). Sunrise's Prakash called this a \"huge\" win for the GND movement, and it was seen as one of the main concessions to the task force's \"progressive\" wing.\n\nOf course, any climate action should focus on those most directly affected by climate risks. But this is less of a real material pledge to these communities than it is a concession to the GND activists' core moral sensibilities. Indeed, the language of justice, frontline communities, and centering the most marginalized - what I call \"livelihood environmentalism\" - is like moralistic catnip for this activist base. While this language inundates grant applications and academic jobs, poor and marginalized communities continue to face the injustice of disproportionate environmental risks. They still lack the kind of broad-based coalition - that is, power - to take on capitalist energy firms that threaten their livelihoods. Moreover, the entire plan to devote 40 percent of spending to frontline communities would amount to means testing in practice. Who qualifies as \"frontline\"? Who speaks for particular communities? Biden's plan calls for a \"Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool to help identify these disadvantaged communities.\" I'm sure the communities deemed not \"disadvantaged\" enough by this tool will find it a fair process.\n\nThe most concerning part of the activist focus on \"frontline justice\" is that it reinforces the sense among most people that GND politics is not for them . Given that 57 percent of Americans believe climate change will not affect them personally, I doubt many consider themselves part of a \"frontline community.\" This kind of policy would potentially ignite the same kind of class resentment that is aimed toward targeted state benefits, while the majority are left to languish. We want the kind of political power to deliver climate action that addresses those most affected, but in order to win , we need a program that appeals to the broadest base possible. It seems GND activists should go back to the basics on the posters they brandished in Pelosi's office: \"Green Jobs for All.\"\n\nThe GND movement claims we are now entering the decade of the Green New Deal - but we have nowhere close to the power to do so. Could we? I close by enumerating three strategic avenues to building this kind of power. First, the Left has largely lost its bid for state power, but we cannot abandon the state. Now that the Democrats run both houses of Congress, the terrain will shift slightly in our favor. Many on the progressive left are laying out specific executive-level policies that a Biden administration can deliver. For example, New Consensus proposes that the Federal Reserve could inject liquidity into actual regional investment projects to solve the climate crisis. We should push this kind of agenda as far as we can. Moreover, socialists have had most success winning state and local office; how this cadre attempts to deliver a working-class agenda in the face of devastating budget austerity will likely be the decisive battle of the year ahead.\n\nWe need to be clear that the Left's failures in 2020 are mostly due to the fact that the vast majority of people still don't believe the politics we are selling. For good reason, most remain cynical about what to expect from the state. Winning power for the Left out of the wreckage of neoliberalism must start by recuperating the very idea of the public . For the climate movement, a litmus test for our campaigns must be: Does the policy decarbonize by delivering material gains in the name of public goods? Only by actually delivering results can we start to resurrect the kind of mass politics needed to transform society. While much of the climate policy community has become oddly obsessed with a wonky regulatory fix - something called a \"clean energy standard\" - these kinds of technical fixes will never generate the mass popular enthusiasm we need. In fact, the Right could easily paint this policy as a liberal scheme to raise electricity costs for everyday people.\n\nSecond, history shows that large-scale political transformations only happen through extra-parliamentary disruption. This was recently proven in 2018 during the West Virginia teachers' strike. Teachers could have attempted to pass their reforms by running progressive candidates and proposing legislation. Instead, they organized popular support, shut down schools, and won their demands in about two weeks. The radical climate movement - especially Sunrise - is still an almost entirely electoral movement. It marshaled tremendous volunteer capacity to get out the vote for Biden and other candidates, but what will happen to this energy when Biden and the Democrats predictably fall short?\n\nThe environmental movement must think harder about strategic disruption. As the case of West Virginia shows, if you don't have the public on your side, disruption is easily maligned. Environmental direct-action protests have long alienated workers and unions in the targeted industries. Extinction Rebellion famously shut down a working-class commuter train in London, facing public backlash and ridicule. The climate movement has continually engaged in polite, explicitly nondisruptive protests (e.g., the 2014 People's Climate March). It is encouraging to see the youth movement reclaim the language of the strike, but the 2019 Global Climate Strike was purely voluntary. The activist call for the strike openly admitted that it lacked any teeth: \"We are well aware that . . . this strike . . . won't change the course of events.\"\n\nSocialists know there is one form of disruption that has the strategic capacity to force elites to respond to radical demands: labor strikes. As Jane McAlevey argues , \"There's just no better way to create a crisis than a 100 percent withdrawal of labor.\" The Massachusetts Teachers Association called for a national teachers' strike for a Green New Deal in the summer of 2019. Calling for such a strike is very different than organizing one, but this is the kind of action we need to think about taking.\n\nThird, if the GND movement is going to move beyond its professional-class activist spaces, it will need to begin building organization and consciousness directly in working-class communities - starting in the trade union movement. It is quite disturbing to consider how many unions came out against the GND ; a platform based on economic justice and combating inequality. One basic problem is that the GND architects didn't consult with unions in the formation of the core ideas and policies. A union-based climate movement should recognize what the labor movement has always understood: certain sectors of the economy are strategic to organize in. Jane McAlevey recounts how the CIO focused on steel and coal in the 1930s, and today, she proposes health care, education, and logistics. For climate, it is clear that any rational pathway to 100 percent decarbonization goes through the electric utility sector. This \"electrify everything\" strategy means cleaning up electricity and electrifying residential heating, transportation, and industrial heat. Yet few GND activists have pointed out that the electric utility sector is already one of the most unionized in the entire economy - in fact, the electric power generation, transmission, and distribution sector has 26.3 percent union membership . These workers are represented by unions like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Utility Workers Union of America. The GND movement could try to win these unions to their side in order to transform the very sector at the core of the problem. One IBEW member has already proposed a rank-and-file strategy for a Green New Deal.\n\nOn the other hand, the renewable energy industry, specifically solar and wind, are notoriously nonunion - at 4 percent union density for solar photovoltaic technology and 6 percent for concentrated solar and wind - and almost entirely run for profit by private capital. The GND movement needs to engage with the electricity unions, arguing that unless a long-term strategy ensures the energy transition is controlled by project labor agreements and union labor, it will be destroyed by a form of \"green capitalism.\"\n\nThe tenor of the moment is to say \"we've only got five or ten years left\" because of the depth of the climate emergency. That kind of slogan was designed to get people to see how serious things are. But as a political strategy it is a dead end. We can't think in those terms, no matter how desperate the climate situation. We have to be able to think in terms of ten, fifteen or twenty years. There is fundamental class and organisational rebuilding to be done. It takes time.\n\n- Leo Panitch, March 2020\n\nLeo Panitch tragically passed away while I was writing this article. The above statement is, characteristic of his work, as incisive as it is sobering. As much as we need a shortcut in the face of the climate crisis, this is not how class struggle works. Much of the energy around the Green New Deal was based on a kind of magical thinking: by insisting on the scientific urgency, large-scale social transformation could come before working-class organization. One would only need to look at the original New Deal to see the falsity of such a hope. In 1933, FDR came to office as a stalwart ally of the capitalist class. By 1936, after socialist organizers and militant union activists in the CIO \"created a crisis\" through a nationwide strike wave, FDR was welcoming the hatred of capital and passing the most transformative working-class agenda in US history. In 2021, the real danger is moving backward rather than forward by assuming that Joe Biden can be effectively pushed left through closed-door corporatist bargaining sessions. The only thing that can and will push Biden, and the state in general, is working-class organization and disruption. We are out of shortcuts to do this hard work.\n\nThis article is reprinted from Catalyst: A Journal of Theory and Strategy , a publication from the Jacobin Foundation.

Will it take a deeper political form?\n\nA march against the gasolinazo in México City, México on January 9, 2017. ProtoplasmaKid / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, an outpouring of protests, marches, and blockades have shaken the streets of Mexico in response to a 20 percent increase in the price of fuel, popularly known as \" el Gasolinazo .\"\n\nThis new wave of struggle, however, doesn't come as a surprise: it comes after years of accumulated anger against the Mexican state. In this interview, Venezuelan-born socialist Eva María talks to Mexican revolutionary Luis Rangel about the immediate situation that has brought about this last spark of struggle, as well as the challenges and possible prospects facing socialists and the Left in Mexico today.\n\nLast week, Mexico saw a new wave of protests known as \" el Gasolinazo .\" What is the social character of these protests? What sectors are involved? Are they different from other recent movements such as the demand to bring back alive the forty-three disappeared students from Ayotzinapa and the movement in defense of public education?\n\nThe social character of these protests is very wide. We have working at the same time a wide range of social sectors, from farmers who will see a reduction of their earnings due to the increased cost of transportation for their products, as well as middle-class people in the cities who can't fill up their cars with gas.\n\nThe most astonishing aspect of these mobilizations, however, is the fact that places in the North such as Tijuana, Monterrey, and Ciudad Juárez, and in places in the west of the country such as Colima or Guadalajara, we're seeing people going out in mass numbers. Mobilizations of this sort are very atypical in these regions.\n\nThe mobilizations have taken different forms, the most common being mass marches and road blockages. Additionally, there have been reports of lootings in malls. This is important since it's been proven that these actions in some places were organized by groups related to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, the party currently in government and the oldest political party since the Mexican Revolution).\n\nBut it is wrong to assume that all the people involved in the lootings are provocateurs. We should see these kind of actions critically, beyond maneuvers from the government to confuse, infuse fear, and justify repression. These events also show that there is a profound social discontent, sometimes due to the fact that the revolutionary left is very small.\n\nWhat's happening right now in Mexico is a result of an accumulation of offenses by the regime led by Peña Nieto. For one, Ayotzinapa (one of the thousands of cases of disappeared people, as is the case of Raquel Gutiérrez, the disappeared daughter of our comrade Guillermo Gutiérrez), as well as massacres such as that of Tlatlaya or Nochixtlán, and the seven femicides per day reported in our country that, for the most part, go with impunity.\n\nPolitically, Peña Nieto's government has killed the constitution of 1917 (which came out of the revolution) and the Mexican state's \"social pact\" that was created in the twentieth century.\n\nAdditionally, with the new energy reform , oil, until now under state control, has been newly sold to the transnational companies expropriated under Cárdenas. If we add to this the surreal cases of corruption, the mining concessions (at least 20 percent of the national territory), the invitation to Trump to come to Mexico when he was just a presidential candidate (!), among other things, what we are seeing is not only the little credibility this government has, but also the deep crisis that the regime is facing as an \"oligarchic-neoliberal\" state which substituted the \"Bonapartist sui generis\" of the twentieth century.\n\nThus, \" el Gasolinazo \" isn't a last drop in the bucket, but part of a climate of constant crisis and mass uprisings in Mexico.\n\nWhy is there this absolute lack of confidence in the governing party? Is the PRI any different from the other two traditional political parties?\n\nThe crisis of the regime has, among its main causes, the lack of legitimacy of practically all the traditional political parties. The PRI is, before anything else, a clientelist machine that buys and coerces votes. Therefore, their candidates are all chosen by their leaders.\n\nThe crisis of legitimacy is expressed every time there is allusion to the \"political caste.\" There are clear reasons for this. When, for example, last year in Veracruz the Party of National Action (PAN) finally won a state election, it did so by running Miguel Ángel Yunes as their candidate, an old leader of the PRI who switched parties only when he failed at his attempt of becoming the party's presidential candidate. When he joined PAN, he ran as a candidate for \"change,\" and won. Cases like these help make people think that the differences between PRI, PAN, and the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) very unclear.\n\nHowever, there are a few differences between these formations. PAN is a party of the traditional right wing, linked to the clergy and openly opposed to abortion rights and LGBT rights. PRD, on the other hand, originates from currents of nationalism within the Left in the twentieth century. They present themselves as the party of the \"responsible left,\" but really they are a caricature of the Left. José Luis Abarca, for example, a PRD politician, was the mayor responsible for the disappearance of Ayotzinapa's forty-three.\n\nHave new political organizations of importance emerged as a result of these struggles?\n\nUnfortunately, no. In my opinion, what has been developing since 2012 until now are lots of small collectives of people who meet in the mass movements and, when the momentum slows down, they look for different ways of continuing their involvement. These activists are of different tendencies, training, and interests. However, in part because of the overall rejection of the \"political caste\" and the traditional parties, in part because of the indirect influence of autonomism which rejects the building of wide and permanent structures, there is very little dialogue between these new groupings.\n\nOn the other hand, there are the democratic unions and the popular and farmers' organizations which do group thousands of people on a permanent basis. But these existed before these new cycles. Unfortunately, sometimes there is very little dialogue between these established organizations and the new ones as well.\n\nWho are Morena and what is their ideology as a party? What is the political program of Andrés Manuel López Obrador? What should be the attitude toward Morena from the socialist left?\n\nMorena emerged as a political party in 2013 after the electoral process of 2012, when Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) \"won\" (through fraudulent means) the election, and Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) took second place in the race. To be brief, Morena broke off from the PRD when the latter finally stopped being a party of the opposition to PRI.\n\nIn reality, however, Morena's political program is not anything but a cheap update of the revolutionary nationalist program: they propose the old idea that there needs to be an alliance between the non-existent national bourgeoisie and the Mexican people to implement protectionist policies and local investment to promote the country's development. But just like Guillermo Almeyra says, the big issue with Morena and AMLO is that they sell the Bonapartist past of Mexico as the future alternative to neoliberalism.\n\nAs to what the socialist left should do with this party, it is an unresolved debate. In addition to the limitations of their political program, Morena is also a profoundly undemocratic party. Its only end goal is to get AMLO elected in 2018 because this is the main way in which they believe we can transform Mexico.\n\nAnd even with all these problems, we need to understand that Morena is the only political group in the opposition that is legally able to participate in elections. Every other party is already inside the \"political caste.\" Morena is on its way to the same end, but today it is still a party of the opposition. Plus, there's the fact that AMLO is a charismatic person.\n\nMillions of people, seeing no other options, are going to place their hopes of change in the hypothetical triumph of Morena. This is the reason why we still need to somehow relate to Morena as the socialist left. Some socialist groups are active in the party thinking that they might be able to create a revolutionary current within it. This is not the case of our party (the Revolutionary Workers Party [PRT]).\n\nIn our view, past experiences such as what the PRD went through in 1988 show how devastating it can be for socialist organizations to sacrifice their political independence to the impulse of trying to escape marginality and advance within wider formations. At that time, the immense majority of socialist parties, with the sole exception of the PRT, dissolved themselves inside the PRD. Nothing is left today of these socialist formations.\n\nWhen the moment came that the PRD finally became a party of the regime, it wasn't socialists, but revolutionary nationalism again which broke with the party from the left. Morena is heading in the same direction at an even quicker pace. This is why we fully believe that it is essential to maintain independence as revolutionary socialists, even when needing to relate to broader formations.\n\nOf course, this is without fooling with sectarianism or thinking that every member of Morena is an opportunist. Instead, we have to relate to them by debating out our differences and, most importantly, trying to build together in the areas where we can, and walk separately when this is the better choice.\n\nOne of the main obstacles we have in the United States is not the lack of protesting, but the organizational void we see on the Left. What is the state of the Left organizationally in Mexico?\n\nOther than Morena as a legal party of the opposition, there is a large pole of organizations to the left, all from student groups, farmers' collectives, and some independent unions, to popular organizations in some neighborhoods. Another social element of relevance is the dozens of eco-social movements fighting against the \"megaprojects.\" Many of these are grouped within the National Indigenous Congress (CNI) together with the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN).\n\nAs for the socialist left, there are some organizations with a wide range of tendencies. But in reality, if we were to add up all of our forces, the organized left is still very small for how big and culturally diverse this country is. This is, just like you're saying, also one of the biggest obstacles we face in Mexico today, the million-dollar question.\n\nIn the last decade, some countries in Latin America have experienced a progressive cycle of left-leaning governments, the \"pink tide.\" How did the different sectors of the Mexican left live this phenomenon?\n\nIn some sectors this phenomenon was characterized with dangerous generalizations like saying that Lula or Kirchner were the same as Hugo Chávez , for example. On the other hand, there is also a relative distance to these processes because Mexico is not a member of some of the most important regional developments like Mercosur or the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA).\n\nTo give you a sense, at the time in which other countries had the biggest impact with their \"progressive governments,\" Mexico acted more like Colombia or Peru: as the main allies of the United States. Against Mercosur, we went into the \"Pacific Alliance.\" (And this is not to mention the North American Free Trade Agreement).\n\nWith all the issues that the pink tide governments are facing , the possibility of having a Mexican version of this process (such as a hypothetical government of AMLO, for example) becomes more and more difficult.\n\nThe PRT just celebrated its forty-year anniversary on December 2016. What are the main political tasks for the party in the year ahead?\n\nI would say there are two: On the one hand, getting involved with our modest forces as much as possible in the struggles against the gasolinazo and Peña Nieto's rule. We predicted a few months ago that the contradictions with his government would only increase, and that this would create the conditions for a new wave of mass protests. The beginning of 2017 confirmed this for us. The level of the crisis in this country supposes a big challenge for all of us struggling, and it therefore makes it necessary to take big chances politically beyond the main goal of building our own organizations.\n\nThis is why, on the other hand, we have to wrap our heads around how to best contribute to help channel all of this social unrest and struggle of the past few years into political organizations that are stronger and longer-lasting. It is with this in mind that we, after the fight of the Electrical Workers Union of Mexico (SME), have launched the Political Organization of the People and Workers (OPT) as the seed of a political party for the workers.\n\nAlso recently, we see the possibility that the Indigenous National Congress (CNI) will call for an Indigenous Government Council that will then propose an indigenous woman for president in 2018. We believe that this could bring a social layer to the left of Morena that might want to organize.\n\nHow does the PRT see the victory of Donald Trump? Among his many threats, Trump has announced that he wants to kick out three million immigrants immediately. Under the Obama administration, over two million immigrants were already kicked out. How do you see the immediate effects of this threat for Mexico?\n\nIt is a very dangerous threat with uncertain consequences. If this threat of mass deportations does occur in a short amount of time, or if he taxes immigrants' remittances, or if he goes ahead with an even worse renegotiation of NAFTA, the social crisis in Mexico would deepen dramatically.\n\nFor his part, Peña Nieto is already playing along. He recently named Luis Videgaray secretary of foreign relations. Before that Videgaray was the secretary of the treasury, who had to quit his post after he got heavily criticized for inviting Trump to Mexico when he was only a candidate. This proves that we can't expect any sort of resistance to Trump's threats from the Mexican state. It will have to come from below through the building of international solidarity networks between the United States and Mexico.\n\nFinally, it's important to add that Trump's positions are actually proving very challenging for the Mexican left when seen beyond an obvious rejection of his xenophobia. The Mexican left has been denouncing NAFTA for decades, and now that Trump is proposing to cancel it or renegotiate it from a right-wing perspective, the situation has become more complicated. The PRD has already made a caricature of themselves by saying that, in order to oppose Trump, they should reconsider their position on this treaty. This is a terrible contradiction.\n\nAs for the Left in the United States, people shouldn't forget that if companies come to Mexico or China, this is not because of a supposed anti-patriotic sentiment, but because the working conditions are notably worse here than they are in the United States. If Trump did convince these companies to not move to any of these countries, this would only mean a dramatic lowering of working conditions in the United States.\n\nIt's very important that the Mexican and the US left talk a lot more so that we can start building more bridges and organizing together. In Mexico, for obvious reasons, we tend to see the United States only as an imperialist monster without stopping to think that there are also struggles and resistance going on, just like we saw recently with Standing Rock .\n\nFor the Left in both sides of the Río Bravo, it's strategic to link our struggles much more organically, not just with the connections that already exist, but with a much wider layer of society. We need to share debates and experiences, as well as think of our struggles as interconnected.\n\nLuis Rangel is an active member of the Revolutionary Workers' Party (PRT) in México City.\n\nEva María is a Venezuelan-born member of the International Socialist Organization.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

This has particularly been the case after a University of Ottawa professor was disciplined for using it in class , which prompted a broad consortium of academics, politicians, and pundits to decry the creeping phenomenon of le wokisme . In Quebec, le wokisme is increasingly vilified as censoring free speech, academic liberty, and - worst of all - Quebec culture, already allegedly imperiled by the steamroller of Anglo-American cultural hegemony.\n\nThat Vallières's book is at the center of this incident is more than simply fitting; it's a window into a rather unique Canadian sociopolitical paradox.\n\nVallières was a journalist who witnessed the profound transformation of Quebec society that took place in the middle decades of the twentieth century. The election of a new Liberal Party government in 1960 ended decades of de facto single-party rule. It also ushered in a new era of modernization, including the development of a low-cost public college and university network, universal health care, and a generous social safety net. This had the effect of permanently ending the Catholic Church's grip on power in the province, transforming Quebec practically overnight from one of the world's most religious societies into one of its most secular.\n\nAll of this occurred within the broader context of national liberation struggles and the Civil Rights Movement, leading some Quebecers to see their own plight in similar terms. Vallières became the intellectual leader of the Quebec Liberation Front (FLQ), which advocated for a proletarian revolution to free Quebec from the colonial oppression of Canada. The FLQ conducted a nearly decade-long bombing and bank heist campaign before kidnapping a British trade commissioner, and later the deputy premier of Quebec (who was ultimately murdered by his captors), during the October Crisis of 1970.\n\nVallières wrote his book in New York City's infamous Manhattan House of Detention while awaiting deportation back to Canada to face a variety of terrorism-related charges in 1967. The book is considered an important contribution to the intellectual justification of Quebec's independence struggle, even if most of its latter-day defenders aren't advocating for the armed proletarian liberation struggle of Quebec's 1960s revolutionaries.\n\nThe FLQ fell apart after the October Crisis, with more mainstream political leaders taking up the reins of the independence struggle, giving birth to the Parti Québécois (PQ) in the process, and leading that party to a triumphant victory in the 1976 Quebec provincial election. Four years later, they would make their first attempt at securing Quebec sovereignty through a province-wide referendum, something they'd attempt again in 1995.\n\nThe PQ has formed several governments in the province, most recently from 2012 to 2014, but interest in Quebec's independence effort has waned considerably in recent decades. The PQ has only been in power for three of the last twenty years and, of the five major parties contesting this year's election, three are at least nominally federalist in inclination.\n\nIn Quebec, it is almost always a crowd-pleaser to advocate for greater provincial autonomy, speak reverently about the separatist leaders of decades past, or evoke their memory when cautioning against \"creeping anglicization.\" However, when it comes to the question of holding a third sovereignty referendum, \"now isn't the right time\" tends to be the common refrain. Indeed, Plamondon recently admitted that he hasn't prepared a hypothetical \"year one\" budget for an independent Quebec. He also hasn't come to any decision about whether a sovereign Quebec would maintain open borders or share defense responsibilities and a common currency with Canada.\n\nAs Quebec society turns more toward federalism, it abandons the revolutionary spirit of the separatist era. However, it does not do so by embracing the multiculturalism that tends to be valued by mainstream Canadian society but rather by turning toward isolation and retrograde traditionalism. It's a bizarre catch-22, where Quebec has become less of a threat to national unity but increasingly at odds with what moderately left-of-center - let alone progressive - Canadians aspire to.\n\nDespite regular demonstrations to the contrary - including the live-streamed racist abuse endured by an indigenous woman, Joyce Echaquan, at the hands of health care workers mere hours before her death - incumbent premier François Legault insists there is no systemic racism in Quebec. There is a pervasive belief that since Quebecers experienced racism, they themselves cannot be racist. Instances where the province's deeply rooted racism are exposed are dismissed either as isolated incidents or instances of \"Quebec-bashing.\"\n\nSovereigntist politicians once made an effort to appeal to the province's minority groups in a hope to demonstrate the forward-thinking and cosmopolitan society they hoped to build as an independent country. But Quebec's recent political leadership seems to have doubled down on latent xenophobia.\n\nIn many ways, this phenomenon is not peculiar to Quebec. It is simply the choke hold that societies atomized by the mercenary diktat of marketized social relations experience - aspirations for the future are slowly suffocated while the foundations of society are ripped out. The aftermath of this process is an increasingly dispossessed and disenfranchised society left with few options but to embrace its darker urges.\n\nFor a province that could once legitimately claim to be Canada's social democratic leader, this year's election makes it appear to be Canada's most backward. At least one party leader has openly considered building a wall on the province's southern border (meaning upstate New York and Vermont). One party is running an ad showing the English language spreading like a virus - an oblique and disparaging comment about the province's immigrant and visible-minority populations, not it's English-speaking communities, which are actually legally required to send their children to French schools and pass French proficiency exams. And the premier has warned that immigrants bring violence and extremism to the province (he subsequently apologized and said his desire is to unite the province). Quebec's current immigration minister then derided immigrants as lazy and unwilling to integrate.\n\nThat this can happen at all is a demonstration of just how politically insignificant Quebec's cultural minorities really are. Also, it further proves that the apparent threat posed by minorities to Quebec society is completely bogus.\n\nThis election has been rife with virulently anti-immigrant rhetoric - including the incumbent premier expressing his belief that the province should invest in robots rather than increase the immigration quota. The anxieties are worth considering in view of the fact that Quebec is about 87 percent white and 86 percent of the population speaks French at home on a regular basis (and 95 percent of the population is able to hold a conversation in French).\n\nQuebec's percentage of the Canadian population has been gently falling in recent years - chiefly because of fairly constant out-migration to other provinces, a low birth rate, and a less than enthusiastic approach to immigration. But the province's population nonetheless continues to grow steadily.\n\nImmigrants are required to learn the French language by attending French schools. But even though there's no evidence suggesting they're refusing to learn French or integrate into Quebec culture, the Legault administration - under cover of language politics - has introduced legislation that undermines Canadian citizens' constitutionally protected charter rights.\n\nBill 21 , ostensibly intended to maintain the secularism of the state, effectively discriminates against religious minorities working in the public service. It forces them to choose between wearing \"ostentatious displays\" of their faith and keeping their jobs (nurses, doctors, police officers, social workers, and teachers are barred from wearing hijabs, turbans, yarmulkes).\n\nThe law almost exclusively affects the province's cultural minorities. Bill 96 , created out of a long-standing though statistically inaccurate belief that the French language is losing ground to English in Quebec, establishes strict quotas on access to the province's English-language junior colleges. In effect, the bill prevents most cultural minorities from freely choosing what language they use in postsecondary education institutions.\n\nThese laws have barely registered any complaint from the leaders of Canada's federal political parties, including from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Quebec riding is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse places in all of Canada. This is because Quebec's retreat into retrograde traditionalism - and overt xenophobia - has turned the province into a four-way electoral battleground.\n\nIt is almost a certain bet that when Quebecers head to the polls tomorrow, they will vote to return Premier Legault to power with a majority government, essentially guaranteeing him another four years in office. This will satisfy a vast swathe of the province's population, and likely convince more of the province's ethnic, linguistic, racial, and cultural minorities to seek better lives elsewhere in Canada. This will, in turn, satisfy Quebecers' evident desire for a more culturally homogenous society.\n\nSuch is the Faustian bargain of modern Canadian federalism.\n\nTaylor C.

Annelize Tozetto / Revista Vírus\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n518 years ago, the territory now known as Brazil was invaded by a Portuguese fleet and colonized. Many of the indigenous peoples who inhabited the land died from diseases, were killed, or enslaved. The indigenous population was reduced to less than a million, and their land was taken away and exploited. These land seizures didn't just effect insurmountable damage to the native ecosystem; they also, by concentrating property in the hands of a very few, wrote inequality into the foundations of modern Brazil.\n\nThis is why, more than five centuries later, Sônia Guajajara, a Guajajara indigenous woman from northeast Brazil's Arariboia region, says her pre-candidacy for the presidency in this year's elections represents a paradigm shift. Brazil's indigenous population may number less than a million in a population of over two hundred million, but their political struggle has reached a strength and visibility in recent years that makes it hard to deny their importance in struggles over class, imperialism, and financial capital. Their struggle is an urgent one; in 2016 alone, 118 indigenous people were murdered. These assassinations tend to be connected to the continued attempts by agribusiness to push onto indigenous land, though they are also rooted in racism.\n\nGuajajara, who has been a member of the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) since 2011, will formally run as PSOL's vice-presidential candidate alongside Guilherme Boulos of the Homeless Workers' Movement (MTST). However, the party and the campaign have pushed for a \"co-candidacy\" arrangement in place of the traditional presidential/vice-presidential ticket. In this way, they're hoping to dispute the hierarchy of the traditional ticket and promote an equal, three-way alliance between the PSOL, indigenous peoples, and the MTST. A specialist in linguistics, a mother of three, and the best-known indigenous leader at home and abroad, she forms part of the coordination of Brazil's most notable indigenous organization, the National Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB).\n\nBoth Guajajara and Boulos present a leftist political project that is distinct from the one carried out by Workers' Party (PT) presidents Lula and Dilma Rousseff; in fact, they formed the leftist opposition during the PT governments. Nevertheless, in today's climate, they have stood in solidarity against the political-judicial persecution of Lula and the increasingly violent expressions of \" anti-petismo \" (anti-PT sentiment) in Brazil.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with Jacobin , Guajajara speaks about the current state of indigenous struggles in Brazil, the state of environmental politics, the relationship between indigenous organizing and the Left, and the meaning of her presidential candidacy with PSOL.\n\nToday, a central part of the indigenous struggle in Brazil is about land rights. But you often place this struggle in the context of the fight against racism, and as part of a centuries-old struggle for indigenous people's right to exist. Can you speak more about that?\n\nYes, we're also fighting racism, especially institutional racism. In recent years, it's proliferated, and become more visible. For us, if we overcome these [barriers] we can finally enter other spaces too. If we have our lands, we'll have a fulfilled life, because it's through the land that you can exercise your citizenship as an indigenous people. To be able to live together with our people and with nature itself guarantees our culture, our traditions, our rituals.\n\n[Today's] violence has arisen from the conflicts over land. The agribusiness sectors, animal farming, land and housing speculation; they want to access indigenous territories, leading to a lot of conflict and murders. And there's the racism, which is connected to the speeches made by public personalities, by conservative congressmen, by fascists. They've been saying [racist] things a lot, helping society feel backed up to be publicly aggressive towards others. This has intensified.\n\nSo you'd say that the racist discourse employed by public personalities and congressmen has worsened in the recent period?\n\nIt has worsened a lot. We've always felt a certain degree of indifference among Brazilians towards indigenous people. But it was a matter of ignoring us. It's a minority of society that knows about the existence of indigenous people in our country. They know that originally [during colonization] there were indigenous people in Brazil, but they don't know about our contemporary existence.\n\nIn the last few years, indifference and ignorance has decreased. But they also began to attack us. Today there are attacks through social media, but also violent attacks leading to deaths. Last year there were a lot of deaths. In the south, Victor Kaingang was decapitated in his mother's arms. This year there was a Xocleng teacher in Santa Catarina. There was a Guarani in Rio de Janeiro, a Tapirapé in Mato Grosso, and a Tremembé in Fortaleza. These four murders happened all in the first month of the year. This racism has become very evident, in a very brutal way. It's not just talk anymore, they're killing us.\n\nWould you say that these racist agitators are confronted more often by indigenous communities now? Are indigenous communities more organized now, more capable of voicing themselves against the structure of white supremacy in Brazil?\n\nWe've always been around and doing our struggle, resisting to protect our territories. Our struggle against mega-projects and the current economic development model. For 518 years we've gone about our struggle to survive. The struggle to exist is something we have to undertake every day, day by day. But now we are mobilizing in a more systematic way. We've increased our mobilizations in Brasília and connected them to other regional struggles. If we go and have a big mobilization in Brasília, we'll do it at the same time in other states. If we call people to stop some anti-indigenous measure at the capital, we call and people come. APIB today has a good level of visibility, and it's very broad, beyond the national level.\n\nWe've managed to cross borders, denounce what's going on internationally too. We've been denouncing products produced in unsettled indigenous territories and conflict areas, and called for the international boycott of these products. We've been denouncing ecocide, like what happened at Rio Doce and is now happening at Bacarena, Belo Monte.\n\nWe continue to reference Belo Monte as an attack against ndigenous peoples, because today we're already suffering its consequences. The consequences are real and we show them as negative examples of hydrodams. I think that this has impacted the legal structures and the agribusiness sectors that we're confronting.\n\nEven if the public sees us as \"just\" the indigenous peoples, our struggle isn't small. We're really confronting the Brazilian state, its negligence, its denial of rights. T o do this we have to confront the agribusiness owners, the business elite, the media itself, the traditional press. Social media has really helped us with this. Today we don't need traditional media as much to have the reach we do. All of this is going to reach the ears of the people. This growing visibility is definitely bothering those in power a bit more.\n\nIs there a difference between when indigenous issues were translated through a white lens, as with the traditional media, and now, when it can be your voice directly?\n\nIt makes a difference. In the traditional press we say things, and they cut and edit to take away what's not in their interest or what could hurt their allies. Sometimes what we say gets taken out of context and obtains a different meaning. Sometimes what we say in the traditional media ends up interpreted against ourselves. It's very dangerous depending on who interviews you.\n\nHow have you and APIB been received internationally? How do they react to the stories you tell? Are the reactions different from the ones you get when trying to be heard in Brazil?\n\nHere our ability to denounce things and to speak out is still very restricted. But today we're getting more visibility. Some of it is negative visibility, related to discrimination and hatred. But among social movements, the understanding of the importance of indigenous struggles - how they impact us, the environment, and life in general - is growing.\n\nBut it's still difficult to get people to understand the meaning of being indigenous. Most people can't translate it, they look at us as the \"other.\" People make some room for the \"Indian\" to speak, but most of the time we're just invited to sing and dance; as exotic beings to embellish the place. So we feel that even as social movements try to include us, they still end up expressing a certain kind of prejudice.\n\nDid the Left forget about the indigenous people for some time?\n\nIt did, it totally did. It isolated us. They'd call us to go to certain places, it looked good, we took pictures, they could say they were supporting us. But it was very isolated in general. I think that one way we found to break through this was to get closer, as APIB, to artists and celebrities. They have a different audience, sometimes shared with our own, but it's way broader. The singers, actresses, they'd come closer and understand our cause; the importance of the territories, of the forest, ecosystems like the Cerrado. How protecting these territories would also protect the water. The discussion worldwide about climate change is also important because it relates to things that us as indigenous peoples have been saying all along.\n\nSo people who wouldn't usually listen to indigenous peoples suddenly become interested when it's coming from a celebrity's mouth?\n\nPeople don't want to listen to us. They don't want to understand. When we get an artist to say it, then they go \"Wow, that guy said this. He supported it!\" It's almost as if we get credibility through it.\n\nThis reminds me of the response to the mobilizations against the Belo Monte dam. That dam was a longtime project that went through different phases and under different names, depending on the government behind it. And through all those phases, the indigenous resistance was always there. But the visibility of the resistance depended on others embracing it, no?\n\nYes, [the Belo Monte project] used to be called Kararaô. And it's curious that people only remember the Belo Monte struggle, because there were many other struggles, that were just as important, that didn't reach the same level of visibility. The biggest struggles - those that reached a high level of visibility and achieved international support - were Belo Monte and Raposa Serra do Sol [an indigenous reservation that landowners tried to reclaim]. Raposa Serra do Sol we won; we got our land settlement. Belo Monte we lost, and now we have Belo Monte stuck in our throats.\n\nIn 1989, under a right-wing - I'd say far-right - government, we stopped the Belo Monte dam project. This time was under a leftist government [that of the Workers' Party (PT)] but we couldn't stop the project. It went through anyway and we had to swallow it. It's really complicated when you see so many political contradictions. [With these contradictions] we can't really tell which noise we have to make to be effective.\n\nWhat was the logic behind the PT pushing through with a project like this?\n\nIn the beginning we had a guarantee by the government that they wouldn't just go ahead with Belo Monte. They were going to consult us. But later [the attitude was] it happens, or it happens. There wasn't another option. It was a project seen as very important for the country, for the nation, and they couldn't go back on it. It was, in a way, \"Well, you don't matter. Whatever the consequences, we'll go through with it.\" It was very, very bad what happened in the end with the construction of the Belo Monte dam.\n\nOn the one hand, there's the developmentalist view that pushes projects like the Belo Monte dam and views indigenous people as standing in the way of progress. On the other, there are environmentalists that value indigenous people for  your role in conservation - but their support stops there. How do you relate to these environmentalist groups?\n\nThere are a lot of environmental institutes that say they support us, that they're with us, but they only really care about preserving a piece of forest so it remains intact. They stand up for the environment but sometimes don't care about who's in there; the people, their social rights. It's like only the environmental agenda matters.\n\nIn recent years this has improved, and they're finally understanding that to move forward with the environmental struggle, you can't be disconnected from the indigenous struggle. You have to fight for indigenous rights, and if you fight for indigenous rights, one of the results, because of our way of life, will be environmental preservation.\n\n[The improved relationship with environmental groups] has given us a jump in visibility. So much that last year, through APIB, I was at Rock in Rio to send a message to the whole world about the rights violations in the Amazon. I also denounced the alliance between economic power and political power in Brazil, and called for land settlements.\n\nThis also means that in the capital, the annoyance with us has grown. The landowning representatives in Congress, the agribusiness, they're more worried. They realized that we gained some strength due to this web of support with the environmentalists and the artists. So they began to attack us more and incite more violence against us.\n\nGiven this, is the Left itself becoming more aware? Is it waking up to the indigenous demands? Because on the other side, we can see that the Right is also trying to get some indigenous peoples on their side.\n\nRight-wing politicians pretend they're good guys, they get close, and they co-opt leadership by promising that they'll solve some of our crucial problems. They try to buy [indigenous] leadership out with small things or even by outright fooling them. Then they go and publicize that they have indigenous support for their own agenda. This is bad because it misleads the public about the positions defended by the indigenous peoples. The indigenous movement is invested in preventing this kind of co-optation, but we can't fix it everywhere because everyone is in need right now. We need social policies and support, so people are ready to believe the politicians that offer them that.\n\nOn the other hand, the Left is now realizing it needs to value us more. We have a new way of participating in the political parties now, that goes beyond us just being members.\n\nIs the Left finally seeing you as not just indigenous leadership but as political leadership in general?\n\nYes. It's important for us to be there not just for the photo ops; but also to overcome our underrepresentation in political and institutional spaces. It's a beginning. We're trying to put forward more indigenous candidates and get the parties to support them. It's complicated because the parties have difficulty with welcoming new leadership -whether they're indigenous or not.But it's harder when they're indigenous. There's an opening now, though.\n\nYou're currently a pre-candidate for the presidency Brazil through PSOL, together with Guilherme Boulos in a co-candidacy arrangement. Does this signal a realization within PSOL that to go forward with the anticapitalist struggle, you have to bring in different types of knowledge from different social movements?\n\nYes, and the recent discussion around global warming has favored this exchange. The whole world is seeking solutions, and in this context, there's no way of denying indigenous peoples. If you compare our way of life to any other, ours is the way that preserves the most, that takes care of nature the most. It's the way that avoids emissions. So there's no way you can ignore ancient knowledge and the traditional, indigenous way of living.\n\nThis helped to push people, and the party itself, to understand that as indigenous people we're not just fighting for ourselves, but can contribute a lot. The Paris Accord helped to promote [this idea], that we need to value scientific knowledge but also include traditional knowledges by first nations and indigenous peoples. Still, we have to fight to define how this recognition should happen in practice. We don't want that acknowledgement to mean commodification of the places we live in and defend.\n\nOne of the themes of your campaign is \"Brazil, 518 years later,\" referencing the start of colonization and the long history of indigenous struggle. Is this a way of reclaiming history from a dominant narrative?\n\nIn Brazil, they've erased this genocide from the country's history. They talk about the \"discovery\" of Brazil by [Portuguese explorer] Pedro Álvares Cabral and then skip to us fighting for our land settlements today. The five hundred years in between is absolutely annulled. The history books still treat us like the ancient indigenous peoples that Cabral encountered, who were exotic and walked around naked and wore feathers everywhere. They don't really talk about the struggles and the resistance.\n\nAnd then people, based on this, turn to us and ask \"Are you a real Indian?\" - I hear that every day. What do you mean by real? I'm real, I'm here. But people express ignorance about what it is to be indigenous. They think that if you're in the city, you speak Portuguese, and you use [modern products], then all of sudden you can't be indigenous anymore. Either you're stuck in the forest, never leaving, or you're not an Indian anymore.\n\nThe rest of our history - the killing, the genocide, the sexual violence against indigenous women - people just don't think about it. Sometimes you even hear people say proudly that they descend from indigenous peoples because their grandmother was \"captured with a lasso.\" They don't connect this with the violence their grandmother and their great-grandmother suffered. And it's the same thing for black people in Brazil. That's why one of our goals is to fight for visibility, so that they know what really happened and that our existence today is the result of a lot of resistance. So to say \"518 years later\" is powerful because it carries a lot of history, a history that isn't really told.\n\nDo you think being a pre-candidate to the presidency of Brazil, as an indigenous leader, will make people take notice of how your politics is important for changing society?\n\nI think so. Even those who didn't recognize us before have to really see us now. They have to understand that we're fighting for the highest institutional position of power. This is big. We're there not just to represent the indigenous and environmental struggles, but also the reconstruction of society that the world needs.\n\nSônia Guajajara is a leader of the Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), and pre-candidate for the vice presidency of Brazil with the Party for Socialism and Freedom (PSOL).\n\nSabrina Fernandes is a Brazilian eco-socialist organizer and communicator with a sociology PhD from Carleton University, Canada.

      "text": "Here's How Deb Haaland Wants to Address the Crisis of Violence Against Indigenous Women\n\nUnited States Representative Deb Haaland looks on during a Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing on her nomination to be Interior Secretary. February 23, 2021. Graeme Jennings/CNP/ZUMA\n\nLess than a month into her term leading the Department of Interior, Deb Haaland , the first Native American Cabinet secretary, announced a new effort to address an issue that has some personal resonance: the lengthy roster of unsolved cases involving missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nMurder is the sixth leading cause of death for Alaska Native and American Indian women under the age of 45.  For AI/AN women younger than 19 years old, murder climbs to the fourth leading cause of death. But it's not just murder; the rate of violent crime perpetrated against Native women is alarmingly high, and flaws in the criminal justice system have meant little is done to solve the cases or hold perpetrators accountable.\n\n\"Violence against Indigenous peoples is a crisis that has been underfunded for decades,\" Haaland said in April, when she introduced a new Missing and Murdered Unit (MMU) to prioritize these cases within the Department of the Interior. \"Far too often, murders and missing persons cases in Indian country go unsolved and unaddressed, leaving families and communities devastated.\"\n\nThe longstanding violence has been largely invisible to people outside Native communities, and progress to address this issue, much less inform agencies and the public of its seriousness, has been slow. Even under the best of circumstances, the criminal justice system often fails to protect women generally, but when it comes to crimes against Native women, the effort is even further behind.\n\nOne key issue has been the morass of complicated jurisdictional concerns that has meant many instances of MMIW aren't investigated, tracked, or prosecuted. As we reported in 2018:\n\nUnder federal law , tribes only have sole jurisdiction in crimes in which both perpetrator and victim are Native American, and even then, the most serious crimes-including many domestic violence offenses-are automatically sent to the federal government, regardless of who is involved. The policy has long created something of a legal quagmire on tribal lands, giving them a reputation as a safe haven for many criminals. Complicating matters is that historically, the federal government has declined to prosecute many tribal cases-a problem that still continues today.\n\nThe result is that in many cases, there has been no justice for most Indigenous survivors, families and communities with missing or murdered loved ones. In the last few decades, legislation has begun cleaving a path toward protecting Indigenous women from rampant violence. In 2005, a \"Safety for Indian Women\" provision was added to the Violence Against Women Act , and the Tribal Law and Order Act in 2010 increased the punitive authority of tribal governments in criminal cases.\n\nStill, those efforts left many problems unresolved. Right now, the efforts to address MMIW centers on establishing basic protocols-like mandating that the cases are reported and sharing information between law enforcement agencies-that will impel law enforcement to engage in a baseline level of functioning when such a case arises.\n\nSavanna's Act, for instance, that was passed in 2020 , requires the Department of Justice to \"review, revise, and develop law enforcement and justice protocols\" to address missing or murdered Native Americans. The law includes a requirement for the DOJ to \"provide training to law enforcement agencies on how to record tribal enrollment for victims in federal databases,\" a necessary requirement because for decades law enforcement agencies consistently failed to record a victim's tribal affiliation in indigenous criminal cases. That gap meant a vast number of cases involving AI/AN victims weren't tracked, and the extent of the violence against Indigenous women was underreported and undercounted.\n\nHaaland's newly invigorated Missing and Murdered Unit will boost funding for the operation from $1 to $6 million, bolstering the efforts of Operation Lady Justice , a task force created under President Trump in 2019 that brought together the Department of Interior, Health and Human Services and other agencies to develop some strategies to address the outsize number of MMIW. The increased funding will add personnel and expand 7 MMU offices in Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, Tennessee, New Mexico, Arizona and Alaska. The new offices will specifically target MMU cases and collaborate with existing law enforcement to solve them.\n\nHaaland also announced that she would implement the \"Not Invisible Act,\" a 2020 bill mandating the coordination among law enforcement agencies to address disproportionate rates of violent crime against Native Americans, an effort that hasn't been particularly effective in the past, but under Haaland's watch could be pivotal for law enforcement in solving MMIW cases.\n\nHaaland's initiatives mark a new commitment to addressing what many consider to be a crisis for Native women. In 2016 alone there were 5,712 instances of missing or murdered indigenous women. According to the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women , Native women are ten times more likely to be murdered and more than half experience sexual violence in some form. The National Crime Information Center notes that of the 5,712 reports in 2016, only 116 cases were logged in the US Department of Justice's federal missing persons database. Plus, non-native perpetrators can't be prosecuted on tribal lands, which becomes a big problem because Indigenous women are commonly attacked by non-native men. A separate study found that of those who experience sexual violence, 96% of them had a non-Native perpetrator. Nicole Matthews is the executive director of the Minnesota Indian Women's Sexual Assault Coalition and has seen this dynamic play out in her client population in which, she says, \"of the rates of violence victimization of Native women, primarily over 70% are white offenders [or] non-native offenders.\"\n\nAccording to the Minnesota Indian Women's Sexual Assault Coalition , Native women are especially vulnerable because they often must navigate their lives at the intersection of several dire social issues: poverty, sexism, and structural racism. Sometimes homeless and often poor, many of these women are exploited through sex trafficking or unwanted prostitution, where they face continued abuse and risk, and often racial discrimination and violence.\n\nIn 2019, when he testified before to the House Committee on Natural Resources, Charles Addington, an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation and [former] Deputy Bureau Director at the Office of Justice Services in the Bureau of Indian Affairs-he was recently appointed to be a Senior Adviser in the BIA- called for more robust interagency efforts: \"Many tribal leaders agreed that a holistic, multi-faceted approach to building safe and secure communities is necessary to address the particular criminal issues that plague Indian Country and Alaska Native villages.\"\n\nHistorically, tribal law enforcement has had to rely on outside agencies, such as local and state law enforcement, or federal agencies to help track down and prosecute offenders, which creates a complicated morass of agencies, laws, and jurisdictions, repeatedly allowing cases to slip through the cracks. In early May, Haaland met with reporters and described the new initiatives as a \"whole-of-government\" approach. In the past, she said, \"Indian issues were relegated to tribal offices within federal agencies,\" but under Biden, \"Every federal agency is taking our commitment to strengthening tribal agency and self-government seriously. We'll keep working until our people stop going missing without a trace.\"\n\nMatthews, from the Minnesota Indian Women's Sexual Assault Coalition, remembers an Indigenous woman sex worker describing a pimp who told her, \"I thought we'd killed all of you.\" That chilling one-line anecdote is part of a compilation of stories for the Garden of Truth Project her organization gathered. The collection includes interviews with 105 Native women about their experiences with prostitution, sexual assault, racism, and abuse.\n\n\"When I read that, it was so shocking. It was like someone hit me,\" says Matthews, who is Anishinabe from the White Earth Band of Ojibwe. \"To think that's the level of violence that people feel and think when they see us. And that's reality.\"\n\nNagle, and other Indigenous women advocates with whom I spoke were supportive of Haaland and hopeful about her efforts. But even though these changes are positive, they are just scratching the surface of a rampant, complicated problem. Advocates told Mother Jones that to have a truly effective program, federal agencies need to engage with tribal leaders, native families, and advocates, who in the past have not been included.\n\n\"If you're saying, 'Oh, we're just gonna have the federal agencies come together, talk and figure out what solution is,' there won't be a solution,\" said Mary Kathryn Nagle, a lawyer for the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. \"They've had years, decades, generations to do that, and they haven't. So we know that we need advocates, tribal leaders, survivors, victims families. We need the people on the ground doing the work to have a seat at the table.\"\n\nSolving the problem will also demand a commitment that extends outside Haaland, an effort that doesn't lose momentum in four years, says Shannon O'Loughlin, a Choctaw member and Chief Executive for the Association on American Indian Affairs. \"There has to be a structure that's going to really be committed to diminishing the numbers and the occurrences,\" she says. \"Not just finding the missing women, not just prosecuting the perpetrators, but preventing it in the first place.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Survivors Are Preserving the Dark History of Native Boarding Schools\n\nJan-Michael Stump/AP\n\nSix-year-old Phyllis Webstand wore an orange shirt to her first day of school. It was shiny, she remembers, and laced up the front-more importantly, it was a gift from her granny.\n\nAt the St. Joseph's Mission Residential School in Williams Lake, British Columbia, it was taken from her, as were all the personal belongings she had known and loved. None were ever returned. That year, 1973, Webstand became one of hundreds of thousands of Indigenous children in Canada and the US to suffer at state-run and religious boarding schools designed to assimilate by force. In the words of Richard Henry Pratt, the first superintendent of the infamous Carlisle Indian School, it was possible to \"kill the Indian in him, and save the man,\" often by coercive conversion to Christianity and the forbidding of Native language.  Physical and sexual abuse were common.\n\nIn the United States, such schools operated for 150 years, the last closing in 1969. They have had a lasting impact on Native communities, from cultural and linguistic loss to intergenerational trauma. Children of people who attended the \"residential schools\" are more likely to have poor health outcomes, experience depression, and encounter abuse. Their story isn't widely taught in schools. With \"critical race theory\" serving as grounds to ban works from Maus to a picture book by Ruby Bridges , the fight to change that may be a long one.\n\nFriday marks the second US observance of the Day of Remembrance for Indian Boarding Schools, or \" Orange Shirt Day ,\" which Webstand and fellow survivor Chief Fred Robbins started a decade ago, on the land now known as Canada. \"The color orange has always reminded me of that,\" Webstand told other Canadians in 2013, on the country's inaugural Orange Shirt Day. \"How my feelings didn't matter, how no one cared and how I felt like I was worth nothing. All of us little children were crying, and no one cared.\" The observance became a federal statutory holiday in Canada last year. It lacks official status in the US, but a resolution calling for federal recognition of Orange Shirt Day, sponsored by Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), recently passed the Senate.\n\nThe United States has dragged behind Canada in recognizing boarding schools' role in Native genocide. In 2007, the Canadian government established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address residential schools' legacy. That commission assembled a historical record of the schools and their impact, concluding in 2015 with 94 calls to action to facilitate \"reconciliation\" between Indigenous peoples and others on the land. But even that commission was the product of a settlement between Canada's government and approximately 86,000 Indigenous people sent to residential schools between 1879 and 1997.\n\nThe United States has had no similar process, and it's fallen to Indigenous women in office to act. Interior Department Secretary Deb Haaland, of the Laguna Pueblo, is the first Indigenous woman to run the agency that once oversaw residential schools. In May, her department released the first report in a multi-part investigation of their abusive practices; though not yet complete, it's already the most comprehensive effort of its kind. Over 408 of these schools existed in the US, including in what are now the states of Alaska and Hawaii. Children as young as four were ordered to execute military drills and carry out manual labor, had their hair forcibly cut, and were made to use English names. Rules were often enforced through physical punishment, including solitary confinement, whipping, and starvation. To date, the investigation has found marked and unmarked graves on the grounds of 53 schools-the likely burial places of children who perished from disease or mistreatment. In Canada, investigators discovered the bodies of thousands of Indigenous children on the former sites of residential schools. The Interior Department appears likely to find the same.\n\nIn June, Kansas House Rep. Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, introduced legislation to create a \"truth and healing commission\" on the residential schools, which would complement the Interior Department's work and serve to advance the nation's understanding of the lasting damage inflicted by Native boarding schools. Native people, of course, have preserved the memory of those atrocities. But much of the story has been buried, sometimes by survivors reluctant to reopen their wounds, and often by whitewashing campaigns like the \"critical race theory\" panic-which the US could begin to undo by acknowledging and documenting the record of genocide.\n\nCorrection, October 3 : An earlier version of this story misquoted residential school superintendent Richard Henry Pratt on the forced assimilation of Native peoples.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "GOP Senators Who Backed Extremist Agency Boss Now Call Deb Haaland too \"Radical\"\n\nSen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) Tom Williams/Congressional Quarterly/ZUMA\n\nThis story was originally published by Huffington Post and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nRepublican senators have settled on their messaging for President Joe Biden 's historic pick to lead the Interior Department , Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.): She's \"radical.\"\n\nSen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) announced his opposition Friday after a conversation with Haaland, who would be the first Native American to serve as the top steward of America's public lands and waters. Montana's junior senator signaled he would not only vote against her confirmation but attempt to block her nomination from advancing.\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned with the Congresswoman's support on several radical issues that will hurt Montana, our way of life, our jobs and rural America, including her support for the Green New Deal and President Biden's oil and gas moratorium, as well as her opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline,\" Daines said in a statement Friday . \"I'm not convinced the Congresswoman can divorce her radical views and represent what's best for Montana and all stakeholders in the West. Unless my concerns are addressed, I will block her confirmation.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, joined the mudslinging Monday, telling E&E News that Haaland's \"radical views are squarely at odds with the responsible management of our nation's energy resources.\"\n\n\"Her vocal opposition to oil and gas production on federal lands will only encourage President Biden along the illegal and reckless path that he has begun,\" Barrasso added. \"Representative Haaland must demonstrate that she will follow the law, protect the multiple uses of our public lands, and reject policies that will force energy workers into the unemployment line. I won't support her nomination otherwise.\"\n\nThe two senators' full-throated endorsement of fossil fuels is expected, as the oil and gas industry has been a top-five contributor to both over their careers, giving $1.16 million to each , according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Both were fierce supporters of the Trump administration's fossil fuel-centric \"energy dominance\" agenda.\n\nDaines often portrays himself as a champion of America's public lands. \"In Montana, public lands are a way of life,\" says a section of his website . In contrast, though, he and Barrasso voiced no concern when President Donald Trump put William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer with a history of lobbying for the sale of federal lands and of ridiculing Native Americans over their religious beliefs, in charge of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management.\n\nAfter Pendley's backdoor appointment as acting director of the agency in late July 2019, Daines dismissed concerns about the new Trump official's past support for pawning off federal lands as \" overblown .\" Barrasso said Pendley \" knows firsthand the impact public lands have on our state\" and that he was looking forward to \"working with him to protect public access for those who live, work and recreate on public lands.\"\n\nA few months later, Daines signaled he'd vote to support Pendley if Trump were to officially nominate the anti-federal-land extremist. When Trump finally did , Daines kept quiet so as not to spoil a recent victory with environmentalists ahead of his bid for reelection. Barrasso said he'd vote to confirm Pendley to lead a bureau that manages more than one-third of all federal land and 700 million subsurface mineral acres.\n\nTrump later withdrew Pendley's nomination amid fierce public backlash.\n\nAt a Colorado county Republican breakfast in 2009, for example, he railed against \"American Indian religious practitioners and their increasing insistence that federal land and private property be off-limits to use because it's 'holy' to them.\"\n\n\"The Indians have been doing this for a number of years,\" he added.\n\nIn August, The Intercept documented Pendley's decadeslong record of pushing \"rhetoric, legal arguments, and policies that sought to deprive Indigenous people of their rights.\" Among other things, The Intercept highlighted an excerpt from Pendley's 2006 book, \"Warriors for the West,\" in which he writes, \"The day may come sooner than many expect given that, with ever-declining blood quantum per tribal member, recognized tribes may soon be little more than associations of financial convenience.\"\n\nMatthew Fletcher, director of the Indigenous Law and Policy Center at Michigan State University and a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, told The Intercept at the time that Pendley's writings were \"overt racism\" and \"just a crazy, crazy racist perception of what Indian people are and what tribes are.\"\n\nNone of this garnered a public rebuke from Daines or Barrasso. But when Biden tapped Haaland, an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Laguna with broad support among elected tribal leaders and intertribal organizations, to help carry out his environmental agenda, they reached for their megaphones.\n\nThe discrepancy was not lost on Daines' critics, including in Montana.\n\nIn a Monday letter to Daines, Whitney Tawney, executive director of the left-leaning Montana Conservation Voters, called on Daines to reconsider his plans to block Haaland's nomination and excoriated the senator for his months-long silence on Pendley.\n\n\"Mr. Pendley's radical, anti-Western policies included advocating for the selloff of our public lands but you refused to demand a confirmation vote for Mr. Pendley, allowing him to serve in what a federal judge called an 'unlawful,' unconstitutional leadership position,\" Tawney wrote, referring to U.S. District Judge Brian Morris' September ruling from his Montanta court that Pendley had illegally served as BLM's acting director for more than 400 days. \"Montanans wish you had expressed concern over Acting Director Pendley's radicalism like you are now with the nation's first indigenous woman ever to be nominated to a cabinet position.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Wilmot Collins, the Democratic mayor of Helena, Montana, called Daines \" shameful .\"\n\n\"Imagine having the audacity to tell a Native American woman that her views are harmful to the American way of life - not even a month after you participated in sedition,\" Collins wrote.\n\nDaines, a loyal Trump ally, was among a dozen GOP senators who announced in early January that they would challenge Biden's victory over unproved claims of widespread voter fraud. He reversed course only after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a violent attempt to reverse the outcome of the November election.\n\nDaines' office did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Sebastian Barros/Getty\n\nThis piece was originally published in High Country News and appears here as part of our Climate Desk Partnership .\n\nAs US government scientists work to understand how COVID-19 affects the human body, tribal nations are still struggling with the impacts of the federal government's inadequate response to the pandemic. Now, through a National Institutes of Health program called \"All of Us,\" tribal nations across Indian Country are pushing federal scientists to conduct disease research that serves Indigenous peoples in a meaningful way. Developing research practices in accordance with tribal consultation takes time, however, meaning that for now, tribal citizens are missing out on the program's coronavirus antibody testing.\n\nThe All of Us study aims to collect, sequence and catalog DNA representative of the United States' diverse communities. This vast project will enable research such as Alzheimer's, diabetes and autoimmune diseases from across the country. But tribal nations are concerned about the ownership and control of this data, which can affect a number of things: patents and intellectual property rights, the privacy of tribes, future research and even access to basic information and health care.\n\n\"We're concerned about access to data as well as release of data without tribal permission,\" said Dr. Stephanie Russo (Ahtna-Native Village of Kluti-Kaah), University of Arizona public health professor . \"What the pandemic has shed a light on is the need for tribes to have access to external data.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has given the Indigenous data sovereignty movement a new sense of urgency. As pharmaceutical companies, researchers and governments scramble to create COVID-19 tests and vaccines, many tribal leaders and Indigenous data and public health experts are wary of participating in research that may have little benefit for their communities.\n\nThe Indigenous data sovereignty movement emerged in 2015, when Indigenous researchers convened in Australia to discuss research on Native peoples and Indigenous rights under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. They concluded that Indigenous nations retain ownership over their citizens' data, as well as the power to decide how that data is used. All this made news earlier this year, when the US was widely criticized for a major data breach that leaked the financial data of tribal nations that had submitted applications for COVID-19 relief.\n\nWhat's more, in the past, medical researchers have stigmatized and harmed Indigenous communities. In some cases, they did not report their findings to the tribes who participated. A 1979 study on an Inupiat community in Alaska resulted in widespread publicity on the community's alcohol use, encouraging harmful stereotypes. Researchers who took blood samples from the Havasupai Tribe in 1989 conducted a diabetes study and allowed other researchers to access the samples without the tribe's knowledge or consent. The federal government's past use of ancestry, such as blood quantum, to terminate tribal nations and limit tribal sovereignty, means there is little trust today for government-funded genetic research. This is why tribes insist on sharing ownership of the data collected by All of Us. It would empower them to have input regarding future research that makes use of Indigenous data.\n\n\"Understand: Data is a resource,\" said Keolu Fox (Kanaka 'Ōiwi), assistant professor of anthropology at University of California-San Diego who studies genome science and Indigenous communities. Fox has argued that unrestricted access to genome data by state governments and pharmaceutical companies is a threat to tribal sovereignty and may have little direct benefit aside from individual test results-meaning tribes will likely not receive subsidized medications, intellectual property rights or royalties in return for their data. During a May National Institutes of Health tribal consultation, NIH researchers recognized the minimal benefits of Indigenous participation, as Fox noted, stating that the primary gain would be those individual test results.\n\nAfter tribes and Indigenous experts began voicing their concerns about All of Us over a year ago, NIH prohibited researchers from collecting data on tribal lands. It has also halted release of data results from participants who identify as American Indian or Alaskan Native. The researchers also agreed not to publish tribal affiliations of participants without the consent of the tribal nations. This means that All of Us is currently prohibited from studying tribal citizens-at least until it finishes consulting with tribes-even for coronavirus antibody testing.\n\nGiven the tragic realities of this pandemic, health experts say addressing past ethical concerns and securing data rights in federal research institutions is crucial for both NIH and tribal nations to propel disease testing and research. Russo, who has been watching NIH's tribal meetings closely, says institutions like NIH need to build better relationships and partnerships with tribal nations to help repair the damage of history's mistakes. \"The onus is on researchers and institutions, which fund them and support them, to change practices.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Ryan Zinke's Official Portrait Is a Final Slap in the Face for Native American Tribes\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke toured Bears Ears National Monument in May. Scott G Winterton/The Deseret News via AP\n\nThis story was originally published by T h e Huffington Post and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nWhen then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke traveled to southern Utah in May 2017 to visit a pair of protected national monuments, he surrounded himself with advocates for dismantling, if not entirely erasing, those sites.\n\nHe toured Bears Ears National Monument not with members of the Native American tribes that consider the landscape sacred, but staunch opponents of the Obama-era monument. He gave representatives of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, made up of the five tribes that petitioned for the monument's designation, just a one-hour meeting. And when an indigenous woman confronted Zinke about why he hadn't spent more time talking with tribal leaders as part of his review, he shook his finger in her face and forcefully ordered her to \"be nice\" and \"don't be rude.\"\n\nTrue to form, Zinke commemorated his scandal-plagued tenure atop the federal agency this week with a portrait of himself riding a paint horse beneath a towering butte in Bears Ears shortly before he and President Donald Trump gutted protections. It is based on a picture of Zinke during his 2017 visit and was unveiled during a ceremony Wednesday at the Interior Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. Attendees, including Zinke's wife and former Navy intelligence officer Donald Bramer, posted pictures of the event to social media.\n\n(We'll get to that fiery snake battle pic in a minute.)\n\nDefense contractor lobbyist says he enjoyed catching up with former Interior Secretary Zinke and his wife \"at the unveiling of his official and 'un-official' portrait(s)\" https://t.co/BcBZaMuoJp\n\nSo, um, which portrait is the official one? pic.twitter.com/aHoxXfyAfN\n\n- Corbin Hiar (@CorbinHiar) December 9, 2020\n\nZinke was secretary of Interior from 2017 to late 2019, when he resigned under a cloud of ethics scandals. His replacement, David Bernrhardt, is a former oil, mining and agricultural lobbyist who has furthered the administration's assault on environmental rules.\n\nNamed after a pair of buttes and home to thousands of Native American archeological and cultural sites, Bears Ears was the first monument established at the request of tribes to honor and protect Native American heritage. In December 2017, on Zinke's recommendation, Trump shrunk the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears boundary by 85% and the nearby 1.87 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument roughly in half, opening the door for oil, gas and other development across large areas of previously protected lands.\n\nBrent Cotton, the Montana artist and \" dear friend \" of the Zinke family who painted the portrait, told Billings radio station KBUL that the piece includes \"a nod to Zinke's respect of the native Americans tribes\" (sic) in the band of the hat. (Aaron Weiss of the Center for Western Priorities pointed out the hat appears to be on backwards ― something Zinke famously did in real life .\n\nDefinitely the north end of a southbound hat. pic.twitter.com/PS7BRUJpHa\n\n- Aaron Weiss (@aweiss) December 9, 2020\n\nZinke's supposed respect for tribes was no doubt lost on the tribes that pleaded with him to leave Bears Ears alone. When Zinke recommended in July 2017 that Trump dismantle the  monument, the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition condemned it as a \" slap in the face to the members of our Tribes and an affront to Indian people all across the country.\" And when Trump followed through and signed a proclamation to shrink the site, Ethel Branch, the attorney general for the Navajo Nation, slammed the move as \"absolutely shocking\" and totally \"disrespectful\" of the decades of work that went into establishing Bears Ears.\n\nIn many ways, the portrait perfectly captures what is widely seen as Zinke's most controversial action and his lasting legacy: rolling back public land and environmental protections to the benefit of extractive industries and undermining tribal sovereignty .\n\nIn his statement to KBUL, Cotton said he hoped the portrait \"will be well received by all.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, the response has been anything but positive.\n\n\"Zinke's official portrait is the last gasp of a fading swamp creature,\" Shaun Chapoose, a member of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee and representative of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, told HuffPost . \"He testified to Congress that tribal ' sovereignty means something ' while he ignored the clear statements of five sovereign tribal governments that the Bears Ears landscape needs and deserves protection.\"\n\n\"His official portrait,\" Chapoose added, \"is another desperate attempt to rewrite history. What you don't see, what he doesn't tell you, is that we are still here defending and protecting our lands. If you look real close, we are there waving goodbye as he is run out of Bears Ears on the horse he rode in on.\"\n\nIn a scathing statement Tuesday, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, called the portrait \"a petty monument to a petty man,\" \"an intentional final insult to tribes he disrespected\" and \"entirely consistent with his smug, unethical, condescending tenure\" at the agency.\n\nThen-Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke talks to reporters during his 2017 visit to Utah to tour Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\n\nGeorge Frey/Getty\n\nIn addition to the official portrait that will join those of other former agency secretaries displayed at Interior headquarters, Wednesday's event included the unveiling of a second unofficial one depicting Zinke once again atop a horse and wearing a cowboy hat, but this time riding through flames, wielding a battle ax and fighting a massive serpent. That prank piece, simply Zinke's face pasted onto fantasy artist Frank Frazetta painting titled \" Death Dealer 6 ,\" appears to be a reference to the Trump administration's pledge to \"drain the swamp\" of lobbyists in Washington ― something that absolutely did not happen at Interior under Zinke's watch.\n\nAfter resigning from the Interior post, Zinke quickly found work with a blockchain investment firm, a lobbying group and a mining exploration company. Numerous other officials at Trump's Interior Department have similarly stepped through the revolving door, landing jobs with fossil fuel interests, lobbying firms or other private companies after leaving the agency, as HuffPost previously reported .\n\nWhile Zinke fancies himself a rugged cowboy and Rooseveltian conservationist, he is likely to be remembered not as a steward of America's natural resources but a loyal strongman for Trump's \"energy dominance\" agenda who racked up nearly 20 federal investigations during his stint as Interior chief. As for the rollbacks of protected wild places that he is so clearly proud of, they appear unlikely to survive the incoming Biden administration.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have vowed to \" take immediate steps to reverse the Trump administration's assaults on America's natural treasures, including by reversing Trump's attacks on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Bears Ears, and Grand Staircase-Escalante,\" as well as establish new protected sites to safeguard ecologically rich landscapes and combat global climate change.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Deb Haaland's First Big Challenge at Interior: Homegrown Extremists\n\nRep. Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat, is poised to become Secretary of the Interior. Illustration: Deandria Mackey/HuffPost; Photos:Getty\n\nThis story was originally published by HuffPost and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nIn October 2019, Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) led a House subcommittee hearing on the effects of anti-government extremism on federal land management officials. The Government Accountability Office had recently documented more than 350 incidents of threats and assaults targeting land management employees between 2013 and 2017.\n\nAs the watchdog group noted, even that data did not capture the full picture, in part because not all incidents are reported. Some officials told investigators they \"consider receiving threats a normal part of their job.\"\n\nHaaland, then in her first congressional term, stressed that these \"extremist ideologies did not develop in a vacuum.\" She read aloud a quote from former Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) on the 2014 armed standoff between federal agents and militias at Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy's ranch, in which Heller praised the militiamen as \" patriots .\" And she noted that Nevada state Rep. Michele Fiore had supported the armed militants who took control of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Fiore, a Republican, dismissed the Bureau of Land Management at the time as \"a bureaucratic agency of basically terrorism.\"\n\nNow, Haaland is about to take the reins of the Interior Department. A Senate committee advanced her nomination Thursday, and she is expected to get a final vote within the next few weeks. She would make history as the first Native American Cabinet secretary, and the first Native American to lead the federal agency that employs more than 70,000 people, manages 500 million acres of federal land-roughly a fifth of the United States-and sets policies for natural resource extraction.\n\nHaaland's ascent comes at a particularly volatile moment, in the wake of a violent Capitol insurrection that included members of many of the same anti-government militia groups that have waged war on the Interior Department. And it comes after four years of the Trump administration, which coddled anti-federal land zealots and prioritized natural resource extraction over all else.\n\nAll of this has public land advocates and experts who track far-right groups worried about the risk of armed conflict between federal agencies and anti-government militias.\n\nSteve Pedery, conservation director at Oregon Wild, expects Haaland will be tested early. \"It's unfortunate, but I guarantee we'll see the Bundys pull something again,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, Bundy has already threatened violence. In an interview in January, days before President Joe Biden's inauguration, Bundy warned that he and his allies would \"walk forward towards guns\" if the new administration attempted to collect long-overdue grazing fees and round up his cattle. That's what the Obama administration tried unsuccessfully to do in 2014. Bundy has now been grazing his cattle illegally on public lands for over two decades.\n\nBundy also praised the violent mob of Donald Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. On Facebook, Bundy wrote that \"you can't clean the swamp by standing off at a distance and smelling it\"-a nod to Trump's campaign claims that he would \"drain the swamp\" of special interests in Washington.\n\nAaron Weiss, deputy director of the Colorado-based conservation group Center for Western Priorities, worries the powder keg is now just waiting for a light.\n\n\"I do think it's not an if, but a when,\" he said.\n\nAn Emboldened Movement\n\nTrump's four years in office greatly empowered anti-government extremists.\n\nHis Interior Department repeatedly hosted people who want to see federal lands sold off. Fierce critics of endangered species protections and federal land management were tapped for powerful department posts. William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer with extreme anti-environmental views who spent his career lobbying for the sale of federal lands, was put in charge of Interior's Bureau of Land Management.\n\nTrump issued pardons for people like Utah state Rep. Phil Lyman (R)―who in 2014 led anti-federal land protesters on an illegal ATV ride on public lands that were off limits to off-road vehicles―and Dwight Lincoln Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, the father-son Oregon ranchers whose arson conviction preceded the armed takeover of the Malheur refuge.\n\nOn the final day of Trump's presidency, then-Interior Secretary David Bernhardt restored the Hammonds' grazing permit, which was revoked after the two men were convicted of intentionally setting fire to federal land.\n\nAlong with pardoning some of their criminal activity, Trump at times applauded violent radicals, including the pro-Trump insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol, as \" patriots .\"\n\nOn the flip side, Trump administration officials derided environmentalists as domestic extremists. Ryan Zinke, Trump's first interior secretary, blamed \" environmental terrorist groups \" for catastrophic wildfires in the West. And decades before joining the Trump administration, Pendley and his organization, the Mountain States Legal Foundation, set up a hotline for the public to report \"acts of environmental terrorism\" and held conferences on \"eco-terrorism,\" as HuffPost previously reported. Pendley was once a key figure of the so-called \"Wise-Use movement,\" a group of anti-government organizations that gained momentum in the 1980s and pushed to boost mining , drilling and logging on federal lands, vilifying environmentalists along the way.\n\nThe Biden administration has vowed to put public lands to use as it pursues aggressive federal action to combat the climate and extinction crises. It has issued a slew of early executive orders , which among other things temporarily paused new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters and canceled a key permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. It also set a goal of protecting 30 percent of America's lands and waters by 2030, an effort that's expected to kick off with Biden restoring protected sites that his predecessor dismantled, including the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in southern Utah.\n\nBiden's environmental agenda has infuriated lawmakers from fossil fuel-producing states, and could ultimately collide with extremist organizations like the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, two of the militia groups that flocked to the Bundy ranch in 2014, to Malheur in 2016 and to the Capitol riot in January. Both groups have long records of threatening violence against public land officials in the West, and a DeSmog investigation last year revealed that numerous Three Percenters members work in oil fields in various Western states.\n\n\"As the new administration comes in and tries to enforce rules, there's the potential for violence on a greater scale,\" said Montana author Betsy Gaines Quammen, who published a book last year on the Bundy family and the religious roots of the anti-public lands movement.\n\nRepublicans whose campaigns are bankrolled in no small part by extractive industries have turned to some familiar rhetoric to attack Haaland. GOP senators including Steve Daines (Mont.), who has a history of railing against what he calls \" fringe environmental extremists ,\" have painted Haaland as a \" far-left ideologue \" and \" radical \" threat to the American \"way of life,\" citing her support for the Green New Deal and previous statements opposing hydraulic fracturing, oil pipelines and new fossil fuel leasing on federal lands.\n\nDeb Haaland is an environmental extremist, particularly on the matter of 'climate change.' Her worldview as interior secretary will become policy, and will adversely impact the way you desire to live your life. But you didn't think about that when you voted for Biden, did you? https://t.co/eSjf7K0i1S\n\n- Darrell B. Harrison (@D_B_Harrison) December 17, 2020\n\n\"It is interesting to me how much of the opposition to her is inextricably linked to the fact that she's an Indigenous woman, and that opponents assume that if she is confirmed and advocates for Indigenous interests on public lands, it would automatically be bad for them,\" said Pedery, of Oregon Wild. \"Kind of a tacit acknowledgement that the exploitation of public lands for logging, oil and gas, mining and cattle in the Western U.S. over the last 150 years is inextricably linked with a history of racism and genocide against Indigenous people.\"\n\nRight-wing groups are already busy generating opposition and outrage to Haaland online.\n\nOn MeWe, a social media platform where extremists and conspiracy theorists are rampant , a user recently circulated a post from the group Montana & Conservative Values about how Daines had exposed Haaland's \"hostility to Western energy jobs and industry.\" In reality, during her confirmation hearing, Haaland told Daines and other lawmakers she'd fight for fossil fuel workers, that she understood the importance of oil and gas revenue to funding community services, and that \"fossil energy does and will continue to play a major role in America for years to come.\"\n\nElsewhere, folks like Sam Faddis, a former CIA agent and 2018 Republican Senate candidate, have peddled a conspiracy theory that the Communist Party of China may have hand-picked Haaland for the post.\n\nMore broadly, at least one of the Biden Interior Department's early actions has garnered the attention of gun rights groups and the far right. Last week, the agency rescinded the Trump administration's 11th-hour decision to restore the Hammonds' grazing permits.\n\n\"The Left simply cannot wait for more bloodshed,\" the Oregon Firearms Federation, a pro-gun group, wrote in a MeWe post that linked to The Oregonian 's coverage of the permit revocation.\n\n\"If ever there was a patriot group #BFYTW kind of moment, this is it,\" conservative Oregon radio host Bill Meyer wrote on Facebook, using an abbreviation for \"Because fuck you, that's why.\"\n\nThe news also sparked outrage on the private Facebook page of Timber Unity, an anti-environmental group with logging industry funding and ties to militia groups and other extremists. Members of Timber Unity chimed in below a post to ask \"How much longer until we stand up and fight?\" and to comment \"Is anyone surprised. 2A\" (a reference to the Second Amendment), according to screenshots shared with HuffPost .\n\nWhen an issue gains traction with the Second Amendment crowd, it's often a first step toward a larger mobilization of the so-called Patriot movement, said Hampton Stall, a senior researcher at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project and founder of Militia Watch, which tracks the militia movement and far-right ideologies.\n\nOver the past year, this movement has been busy confronting the Black Lives Matter protesters, throwing fits over COVID-19 mask mandates and other pandemic restrictions, plotting to kidnap Michigan's Democratic governor over the state's coronavirus lockdown and, of course, attempting to violently overturn the 2020 presidential election. But as the armed standoffs at the Bundy ranch and Malheur showed, armed militias are always looking for the next issue or event to rally behind-a phenomenon that extremism experts call \"cause shopping.\"\n\nIn Oregon, which is home to a thriving militia movement, the far right tends to mobilize around public land and environmental issues \"in part because that's where the [financial] support and political legitimacy for them come from,\" Pedery said. Two decades ago, militia groups descended on Klamath Falls to support farmers in their feud with the federal government, which at the time blocked farmers from accessing irrigation water in order to protect endangered suckerfish habitat.\n\nAnd in 2015, months before the Malheur occupation, a dispute between two gold miners and the Bureau of Land Management led to an armed standoff that lasted for weeks. The Oath Keepers were key players in that episode, which, as The Oregonian reported , helped galvanize the militia movement.\n\nJohn Temple, author of Up in Arms: How the Bundy Family Hijacked Public Lands, Outfoxed the Federal Government, and Ignited America's Patriot Militia Movement , told HuffPost the Biden administration likely has some serious challenges ahead in terms of advancing its environmental and public lands goals. Certain people are going to feel they've been trampled by the administration's policies, he said.\n\nAs for the possibility of an armed standoff arising, Temple noted, it could depend on whether a certain issue is reduced to a simple bumper sticker or a face to rally behind. With the Bundys, it was the government coming to take away the cattle of a rugged individualist rancher. With the election, it was the false narrative that the vote had been rigged and Trump's rightful victory stolen.\n\nAs Temple sees it, the landscape today is very different than it was during the Bundy standoff in 2014. Whereas then a mob of people taking up arms against federal officers \"seemed like an atrocity,\" now it \"feels sort of inevitable,\" he said.\n\nAdding to the tension, Ammon Bundy, Cliven's son who led the armed occupation at Malheur, has spent the past year building up a vast network of militia members and other far-right radicals to fight COVID-19 mandates.\n\nHe and other leaders of the group, known as People's Rights, have made vague warnings about a looming conflict, telling members to prepare for \"the force that is evident to come upon us,\" the Idaho Press reported in December.\n\n\"I think it's just a matter of time before some of these folks start to pivot away from COVID-19 organizing and focus their attention on the Bureau of Land Management yet again,\" said Stephen Piggott, a researcher with the Portland, Oregon-based nonprofit Western States Center. \"I could see a lot of this stuff coming to a head in the near future.\"\n\nWith Haaland poised to assume control of the 172-year-old Interior Department, experts and advocates say dealing with this domestic threat will require additional resources and a different law enforcement response.\n\n\"Exacerbated by new political polarization and by Trump, right-wing armed groups have been mobilizing and gaining an increased sense of impunity since the 1990s,\" Vanda Felbab-Brown , director of the Brookings Institution's Initiative on Nonstate Armed Actors , wrote in a January piece on countering right-wing armed groups. She noted that \"the government's leniency toward the anti-federal-government Bundy group\" during the Malheur takeover further \"emboldened\" such groups.\n\nWhile more than a dozen participants in the Malheur occupation pleaded guilty to criminal charges , and four were convicted by a federal jury, Ammon Bundy and six other leaders were ultimately acquitted . In 2018, a judge also declared a mistrial and dismissed all charges against Cliven Bundy and his sons stemming from the 2014 standoff at the family ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada.\n\n\"There have to be consequences and above all else, you can't give these folks the microphone,\" Weiss said. \"Letting them turn it into a media circus, letting them hold press conferences, giving them a megaphone to amplify their anti-public land message was a huge mistake. That cannot happen again.\"\n\nIn a recent podcast interview with the Center for Western Priorities, former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, who led the agency through both incidents, defended the government's decision to back down during the 2014 standoff at the Bundy ranch, saying it was the only way to avoid bloodshed. At the same time, she acknowledged errors in the government prosecution.\n\n\"Until we dish out the consequences that they deserve for this kind of activity, we are just emboldening a group of well-armed, ideologically extreme people that will continue to provide a domestic terrorism problem until they are brought to justice,\" Jewell said. \"This is a very risky time for the United States, and what we witnessed on Jan. 6 [at the Capitol] is just a small taste of what this group is interested, frankly, in dishing out.\"\n\nHaaland's office declined to be quoted for this story. The Interior Department told HuffPost it is making strides to implement the recommendations in GAO's 2019 report, which called on federal land management agencies, including BLM, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, as well as USDA's Forest Service, to take steps to assess and address ongoing security risks. BLM, for example, has hired a full-time security specialist to meet GAO's recommendations.\n\n\"Interior is taking concrete steps to strengthen security protocols and mitigate the risks our employees face, including law enforcement who are on the frontline of protecting the public, our staff, our facilities and millions of acres of federal public lands,\" Jennifer Van der Heide, Interior's chief of staff, said in a statement.\n\nRep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, which has oversight of the Interior Department, told HuffPost that the committee looks forward to working with Haaland and the rest of the Biden administration to find ways to address anti-government extremism.\n\n\"The whole country has already seen the terrible things that happen when this kind of talk turns into action,\" Grijalva said in an email. \"The Biden transition is a perfect time for the Interior Department and its agencies to take stock of their security needs, make the appropriate requests of Congress, and spend time with stakeholders to assess the risks they face in a new political world.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nDeb Haaland, a Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico's First District. (Michael Anaya-Gorman)\n\nOn a February evening, Deb Haaland, Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico's first district and a member of the Turquoise clan of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, addressed a crowd of supporters packed shoulder to shoulder in a Capitol Hill brownstone. With stairs as a pulpit, Haaland rested a forearm on the bannister and leaned into her stump speech. \"I am the only candidate who went to Standing Rock to stand with the Water Protectors,\" Haaland said to cheers from the crowd. \"There have been more than 10,000 members of Congress-but never a Native American woman.\" 1 Two months later and just a few blocks away, Paulette Jordan, Democratic candidate for Governor of Idaho, spoke to a crowd of about 30 supporters gathered at the National Indian Gaming Association headquarters. \"We want to make history,\" she said to the attorneys and advocates circled round. \"But we also want to make change.\" 2 Related Articles After Stunning Democratic Win, North Dakota Republicans Suppressed the Native American Vote Roey Hadar PHOTOS: Since Standing Rock, 56 Bills Have Been Introduced in 30 States to Restrict Protests Zoë Carpenter and Tracie Williams In some ways these Capitol Hill functions were unremarkable-modest meet-and-greet fundraisers in an election cycle full of them. But they represented an historic moment. If Haaland wins her tightly contested primary in her heavily Democratic district, she has a strong chance of becoming the first Native woman elected to Congress-one out of 10,945 members in United States history. Jordan, a citizen of the Coeur d'Alene tribe in Idaho and descendant of the Yakama, Colville and Nez Perce, faces longer odds. But if she wins her May 15 primary and then the election in November, she would become the first-ever Indigenous woman elected governor in the United States. 3 Haaland and Jordan are riding a wave of post-Standing Rock organizing that's aimed at helping Native women win elections. In all there are five Native women running for Congress, four running for governors' offices and 46 running for state legislature, according to data compiled by Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today. These trailblazing campaigns mark the arrival of this nation's first peoples-and particularly first women-at the doorstep of the halls of power. 4 \"It gives me hope,\" said Vivienna Orcutt, a councilwoman from the Hoopa Valley tribe in California. \"It gives me hope for my daughters. It gives me hope for the young women in Indian Country.\" Orcutt brought a group of Native women to Haaland's event and, after hearing her speak, decided to get involved in the campaign. She's now a dedicated volunteer who spends nights and weekends sending emails and making phone calls in the hope that come 2019, Haaland will be delivering speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives. 5 Supporters like Orcutt-the people hosting fundraisers and mobilizing voters across Indian Country- are themselves an important part of this story. Overlooked and underestimated, Native communities across the continent have organized grassroots networks amidst deep social and economic inequality: Native people are the most likely to be killed by law enforcement and rank among the poorest of this nation's poor. 6 The tribal leaders, lawyers, and activists showing up for Haaland, Jordan and other candidates cut their teeth during decades of hard-fought battles for Native rights. On my way into Haaland's fundraiser, for example, I ran into a woman from the Nisqually tribe, a community in Washington that led protests and legal battles to secure treaty rights to the Northwest coast fishery for two straight decades, through the 1960s and 1970s. Inside, I shook hands with an elder from Nambé Pueblo, one of the 19 pueblo communities who re-took control of their education systems. Today, the All Indian Pueblo Council operates the Santa Fe Indian School, where former First Lady Michelle Obama spoke in 2016 and where my little sister is a junior in high school. 7 There is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. In the wake of Standing Rock, the largest Indigenous protest in United States history, many of those activists have turned their attention to elections-and they're applying lessons learned from decades of organizing around treaty rights, casinos, and pipelines. Among the Native leaders I talked to for this story, there is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. This reorientation from tribal affairs to social movements and the ballot marks a shift for Indian Country-and potentially for national politics as well. 8 H aaland comes from a working-class family. Her father served in the Vietnam War and was awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of six men in a 1967 firefight. She grew up a military brat, attending 13 public schools before graduating from Highland High in southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico. At 15, she took a job at a bakery; every day after school and on into her twenties, Haaland decorated cakes. At 28, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, and put herself through undergrad and law school on student loans and food stamps. (I work at 350.org, whose affiliate 350 Action has endorsed Haaland.) \"When I think about my roots as a Native woman and how I was raised by my parents and my grandparents, my values were formed pretty much when I was born,\" Haaland told me. \"I didn't just decide last year where on the spectrum I was falling.\" 9 Somah Haaland, Deb's daughter, remembers her mother's first campaign well. The Haalands were living in a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California. Deb was taking classes at UCLA. Somah was in first grade and participated in after school drama lessons at the Santa Monica Playhouse. When the theatre lost its funding, Haaland launched a campaign to save the playhouse, canvassing the community with six-year-old Somah in tow. The Haalands prevailed and the playhouse still operates today; Somah went on to major in theatre at the University of New Mexico. 10 Haaland is running an unabashedly progressive campaign. She supports universal healthcare, tuition-free college, gun reform and a woman's right to choose. In a nod to Standing Rock, Haaland uses #MniWiconi, Lakota for \"Water is Life,\" in her platform and calls for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground and for a transition to a 100% renewable energy economy. 11 \"I felt I could be an effective voice for people like me: a single mom with student loans,\" Haaland told me. \"If I can fight to make people's lives better and make the role of government one where it actually lives up to its obligation to our citizens, that's what I want to do.\" 12 Jordan and Haaland are part of a rising class of Native women professionals. Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents. Haaland is nose-to-nose with Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, her closest primary competitor. Jordan, meanwhile, is being outspent in the Democratic primary 6 to 1 by Idaho businessman AJ Balukoff, who put $3.6 million of his own funds into his losing 2014 campaign. 16 Native women candidates are also drawing from lessons learned during the Obama and Sanders campaigns, the first presidential bids to integrate full-time Native advisors into their campaign headquarters. Former President Obama held an annual summit for tribal leaders at the White House and became one of just a handful of sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when he travelled to Standing Rock in 2014. Native Americans, who tend to vote for Democratic candidates , have also strengthened their position with their party of choice, reaching the nine-party-member tipping-point to constitute a caucus in 2017, giving Indigenous voices greater representation in party politics. 17 Jodi Archambault Gillette, former special assistant for Native American affairs to President Obama, watched many of these behind-the-scenes developments from the inside. In 2016, Gillette worked for her nation, the Standing Rock Sioux, leveraging relationships with Democratic decision-makers to strengthen and elevate Native resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Haaland and Jordan both travelled to Standing Rock and helped advocate for the tribe with government agencies and progressive organizations. 18 Gillette remembers when Haaland came to the Oceti Sakowin camp near the path of the pipeline to cook green chili stew and homemade tortillas for Gillette's extended family. \"As an Indigenous woman, we have responsibilities that are to us sacred.\" Gillette said. \"She gave us her traditional food. That was beautiful.\" 19 The path to victory for Haaland, Jordan and Native women running up and down the ballot remains arduous, but Gillette is confident. \"As women we are going to get it done.\" 20\n\nTwo months later and just a few blocks away, Paulette Jordan, Democratic candidate for Governor of Idaho, spoke to a crowd of about 30 supporters gathered at the National Indian Gaming Association headquarters. \"We want to make history,\" she said to the attorneys and advocates circled round. \"But we also want to make change.\" 2 Related Articles After Stunning Democratic Win, North Dakota Republicans Suppressed the Native American Vote Roey Hadar PHOTOS: Since Standing Rock, 56 Bills Have Been Introduced in 30 States to Restrict Protests Zoë Carpenter and Tracie Williams In some ways these Capitol Hill functions were unremarkable-modest meet-and-greet fundraisers in an election cycle full of them.

Native Americans, who tend to vote for Democratic candidates , have also strengthened their position with their party of choice, reaching the nine-party-member tipping-point to constitute a caucus in 2017, giving Indigenous voices greater representation in party politics. 17 Jodi Archambault Gillette, former special assistant for Native American affairs to President Obama, watched many of these behind-the-scenes developments from the inside. In 2016, Gillette worked for her nation, the Standing Rock Sioux, leveraging relationships with Democratic decision-makers to strengthen and elevate Native resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Haaland and Jordan both travelled to Standing Rock and helped advocate for the tribe with government agencies and progressive organizations. 18 Gillette remembers when Haaland came to the Oceti Sakowin camp near the path of the pipeline to cook green chili stew and homemade tortillas for Gillette's extended family. \"As an Indigenous woman, we have responsibilities that are to us sacred.\" Gillette said. \"She gave us her traditional food. That was beautiful.\" 19 The path to victory for Haaland, Jordan and Native women running up and down the ballot remains arduous, but Gillette is confident. \"As women we are going to get it done.\" 20\n\nRoey Hadar\n\nZoë Carpenter and Tracie Williams\n\nIn some ways these Capitol Hill functions were unremarkable-modest meet-and-greet fundraisers in an election cycle full of them. But they represented an historic moment. If Haaland wins her tightly contested primary in her heavily Democratic district, she has a strong chance of becoming the first Native woman elected to Congress-one out of 10,945 members in United States history. Jordan, a citizen of the Coeur d'Alene tribe in Idaho and descendant of the Yakama, Colville and Nez Perce, faces longer odds. But if she wins her May 15 primary and then the election in November, she would become the first-ever Indigenous woman elected governor in the United States. 3 Haaland and Jordan are riding a wave of post-Standing Rock organizing that's aimed at helping Native women win elections. In all there are five Native women running for Congress, four running for governors' offices and 46 running for state legislature, according to data compiled by Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today. These trailblazing campaigns mark the arrival of this nation's first peoples-and particularly first women-at the doorstep of the halls of power. 4 \"It gives me hope,\" said Vivienna Orcutt, a councilwoman from the Hoopa Valley tribe in California. \"It gives me hope for my daughters. It gives me hope for the young women in Indian Country.\" Orcutt brought a group of Native women to Haaland's event and, after hearing her speak, decided to get involved in the campaign. She's now a dedicated volunteer who spends nights and weekends sending emails and making phone calls in the hope that come 2019, Haaland will be delivering speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives. 5 Supporters like Orcutt-the people hosting fundraisers and mobilizing voters across Indian Country- are themselves an important part of this story. Overlooked and underestimated, Native communities across the continent have organized grassroots networks amidst deep social and economic inequality: Native people are the most likely to be killed by law enforcement and rank among the poorest of this nation's poor. 6 The tribal leaders, lawyers, and activists showing up for Haaland, Jordan and other candidates cut their teeth during decades of hard-fought battles for Native rights. On my way into Haaland's fundraiser, for example, I ran into a woman from the Nisqually tribe, a community in Washington that led protests and legal battles to secure treaty rights to the Northwest coast fishery for two straight decades, through the 1960s and 1970s. Inside, I shook hands with an elder from Nambé Pueblo, one of the 19 pueblo communities who re-took control of their education systems. Today, the All Indian Pueblo Council operates the Santa Fe Indian School, where former First Lady Michelle Obama spoke in 2016 and where my little sister is a junior in high school. 7 There is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. In the wake of Standing Rock, the largest Indigenous protest in United States history, many of those activists have turned their attention to elections-and they're applying lessons learned from decades of organizing around treaty rights, casinos, and pipelines. Among the Native leaders I talked to for this story, there is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. This reorientation from tribal affairs to social movements and the ballot marks a shift for Indian Country-and potentially for national politics as well. 8 H aaland comes from a working-class family. Her father served in the Vietnam War and was awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of six men in a 1967 firefight. She grew up a military brat, attending 13 public schools before graduating from Highland High in southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico. At 15, she took a job at a bakery; every day after school and on into her twenties, Haaland decorated cakes. At 28, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, and put herself through undergrad and law school on student loans and food stamps. (I work at 350.org, whose affiliate 350 Action has endorsed Haaland.) \"When I think about my roots as a Native woman and how I was raised by my parents and my grandparents, my values were formed pretty much when I was born,\" Haaland told me. \"I didn't just decide last year where on the spectrum I was falling.\" 9 Somah Haaland, Deb's daughter, remembers her mother's first campaign well. The Haalands were living in a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California. Deb was taking classes at UCLA. Somah was in first grade and participated in after school drama lessons at the Santa Monica Playhouse. When the theatre lost its funding, Haaland launched a campaign to save the playhouse, canvassing the community with six-year-old Somah in tow. The Haalands prevailed and the playhouse still operates today; Somah went on to major in theatre at the University of New Mexico. 10 Haaland is running an unabashedly progressive campaign. She supports universal healthcare, tuition-free college, gun reform and a woman's right to choose. In a nod to Standing Rock, Haaland uses #MniWiconi, Lakota for \"Water is Life,\" in her platform and calls for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground and for a transition to a 100% renewable energy economy. 11 \"I felt I could be an effective voice for people like me: a single mom with student loans,\" Haaland told me. \"If I can fight to make people's lives better and make the role of government one where it actually lives up to its obligation to our citizens, that's what I want to do.\" 12 Jordan and Haaland are part of a rising class of Native women professionals. Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents.

This reorientation from tribal affairs to social movements and the ballot marks a shift for Indian Country-and potentially for national politics as well. 8 H aaland comes from a working-class family. Her father served in the Vietnam War and was awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of six men in a 1967 firefight. She grew up a military brat, attending 13 public schools before graduating from Highland High in southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico. At 15, she took a job at a bakery; every day after school and on into her twenties, Haaland decorated cakes. At 28, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, and put herself through undergrad and law school on student loans and food stamps. (I work at 350.org, whose affiliate 350 Action has endorsed Haaland.) \"When I think about my roots as a Native woman and how I was raised by my parents and my grandparents, my values were formed pretty much when I was born,\" Haaland told me. \"I didn't just decide last year where on the spectrum I was falling.\" 9 Somah Haaland, Deb's daughter, remembers her mother's first campaign well. The Haalands were living in a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California. Deb was taking classes at UCLA. Somah was in first grade and participated in after school drama lessons at the Santa Monica Playhouse. When the theatre lost its funding, Haaland launched a campaign to save the playhouse, canvassing the community with six-year-old Somah in tow. The Haalands prevailed and the playhouse still operates today; Somah went on to major in theatre at the University of New Mexico. 10 Haaland is running an unabashedly progressive campaign. She supports universal healthcare, tuition-free college, gun reform and a woman's right to choose. In a nod to Standing Rock, Haaland uses #MniWiconi, Lakota for \"Water is Life,\" in her platform and calls for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground and for a transition to a 100% renewable energy economy. 11 \"I felt I could be an effective voice for people like me: a single mom with student loans,\" Haaland told me. \"If I can fight to make people's lives better and make the role of government one where it actually lives up to its obligation to our citizens, that's what I want to do.\" 12 Jordan and Haaland are part of a rising class of Native women professionals. Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents. Haaland is nose-to-nose with Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, her closest primary competitor. Jordan, meanwhile, is being outspent in the Democratic primary 6 to 1 by Idaho businessman AJ Balukoff, who put $3.6 million of his own funds into his losing 2014 campaign. 16 Native women candidates are also drawing from lessons learned during the Obama and Sanders campaigns, the first presidential bids to integrate full-time Native advisors into their campaign headquarters. Former President Obama held an annual summit for tribal leaders at the White House and became one of just a handful of sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when he travelled to Standing Rock in 2014. Native Americans, who tend to vote for Democratic candidates , have also strengthened their position with their party of choice, reaching the nine-party-member tipping-point to constitute a caucus in 2017, giving Indigenous voices greater representation in party politics. 17 Jodi Archambault Gillette, former special assistant for Native American affairs to President Obama, watched many of these behind-the-scenes developments from the inside. In 2016, Gillette worked for her nation, the Standing Rock Sioux, leveraging relationships with Democratic decision-makers to strengthen and elevate Native resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Haaland and Jordan both travelled to Standing Rock and helped advocate for the tribe with government agencies and progressive organizations. 18 Gillette remembers when Haaland came to the Oceti Sakowin camp near the path of the pipeline to cook green chili stew and homemade tortillas for Gillette's extended family. \"As an Indigenous woman, we have responsibilities that are to us sacred.\" Gillette said. \"She gave us her traditional food. That was beautiful.\" 19 The path to victory for Haaland, Jordan and Native women running up and down the ballot remains arduous, but Gillette is confident. \"As women we are going to get it done.\" 20\n\nThere is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests.\n\nIn the wake of Standing Rock, the largest Indigenous protest in United States history, many of those activists have turned their attention to elections-and they're applying lessons learned from decades of organizing around treaty rights, casinos, and pipelines.

Haaland and Jordan both travelled to Standing Rock and helped advocate for the tribe with government agencies and progressive organizations. 18 Gillette remembers when Haaland came to the Oceti Sakowin camp near the path of the pipeline to cook green chili stew and homemade tortillas for Gillette's extended family. \"As an Indigenous woman, we have responsibilities that are to us sacred.\" Gillette said. \"She gave us her traditional food. That was beautiful.\" 19 The path to victory for Haaland, Jordan and Native women running up and down the ballot remains arduous, but Gillette is confident. \"As women we are going to get it done.\" 20\n\nJordan and Haaland are part of a rising class of Native women professionals. Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents. Haaland is nose-to-nose with Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, her closest primary competitor. Jordan, meanwhile, is being outspent in the Democratic primary 6 to 1 by Idaho businessman AJ Balukoff, who put $3.6 million of his own funds into his losing 2014 campaign. 16 Native women candidates are also drawing from lessons learned during the Obama and Sanders campaigns, the first presidential bids to integrate full-time Native advisors into their campaign headquarters. Former President Obama held an annual summit for tribal leaders at the White House and became one of just a handful of sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when he travelled to Standing Rock in 2014.

Being part of this community response, giving food or helping others, is a commitment, an act of solidarity and at the same time a way of expressing autonomy: We do not need the government to help us, the communities have known how to do it for more than 500 years.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nThe ongoing struggle for racial justice. The future for immigrant families. The health and well-being of all Americans. The very fate of our fragile planet. The United States faces a crossroads in 2020. Seeking out the stories flying under the national radar , The Nation and Magnum Foundation are partnering on What's At Stake , a series of photo essays from across the country through the lenses of independent imagemakers. Follow the whole series here . This installment was produced with support from the Economic Hardship Reporting Project . W hen the pandemic hit New York City this spring, Próspero Martínez, a Mixe Indigenous migrant from the community of Tlahuitoltepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, began managing a community garden and green roof project at the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The community was experiencing food shortages and many people were losing jobs or having hours cut. People were scared. Polaroid photo of the green roof that Próspero Martinez created.\r\n\r\nText written in the Ayuujk jää'y language by Próspero about his inspiration for the garden: \"Sow and build to preserve the integrity of the universe to which we belong. Coexist as far as our mother earth allows our species. The wisdom of nature gives us the opportunity to interpret what is beautiful at heart. When a seed turns into a flower we state that we exist.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) For Próspero, joining with his neighbors to get through the crisis together just made sense. \"Planting your own food is a way of resisting, of being autonomous-it is what we, Indigenous peoples, have fought all our lives to preserve,\" he told me this summer. \"It is a way to return to our origins, to revalue the work of the campesino , which in the labor hierarchy occupies the last step and, during the pandemic, we saw paradoxically, that he became the 'essential' and yet the most exploited worker.\" Josefina Neponuseno, an Indigenous Nahuatl, hands out groceries at the food pantry at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, where she is a volunteer and cook. \r\n\r\nText written in Nahuatl language and Spanish by Josefina about the pandemic and her experience of mutual aid: \"First I thank God for all the blessings. This pandemic changed the life of the whole world. Many people have died but thank God we are moving on little by little. Being a volunteer is helping others. I don't have money to help but I give my time. Since my mother told me: whenever you can help others do it without discriminating if the person is good or bad. Thus I follow her example. Here in the church we provide food for all the people who need help, because with this pandemic many people were left without work, but with God's blessing we will all get ahead.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) The food distribution network that Próspero is a part of, centered around the Good Shepherd Church, is largely run and led by Indigenous people, and for many like him, the work they are doing to keep their neighbors fed and housed draws heavily on the Indigenous practices they're importing from their home communities. (Full disclosure: My husband is the pastor at Good Shepherd Church, so I have deep connections with this congregation.) Over the course of the pandemic, I have been visiting these centers of mutual support run by Indigenous migrants, photographing their work and talking to them about the importance these practices represent to them. \"I am the musician of the Tecuanes group, I accompany the dance playing a flute and a drum,\" says Jeffrey Perez, a 12-year-old boy who is part of the Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's dance group, which is mostly made up of children born in New York. La danza de los tecuanes, the dance of the jaguar, is a theatrical, Indigenous celebration that fuses magical-religious elements and fertility rites in its portrayal of a group of hunters trying to catch a tecuane, a word which itself is of Nahuatl origin. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Dancer dressed as a jaguar or tecuani during the Mixtec carnival celebration in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \"In Mixtec mythology there has been a battle between Tecuán and man since pre-Hispanic times, a struggle that is recreated today in the Tecuán dance that stages the persecution, hunt, and death of the Tecuán,\" says Demetrio, an Indigenous Mixtec migrant from Puebla. (Cinthya Santos Briones) When Próspero came to New York City two years ago, he was joining a diverse mix of Mesoamerican Indigenous immigrant communities hailing from the mountains, jungles, and deserts of Mexico and Guatemala. Though not wholly new (Indigenous migrants have been in the United States for as long as the country has existed, and from the 1940s to the '60s, Indigenous manual laborers from southeast and central Mexico worked as peasants in the US under the government's \"Bracero Program\"), the pace of Indigenous migration to the United States has accelerated in recent decades. Indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala have faced new levels of economic precarity and violence in recent decades, which has displaced thousands of Indigenous people from their communities. New York has become a destination for many of them, and the city is now home to Mixes, Totonacos, Mixtecos, Otomís, Tlapanecos, Tepehuas, Amuzgos from Mexico; K'iches, Mams, Kaqchikels and Tz'utujils from Guatemala; Nahua from across Central America; and Quechuas and Aymaras from South America. Each of these peoples come with their own language, culture, identity, gastronomy, religion, oral history, philosophy and worldview that is glossed over or erased in many discussions of Latin American migration to the United States. Natalia Méndez Saavedra is a Mixtec Indigenous migrant from Oaxaca and co-owner with her family of La Morada restaurant in the South Bronx. When the pandemic began, La Morada opened its doors in an act of solidarity with the communities most in need, providing more than 5,000 meals a week. \"This system has taken away everything and even our fear. In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Portrait of the exterior of La Morada. The restaurant has operated for years as both a refuge for undocumented migrants and a cultural and political meeting point in New York City.\r\n\"We have built a space where justice can be smelled and eaten, where our roots as Mixtec Indigenous people can be transmitted,\" Natalia Mendez says. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Zenaida Cantú, a Me'phaa Indigenous migrant from the mountains of Guerrero, is a poet who currently works as an interpreter in immigration courts for immigrants who speak neither English or Spanish. \"It is important to provide adequate interpretation in the courts,\" says Zenaida. \"Through the organization Cielo in California I have been able to be a translator in immigration and family courts in Arizona, New York, and other states; that is a way of contributing and helping my community to keep their families united, to have a fair treatment and not be deported and separated from your loved ones.\"\r\nFor more than 15 years, she has lived in the Bronx with her three children and husband. \"I am teaching my children to speak and write in my language, the Me'phaa, because my mother does not speak Spanish and how are they going to communicate with her?\" Zenaida says.\r\n\r\nPoem in the Indigenous Me'phaa language written by Zenaida. (Cinthya Santos Briones) What many of these peoples share, however, is an idea of reciprocity and mutual support-\"giving, returning and receiving\"-as a social organizing system. These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) \"Weaving in community is resisting\" says Maria, center, with the weaving and embroidery group she runs in Owl's Head Park, Bay Ridge. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Mario Cortés, a Nahua Indigenous migrant from Puebla, dressed as a Mexica warrior from pre-Hispanic times. Mario is a dancer with the Mexica group Cetiliztli Nauhcampa, and has been working as a hairdresser in New York City for years.\r\n\"We believe that a connection exists among all things. The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia. Elias Guzmán holding the portrait of his brother, Victorio Hilario Guzmán, who was making food deliveries on his bike in the Bronx when he was killed in a hit-and-run in the Bronx on September 23. \"Being Indigenous and migrant is difficult because we cannot express ourselves accurately before the institutions, ask for justice, fight for our rights,\" says Elías, a Meꞌphaa Indigenous migrant. Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit. You left us a great void in your departure, but we will always carry you in our hearts. This is not a goodbye. Rest in peace, now you are already an angel, brother.\r\nYou left the house a month ago today, we are still waiting for you to come back to have dinner with us. Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Migrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures. Ely is an Indigenous migrant from the department of Quiché in Guatemala. \r\n\r\nText written in Kiche' by Ely: \"A K'iche' woman is independent and strong, she makes her own natural medicines, has a stove and makes tortillas by hand. She wears a very expensive traditional costume, valued at 5,000 quetzales. The costume that an Indigenous Ki'che' woman wears has multiple meanings like the white blouse, which is peace, purity, beauty. The cords that are used to tie your hair signify respect and make your hair grow. The sash has various drawings as flowers, roses, animals such as birds, doves, that stand for peace on earth for the Ki'che' woman. Flowers on the skirt means nature and the heavens, the animals are the colors of the forest, of the jungle, of the mountain. The necklaces that the Indigenous woman wears are black and red, which are sacred colors. The life of a woman in the land is very hard.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Children of the dance group Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's participate in the celebration of the independence of Mexico, organized by the Mixtec organization in Sunset Park. (Cinthya Santos Briones) First-generation girls who are members of the Las Moras dance group.\r\nLas Moras is an Indigenous dance from San Pedro Benito Juárez, Puebla. It emerged during the colonial period in Mexico, and it is accompanied by pre-Hispanic instruments like the teponaztli and the chirimia, a drum and a small flute. The dance is now performed by Indigenous migrants from San Pedro Benito Juárez in parties and festivals in New York.

I don't have money to help but I give my time. Since my mother told me: whenever you can help others do it without discriminating if the person is good or bad. Thus I follow her example. Here in the church we provide food for all the people who need help, because with this pandemic many people were left without work, but with God's blessing we will all get ahead.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) The food distribution network that Próspero is a part of, centered around the Good Shepherd Church, is largely run and led by Indigenous people, and for many like him, the work they are doing to keep their neighbors fed and housed draws heavily on the Indigenous practices they're importing from their home communities. (Full disclosure: My husband is the pastor at Good Shepherd Church, so I have deep connections with this congregation.) Over the course of the pandemic, I have been visiting these centers of mutual support run by Indigenous migrants, photographing their work and talking to them about the importance these practices represent to them. \"I am the musician of the Tecuanes group, I accompany the dance playing a flute and a drum,\" says Jeffrey Perez, a 12-year-old boy who is part of the Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's dance group, which is mostly made up of children born in New York. La danza de los tecuanes, the dance of the jaguar, is a theatrical, Indigenous celebration that fuses magical-religious elements and fertility rites in its portrayal of a group of hunters trying to catch a tecuane, a word which itself is of Nahuatl origin. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Dancer dressed as a jaguar or tecuani during the Mixtec carnival celebration in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \"In Mixtec mythology there has been a battle between Tecuán and man since pre-Hispanic times, a struggle that is recreated today in the Tecuán dance that stages the persecution, hunt, and death of the Tecuán,\" says Demetrio, an Indigenous Mixtec migrant from Puebla. (Cinthya Santos Briones) When Próspero came to New York City two years ago, he was joining a diverse mix of Mesoamerican Indigenous immigrant communities hailing from the mountains, jungles, and deserts of Mexico and Guatemala. Though not wholly new (Indigenous migrants have been in the United States for as long as the country has existed, and from the 1940s to the '60s, Indigenous manual laborers from southeast and central Mexico worked as peasants in the US under the government's \"Bracero Program\"), the pace of Indigenous migration to the United States has accelerated in recent decades. Indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala have faced new levels of economic precarity and violence in recent decades, which has displaced thousands of Indigenous people from their communities. New York has become a destination for many of them, and the city is now home to Mixes, Totonacos, Mixtecos, Otomís, Tlapanecos, Tepehuas, Amuzgos from Mexico; K'iches, Mams, Kaqchikels and Tz'utujils from Guatemala; Nahua from across Central America; and Quechuas and Aymaras from South America. Each of these peoples come with their own language, culture, identity, gastronomy, religion, oral history, philosophy and worldview that is glossed over or erased in many discussions of Latin American migration to the United States. Natalia Méndez Saavedra is a Mixtec Indigenous migrant from Oaxaca and co-owner with her family of La Morada restaurant in the South Bronx. When the pandemic began, La Morada opened its doors in an act of solidarity with the communities most in need, providing more than 5,000 meals a week. \"This system has taken away everything and even our fear. In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Portrait of the exterior of La Morada. The restaurant has operated for years as both a refuge for undocumented migrants and a cultural and political meeting point in New York City.\r\n\"We have built a space where justice can be smelled and eaten, where our roots as Mixtec Indigenous people can be transmitted,\" Natalia Mendez says. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Zenaida Cantú, a Me'phaa Indigenous migrant from the mountains of Guerrero, is a poet who currently works as an interpreter in immigration courts for immigrants who speak neither English or Spanish. \"It is important to provide adequate interpretation in the courts,\" says Zenaida. \"Through the organization Cielo in California I have been able to be a translator in immigration and family courts in Arizona, New York, and other states; that is a way of contributing and helping my community to keep their families united, to have a fair treatment and not be deported and separated from your loved ones.\"\r\nFor more than 15 years, she has lived in the Bronx with her three children and husband. \"I am teaching my children to speak and write in my language, the Me'phaa, because my mother does not speak Spanish and how are they going to communicate with her?\" Zenaida says.\r\n\r\nPoem in the Indigenous Me'phaa language written by Zenaida. (Cinthya Santos Briones) What many of these peoples share, however, is an idea of reciprocity and mutual support-\"giving, returning and receiving\"-as a social organizing system. These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) \"Weaving in community is resisting\" says Maria, center, with the weaving and embroidery group she runs in Owl's Head Park, Bay Ridge. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Mario Cortés, a Nahua Indigenous migrant from Puebla, dressed as a Mexica warrior from pre-Hispanic times. Mario is a dancer with the Mexica group Cetiliztli Nauhcampa, and has been working as a hairdresser in New York City for years.\r\n\"We believe that a connection exists among all things. The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia. Elias Guzmán holding the portrait of his brother, Victorio Hilario Guzmán, who was making food deliveries on his bike in the Bronx when he was killed in a hit-and-run in the Bronx on September 23. \"Being Indigenous and migrant is difficult because we cannot express ourselves accurately before the institutions, ask for justice, fight for our rights,\" says Elías, a Meꞌphaa Indigenous migrant. Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit. You left us a great void in your departure, but we will always carry you in our hearts. This is not a goodbye. Rest in peace, now you are already an angel, brother.\r\nYou left the house a month ago today, we are still waiting for you to come back to have dinner with us. Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Migrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures. Ely is an Indigenous migrant from the department of Quiché in Guatemala. \r\n\r\nText written in Kiche' by Ely: \"A K'iche' woman is independent and strong, she makes her own natural medicines, has a stove and makes tortillas by hand. She wears a very expensive traditional costume, valued at 5,000 quetzales. The costume that an Indigenous Ki'che' woman wears has multiple meanings like the white blouse, which is peace, purity, beauty. The cords that are used to tie your hair signify respect and make your hair grow. The sash has various drawings as flowers, roses, animals such as birds, doves, that stand for peace on earth for the Ki'che' woman. Flowers on the skirt means nature and the heavens, the animals are the colors of the forest, of the jungle, of the mountain. The necklaces that the Indigenous woman wears are black and red, which are sacred colors.

These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me.

To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia.

Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables.

No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures.

La danza de los tecuanes, the dance of the jaguar, is a theatrical, Indigenous celebration that fuses magical-religious elements and fertility rites in its portrayal of a group of hunters trying to catch a tecuane, a word which itself is of Nahuatl origin.

(Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nWhen Próspero came to New York City two years ago, he was joining a diverse mix of Mesoamerican Indigenous immigrant communities hailing from the mountains, jungles, and deserts of Mexico and Guatemala. Though not wholly new (Indigenous migrants have been in the United States for as long as the country has existed, and from the 1940s to the '60s, Indigenous manual laborers from southeast and central Mexico worked as peasants in the US under the government's \"Bracero Program\"), the pace of Indigenous migration to the United States has accelerated in recent decades. Indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala have faced new levels of economic precarity and violence in recent decades, which has displaced thousands of Indigenous people from their communities. New York has become a destination for many of them, and the city is now home to Mixes, Totonacos, Mixtecos, Otomís, Tlapanecos, Tepehuas, Amuzgos from Mexico; K'iches, Mams, Kaqchikels and Tz'utujils from Guatemala; Nahua from across Central America; and Quechuas and Aymaras from South America. Each of these peoples come with their own language, culture, identity, gastronomy, religion, oral history, philosophy and worldview that is glossed over or erased in many discussions of Latin American migration to the United States.

In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me.

This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia.

Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit.

The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own.

She longs to be around her community in the western highlands of Totonicapán, Guatemala, immersing herself in the sacred communal forest she'd been taught to love, respect, and protect since she was a young child. The forest of Totonicapán is not only one of the most important water recharge sites of Mesoamerica; it's also a symbol of the collective fight of K'iche communities against a colonial Guatemalan state that has repeatedly attempted to seize and destroy it. \"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says. The word K'iche literally translates to \"a lot of trees.\" \"That's what we are,\" she says. In the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it. Supporters of Guatemalan candidate for the Movimiento para la Liberación de los Pueblos (Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples) party Thelma Cabrera take part in a campaign closing rally at Plaza de la Constitucion in Guatemala City on June 8, 2019. (JOHAN ORDONEZ / AFP via Getty Images) Ixchíu is a community journalist, artist, architect and feminist advocate. She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong. People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance.

But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nThe forest of Totonicapán is not only one of the most important water recharge sites of Mesoamerica; it's also a symbol of the collective fight of K'iche communities against a colonial Guatemalan state that has repeatedly attempted to seize and destroy it. \"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says. The word K'iche literally translates to \"a lot of trees.\" \"That's what we are,\" she says. In the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it.

She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong.

But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero.

The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nSupporters of Guatemalan candidate for the Movimiento para la Liberación de los Pueblos (Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples) party Thelma Cabrera take part in a campaign closing rally at Plaza de la Constitucion in Guatemala City on June 8, 2019.

She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong. People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 .

The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nAs Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed.

Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution.

Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 .

She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nThe 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says.

After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\n\"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire .

But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero.

She longs to be around her community in the western highlands of Totonicapán, Guatemala, immersing herself in the sacred communal forest she'd been taught to love, respect, and protect since she was a young child. The forest of Totonicapán is not only one of the most important water recharge sites of Mesoamerica; it's also a symbol of the collective fight of K'iche communities against a colonial Guatemalan state that has repeatedly attempted to seize and destroy it. \"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says. The word K'iche literally translates to \"a lot of trees.\" \"That's what we are,\" she says. In the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it.

(JOHAN ORDONEZ / AFP via Getty Images) Ixchíu is a community journalist, artist, architect and feminist advocate. She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong. People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance.

Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nIn the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it.

She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong.

People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\n\"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong.

(Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nIn the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm.

Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\n\"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says.

She longs to be around her community in the western highlands of Totonicapán, Guatemala, immersing herself in the sacred communal forest she'd been taught to love, respect, and protect since she was a young child. The forest of Totonicapán is not only one of the most important water recharge sites of Mesoamerica; it's also a symbol of the collective fight of K'iche communities against a colonial Guatemalan state that has repeatedly attempted to seize and destroy it. \"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says. The word K'iche literally translates to \"a lot of trees.\" \"That's what we are,\" she says. In the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it.

(JOHAN ORDONEZ / AFP via Getty Images) Ixchíu is a community journalist, artist, architect and feminist advocate. She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong. People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nThe forest of Totonicapán is not only one of the most important water recharge sites of Mesoamerica; it's also a symbol of the collective fight of K'iche communities against a colonial Guatemalan state that has repeatedly attempted to seize and destroy it. \"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says. The word K'iche literally translates to \"a lot of trees.\" \"That's what we are,\" she says. In the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it.

She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong.

But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists.

Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nSupporters of Guatemalan candidate for the Movimiento para la Liberación de los Pueblos (Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples) party Thelma Cabrera take part in a campaign closing rally at Plaza de la Constitucion in Guatemala City on June 8, 2019.

She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong. People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence.

Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nAs Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed.

What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nThe 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution.

Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\n\"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero.

Being part of this community response, giving food or helping others, is a commitment, an act of solidarity and at the same time a way of expressing autonomy: We do not need the government to help us, the communities have known how to do it for more than 500 years.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nThe ongoing struggle for racial justice. The future for immigrant families. The health and well-being of all Americans. The very fate of our fragile planet. The United States faces a crossroads in 2020. Seeking out the stories flying under the national radar , The Nation and Magnum Foundation are partnering on What's At Stake , a series of photo essays from across the country through the lenses of independent imagemakers. Follow the whole series here . This installment was produced with support from the Economic Hardship Reporting Project . W hen the pandemic hit New York City this spring, Próspero Martínez, a Mixe Indigenous migrant from the community of Tlahuitoltepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, began managing a community garden and green roof project at the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The community was experiencing food shortages and many people were losing jobs or having hours cut. People were scared. Polaroid photo of the green roof that Próspero Martinez created.\r\n\r\nText written in the Ayuujk jää'y language by Próspero about his inspiration for the garden: \"Sow and build to preserve the integrity of the universe to which we belong. Coexist as far as our mother earth allows our species. The wisdom of nature gives us the opportunity to interpret what is beautiful at heart. When a seed turns into a flower we state that we exist.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) For Próspero, joining with his neighbors to get through the crisis together just made sense. \"Planting your own food is a way of resisting, of being autonomous-it is what we, Indigenous peoples, have fought all our lives to preserve,\" he told me this summer. \"It is a way to return to our origins, to revalue the work of the campesino , which in the labor hierarchy occupies the last step and, during the pandemic, we saw paradoxically, that he became the 'essential' and yet the most exploited worker.\" Josefina Neponuseno, an Indigenous Nahuatl, hands out groceries at the food pantry at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, where she is a volunteer and cook. \r\n\r\nText written in Nahuatl language and Spanish by Josefina about the pandemic and her experience of mutual aid: \"First I thank God for all the blessings. This pandemic changed the life of the whole world. Many people have died but thank God we are moving on little by little. Being a volunteer is helping others. I don't have money to help but I give my time. Since my mother told me: whenever you can help others do it without discriminating if the person is good or bad. Thus I follow her example. Here in the church we provide food for all the people who need help, because with this pandemic many people were left without work, but with God's blessing we will all get ahead.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) The food distribution network that Próspero is a part of, centered around the Good Shepherd Church, is largely run and led by Indigenous people, and for many like him, the work they are doing to keep their neighbors fed and housed draws heavily on the Indigenous practices they're importing from their home communities. (Full disclosure: My husband is the pastor at Good Shepherd Church, so I have deep connections with this congregation.) Over the course of the pandemic, I have been visiting these centers of mutual support run by Indigenous migrants, photographing their work and talking to them about the importance these practices represent to them. \"I am the musician of the Tecuanes group, I accompany the dance playing a flute and a drum,\" says Jeffrey Perez, a 12-year-old boy who is part of the Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's dance group, which is mostly made up of children born in New York. La danza de los tecuanes, the dance of the jaguar, is a theatrical, Indigenous celebration that fuses magical-religious elements and fertility rites in its portrayal of a group of hunters trying to catch a tecuane, a word which itself is of Nahuatl origin. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Dancer dressed as a jaguar or tecuani during the Mixtec carnival celebration in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \"In Mixtec mythology there has been a battle between Tecuán and man since pre-Hispanic times, a struggle that is recreated today in the Tecuán dance that stages the persecution, hunt, and death of the Tecuán,\" says Demetrio, an Indigenous Mixtec migrant from Puebla. (Cinthya Santos Briones) When Próspero came to New York City two years ago, he was joining a diverse mix of Mesoamerican Indigenous immigrant communities hailing from the mountains, jungles, and deserts of Mexico and Guatemala. Though not wholly new (Indigenous migrants have been in the United States for as long as the country has existed, and from the 1940s to the '60s, Indigenous manual laborers from southeast and central Mexico worked as peasants in the US under the government's \"Bracero Program\"), the pace of Indigenous migration to the United States has accelerated in recent decades. Indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala have faced new levels of economic precarity and violence in recent decades, which has displaced thousands of Indigenous people from their communities. New York has become a destination for many of them, and the city is now home to Mixes, Totonacos, Mixtecos, Otomís, Tlapanecos, Tepehuas, Amuzgos from Mexico; K'iches, Mams, Kaqchikels and Tz'utujils from Guatemala; Nahua from across Central America; and Quechuas and Aymaras from South America. Each of these peoples come with their own language, culture, identity, gastronomy, religion, oral history, philosophy and worldview that is glossed over or erased in many discussions of Latin American migration to the United States. Natalia Méndez Saavedra is a Mixtec Indigenous migrant from Oaxaca and co-owner with her family of La Morada restaurant in the South Bronx. When the pandemic began, La Morada opened its doors in an act of solidarity with the communities most in need, providing more than 5,000 meals a week. \"This system has taken away everything and even our fear. In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Portrait of the exterior of La Morada. The restaurant has operated for years as both a refuge for undocumented migrants and a cultural and political meeting point in New York City.\r\n\"We have built a space where justice can be smelled and eaten, where our roots as Mixtec Indigenous people can be transmitted,\" Natalia Mendez says. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Zenaida Cantú, a Me'phaa Indigenous migrant from the mountains of Guerrero, is a poet who currently works as an interpreter in immigration courts for immigrants who speak neither English or Spanish. \"It is important to provide adequate interpretation in the courts,\" says Zenaida. \"Through the organization Cielo in California I have been able to be a translator in immigration and family courts in Arizona, New York, and other states; that is a way of contributing and helping my community to keep their families united, to have a fair treatment and not be deported and separated from your loved ones.\"\r\nFor more than 15 years, she has lived in the Bronx with her three children and husband. \"I am teaching my children to speak and write in my language, the Me'phaa, because my mother does not speak Spanish and how are they going to communicate with her?\" Zenaida says.\r\n\r\nPoem in the Indigenous Me'phaa language written by Zenaida. (Cinthya Santos Briones) What many of these peoples share, however, is an idea of reciprocity and mutual support-\"giving, returning and receiving\"-as a social organizing system. These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) \"Weaving in community is resisting\" says Maria, center, with the weaving and embroidery group she runs in Owl's Head Park, Bay Ridge. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Mario Cortés, a Nahua Indigenous migrant from Puebla, dressed as a Mexica warrior from pre-Hispanic times. Mario is a dancer with the Mexica group Cetiliztli Nauhcampa, and has been working as a hairdresser in New York City for years.\r\n\"We believe that a connection exists among all things. The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia. Elias Guzmán holding the portrait of his brother, Victorio Hilario Guzmán, who was making food deliveries on his bike in the Bronx when he was killed in a hit-and-run in the Bronx on September 23. \"Being Indigenous and migrant is difficult because we cannot express ourselves accurately before the institutions, ask for justice, fight for our rights,\" says Elías, a Meꞌphaa Indigenous migrant. Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit. You left us a great void in your departure, but we will always carry you in our hearts. This is not a goodbye. Rest in peace, now you are already an angel, brother.\r\nYou left the house a month ago today, we are still waiting for you to come back to have dinner with us. Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Migrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures. Ely is an Indigenous migrant from the department of Quiché in Guatemala. \r\n\r\nText written in Kiche' by Ely: \"A K'iche' woman is independent and strong, she makes her own natural medicines, has a stove and makes tortillas by hand. She wears a very expensive traditional costume, valued at 5,000 quetzales. The costume that an Indigenous Ki'che' woman wears has multiple meanings like the white blouse, which is peace, purity, beauty. The cords that are used to tie your hair signify respect and make your hair grow. The sash has various drawings as flowers, roses, animals such as birds, doves, that stand for peace on earth for the Ki'che' woman. Flowers on the skirt means nature and the heavens, the animals are the colors of the forest, of the jungle, of the mountain. The necklaces that the Indigenous woman wears are black and red, which are sacred colors. The life of a woman in the land is very hard.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Children of the dance group Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's participate in the celebration of the independence of Mexico, organized by the Mixtec organization in Sunset Park. (Cinthya Santos Briones) First-generation girls who are members of the Las Moras dance group.\r\nLas Moras is an Indigenous dance from San Pedro Benito Juárez, Puebla. It emerged during the colonial period in Mexico, and it is accompanied by pre-Hispanic instruments like the teponaztli and the chirimia, a drum and a small flute. The dance is now performed by Indigenous migrants from San Pedro Benito Juárez in parties and festivals in New York.

Coexist as far as our mother earth allows our species. The wisdom of nature gives us the opportunity to interpret what is beautiful at heart. When a seed turns into a flower we state that we exist.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nFor Próspero, joining with his neighbors to get through the crisis together just made sense. \"Planting your own food is a way of resisting, of being autonomous-it is what we, Indigenous peoples, have fought all our lives to preserve,\" he told me this summer. \"It is a way to return to our origins, to revalue the work of the campesino , which in the labor hierarchy occupies the last step and, during the pandemic, we saw paradoxically, that he became the 'essential' and yet the most exploited worker.\" Josefina Neponuseno, an Indigenous Nahuatl, hands out groceries at the food pantry at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, where she is a volunteer and cook. \r\n\r\nText written in Nahuatl language and Spanish by Josefina about the pandemic and her experience of mutual aid: \"First I thank God for all the blessings. This pandemic changed the life of the whole world. Many people have died but thank God we are moving on little by little. Being a volunteer is helping others. I don't have money to help but I give my time. Since my mother told me: whenever you can help others do it without discriminating if the person is good or bad. Thus I follow her example. Here in the church we provide food for all the people who need help, because with this pandemic many people were left without work, but with God's blessing we will all get ahead.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) The food distribution network that Próspero is a part of, centered around the Good Shepherd Church, is largely run and led by Indigenous people, and for many like him, the work they are doing to keep their neighbors fed and housed draws heavily on the Indigenous practices they're importing from their home communities. (Full disclosure: My husband is the pastor at Good Shepherd Church, so I have deep connections with this congregation.) Over the course of the pandemic, I have been visiting these centers of mutual support run by Indigenous migrants, photographing their work and talking to them about the importance these practices represent to them. \"I am the musician of the Tecuanes group, I accompany the dance playing a flute and a drum,\" says Jeffrey Perez, a 12-year-old boy who is part of the Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's dance group, which is mostly made up of children born in New York. La danza de los tecuanes, the dance of the jaguar, is a theatrical, Indigenous celebration that fuses magical-religious elements and fertility rites in its portrayal of a group of hunters trying to catch a tecuane, a word which itself is of Nahuatl origin.

(Cinthya Santos Briones) When Próspero came to New York City two years ago, he was joining a diverse mix of Mesoamerican Indigenous immigrant communities hailing from the mountains, jungles, and deserts of Mexico and Guatemala. Though not wholly new (Indigenous migrants have been in the United States for as long as the country has existed, and from the 1940s to the '60s, Indigenous manual laborers from southeast and central Mexico worked as peasants in the US under the government's \"Bracero Program\"), the pace of Indigenous migration to the United States has accelerated in recent decades. Indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala have faced new levels of economic precarity and violence in recent decades, which has displaced thousands of Indigenous people from their communities. New York has become a destination for many of them, and the city is now home to Mixes, Totonacos, Mixtecos, Otomís, Tlapanecos, Tepehuas, Amuzgos from Mexico; K'iches, Mams, Kaqchikels and Tz'utujils from Guatemala; Nahua from across Central America; and Quechuas and Aymaras from South America. Each of these peoples come with their own language, culture, identity, gastronomy, religion, oral history, philosophy and worldview that is glossed over or erased in many discussions of Latin American migration to the United States. Natalia Méndez Saavedra is a Mixtec Indigenous migrant from Oaxaca and co-owner with her family of La Morada restaurant in the South Bronx. When the pandemic began, La Morada opened its doors in an act of solidarity with the communities most in need, providing more than 5,000 meals a week. \"This system has taken away everything and even our fear. In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Portrait of the exterior of La Morada. The restaurant has operated for years as both a refuge for undocumented migrants and a cultural and political meeting point in New York City.\r\n\"We have built a space where justice can be smelled and eaten, where our roots as Mixtec Indigenous people can be transmitted,\" Natalia Mendez says. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Zenaida Cantú, a Me'phaa Indigenous migrant from the mountains of Guerrero, is a poet who currently works as an interpreter in immigration courts for immigrants who speak neither English or Spanish. \"It is important to provide adequate interpretation in the courts,\" says Zenaida. \"Through the organization Cielo in California I have been able to be a translator in immigration and family courts in Arizona, New York, and other states; that is a way of contributing and helping my community to keep their families united, to have a fair treatment and not be deported and separated from your loved ones.\"\r\nFor more than 15 years, she has lived in the Bronx with her three children and husband. \"I am teaching my children to speak and write in my language, the Me'phaa, because my mother does not speak Spanish and how are they going to communicate with her?\" Zenaida says.\r\n\r\nPoem in the Indigenous Me'phaa language written by Zenaida. (Cinthya Santos Briones) What many of these peoples share, however, is an idea of reciprocity and mutual support-\"giving, returning and receiving\"-as a social organizing system. These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) \"Weaving in community is resisting\" says Maria, center, with the weaving and embroidery group she runs in Owl's Head Park, Bay Ridge. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Mario Cortés, a Nahua Indigenous migrant from Puebla, dressed as a Mexica warrior from pre-Hispanic times. Mario is a dancer with the Mexica group Cetiliztli Nauhcampa, and has been working as a hairdresser in New York City for years.\r\n\"We believe that a connection exists among all things. The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia. Elias Guzmán holding the portrait of his brother, Victorio Hilario Guzmán, who was making food deliveries on his bike in the Bronx when he was killed in a hit-and-run in the Bronx on September 23. \"Being Indigenous and migrant is difficult because we cannot express ourselves accurately before the institutions, ask for justice, fight for our rights,\" says Elías, a Meꞌphaa Indigenous migrant. Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit. You left us a great void in your departure, but we will always carry you in our hearts. This is not a goodbye. Rest in peace, now you are already an angel, brother.\r\nYou left the house a month ago today, we are still waiting for you to come back to have dinner with us. Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Migrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures.

My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me.

The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia. Elias Guzmán holding the portrait of his brother, Victorio Hilario Guzmán, who was making food deliveries on his bike in the Bronx when he was killed in a hit-and-run in the Bronx on September 23. \"Being Indigenous and migrant is difficult because we cannot express ourselves accurately before the institutions, ask for justice, fight for our rights,\" says Elías, a Meꞌphaa Indigenous migrant. Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit.

No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures.

In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me.

The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nAlongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Being part of this community response, giving food or helping others, is a commitment, an act of solidarity and at the same time a way of expressing autonomy: We do not need the government to help us, the communities have known how to do it for more than 500 years.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nThe ongoing struggle for racial justice. The future for immigrant families. The health and well-being of all Americans. The very fate of our fragile planet. The United States faces a crossroads in 2020. Seeking out the stories flying under the national radar , The Nation and Magnum Foundation are partnering on What's At Stake , a series of photo essays from across the country through the lenses of independent imagemakers. Follow the whole series here . This installment was produced with support from the Economic Hardship Reporting Project . W hen the pandemic hit New York City this spring, Próspero Martínez, a Mixe Indigenous migrant from the community of Tlahuitoltepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, began managing a community garden and green roof project at the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The community was experiencing food shortages and many people were losing jobs or having hours cut. People were scared. Polaroid photo of the green roof that Próspero Martinez created.\r\n\r\nText written in the Ayuujk jää'y language by Próspero about his inspiration for the garden: \"Sow and build to preserve the integrity of the universe to which we belong. Coexist as far as our mother earth allows our species. The wisdom of nature gives us the opportunity to interpret what is beautiful at heart. When a seed turns into a flower we state that we exist.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) For Próspero, joining with his neighbors to get through the crisis together just made sense. \"Planting your own food is a way of resisting, of being autonomous-it is what we, Indigenous peoples, have fought all our lives to preserve,\" he told me this summer. \"It is a way to return to our origins, to revalue the work of the campesino , which in the labor hierarchy occupies the last step and, during the pandemic, we saw paradoxically, that he became the 'essential' and yet the most exploited worker.\" Josefina Neponuseno, an Indigenous Nahuatl, hands out groceries at the food pantry at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, where she is a volunteer and cook. \r\n\r\nText written in Nahuatl language and Spanish by Josefina about the pandemic and her experience of mutual aid: \"First I thank God for all the blessings. This pandemic changed the life of the whole world. Many people have died but thank God we are moving on little by little. Being a volunteer is helping others. I don't have money to help but I give my time. Since my mother told me: whenever you can help others do it without discriminating if the person is good or bad. Thus I follow her example. Here in the church we provide food for all the people who need help, because with this pandemic many people were left without work, but with God's blessing we will all get ahead.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) The food distribution network that Próspero is a part of, centered around the Good Shepherd Church, is largely run and led by Indigenous people, and for many like him, the work they are doing to keep their neighbors fed and housed draws heavily on the Indigenous practices they're importing from their home communities. (Full disclosure: My husband is the pastor at Good Shepherd Church, so I have deep connections with this congregation.) Over the course of the pandemic, I have been visiting these centers of mutual support run by Indigenous migrants, photographing their work and talking to them about the importance these practices represent to them. \"I am the musician of the Tecuanes group, I accompany the dance playing a flute and a drum,\" says Jeffrey Perez, a 12-year-old boy who is part of the Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's dance group, which is mostly made up of children born in New York. La danza de los tecuanes, the dance of the jaguar, is a theatrical, Indigenous celebration that fuses magical-religious elements and fertility rites in its portrayal of a group of hunters trying to catch a tecuane, a word which itself is of Nahuatl origin. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Dancer dressed as a jaguar or tecuani during the Mixtec carnival celebration in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. \"In Mixtec mythology there has been a battle between Tecuán and man since pre-Hispanic times, a struggle that is recreated today in the Tecuán dance that stages the persecution, hunt, and death of the Tecuán,\" says Demetrio, an Indigenous Mixtec migrant from Puebla. (Cinthya Santos Briones) When Próspero came to New York City two years ago, he was joining a diverse mix of Mesoamerican Indigenous immigrant communities hailing from the mountains, jungles, and deserts of Mexico and Guatemala. Though not wholly new (Indigenous migrants have been in the United States for as long as the country has existed, and from the 1940s to the '60s, Indigenous manual laborers from southeast and central Mexico worked as peasants in the US under the government's \"Bracero Program\"), the pace of Indigenous migration to the United States has accelerated in recent decades. Indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala have faced new levels of economic precarity and violence in recent decades, which has displaced thousands of Indigenous people from their communities. New York has become a destination for many of them, and the city is now home to Mixes, Totonacos, Mixtecos, Otomís, Tlapanecos, Tepehuas, Amuzgos from Mexico; K'iches, Mams, Kaqchikels and Tz'utujils from Guatemala; Nahua from across Central America; and Quechuas and Aymaras from South America. Each of these peoples come with their own language, culture, identity, gastronomy, religion, oral history, philosophy and worldview that is glossed over or erased in many discussions of Latin American migration to the United States. Natalia Méndez Saavedra is a Mixtec Indigenous migrant from Oaxaca and co-owner with her family of La Morada restaurant in the South Bronx. When the pandemic began, La Morada opened its doors in an act of solidarity with the communities most in need, providing more than 5,000 meals a week. \"This system has taken away everything and even our fear. In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Portrait of the exterior of La Morada. The restaurant has operated for years as both a refuge for undocumented migrants and a cultural and political meeting point in New York City.\r\n\"We have built a space where justice can be smelled and eaten, where our roots as Mixtec Indigenous people can be transmitted,\" Natalia Mendez says. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Zenaida Cantú, a Me'phaa Indigenous migrant from the mountains of Guerrero, is a poet who currently works as an interpreter in immigration courts for immigrants who speak neither English or Spanish. \"It is important to provide adequate interpretation in the courts,\" says Zenaida. \"Through the organization Cielo in California I have been able to be a translator in immigration and family courts in Arizona, New York, and other states; that is a way of contributing and helping my community to keep their families united, to have a fair treatment and not be deported and separated from your loved ones.\"\r\nFor more than 15 years, she has lived in the Bronx with her three children and husband. \"I am teaching my children to speak and write in my language, the Me'phaa, because my mother does not speak Spanish and how are they going to communicate with her?\" Zenaida says.\r\n\r\nPoem in the Indigenous Me'phaa language written by Zenaida. (Cinthya Santos Briones) What many of these peoples share, however, is an idea of reciprocity and mutual support-\"giving, returning and receiving\"-as a social organizing system. These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) \"Weaving in community is resisting\" says Maria, center, with the weaving and embroidery group she runs in Owl's Head Park, Bay Ridge. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Mario Cortés, a Nahua Indigenous migrant from Puebla, dressed as a Mexica warrior from pre-Hispanic times. Mario is a dancer with the Mexica group Cetiliztli Nauhcampa, and has been working as a hairdresser in New York City for years.\r\n\"We believe that a connection exists among all things. The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia. Elias Guzmán holding the portrait of his brother, Victorio Hilario Guzmán, who was making food deliveries on his bike in the Bronx when he was killed in a hit-and-run in the Bronx on September 23. \"Being Indigenous and migrant is difficult because we cannot express ourselves accurately before the institutions, ask for justice, fight for our rights,\" says Elías, a Meꞌphaa Indigenous migrant. Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit. You left us a great void in your departure, but we will always carry you in our hearts. This is not a goodbye. Rest in peace, now you are already an angel, brother.\r\nYou left the house a month ago today, we are still waiting for you to come back to have dinner with us. Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Migrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city.

Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit. You left us a great void in your departure, but we will always carry you in our hearts. This is not a goodbye. Rest in peace, now you are already an angel, brother.\r\nYou left the house a month ago today, we are still waiting for you to come back to have dinner with us. Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Migrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures.

She wears a very expensive traditional costume, valued at 5,000 quetzales. The costume that an Indigenous Ki'che' woman wears has multiple meanings like the white blouse, which is peace, purity, beauty. The cords that are used to tie your hair signify respect and make your hair grow. The sash has various drawings as flowers, roses, animals such as birds, doves, that stand for peace on earth for the Ki'che' woman. Flowers on the skirt means nature and the heavens, the animals are the colors of the forest, of the jungle, of the mountain. The necklaces that the Indigenous woman wears are black and red, which are sacred colors.

Coexist as far as our mother earth allows our species. The wisdom of nature gives us the opportunity to interpret what is beautiful at heart. When a seed turns into a flower we state that we exist.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nFor Próspero, joining with his neighbors to get through the crisis together just made sense. \"Planting your own food is a way of resisting, of being autonomous-it is what we, Indigenous peoples, have fought all our lives to preserve,\" he told me this summer. \"It is a way to return to our origins, to revalue the work of the campesino , which in the labor hierarchy occupies the last step and, during the pandemic, we saw paradoxically, that he became the 'essential' and yet the most exploited worker.\" Josefina Neponuseno, an Indigenous Nahuatl, hands out groceries at the food pantry at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, where she is a volunteer and cook. \r\n\r\nText written in Nahuatl language and Spanish by Josefina about the pandemic and her experience of mutual aid: \"First I thank God for all the blessings. This pandemic changed the life of the whole world. Many people have died but thank God we are moving on little by little. Being a volunteer is helping others. I don't have money to help but I give my time. Since my mother told me: whenever you can help others do it without discriminating if the person is good or bad. Thus I follow her example. Here in the church we provide food for all the people who need help, because with this pandemic many people were left without work, but with God's blessing we will all get ahead.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) The food distribution network that Próspero is a part of, centered around the Good Shepherd Church, is largely run and led by Indigenous people, and for many like him, the work they are doing to keep their neighbors fed and housed draws heavily on the Indigenous practices they're importing from their home communities. (Full disclosure: My husband is the pastor at Good Shepherd Church, so I have deep connections with this congregation.) Over the course of the pandemic, I have been visiting these centers of mutual support run by Indigenous migrants, photographing their work and talking to them about the importance these practices represent to them. \"I am the musician of the Tecuanes group, I accompany the dance playing a flute and a drum,\" says Jeffrey Perez, a 12-year-old boy who is part of the Los Tecuanes de San Juan Bautista's dance group, which is mostly made up of children born in New York. La danza de los tecuanes, the dance of the jaguar, is a theatrical, Indigenous celebration that fuses magical-religious elements and fertility rites in its portrayal of a group of hunters trying to catch a tecuane, a word which itself is of Nahuatl origin.

(Cinthya Santos Briones) When Próspero came to New York City two years ago, he was joining a diverse mix of Mesoamerican Indigenous immigrant communities hailing from the mountains, jungles, and deserts of Mexico and Guatemala. Though not wholly new (Indigenous migrants have been in the United States for as long as the country has existed, and from the 1940s to the '60s, Indigenous manual laborers from southeast and central Mexico worked as peasants in the US under the government's \"Bracero Program\"), the pace of Indigenous migration to the United States has accelerated in recent decades. Indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala have faced new levels of economic precarity and violence in recent decades, which has displaced thousands of Indigenous people from their communities. New York has become a destination for many of them, and the city is now home to Mixes, Totonacos, Mixtecos, Otomís, Tlapanecos, Tepehuas, Amuzgos from Mexico; K'iches, Mams, Kaqchikels and Tz'utujils from Guatemala; Nahua from across Central America; and Quechuas and Aymaras from South America. Each of these peoples come with their own language, culture, identity, gastronomy, religion, oral history, philosophy and worldview that is glossed over or erased in many discussions of Latin American migration to the United States. Natalia Méndez Saavedra is a Mixtec Indigenous migrant from Oaxaca and co-owner with her family of La Morada restaurant in the South Bronx. When the pandemic began, La Morada opened its doors in an act of solidarity with the communities most in need, providing more than 5,000 meals a week. \"This system has taken away everything and even our fear. In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Portrait of the exterior of La Morada. The restaurant has operated for years as both a refuge for undocumented migrants and a cultural and political meeting point in New York City.\r\n\"We have built a space where justice can be smelled and eaten, where our roots as Mixtec Indigenous people can be transmitted,\" Natalia Mendez says. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Zenaida Cantú, a Me'phaa Indigenous migrant from the mountains of Guerrero, is a poet who currently works as an interpreter in immigration courts for immigrants who speak neither English or Spanish. \"It is important to provide adequate interpretation in the courts,\" says Zenaida. \"Through the organization Cielo in California I have been able to be a translator in immigration and family courts in Arizona, New York, and other states; that is a way of contributing and helping my community to keep their families united, to have a fair treatment and not be deported and separated from your loved ones.\"\r\nFor more than 15 years, she has lived in the Bronx with her three children and husband. \"I am teaching my children to speak and write in my language, the Me'phaa, because my mother does not speak Spanish and how are they going to communicate with her?\" Zenaida says.\r\n\r\nPoem in the Indigenous Me'phaa language written by Zenaida. (Cinthya Santos Briones) What many of these peoples share, however, is an idea of reciprocity and mutual support-\"giving, returning and receiving\"-as a social organizing system. These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) \"Weaving in community is resisting\" says Maria, center, with the weaving and embroidery group she runs in Owl's Head Park, Bay Ridge. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Mario Cortés, a Nahua Indigenous migrant from Puebla, dressed as a Mexica warrior from pre-Hispanic times. Mario is a dancer with the Mexica group Cetiliztli Nauhcampa, and has been working as a hairdresser in New York City for years.\r\n\"We believe that a connection exists among all things. The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia.

When the pandemic began, La Morada opened its doors in an act of solidarity with the communities most in need, providing more than 5,000 meals a week. \"This system has taken away everything and even our fear. In this crisis, we do not mind dying because our spirit and values as a family is to fight for equality, social justice, and human rights. To facilitate a place that the most needy can call home and thus to respond to this crisis as we as Indigenous people have always done,\" Natalia told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Portrait of the exterior of La Morada. The restaurant has operated for years as both a refuge for undocumented migrants and a cultural and political meeting point in New York City.\r\n\"We have built a space where justice can be smelled and eaten, where our roots as Mixtec Indigenous people can be transmitted,\" Natalia Mendez says. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Zenaida Cantú, a Me'phaa Indigenous migrant from the mountains of Guerrero, is a poet who currently works as an interpreter in immigration courts for immigrants who speak neither English or Spanish. \"It is important to provide adequate interpretation in the courts,\" says Zenaida. \"Through the organization Cielo in California I have been able to be a translator in immigration and family courts in Arizona, New York, and other states; that is a way of contributing and helping my community to keep their families united, to have a fair treatment and not be deported and separated from your loved ones.\"\r\nFor more than 15 years, she has lived in the Bronx with her three children and husband. \"I am teaching my children to speak and write in my language, the Me'phaa, because my mother does not speak Spanish and how are they going to communicate with her?\" Zenaida says.\r\n\r\nPoem in the Indigenous Me'phaa language written by Zenaida. (Cinthya Santos Briones) What many of these peoples share, however, is an idea of reciprocity and mutual support-\"giving, returning and receiving\"-as a social organizing system. These concepts and practices are embodied in words and phrases like tequio , faena , la mano vuela , mayordomías , and compadrazgo , concepts that have no direct translation in English but that all imply an individual's responsibilities to the collective, and the obligations that come with being part of a community. I've been working with and photographing Indigenous communities for over a decade, and this work has been grounded in a personal search for my own roots. My paternal family are Nahua from the community of Ahila Pahuatlán Puebla, Mexico, for years I lived in Indigenous Otomí, Nahua, Téenek, and Tepehua communities in Mexico, and when I first came to New York in 2011, I lived in an Otomí community in Queens. These experiences have led me to work as a community organizer with Indigenous K'iche', Nahua, Otomí, Tepehua, and Tlapaneco communities in New York, creating long-standing ties of friendship and kinship. \"Weaving is a way of healing, being in community with women and empowering ourselves,\" says Maria José Prudente, an Indigenous Tu'u savi  migrant from the community of Yerba Santa, Guerrero, Mexico, who runs a collective weaving and embroidery group in which she teaches Indigenous women how to weave while speaking about social justice, domestic violence, and economic autonomy. \r\nDuring the pandemic, María José decided to start an audiovisual radio program in the Mixteco language, \"Telling stories in Tu'u savi,\" through Facebook, with the aim of preserving the language, rescuing memory, and using this platform to talk about problems and find collective solutions to the issues facing her community. \"I consider myself an Indigenous feminist and through my skill as a cultural promoter and community organizer I want to provide legal, economic, and social tools to the women of my community so that they can get ahead and discover their power,\" she told me. (Cinthya Santos Briones) \"Weaving in community is resisting\" says Maria, center, with the weaving and embroidery group she runs in Owl's Head Park, Bay Ridge. (Cinthya Santos Briones) Mario Cortés, a Nahua Indigenous migrant from Puebla, dressed as a Mexica warrior from pre-Hispanic times. Mario is a dancer with the Mexica group Cetiliztli Nauhcampa, and has been working as a hairdresser in New York City for years.\r\n\"We believe that a connection exists among all things. The Mexica people, like the many other Native nations from the Americas, have a rich culture in which the principle of interconnectedness is central. Through our prayers in the form of dances, songs and ceremonies we honor this principle. Our circle and its dances represent the circle of life and all that is found on Mother Earth. It is our duty to keep these traditions alive and for future generations to do the same. In keeping the energy of this vision flowing, the Indigenous people of this continent, as all of humanity, will be able to heal and reestablish a connection between our spirit and the Mother Earth.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) So when it came to documenting Indigenous communities during the pandemic, I wanted to draw upon the ethic of mutual support that guides many of these communities. To make these portraits, I used the approach that guides all my work: Through collaboration, I asked how they wanted to be represented, and worked with them to create images that reflected what they wanted to express about their identities and their lives. This more horizontal, anti-hierarchical approach to image making is driven by my desire to create work collectively, in community with the people represented, in an effort to more accurately represent what Indigenous migrants consider to be important to them. This mode of engagement stands in stark contrast to the way these non-Latino immigrants are treated by the institutions that exert outsize influence on their lives, be they the courts, the migration system, hospitals or other institutions that fail to recognize the diversity-linguistic and otherwise-of Indigenous migrants. Many Indigenous migrants work low-paid and dangerous jobs, including as delivery workers, carwasheros, nannies, domestic workers, and day laborers, making them particularly vulnerable during this time. As the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the fact that many of these migrants are also categorized as \"undocumented\" by a government that has existed for less than 250 years is another nonsensical affront to the enduring resilience of peoples who have made their lives and developed their cultures here for millennia. Elias Guzmán holding the portrait of his brother, Victorio Hilario Guzmán, who was making food deliveries on his bike in the Bronx when he was killed in a hit-and-run in the Bronx on September 23. \"Being Indigenous and migrant is difficult because we cannot express ourselves accurately before the institutions, ask for justice, fight for our rights,\" says Elías, a Meꞌphaa Indigenous migrant. Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) A photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit.

Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Migrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones) Alongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures.

Following his brother's death, Elias organized, together with his family and community, a series of protests and vigils in a political act of saying: \"Here we are, the Indigenous migrants, we deliver food to their tables. Yes, we are essential workers with many dreams.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nA photo of the memorial and offering to Victorio Hilario Guzmán, with text by Elias: \"Lord, into your hands I commend his spirit. You left us a great void in your departure, but we will always carry you in our hearts. This is not a goodbye. Rest in peace, now you are already an angel, brother.\r\nYou left the house a month ago today, we are still waiting for you to come back to have dinner with us. Your bed is still empty, just as you left it that day when you left the house. We need you. But we know that you will never come back. Now you are in a better place, you suffered for a while. We will always suffer.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nMigrants from Guerrero, Mexico, protest the death of Victorio Hilario Guzman on 180th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx with banners written in their Me'phaa Indigenous language. The banners say: \"Enough of impunity, we want justice, not one more dead, justice for delivery workers.\" \"We want justice for Victorio Hilario Guzman. No more impunity, not one more killed.\" (Cinthya Santos Briones)\n\nAlongside the portraits, I asked people to write, in their own Indigenous language, what they wanted the world to read. Their messages reveal the struggles they face, the ways they adapt to a system that holds them in low regard, and the way they are thriving in their adopted city. From soup kitchens to Indigenous-language radio programs, green roofs to sports clubs, embroidery classes to community organizing drives, the diversity of efforts Indigenous migrants are currently leading points to the ways they are making New York City their own. These photos, then, represent a fraction of the efforts underway across the city to build and sustain vibrant Indigenous cultures.

She longs to be around her community in the western highlands of Totonicapán, Guatemala, immersing herself in the sacred communal forest she'd been taught to love, respect, and protect since she was a young child. The forest of Totonicapán is not only one of the most important water recharge sites of Mesoamerica; it's also a symbol of the collective fight of K'iche communities against a colonial Guatemalan state that has repeatedly attempted to seize and destroy it. \"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says. The word K'iche literally translates to \"a lot of trees.\" \"That's what we are,\" she says. In the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it. Supporters of Guatemalan candidate for the Movimiento para la Liberación de los Pueblos (Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples) party Thelma Cabrera take part in a campaign closing rally at Plaza de la Constitucion in Guatemala City on June 8, 2019. (JOHAN ORDONEZ / AFP via Getty Images) Ixchíu is a community journalist, artist, architect and feminist advocate. She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong. People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nThe forest of Totonicapán is not only one of the most important water recharge sites of Mesoamerica; it's also a symbol of the collective fight of K'iche communities against a colonial Guatemalan state that has repeatedly attempted to seize and destroy it. \"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says.

She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\n\"We, as K'iche people, recognize the trees as our ancestors,\" Ixchíu says. The word K'iche literally translates to \"a lot of trees.\" \"That's what we are,\" she says. In the last roughly two decades, illegal logging-facilitated by criminal structures and the government-has increasingly threatened the forest's survival and the livelihoods of the local communities that guard it.

She fled Guatemala in 2021, after nearly 10 years of ongoing harassment and death threats from criminal organizations, culminating in an assassination attempt in September 2020 . On that day, she was documenting illegal logging in the forest of Totonicapán with her sisters, Andrea and Gabriela Ixchíu, and her partner, Carlos Ernesto Cano-all journalists and members of the collective Festivales Solidarios -as well as staff from Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas and other local forest defenders. They were ambushed and badly injured by assailants armed with machetes after they confronted a group of men who were illegally smuggling tree wood out of the forest. Guatemalan authorities did nothing after the attack. This violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong.

But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists.

What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\nThis violence is happening across Indigenous territories in Guatemala. In El Estor, Izabal, Q'eqchi' communities continue to resist a destructive nickel mine despite growing state militarization, killings, and arrests. And in the region of Quiché, Ixil Indigenous leaders are fighting against hydroelectric dams, illegal logging, and deforestation under the same threats. \"What forced me to leave are the multiple forms of violence that target us as Indigenous women, and that [Guatemala] has normalized in our daily lives,\" Ixchíu says from a phone call in Spain, where she and Cano were granted political asylum last year. \"Right before I fled Guatemala, I was forced to live in a safe house, and I understood that if I wanted to stay, it was going to have to be in silence and in hiding, when I didn't do anything wrong. People are leaving because our lives are in danger.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Current Issue View our current issue As Guatemala gears up for a presidential election this year, many had placed their hope on candidate Thelma Cabrera , a Maya Mam leader, human rights and environmental defender, of the political party the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples (MLP). But both Cabrera and her running mate, the exiled former Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordán Rodas, were blocked from the ballot by Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) in February. The Constitutional Court upheld that decision . The MLP filed a challenge with Guatemala's Supreme Court of Justice in mid-March, with less than a week left before the registration period for June's election is officially closed on March 25 . Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in support of Cabrera and Rodas, who also brought their fight internationally last month when they met with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C. \"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\n\"Guatemala still lives in a dictatorship. Democracy is almost nonexistent,\" Ixchíu says. \"The root of the structural problems that exist in the country won't be resolved with an election every four years. But they can be the beginning of those structural changes that we Indigenous people have been fighting for, for more than 530 years.\" In the 2019 presidential election, Cabrera ended up in fourth place among the dozen-plus candidates that ran that year. But MLP maintains that the results of that election were fraudulent, and that many polls and vote counts actually showed that Cabrera received enough support to make it to the runoff election where two final candidates face off. Right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei ultimately won the election that year. \"Our movement arose from within the communities that have been excluded in this country, some of the most impoverished,\" says Neftalí López, who ran as Cabrera's vice presidential candidate in 2019. He and Cabrera are also leading members of the Comité de Desarrollo Campesino (Committee for Peasant Development), or CODECA . \"We organized the people and went from a peasant organization to becoming a sociopolitical movement.\" The 2023 Guatemalan election is taking place during a precarious time of heightened repression in the country, with nearly all political, public and judicial institutions gripped by corrupt figures. This includes Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal which last August announced a collaboration with the military for the transfer of information, data, and documents surrounding the elections. A move that's extremely concerning given the Guatemalan military's history of political fraud, massacres, and coups. It's no surprise to López, Ixchíu and others that the TSE, without objection, approved the presidential candidacy of Zury Ríos, the daughter of Efraín Ríos Montt, the now-deceased US-backed dictator who seized power in a military coup in 1982, during Guatemala's 36-year conflict, and who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Zury Ríos was blocked from running in 2019 because the Constitution prohibits those who came to power by a coup, as well as their blood relatives, from running for president. \"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm. Communities are displaced, the air, soil and water polluted, while those who interfere in defense of the people and the earth are persecuted and killed. Extractive capitalism has thrived under this system-historically with the backing of the United States. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City.

They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire .

(Courtesy of Lucia Ixchíu) \"We know that equipment donated by the US Defense Department has been used to repress Guatemalan citizens...to commit human rights abuses,\" says Giovanni Batz, an assistant professor at UC Santa Barbara, whose book La Cuarta Invasión (The Fourth Invasion), documents centuries of Maya Ixil resistance against colonialism and megaprojects. \"When the US tries to 'combat' migration, what that means is more militarization through aid that's being misused, or they align themselves with very powerful families who have committed a lot of violence against the people,\" Batz says. \"This is a clear demonstration of where US interests are: arming the Guatemalan state to the teeth. They use the discourses of combating narco trafficking and gang violence. But at the end of the day, it's people like Lucía, it's other activists, environmentalists who are persecuted.\" Last year, Global Witness reported that at least 80 environmental defenders were killed in Guatemala between 2012 and 2021. Dozens of other dissident voices have fled, been detained, or are facing judicial persecution. (Just last week, Orlando Salvador López, the prosecutor who brought Ríos Montt to trial for genocide in 2013, was arrested .) Ixchíu is part of a new generation of exiles-human rights defenders, Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, anti-corruption prosecutors , and journalists-who've been criminalized and forced out of Guatemala in recent years, particularly since the expulsion of the UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, in 2019 . Her first experience with displacement was in 2012, the year Guatemalan soldiers killed seven K'iche environmental defenders and wounded dozens of others who were part of a peaceful highway blockade protesting high electricity costs and attacks on local education. What became known as the massacre of La Cumbre de Alaska , was the first documented case of extrajudicial killings carried out by the military in a supposed post-conflict Guatemala . \"This is the reason why I became a journalist and an activist,\" she says. The threats and harassment against Ixchíu intensified after that. \"The war never ended and we're the ones documenting that.\" Ixchíu left for Guatemala City after the massacre. She enrolled at the public San Carlos University, where she became the first Indigenous woman to lead the student body in the architecture faculty, and got involved in the student movement. She and other young activists were at the forefront of mass protests in 2015 that led to the resignation and jailing of former president Otto Pérez Molina and vice president Roxana Baldetti over their involvement in a multimillion-dollar fraud and bribery scheme. CICIG's extensive corruption investigations also led to the prosecution of dozens of other prominent government officials, including Congress members, and hundreds of other landmark cases. After the government of former president Jimmy Morales ousted CICIG, the Guatemalan state unleashed a furious campaign of retaliation against activists involved in the 2015 mobilizations and their aftermath, Indigenous leaders, anti-corruption judges and prosecutors who worked with CICIG, as well as journalists . Ixchíu says many of the student activists she led marches with in 2015 are now living in exile. Lucia Ixchíu at a protest in Guatemala City. (Courtesy of Lucía Ixchíu) The assaults only worsened under Giammattei's presidency, whose first year in office also saw the arrival of a pandemic that government neglect and abuse made catastrophic for Guatemala . Rather than fortifying the health care system, clinics and hospitals collapsed. The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine was a mess. Femicides and violence against women and girls grew. Extreme poverty and malnourishment also skyrocketed , while Giammattei used the lockdown as a tool to further militarize the streets and borders. \"And this awoke great indignation among the people,\" Ixchíu says. \"The state wants us to feel hunger because they don't want us to be able to think.\" On November 21, 2020, after Guatemala's Congress approved a budget that proposed cuts to funding for health care and education, thousands of protesters flooded the streets. \"People's indignation was legitimate,\" Ixchíu says. Riot police arrested dozens of people that day. At least two protesters lost an eye after being assaulted by police. A portion of Congress was sent on fire . Authorities quickly blamed protesters, but Ixchíu and others believe the blaze was actually instigated by government infiltrators to help build criminal cases against activists. Just two months before the November protest, Ixchíu had survived the assassination attempt in Totonicapán. After the fire, the threats and police harassment only intensified, forcing her to go into hiding until she clandestinely left Guatemala in 2021. She says she wasn't willing to bet her future on a racist and corrupt judicial system in a country like Guatemala \"where prison is torture.\" Ixchíu is also critical of many social justice movements centered in Guatemala City, which she says have perpetuated racism and sexism, and have turned their backs on Indigenous women activists and journalists like her. The memories of her family and the community that nurtured her give her strength. Through their work with Festivales Solidarios, Ixchíu, her sisters, Andrea-who's also exiled-and Gabriela, and many others living in Guatemala and in exile, have centered storytelling, art, dance, the preservation of ancestral traditions and knowledge as part of their ongoing communal resistance. But Ixchíu says joy and celebration are also part of this fight. \"I miss my family, I miss my territory, I miss the trees, I miss the food, I miss communal art, I miss my friends,\" Ixchíu says. \"Now, I'm a stranger in a new place, starting from zero. But I've also learned that being an exiled woman doesn't mean that my life and happiness should end.\"\n\n\"They blocked our binomial because the powerful elite sectors of this country are afraid of us-the oligarchy and the corrupt political class that protects the status quo,\" López says. \"But this isn't about one election or a candidacy. Our movement and our initiatives go far beyond the electoral process. If they don't let us participate now, we will come back. We have an avalanche of support that's impossible to stop.\" A priority for MLP is to create a plurinational state that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty, protects human rights and the environment, and that ends decades of corrupt agreements between political and business elites, and the multinational corporations that continue to loot and exploit Indigenous territories with mines, hydroelectric dams, and monocrops like African palm.

(AP Photo / John Locher)\n\nWhen Paulette Jordan entered the race for governor of Idaho, there were plenty of pundits who tried to write off the Native American legislator from a district that's much closer to Canada than to Boise. In an overwhelmingly white, very conservative, very Republican state, she was an indigenous woman running as a progressive Democrat. Her more centrist opponent in the party primary was a wealthy businessman who had statewide name recognition, having headed the Democratic ticket four years earlier. But Jordan was undaunted. She had served two terms in the Legislature representing a historically Republican region of Idaho's northern panhandle-beating a Republican incumbent in the GOP \"wave\" election of 2014 and retaining her seat in the \"Trump wave\" election of 2016 , which saw a number of the state's Democratic legislators defeated. Jordan launched her gubernatorial campaign with a fierce sense of urgency, declaring that \"the system is so corrupt that we have to fix it.\" She refused to play the games of conventional politics. In a state that has never elected a woman governor, she aligned herself with a progressive woman who was running for lieutenant governor, Kristin Collum , and formed the state's first all-female ticket for a major-party nomination. \"We are two progressive women who are very strong-minded,\" announced Jordan, who refused to be dismayed when a number of prominent Democrats backed her male opponent in the primary. \"People just aren't used to thinking that a woman of color, or a woman period, can win,\" she told interviewers. \"Even people in the Democratic Party, they aren't used to envisioning a woman at the top. Yet there are Republican women who know we can get there. There are progressive women in our state who know we can get there. Being young and vibrant and fresh, that plays into a new, bold vision and strong leadership.\" Jordan was confident she could break through. And so she did. In Tuesday's primary, she won with almost 60 percent of the vote and told the cheering crowd at her victory party, \"We are not afraid, and never again will we stand down.\" There is no question that Jordan faces an uphill race in the fall. But she has a plan for running a truly statewide campaign that goes deep into the rural regions of Idaho. \"It's about connections to the land and people,\" says the candidate, who from the start of this campaign has emphasized her rural roots. Raised in a family of farmers and ranchers, this member of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe still resides in Plummer, Idaho, population 1,017. And she speaks about her ranching roots in a language that speaks to rural voters. \"It's more than just the process of ranching and being part of the ag community. It's what it means to be a rancher or an agriculturalist,\" says Jordan. \"It's sustainability. It's defending your family and your way of life. When I talk about protecting my future generations, that resonates. When I talk about protecting the land, that resonates.\" When People's Action gathered grassroots activists from across the country in Washington, DC, for an April summit on building a progressive movement in rural and small-town America, Jordan was a featured speaker. And rightly so. She understands-as do the savvy leaders of People's Action -what many top Democrats do not quite get. She knows that Democrats must reach out to rural voters. And she understands the importance of doing so with a progressive populist vision. Connecting with rural voters does not require a lurch to the center, which would further deplete a Democratic Party that in many parts of the country is already running on fumes. The devastating defeats in 2014 and 2016 have left too many Democratic \"strategists\" imagining that rural America is so conservative that the party must trim its ideological sails in order to compete. But they're forgetting that states like Idaho have progressive histories-visionary senators such as William Borah, Glen Taylor, and Frank Church once represented Idaho as bold defenders of civil liberties, worker rights, and enlightened internationalism-and that those histories extended from rural populist traditions that can and must be renewed. After so many years of neglect in so many states, the renewal will be difficult. As Jordan notes, she hails from \"a very conservative part of my state. We have white supremacists in our neighborhood.\" But that conservative part of the state elected her to the Legislature as an indigenous woman who challenges corporate power and political corruption. That's a reminder of what is possible when Democrats start thinking seriously about reaching out to the whole of rural America-and in so doing to the whole of America-with a message that is economically and socially progressive. Democratic leaders in Washington often become lost in a reverie about reconnecting with the rural \"white working class,\" forgetting that 25 percent of African Americans live in the small cities, towns, and rural counties of blue and red states; that the Asian-American population of rural communities grew by 37 percent between 2000 and 2010; that the Hispanic population of rural communities grew by 46 percent during the same period; and that 54 percent of Native Americans live in rural counties. Few DC Democrats bother to acknowledge that rural millennials embraced Bernie Sanders with the same fervor as did their college-town counterparts. Sanders won 78 percent of the vote in Idaho's 2016 caucuses, carrying 43 of the state's 44 counties and sweeping rural areas. And he did so as a democratic socialist running on a boldly progressive, boldly populist platform. In Tuesday's gubernatorial primary, Jordan won the vast majority of Idaho counties-including several rural counties that she took with over 70 percent of the vote. Yes, it will be harder in November. Idaho has, of late, been a very Republican, very \"red\" state. But an Idaho Democrat (State Superintendent of Public Instruction Marilyn Howard) held a statewide elected post until 2006, and another Democrat (Walt Minnick) held an Idaho congressional seat until 2011. Both won by running campaigns aimed at securing urban and rural votes. If Democrats are serious about rebuilding their party as a truly national force, they are going to have to focus on red states-and on rural areas within red and blue states. And they are going to have to recognize the potential of candidates such as Paulette Jordan, who know that Democrats can speak to \"true rural values\" and that a winning \"progressivism... is possible\"-in Idaho and in states across the country.\n\nIn an overwhelmingly white, very conservative, very Republican state, she was an indigenous woman running as a progressive Democrat. Her more centrist opponent in the party primary was a wealthy businessman who had statewide name recognition, having headed the Democratic ticket four years earlier. But Jordan was undaunted.

And she speaks about her ranching roots in a language that speaks to rural voters. \"It's more than just the process of ranching and being part of the ag community. It's what it means to be a rancher or an agriculturalist,\" says Jordan. \"It's sustainability. It's defending your family and your way of life. When I talk about protecting my future generations, that resonates. When I talk about protecting the land, that resonates.\" When People's Action gathered grassroots activists from across the country in Washington, DC, for an April summit on building a progressive movement in rural and small-town America, Jordan was a featured speaker. And rightly so. She understands-as do the savvy leaders of People's Action -what many top Democrats do not quite get. She knows that Democrats must reach out to rural voters. And she understands the importance of doing so with a progressive populist vision. Connecting with rural voters does not require a lurch to the center, which would further deplete a Democratic Party that in many parts of the country is already running on fumes. The devastating defeats in 2014 and 2016 have left too many Democratic \"strategists\" imagining that rural America is so conservative that the party must trim its ideological sails in order to compete. But they're forgetting that states like Idaho have progressive histories-visionary senators such as William Borah, Glen Taylor, and Frank Church once represented Idaho as bold defenders of civil liberties, worker rights, and enlightened internationalism-and that those histories extended from rural populist traditions that can and must be renewed. After so many years of neglect in so many states, the renewal will be difficult. As Jordan notes, she hails from \"a very conservative part of my state. We have white supremacists in our neighborhood.\" But that conservative part of the state elected her to the Legislature as an indigenous woman who challenges corporate power and political corruption. That's a reminder of what is possible when Democrats start thinking seriously about reaching out to the whole of rural America-and in so doing to the whole of America-with a message that is economically and socially progressive. Democratic leaders in Washington often become lost in a reverie about reconnecting with the rural \"white working class,\" forgetting that 25 percent of African Americans live in the small cities, towns, and rural counties of blue and red states; that the Asian-American population of rural communities grew by 37 percent between 2000 and 2010; that the Hispanic population of rural communities grew by 46 percent during the same period; and that 54 percent of Native Americans live in rural counties. Few DC Democrats bother to acknowledge that rural millennials embraced Bernie Sanders with the same fervor as did their college-town counterparts. Sanders won 78 percent of the vote in Idaho's 2016 caucuses, carrying 43 of the state's 44 counties and sweeping rural areas. And he did so as a democratic socialist running on a boldly progressive, boldly populist platform. In Tuesday's gubernatorial primary, Jordan won the vast majority of Idaho counties-including several rural counties that she took with over 70 percent of the vote. Yes, it will be harder in November. Idaho has, of late, been a very Republican, very \"red\" state. But an Idaho Democrat (State Superintendent of Public Instruction Marilyn Howard) held a statewide elected post until 2006, and another Democrat (Walt Minnick) held an Idaho congressional seat until 2011. Both won by running campaigns aimed at securing urban and rural votes. If Democrats are serious about rebuilding their party as a truly national force, they are going to have to focus on red states-and on rural areas within red and blue states. And they are going to have to recognize the potential of candidates such as Paulette Jordan, who know that Democrats can speak to \"true rural values\" and that a winning \"progressivism... is possible\"-in Idaho and in states across the country.\n\nBut Jordan was undaunted. She had served two terms in the Legislature representing a historically Republican region of Idaho's northern panhandle-beating a Republican incumbent in the GOP \"wave\" election of 2014 and retaining her seat in the \"Trump wave\" election of 2016 , which saw a number of the state's Democratic legislators defeated. Jordan launched her gubernatorial campaign with a fierce sense of urgency, declaring that \"the system is so corrupt that we have to fix it.\" She refused to play the games of conventional politics. In a state that has never elected a woman governor, she aligned herself with a progressive woman who was running for lieutenant governor, Kristin Collum , and formed the state's first all-female ticket for a major-party nomination. \"We are two progressive women who are very strong-minded,\" announced Jordan, who refused to be dismayed when a number of prominent Democrats backed her male opponent in the primary. \"People just aren't used to thinking that a woman of color, or a woman period, can win,\" she told interviewers. \"Even people in the Democratic Party, they aren't used to envisioning a woman at the top. Yet there are Republican women who know we can get there. There are progressive women in our state who know we can get there. Being young and vibrant and fresh, that plays into a new, bold vision and strong leadership.\" Jordan was confident she could break through. And so she did. In Tuesday's primary, she won with almost 60 percent of the vote and told the cheering crowd at her victory party, \"We are not afraid, and never again will we stand down.\" There is no question that Jordan faces an uphill race in the fall.

Sanders won 78 percent of the vote in Idaho's 2016 caucuses, carrying 43 of the state's 44 counties and sweeping rural areas. And he did so as a democratic socialist running on a boldly progressive, boldly populist platform. In Tuesday's gubernatorial primary, Jordan won the vast majority of Idaho counties-including several rural counties that she took with over 70 percent of the vote. Yes, it will be harder in November. Idaho has, of late, been a very Republican, very \"red\" state. But an Idaho Democrat (State Superintendent of Public Instruction Marilyn Howard) held a statewide elected post until 2006, and another Democrat (Walt Minnick) held an Idaho congressional seat until 2011. Both won by running campaigns aimed at securing urban and rural votes. If Democrats are serious about rebuilding their party as a truly national force, they are going to have to focus on red states-and on rural areas within red and blue states. And they are going to have to recognize the potential of candidates such as Paulette Jordan, who know that Democrats can speak to \"true rural values\" and that a winning \"progressivism... is possible\"-in Idaho and in states across the country.\n\nConnecting with rural voters does not require a lurch to the center, which would further deplete a Democratic Party that in many parts of the country is already running on fumes. The devastating defeats in 2014 and 2016 have left too many Democratic \"strategists\" imagining that rural America is so conservative that the party must trim its ideological sails in order to compete. But they're forgetting that states like Idaho have progressive histories-visionary senators such as William Borah, Glen Taylor, and Frank Church once represented Idaho as bold defenders of civil liberties, worker rights, and enlightened internationalism-and that those histories extended from rural populist traditions that can and must be renewed. After so many years of neglect in so many states, the renewal will be difficult. As Jordan notes, she hails from \"a very conservative part of my state. We have white supremacists in our neighborhood.\" But that conservative part of the state elected her to the Legislature as an indigenous woman who challenges corporate power and political corruption. That's a reminder of what is possible when Democrats start thinking seriously about reaching out to the whole of rural America-and in so doing to the whole of America-with a message that is economically and socially progressive.

(Michael Anaya-Gorman)\n\nOn a February evening, Deb Haaland, Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico's first district and a member of the Turquoise clan of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, addressed a crowd of supporters packed shoulder to shoulder in a Capitol Hill brownstone. With stairs as a pulpit, Haaland rested a forearm on the bannister and leaned into her stump speech. \"I am the only candidate who went to Standing Rock to stand with the Water Protectors,\" Haaland said to cheers from the crowd. \"There have been more than 10,000 members of Congress-but never a Native American woman.\" 1 Two months later and just a few blocks away, Paulette Jordan, Democratic candidate for Governor of Idaho, spoke to a crowd of about 30 supporters gathered at the National Indian Gaming Association headquarters. \"We want to make history,\" she said to the attorneys and advocates circled round. \"But we also want to make change.\" 2 Related Articles After Stunning Democratic Win, North Dakota Republicans Suppressed the Native American Vote Roey Hadar PHOTOS: Since Standing Rock, 56 Bills Have Been Introduced in 30 States to Restrict Protests Zoë Carpenter and Tracie Williams In some ways these Capitol Hill functions were unremarkable-modest meet-and-greet fundraisers in an election cycle full of them. But they represented an historic moment. If Haaland wins her tightly contested primary in her heavily Democratic district, she has a strong chance of becoming the first Native woman elected to Congress-one out of 10,945 members in United States history. Jordan, a citizen of the Coeur d'Alene tribe in Idaho and descendant of the Yakama, Colville and Nez Perce, faces longer odds. But if she wins her May 15 primary and then the election in November, she would become the first-ever Indigenous woman elected governor in the United States. 3 Haaland and Jordan are riding a wave of post-Standing Rock organizing that's aimed at helping Native women win elections. In all there are five Native women running for Congress, four running for governors' offices and 46 running for state legislature, according to data compiled by Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today. These trailblazing campaigns mark the arrival of this nation's first peoples-and particularly first women-at the doorstep of the halls of power. 4 \"It gives me hope,\" said Vivienna Orcutt, a councilwoman from the Hoopa Valley tribe in California. \"It gives me hope for my daughters. It gives me hope for the young women in Indian Country.\" Orcutt brought a group of Native women to Haaland's event and, after hearing her speak, decided to get involved in the campaign. She's now a dedicated volunteer who spends nights and weekends sending emails and making phone calls in the hope that come 2019, Haaland will be delivering speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives. 5 Supporters like Orcutt-the people hosting fundraisers and mobilizing voters across Indian Country- are themselves an important part of this story. Overlooked and underestimated, Native communities across the continent have organized grassroots networks amidst deep social and economic inequality: Native people are the most likely to be killed by law enforcement and rank among the poorest of this nation's poor. 6 The tribal leaders, lawyers, and activists showing up for Haaland, Jordan and other candidates cut their teeth during decades of hard-fought battles for Native rights. On my way into Haaland's fundraiser, for example, I ran into a woman from the Nisqually tribe, a community in Washington that led protests and legal battles to secure treaty rights to the Northwest coast fishery for two straight decades, through the 1960s and 1970s. Inside, I shook hands with an elder from Nambé Pueblo, one of the 19 pueblo communities who re-took control of their education systems. Today, the All Indian Pueblo Council operates the Santa Fe Indian School, where former First Lady Michelle Obama spoke in 2016 and where my little sister is a junior in high school. 7 There is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. In the wake of Standing Rock, the largest Indigenous protest in United States history, many of those activists have turned their attention to elections-and they're applying lessons learned from decades of organizing around treaty rights, casinos, and pipelines. Among the Native leaders I talked to for this story, there is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. This reorientation from tribal affairs to social movements and the ballot marks a shift for Indian Country-and potentially for national politics as well. 8 H aaland comes from a working-class family. Her father served in the Vietnam War and was awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of six men in a 1967 firefight. She grew up a military brat, attending 13 public schools before graduating from Highland High in southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico. At 15, she took a job at a bakery; every day after school and on into her twenties, Haaland decorated cakes. At 28, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, and put herself through undergrad and law school on student loans and food stamps. (I work at 350.org, whose affiliate 350 Action has endorsed Haaland.) \"When I think about my roots as a Native woman and how I was raised by my parents and my grandparents, my values were formed pretty much when I was born,\" Haaland told me. \"I didn't just decide last year where on the spectrum I was falling.\" 9 Somah Haaland, Deb's daughter, remembers her mother's first campaign well. The Haalands were living in a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California. Deb was taking classes at UCLA. Somah was in first grade and participated in after school drama lessons at the Santa Monica Playhouse. When the theatre lost its funding, Haaland launched a campaign to save the playhouse, canvassing the community with six-year-old Somah in tow. The Haalands prevailed and the playhouse still operates today; Somah went on to major in theatre at the University of New Mexico. 10 Haaland is running an unabashedly progressive campaign. She supports universal healthcare, tuition-free college, gun reform and a woman's right to choose. In a nod to Standing Rock, Haaland uses #MniWiconi, Lakota for \"Water is Life,\" in her platform and calls for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground and for a transition to a 100% renewable energy economy. 11 \"I felt I could be an effective voice for people like me: a single mom with student loans,\" Haaland told me. \"If I can fight to make people's lives better and make the role of government one where it actually lives up to its obligation to our citizens, that's what I want to do.\" 12 Jordan and Haaland are part of a rising class of Native women professionals. Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents. Haaland is nose-to-nose with Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, her closest primary competitor. Jordan, meanwhile, is being outspent in the Democratic primary 6 to 1 by Idaho businessman AJ Balukoff, who put $3.6 million of his own funds into his losing 2014 campaign. 16 Native women candidates are also drawing from lessons learned during the Obama and Sanders campaigns, the first presidential bids to integrate full-time Native advisors into their campaign headquarters. Former President Obama held an annual summit for tribal leaders at the White House and became one of just a handful of sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when he travelled to Standing Rock in 2014. Native Americans, who tend to vote for Democratic candidates , have also strengthened their position with their party of choice, reaching the nine-party-member tipping-point to constitute a caucus in 2017, giving Indigenous voices greater representation in party politics. 17 Jodi Archambault Gillette, former special assistant for Native American affairs to President Obama, watched many of these behind-the-scenes developments from the inside. In 2016, Gillette worked for her nation, the Standing Rock Sioux, leveraging relationships with Democratic decision-makers to strengthen and elevate Native resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Haaland and Jordan both travelled to Standing Rock and helped advocate for the tribe with government agencies and progressive organizations. 18 Gillette remembers when Haaland came to the Oceti Sakowin camp near the path of the pipeline to cook green chili stew and homemade tortillas for Gillette's extended family. \"As an Indigenous woman, we have responsibilities that are to us sacred.\" Gillette said. \"She gave us her traditional food. That was beautiful.\" 19 The path to victory for Haaland, Jordan and Native women running up and down the ballot remains arduous, but Gillette is confident. \"As women we are going to get it done.\" 20\n\nTwo months later and just a few blocks away, Paulette Jordan, Democratic candidate for Governor of Idaho, spoke to a crowd of about 30 supporters gathered at the National Indian Gaming Association headquarters. \"We want to make history,\" she said to the attorneys and advocates circled round. \"But we also want to make change.\" 2 Related Articles After Stunning Democratic Win, North Dakota Republicans Suppressed the Native American Vote Roey Hadar PHOTOS: Since Standing Rock, 56 Bills Have Been Introduced in 30 States to Restrict Protests Zoë Carpenter and Tracie Williams In some ways these Capitol Hill functions were unremarkable-modest meet-and-greet fundraisers in an election cycle full of them.

Native Americans, who tend to vote for Democratic candidates , have also strengthened their position with their party of choice, reaching the nine-party-member tipping-point to constitute a caucus in 2017, giving Indigenous voices greater representation in party politics. 17 Jodi Archambault Gillette, former special assistant for Native American affairs to President Obama, watched many of these behind-the-scenes developments from the inside. In 2016, Gillette worked for her nation, the Standing Rock Sioux, leveraging relationships with Democratic decision-makers to strengthen and elevate Native resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Haaland and Jordan both travelled to Standing Rock and helped advocate for the tribe with government agencies and progressive organizations. 18 Gillette remembers when Haaland came to the Oceti Sakowin camp near the path of the pipeline to cook green chili stew and homemade tortillas for Gillette's extended family. \"As an Indigenous woman, we have responsibilities that are to us sacred.\" Gillette said. \"She gave us her traditional food. That was beautiful.\" 19 The path to victory for Haaland, Jordan and Native women running up and down the ballot remains arduous, but Gillette is confident. \"As women we are going to get it done.\" 20\n\nRoey Hadar\n\nZoë Carpenter and Tracie Williams\n\nIn some ways these Capitol Hill functions were unremarkable-modest meet-and-greet fundraisers in an election cycle full of them. But they represented an historic moment. If Haaland wins her tightly contested primary in her heavily Democratic district, she has a strong chance of becoming the first Native woman elected to Congress-one out of 10,945 members in United States history. Jordan, a citizen of the Coeur d'Alene tribe in Idaho and descendant of the Yakama, Colville and Nez Perce, faces longer odds. But if she wins her May 15 primary and then the election in November, she would become the first-ever Indigenous woman elected governor in the United States. 3 Haaland and Jordan are riding a wave of post-Standing Rock organizing that's aimed at helping Native women win elections. In all there are five Native women running for Congress, four running for governors' offices and 46 running for state legislature, according to data compiled by Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today. These trailblazing campaigns mark the arrival of this nation's first peoples-and particularly first women-at the doorstep of the halls of power. 4 \"It gives me hope,\" said Vivienna Orcutt, a councilwoman from the Hoopa Valley tribe in California. \"It gives me hope for my daughters. It gives me hope for the young women in Indian Country.\" Orcutt brought a group of Native women to Haaland's event and, after hearing her speak, decided to get involved in the campaign. She's now a dedicated volunteer who spends nights and weekends sending emails and making phone calls in the hope that come 2019, Haaland will be delivering speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives. 5 Supporters like Orcutt-the people hosting fundraisers and mobilizing voters across Indian Country- are themselves an important part of this story. Overlooked and underestimated, Native communities across the continent have organized grassroots networks amidst deep social and economic inequality: Native people are the most likely to be killed by law enforcement and rank among the poorest of this nation's poor. 6 The tribal leaders, lawyers, and activists showing up for Haaland, Jordan and other candidates cut their teeth during decades of hard-fought battles for Native rights. On my way into Haaland's fundraiser, for example, I ran into a woman from the Nisqually tribe, a community in Washington that led protests and legal battles to secure treaty rights to the Northwest coast fishery for two straight decades, through the 1960s and 1970s. Inside, I shook hands with an elder from Nambé Pueblo, one of the 19 pueblo communities who re-took control of their education systems. Today, the All Indian Pueblo Council operates the Santa Fe Indian School, where former First Lady Michelle Obama spoke in 2016 and where my little sister is a junior in high school. 7 There is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. In the wake of Standing Rock, the largest Indigenous protest in United States history, many of those activists have turned their attention to elections-and they're applying lessons learned from decades of organizing around treaty rights, casinos, and pipelines. Among the Native leaders I talked to for this story, there is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests. This reorientation from tribal affairs to social movements and the ballot marks a shift for Indian Country-and potentially for national politics as well. 8 H aaland comes from a working-class family. Her father served in the Vietnam War and was awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of six men in a 1967 firefight. She grew up a military brat, attending 13 public schools before graduating from Highland High in southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico. At 15, she took a job at a bakery; every day after school and on into her twenties, Haaland decorated cakes. At 28, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, and put herself through undergrad and law school on student loans and food stamps. (I work at 350.org, whose affiliate 350 Action has endorsed Haaland.) \"When I think about my roots as a Native woman and how I was raised by my parents and my grandparents, my values were formed pretty much when I was born,\" Haaland told me. \"I didn't just decide last year where on the spectrum I was falling.\" 9 Somah Haaland, Deb's daughter, remembers her mother's first campaign well. The Haalands were living in a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California. Deb was taking classes at UCLA. Somah was in first grade and participated in after school drama lessons at the Santa Monica Playhouse. When the theatre lost its funding, Haaland launched a campaign to save the playhouse, canvassing the community with six-year-old Somah in tow. The Haalands prevailed and the playhouse still operates today; Somah went on to major in theatre at the University of New Mexico. 10 Haaland is running an unabashedly progressive campaign. She supports universal healthcare, tuition-free college, gun reform and a woman's right to choose. In a nod to Standing Rock, Haaland uses #MniWiconi, Lakota for \"Water is Life,\" in her platform and calls for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground and for a transition to a 100% renewable energy economy. 11 \"I felt I could be an effective voice for people like me: a single mom with student loans,\" Haaland told me. \"If I can fight to make people's lives better and make the role of government one where it actually lives up to its obligation to our citizens, that's what I want to do.\" 12 Jordan and Haaland are part of a rising class of Native women professionals. Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents.

This reorientation from tribal affairs to social movements and the ballot marks a shift for Indian Country-and potentially for national politics as well. 8 H aaland comes from a working-class family. Her father served in the Vietnam War and was awarded the Silver Star for saving the lives of six men in a 1967 firefight. She grew up a military brat, attending 13 public schools before graduating from Highland High in southeast Albuquerque, New Mexico. At 15, she took a job at a bakery; every day after school and on into her twenties, Haaland decorated cakes. At 28, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, and put herself through undergrad and law school on student loans and food stamps. (I work at 350.org, whose affiliate 350 Action has endorsed Haaland.) \"When I think about my roots as a Native woman and how I was raised by my parents and my grandparents, my values were formed pretty much when I was born,\" Haaland told me. \"I didn't just decide last year where on the spectrum I was falling.\" 9 Somah Haaland, Deb's daughter, remembers her mother's first campaign well. The Haalands were living in a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica, California. Deb was taking classes at UCLA. Somah was in first grade and participated in after school drama lessons at the Santa Monica Playhouse. When the theatre lost its funding, Haaland launched a campaign to save the playhouse, canvassing the community with six-year-old Somah in tow. The Haalands prevailed and the playhouse still operates today; Somah went on to major in theatre at the University of New Mexico. 10 Haaland is running an unabashedly progressive campaign. She supports universal healthcare, tuition-free college, gun reform and a woman's right to choose. In a nod to Standing Rock, Haaland uses #MniWiconi, Lakota for \"Water is Life,\" in her platform and calls for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground and for a transition to a 100% renewable energy economy. 11 \"I felt I could be an effective voice for people like me: a single mom with student loans,\" Haaland told me. \"If I can fight to make people's lives better and make the role of government one where it actually lives up to its obligation to our citizens, that's what I want to do.\" 12 Jordan and Haaland are part of a rising class of Native women professionals. Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents. Haaland is nose-to-nose with Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, her closest primary competitor. Jordan, meanwhile, is being outspent in the Democratic primary 6 to 1 by Idaho businessman AJ Balukoff, who put $3.6 million of his own funds into his losing 2014 campaign. 16 Native women candidates are also drawing from lessons learned during the Obama and Sanders campaigns, the first presidential bids to integrate full-time Native advisors into their campaign headquarters. Former President Obama held an annual summit for tribal leaders at the White House and became one of just a handful of sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when he travelled to Standing Rock in 2014. Native Americans, who tend to vote for Democratic candidates , have also strengthened their position with their party of choice, reaching the nine-party-member tipping-point to constitute a caucus in 2017, giving Indigenous voices greater representation in party politics. 17 Jodi Archambault Gillette, former special assistant for Native American affairs to President Obama, watched many of these behind-the-scenes developments from the inside. In 2016, Gillette worked for her nation, the Standing Rock Sioux, leveraging relationships with Democratic decision-makers to strengthen and elevate Native resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Haaland and Jordan both travelled to Standing Rock and helped advocate for the tribe with government agencies and progressive organizations. 18 Gillette remembers when Haaland came to the Oceti Sakowin camp near the path of the pipeline to cook green chili stew and homemade tortillas for Gillette's extended family. \"As an Indigenous woman, we have responsibilities that are to us sacred.\" Gillette said. \"She gave us her traditional food. That was beautiful.\" 19 The path to victory for Haaland, Jordan and Native women running up and down the ballot remains arduous, but Gillette is confident. \"As women we are going to get it done.\" 20\n\nThere is a growing sense that Indigenous communities must engage political systems beyond reservations to advance their rights and interests.\n\nIn the wake of Standing Rock, the largest Indigenous protest in United States history, many of those activists have turned their attention to elections-and they're applying lessons learned from decades of organizing around treaty rights, casinos, and pipelines.

Nicole Willis of the Cayuse and Walla Walla tribes, a political consultant who worked on the Obama and Sanders campaigns, has watched this slow build over the last decade. When Willis attended law school in the mid 2000s, Native women outnumbered their male counterparts in the Native American Law Students Association 6 to 1. \"Even though we were the vast majority, we held fewer leadership roles,\" Willis said. \"Now we are seeing more Native people step forward and particularly Native women step forward.\" 13 \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" \"I think it was kind of inevitable,\" said Dick Trudell, a Santee Sioux tribal member who worked in Democratic circles in DC in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the first Native Americans to earn a law degree. \"We've seen more political activism and more Native professionals realizing what it takes to advance our interests at the state and federal levels and realizing that we can do it.\" 14 With the rise of Indian gaming, a $31.2 billion industry in 2016, a small subset of tribes now have the resources of a minor powerbroker. \"It may pale in comparison to the corporate world,\" Trudell said, \"but the Natives can put up dollars.\" Tribal governments and casinos are among the top funders of both the Haaland and Jordan campaigns, contributing over $30,000 to Haaland's campaign and more than $6,000 to Jordan's. 15 Still, despite strong support from tribes, progressive funders, and small donors, Native candidates still often face financial asymmetry with their opponents. Haaland is nose-to-nose with Antoinette Sedillo-Lopez, her closest primary competitor. Jordan, meanwhile, is being outspent in the Democratic primary 6 to 1 by Idaho businessman AJ Balukoff, who put $3.6 million of his own funds into his losing 2014 campaign. 16 Native women candidates are also drawing from lessons learned during the Obama and Sanders campaigns, the first presidential bids to integrate full-time Native advisors into their campaign headquarters.

Because of bias, she said, medical staff had erroneously assumed Ms. Echaquan was suffering withdrawal from narcotics.\n\nBut there was no evidence that Ms. Echaquan, who had a history of heart problems, was experiencing a narcotics withdrawal, the coroner, Géhane Kamel, said.\n\n\"This was a death that could've been prevented,\" Ms. Kamel said Tuesday. In a report released last week that detailed lapses in Ms. Echaquan's care, Ms Kamel said the evidence suggested that she had died of a pulmonary edema, an excess of fluid in the lungs.\n\nOn Tuesday, at a news conference explaining her findings, Ms Kamel called on the Quebec government to recognize \"systemic racism\" in the health care system and across the province.\n\nIf Ms. Echaquan were a white woman, Ms. Kamel said, she would still be alive today.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Lily Gladstone Is Holding the Door Open\n\nLife was different for Lily Gladstone in the summer of 2020. She had built up a small but impressive résumé in independent films, including two by Kelly Reichardt , \"Certain Women\" and \"First Cow.\" But the pandemic had shut down the industry, and she was worried about sustaining an acting career. Gladstone, who calls herself a \"bee nerd,\" looked into applying for a seasonal job with the Department of Agriculture, tracking murder hornets. Then she got an invitation to meet Martin Scorsese over Zoom. He was making a film based on David Grann's book \" Killers of the Flower Moon ,\" about a series of mysterious deaths in Oklahoma in the nineteen-twenties, when the Osage Nation was flush with oil money. Her performance in the film didn't just boost her career-it has now earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, the first for a Native American woman.\n\nThe role of Mollie Kyle, who lived from 1886 to 1937, is a tricky one. She married Ernest Burkhart (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a white man who conspired with his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro) to knock off Mollie's relatives in order to inherit her family's headrights. In the film, Mollie suspects from the start that Ernest is after her money-\"Coyote wants money,\" she teases him-but she doesn't divorce him until after his crimes are exposed in court. Playing her scenes with DiCaprio, one of the brightest stars in Hollywood, Gladstone adopts a Mona Lisa smile; ambiguity is central to her mesmerizing performance, and much of it comes across without words. And yet she resists the trope of the stoic, suffering Native heroine. She's by turns flirtatious, shrewd, agonized, ailing, and clear-eyed. Anthony Lane, in his New Yorker review , called her \"unmistakably the most compelling presence in the movie.\"\n\nPodcast: The New Yorker Radio Hour Lily Gladstone talks with Michael Schulman.\n\nGladstone, who is thirty-seven, was raised on the Blackfeet Reservation, in Montana, the daughter of a white mother and a father of Blackfeet and Nez Perce ancestry. No acting career is a sure bet, but Hollywood's treatment of Native characters and performers has historically been worse than neglectful-it's been vilifying and insulting. The Oscars, in their nine-and-a-half-decade history, haven't done much better. In 1973, Sacheen Littlefeather was booed when she took the stage to criticize the industry's representation of Native Americans, at the behest of Marlon Brando. A handful of Indigenous nominees have shown up in the acting categories-most recently, the Native Mexican actress Yalitza Aparicio (\"Roma\")-but Gladstone walks a mostly untrodden path, and she does it with composure and conviction. When we spoke recently, she was in Washington, D.C., for a screening of \"Killers\" at the National Museum of the American Indian, along with the Osage musician Scott George, who is nominated for his original song \"Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People).\" \"There are a couple historic nominations this year, and I'm so happy that there's an Osage making history, too,\" she said. We spoke about her own historic nomination, her passion for language revitalization, and how to curse in Blackfoot. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nYou're in the heat of Oscar season. What's life like right now?\n\nIt's a lot of nice hotels and a very rapid-paced schedule. It's really lovely, the reach that this film is having. It's been a lot of travel, a lot of meeting new people.\n\nAwards season is this huge machine. As someone who's been catapulted into it, have you had moments that have felt particularly surreal or fun or stressful?\n\nIt does get to a point where you get a little overwhelmed by all of the celebrity, and then pretty soon it's just people, you know? Probably the most surreal moment was when I was at the National Board of Review awards. Patti Smith made the introduction for my award, and I was sitting between her and Daniel Day-Lewis. And then the next day I was at the A.F.I. luncheon, in L.A., sitting between Tim Cook and Leo DiCaprio, and I was telling Tim, \"Why is it that today feels a little bit more grounded and familiar than yesterday?\" When Tim Cook and Leo DiCaprio become \"Oh, hey, guys!\"-it's a strange place to be.\n\nThe people you've collaborated with on this movie are, of course, old hands at this kind of thing. Leo, Marty, Bob-not that I have any reason to call them by those names. Have they given you any sort of advice on what to expect?\n\nWhat I really appreciate is: there's not this protective, patriarchal \"Let me give you advice, kid\" sort of thing. Anytime Leo's done it, it's been completely self-aware and joking. He's kind of a goofball and a wise-ass. They lead by example. That's been the most grounding thing, because I've been able to be in proximity to people who are so used to it. And meeting other people I'm just so excited by-how quickly America Ferrera took to me. I'm a huge fan of Emma Stone, and she's been lovely, and all of these people that are now in a peer group, I guess. You just get the sense that it's not as big or scary as you need to make it. It's just about human connection in the end.\n\nAt the same time that you're dressing up and going to award shows, you're also carrying the banner of a historic nomination. The Oscars have had an extremely spotty record with honoring Indigenous people, and you're the first Native American woman in the Best Actress category. How has that been sitting with you?\n\nI keep saying it's overdue. We're in the ninety-sixth year of the Academy Awards, and we're on Native American land. Natives are natural storytellers. A big part of our understanding of ourselves, since time immemorial, is our stories. So it's just odd that, in the United States, it's taken almost a hundred years for a Native American to reach this milestone in a major acting category. We've had Indigenous representation. We've had Yalitza Aparicio, Graham Greene [\"Dances with Wolves\"] in supporting, Chief Dan George [\"Little Big Man\"] in supporting. We've had global Indigenous recognition. But, like you said, it's sprinkled.\n\nI'm friends with Sterlin Harjo, the co-creator of \"Reservation Dogs.\" We're both in the circuit right now, and we happened to find ourselves in the same hotel the week before last. He put it really well. He said, \"We're in a position where we're kicking the door in. When you kick the door in, you should just put your foot in the door and stand there.\" Kicking the door in and running through it means it's going to shut behind you. While I'm the first specifically Native American Indigenous woman, I stand on the shoulders of a lot of performers. It's all circumstantial that I have this moniker of the first, and I'm certainly not going to be the last. If I've kicked the door in, I'm just trying to stand here and leave it open for everybody else.\n\nAs a student of Oscar history, I know that it's been a mixed experience for people who have been the firsts in their categories. Sidney Poitier was the first Black man to win Best Actor, in 1964, and when he was being honored at the mayor's office, in New York City, reporters kept asking him about civil rights. He finally snapped-he was not a person who generally snapped-and said, \"Why is it everything you guys ask refers to the Negroness of my life and not my acting?\" I'm curious if you've felt that tension of being out here as an actor, but also as the face of a community. And, in addition to that, you're playing an Osage woman, so it's not even quite your community.\n\nThat's something that I try to highlight first. There's just the roadblock that a lot of Natives have in representation, that people don't even think we're still here. There's some empirical data out there, some surveys-in one study I was reading, forty per cent of people didn't think that Native Americans still existed. The perception of who we are, which has largely been shaped by Hollywood-it's very narrow. There's an assumption that we just disappeared.\n\nThere's an incredible diversity in Indian country. I'm not Osage, but as a Native actor I've played a lot of roles now that required that I speak another Indigenous language. And I'm by no means even fluent in Blackfoot! I can introduce myself. I have a few words and phrases. I know some of the bad words.\n\nCan you please curse in Blackfoot right now?\n\nI'm just gonna drop this for my Blackfeet folks, but I'm not going to say what it means. Siksimiisii was one of the worst and funniest things you could say about somebody. It's a fairly PG thing, but it's my favorite word in our language. Good luck trying to phonetically transcribe it!\n\nAnother film that I did last year was \"Fancy Dance,\" which premièred at Sundance. Isabel Deroy-Olson, the actress who plays my niece, and I were playing Seneca-Cayuga, and our director and co-writer, Erica Tremblay, is Seneca-Cayuga. Erica was going through a three-year-long language-revitalization program and wanted to make a film where she saw modern characters speaking Cayuga. So, when Isabel and I were at this talkback, a woman very sweetly asked if it felt good for us to be able to speak in our native language. And Isabel and I looked at each other. Neither of us is Seneca-Cayuga! It was really difficult for us to pick up the language, and to get to the point where we could act in it as well. Tribal languages are incredibly different from each other. The perception that we all speak one Native American language is very commonly held. Most of us are not fluent even in our own languages.\n\nThat's an aspect of Native performance that I think a lot of people take for granted. We celebrate other actors for picking up European languages for a role and sounding proficient, but for some reason that same awe and credit are often dismissed for Native actors, because people assume, \"Oh, you all speak that.\"\n\nIn your Golden Globes speech , you talked about how your mother had advocated for your school to teach Blackfoot when you were growing up. Can you tell me a little bit about that?\n\nIt was in second grade, when [the educator] Edward North Peigan came into our classroom. I didn't really know what my mom was up to. I just knew that she was doing everything she could to help in community-building, and she had a degree in early-childhood education. She remembers having to find the funding to pay for a language teacher to come in. The school was fairly mixed-majority Blackfeet students, but a lot of non-Blackfeet students-so there was a little bit of pushback. And my mom was saying, \"Well, we're on Blackfeet land, and most of your students are Blackfeet, and it's important for brain development, it's important for sense of self, it's important for connection to community.\" I'm so grateful to her. My dad would come into the classroom and record when Edward was speaking so that we would have an archive of some of our language. But I just remember sitting there and learning how to count, learning how to introduce ourselves.\n\nAs you were growing up on the Blackfeet Reservation, what sort of art or culture called out to you?\n\nI've said it a lot now: \"Return of the Jedi\" and my love of Ewoks gave me the early spark to want to be an actor. Missoula Children's Theatre is a touring company, and they take plays to schools all across the country, especially in smaller rural areas. They're in residence for a week and do a big play for the community. So I loved that. But I also remember when Edward and his wife, Wilma, were coming to school and teaching language. Every year, you put on your little school play, and I think a lot of people were pushing for a Nativity play. And the pushback was, \"Well, while we have this grant to have Edward and Wilma in our schools, maybe we ought to do a different story.\"\n\nSo we staged a trickster story-our trickster figure. He's also a creator of our world. A lot of these stories, they're fun for kids, but they're also teaching you these sacred world-building lessons. There was an element of the story where the trickster is being chased by this giant rock rolling down a hill, and all of these nighthawks come in to try to save him, and they break apart this big, rolling boulder by throwing their feces. So I remember being one of these little nighthawks, just pummelling one of my classmates dressed as a rock with these little balled-up pieces of paper, and how fun that was for all the kids-and how triggering it was for a lot of the more conservative families, the non-Blackfeet folks! Our stories don't move the same way Western stories do. They don't have the same lessons. That was a really foundational experience in early childhood, as far as performance goes.\n\nYour high-school yearbook has made the rounds online, so I know that you were voted Most Likely to Win an Oscar.\n\nIt's really sweet. My graduating class, and a lot of people that were in the same drama program-they're reuniting to watch the Oscars in our old high-school theatre. And then Josh Ryder, who's the other [classmate] that was voted Most Likely to Win an Oscar-he's still a brilliant actor. He's a restaurateur now. Anybody in Seattle, go check out Betty Restaurant & Bar, on Queen Anne. It's the best.\n\nShoutout!\n\nLittle shoutout to Betty. I was really more involved in my sophomore and junior years. My senior year-this is silly-I wanted to do more complex work than high school would allow for. So I jumped over to the community college, where my mom was teaching. But, growing up back home, after Missoula Children's Theatre shows, people would tell my parents that when they saw me, like, in full costume playing one of Cinderella's ugly stepsisters, they didn't recognize me. I disappeared into character. My identity at home and then in high school became synonymous with acting.\n\nThen you studied acting and directing at the University of Montana. When you got out, what was your early career like? What kind of roles were you auditioning for, what were you getting, and what kind of day jobs were you doing for survival?\n\nMy dad gave me a little piece of knowledge that, until recently, I thought was a Blackfeet saying: \"Prey runs to the hunter.\" Turns out it comes from Carl Sagan! [ In \" Intelligent Life in the Universe ,\" Sagan credits the line to the Soviet astronomer Iosif Samuilovich Shklovskii. ] Which is really cool, too. But my career has kind of been shaped that way. I graduated already cast into a touring theatre production with Montana Repertory Theatre, which is a company attached to the University of Montana actor-training program. So I went out for a year with \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and played Mrs. Dubose, the ninety-year-old morphine addict.\n\nOh, nice!\n\nThen I had a costume transition in the intermission and played a lady in the court. I also doubled as crew, so it gave me a holistic sense of what it is to bring a production together. After that, I decided to stay in Montana instead of going to L.A. or New York. My scene work in class was always praised, but I also got a little bit disillusioned with the whole casting process. If I had gone to L.A. or New York and done the classic [route]-audition endlessly, get an agent-just thinking about it was starting to kill my passion for it. So I stayed in Montana, where I had built some connections with local filmmakers. In between the theatre tours, I auditioned for a one-woman show that toured schools.\n\nOh, I read about this. And you were acting against a prerecorded track in school auditoriums?\n\nYeah. It's a Seattle-based company called Living Voices , and I was performing a show that was teaching about the Native American boarding-school experience, with historical documents projected behind you on the screen and prerecorded voices from other actors that etch out this period in history. You act as a person who's living through it for about twenty minutes-something that fits into a classroom period with enough time for a question-and-answer period. The character I played was a boarding-school survivor who had gone through the Ganado Mission hospital, trained to become a nurse in the Second World War, and then was in a letter correspondence with her clan brother, who had become a Navajo code talker. So I was teaching a little bit about that history as well, about the Native veteran experience.\n\nIt's a heavy story to carry alone. I did that for as many years as I could but got burned out on it. You have to do so much 101 before you even start the show, contextualizing that there are five hundred and seventy-four different tribal nations in the United States, and we all come from different backgrounds, and we have a lot of different languages, and, yes, we're still here, and, no, we don't still live in tepees.\n\nRight, and then there's a sophomore sleeping in the first row. Teens are a tough audience.\n\nTeens are the toughest audience. It was really rewarding but incredibly exhausting work, as any teacher will attest. So that job kept me going, between cashiering at Staples and then every once in a while having an independent film. I've always felt that acting and activism can go hand in hand. I find curriculum development fascinating, and doing that show kind of gave me a chance to figure out very succinct ways to deliver to very mixed young audiences. How do you impart enough to give them some curiosity? To break some stereotypes? To expand the lens?\n\nBefore I got cast in the Montana Repertory touring show, I was consulting with an old professor about maybe doing a Ph.D., developing performance-based pedagogy for language revitalization. My primary language teacher on \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" Chris Côté-this is his life. He's a language revitalizationist. He and I would have conversations about how I was excited to test out some of my early theories that performance is a really valuable tool for language revitalization. The first [Blackfoot] language-immersion school, Niitsiipoowahsiin, or Cuts Wood School, was established in the model of the Kamehameha schools, the immersion schools in Hawaii. And one thing that I've heard is that these programs were very successful at graduating fluent speakers at the middle-school level, but then the retention rate was fairly low. Having come out of a performance background, I was noticing how being physiologically based sounded like a lot of the practices of total physical response that you hear about in language immersion. When you're learning the words \"to sit,\" you're sitting down. You're getting the concept in your body, in your movement. I felt like that was a key, maybe, to the next step of what could help with language retention, if you can express emotion in your language.\n\nMy great-grandma Lily, the one that I'm named after, was a fluent speaker. She and her family relocated from our rez to Seattle in, I believe, the nineteen-thirties, like a lot of Natives who got relocated to urban locations during that period. I remember my dad saying that other Blackfeet would come over to Grandma Lily's house because they're, like, \"Oh, that old lady speaks Blackfoot! Let's go visit with her!\" People would talk about how good it felt physically to speak the language. Your whole world view and sense of self are based in language.\n\nYou've talked about how many Native languages don't have gendered pronouns, and how that has shaped your own sense of gender. Can you talk a little more about that?\n\nBlackfoot has gendered verbs , which is an interesting concept. There are definitely gendered roles in our communities, but gender is not a prescriptive sort of thing. Our gender is implied in our name. So my name, Piitaakii, means Eagle Woman. And the aki part is what makes it feminized. But a lot of those things aren't exclusive. One of our heroes in Blackfeet history, Piitamakaan, means Running Eagle, which is a man's name, but it was held by a woman because she was a really good warrior. And the verbs that she would have used, the things that men do, are gendered, but gender is not really a binary in that way. So when you think about the pronoun usage, when you're talking about people, it's just \"this person,\" \"this one,\" \"that one.\" The easiest reach in English would be \"they.\" It's different for every tribe. I mean, Navajo Nation has multiple words for multiple genders. So does Crow Nation, I've heard.\n\nYou've said that using \"she\"/\"they\" pronouns is \"a way of decolonizing gender\" for yourself. I'm curious how that has played out in your acting life. For instance, your breakout role was in the wonderful Kelly Reichardt film \" Certain Women ,\" from 2016, in which you play a pretty butch ranch hand in Montana who more or less falls in love with the character played by Kristen Stewart .\n\nThat's a great example. That character comes from a Maile Meloy short story. But the character originally in the story, \" Travis, B. ,\" was a man. You can still feel it in there. I think a lot of queer people who watch it have picked up on that. So transitioning that character from explicitly male changed the whole tone. It became more ambiguous as to what was really going on there. That's the realm that Kelly likes making films in: things not so explicitly stated.\n\nSo there was just a part of me that felt like I understood who that character was, the way that Maile had drawn him. Maybe the rancher is not self-aware enough to know what their gender identity is, what their sexual orientation is. In the original short story, there was a line: \"He got afraid of himself that winter.\" The character was a polio survivor and had a displaced relationship with his own body. His spirit felt bigger than what his body was allowing him to do, with his shrunken leg. And he had this streak where he would ride a little more dangerously than he should and had a lot of broken bones. So there was some self-destructiveness there.\n\nThat's fascinating, because none of that is explicitly said in the movie, but it clearly was influential for you in building the character.\n\nTotally.\n\nI want to move on to \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" based on the book by my colleague David Grann . When you were figuring out how to play Mollie, a real person who made real choices and lived through very extreme circumstances, what was most familiar about her and what was most enigmatic or obscure?\n\nIn reading the book, I got a sense of the kind of person that I would recognize from my grandma's side of the family, my Nez Perce side. I have nothing but aunties on my Nez Perce side. What was really exciting was the idea of breaking some stereotypes as well, in her relationship with her sisters . The relationship that Native women have with each other, especially our families-we love being together. We love joking. We love gossiping and teasing. I could really see that with my grandma's sisters: being very proper, still, but just giggling about everything. That's not the Native woman that you're used to seeing in cinema. You're used to seeing [someone] more stoic, kind of mean. Well, it's because there are outsiders around! People are a little bit more guarded.\n\nLike I said, I didn't want to overextend my own cultural understanding into Mollie as an Osage woman, but it was a basis. When I sat down with Margie Burkhart, Mollie's granddaughter, I could see maybe how Grann was able to sketch Mollie, the way that he drew her personality. There was a lot of both her and my other language teacher, Janis Carpenter. Those two women most influenced Mollie.\n\nMollie has a very strange and conflicted relationship with her husband, Ernest. I want to zero in on my favorite scene in the film, a scene that's up there with the all-time great Martin Scorsese scenes, which is their first date, when she invites him to dinner at her house. They're flirting, they're smoking, and she calls him out as a \"coyote\" and says, \"Coyote wants money.\" And then she offers him whiskey . She's trying to figure this guy out, and in a way she has, but in a way she hasn't.\n\nRight. And at that point people were starting to pass away, and it was a really difficult transitional time for Osage. Mollie and her sisters were boarding-school survivors as well, so there's a whole lot of contextualized history behind that. A lot of that also came from Charles H. Red Corn's book, \" A Pipe for February .\" It's a novel about the Osage Reign of Terror from an Osage perspective. As people are dying, the rise in paranoia was slow. It wasn't immediately obvious that people were being poisoned to death. You see these new folks coming in-\"Oh, these guys are new!\"-and there's a flirtation. There's an exoticism that's happening on both sides.\n\nWhat do you think she sees in Ernest?\n\nIt's a dynamic that I'm very used to seeing, even in my own family. This fun-loving, larger-than-life, inappropriate, sometimes goofy cowboy of a guy, and this very self-possessed, humble, acting-on-protocol Native woman. He just lives to make her laugh. That scene underwent a couple of different changes. It's not going to be explicitly clear to the audience when Mollie calls him sho-me-kah-see -coyote-she's not just calling him the animal. She's calling him a trickster. One of the trickster figures in oral tradition with Osage is Coyote. He's always tripping over his own feet, acting in self-interest, and he never really wins. He'll screw up everything for everybody in the story in a very funny way, especially when you're telling it to kids.\n\nWhen I was learning these stories, a lot of them reminded me of our Blackfeet trickster stories. So I had a new understanding of the whole movie at that point, when my language teacher Chris kept sharing these coyote stories. He would tell them to me in the Osage language first, and then translate them into English, which helped me see how Osage is a very animated, fun language to speak. It's highly expressive, which also started shattering some of these stereotypes about playing stoic Indians. It had a huge hand in shaping how I understood Mollie, and the humor that she would have. I found her in the language so much.\n\nSo how did that scene change?\n\nWell, when Chris was telling me these trickster stories, I kept hearing analogies for the whole film. And Marty and I, when we hear somebody call this film a Western, we kind of look at each other, like, Ugh . Marty's pretty resistant to calling this film a Western. To me, the genre of the film is a trickster story. When Chris kept telling me these stories, I took that idea to Marty and Leo. It suddenly gave Mollie a big blind spot for Ernest to hide in. If she was raised hearing these trickster stories as a kid, they change on you throughout your life. You hear them when you're young, and they're funny. And then, when you get older, you start learning the lessons that are hidden in the story. So that's kind of Mollie from beginning to end. She enjoyed his humor, she enjoyed his nature, and she felt like she understood it-she had the upper hand.\n\nThere was a mutual benefit there, too. The first time we meet Mollie, she's asking for her own money from her guardian, Pitts Beaty, because she's an \"incompetent\" Osage. If you were married to a white person, that spouse could be your guardian. You would just tell your husband or wife that you needed something for the house, and they would cut the check. So I think Mollie, in that way, is being calculated. She was vetting him, and she found that he would be a fun-loving guy. She's, like, O.K., this one's easy to handle. I can deal with that.\n\nSome of the movies that \"Killers\" called to mind for me are not Westerns but domestic dramas like \" Gaslight \" or \" Suspicion ,\" stories of women who are married to men who they slowly realize are terrorizing them. And of course that gets more acute as the film goes on, and Mollie is starting to realize that he's not only responsible for the deaths of her family members but is actively poisoning her through her insulin. You start to wonder, How much is she seeing through him when he's lying to her face? How much is she deluding herself? Was that the question for you?\n\nWell, what you suspect in your subconscious mind you've been conditioned to dismiss. He's so good with the kids, and he just doesn't seem capable of it, even if the seeds of doubt are there. [She's] nowhere near imagining that he was orchestrating blowing up [Mollie's sister] Rita's house. The family didn't put that one together or accept that fully until years after. [Molly and Ernest's son] Cowboy maintained a relationship with his dad when he came back from prison. He even gave him the nickname Old Dynamite. Eventually, that relationship kind of got broken.\n\nBut one of the biggest clues for me, during that period when Mollie's getting the insulin, is that the family has surmised she was also getting a combination of arsenic and morphine. Having played a morphine addict in my first play, and doing the research about that-the chemical dependency, the immediate relief-that was a clue to me. It screws with your grasp on reality. While her subconscious and conscious minds are dancing with each other, while her body is being eroded by arsenic but also healed by insulin, and she's addicted to the whole process, the only thing that she sees consistently is Ernest, who's bringing her this relief. It was people in my life who are recovering addicts, who are leaving toxic, abusive, codependent relationships, be it with people or with substances-that gave me some compassion for what Mollie wasn't seeing. What she was incapable of seeing. And, even if she was seeing and suspecting it, incapable of leaving.\n\nYou've just had a new project announced: \"The Memory Police,\" directed by Reed Morano and written by Charlie Kaufman, based on the sci-fi novel by Yoko Ogawa . What drew you to this project?\n\nSince I've developed my own taste in film, Charlie Kaufman has been my favorite screenwriter. \"Adaptation\" was the first acting master class that I put myself through. I've seen that film, oh, more than twenty times. A lot of people who love the novel are very curious what the adaptation is going to be, and it's remarkable, I can tell you. It's the kind of space I really love playing in. There was a substantial period of my life when I was working with friends and creating theatre pieces that delved into themes of subconscious and memory, all of the things that are present in this incredible book. It's [set on] a nondescript island in a nondescript world, with the device that people's memories are being hijacked and erased by an authoritarian, fascist government run by what's called the Memory Police. And within it there are themes that are going to be recognized worldwide. I've spent so much of our time talking about language revitalization. There was this systemic effort to erase the collective memory of our very language. Yoko Ogawa wrote a book that speaks globally to people who have suffered under the foot of authoritarianism, and it's told in a sci-fi world that's going to be accessible. When we got sent it, it was, like, Yep, this is it. This is what we've been waiting for. ♦\n\nWhy Bishop Mariann Budde wanted to speak to Donald Trump .\n\nLena Dunham's change of pace .\n\nTim Walz might run for President in 2028 if you ask him nicely .\n\nMaya Rudolph is ready to serve .\n\nSarah McBride wasn't looking for a fight on trans rights .\n\nThe liberated life of Colman Domingo .\n\nSupport The New Yorker's award-winning journalism.

The portraits prefigure those of Cindy Sherman but, perhaps more significantly, they're the spiritual ancestors of the works of subsequent generations of genderqueer chameleon-photographers, such as the Japanese photographer Yasumasa Morimura (who has a strong survey up now at the Japan Society) and the South African photographer Zanele Muholi .

      "text": "The Woman Who Won't Let Mexico Forget a Massacre\n\nLupita Vasquez woke up on the morning of Dec. 22, 1997, from a good night's sleep in the hilltop village of Acteal, perched high in the western Hueytepec range in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. The early morning fog had filled the surrounding valleys and gorges like a moat.\n\nForgoing breakfast-it was the family's custom to fast before prayer-Lupita, 10, and her nine siblings dressed for church and followed their mother toward the hillside chapel where their father, Alonso Vasquez, the village priest, gave his morning Mass. Over 300 people from Acteal and the surrounding hamlets-many of them displaced by paramilitary groups who had swept through the surrounding region in the previous months-had gathered to listen to Alonso's sermon. He raised his hands and voice so everyone could hear.\n\nThat's when the shooting began. Over the next several hours, paramilitary forces slaughtered 45 people-21 women (four of them pregnant), nine men, 15 children-including more than half of Lupita's family. From that day on, the child who had still not entered her teens had to become a woman, tasked with the immense responsibility of keeping her community's memory alive.\n\nTwo years ago, the 523 villages and 43 indigenous peoples comprising Mexico's National Indigenous Congress ratified a proposition to form an autonomous governing body called the Indigenous Governing Council. Lupita, 29 at the time, was elected to represent the Altos-Centro region, home to nearly 50,000 people, mostly from the Tzotzil ethnic group in Chiapas. As the speaker for a still-restive region, Lupita is now responsible for bringing the problems and concerns of her people to the attention of the council and, through its speaker, María de Jesús Patricio Martínez (better known as Marichuy), to the broader public. Last fall, the council put forward Marichuy as the first indigenous woman aspirant to the presidency of Mexico. Though she did not earn enough signatures to appear on the ballot last year, her candidacy ran on a powerful political message: \"Never again a México without us.\"\n\nAs violence continues today in Los Altos, often following disturbingly familiar patterns, it is also Lupita's role to remind Mexico, and the world, what has happened here before. As recently as last fall, 6,000 people were displaced from the villages of Chenalhó (the local municipal seat, about an hour's drive from Acteal) and Chalchihuitán, roughly the same number that was displaced from the communities surrounding Acteal in the months before the massacre 20 years before. Though they wear different guises, the actors-shadowy paramilitary forces aligned either directly or tacitly with state and federal government-remain the same. The struggle for land rights is as urgent today as ever.\n\nOver the last few years, members of local political parties have approached Lupita, asking her to forget what happened. Lupita has refused. \"I always say that what's burned me is my mouth,\" she says. \"To speak the truth, you have to talk.\"\n\nNow 30, Lupita's smile is luminous, sincere, youthful; her eyes are expressive and black, the eyes of someone who has, even at such a young age, experienced enough for several lifetimes. She dresses in the traditional clothing of the region-a dark skirt, an embroidered huipil made on a waist loom-and weaves green laths into her long obsidian braids. When the temperature drops, she throws on a leather jacket.\n\nAs a child, Lupita spent her afternoons scaling medlar trees with disconcerting skill, picking their sweet, pulpy fruit and rubbing the resin between her fingers. \"I had a beautiful childhood,\" she remembers now. \"We might have been the poorest and humblest family. We didn't have enough to buy shoes, no one gave us clothes, but even still we were never unhappy.\"\n\nLupita's childhood, until she was 10, was peaceful, but the land she grew up in was not. The conflict in Los Altos de Chiapas (the Chiapas Highlands) formally began on Jan. 1, 1994, when thousands of indigenous people, organized under the banner of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (the EZLN, or the Zapatistas), declared war on the neoliberal policies of the federal government and then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.\n\nThe first public act of the Zapatista movement was the occupation of six cities in Chiapas, including San Cristóbal de las Casas, a beautiful colonial town popular with tourists. The rebels covered their faces with ski masks, blocked the entry points to those cities, and listed their demands: work, land, shelter, food, health, education, independence, freedom, democracy, justice, and peace. Within their villages, the Zapatistas focused on social change, remaking their communities as more equal places, focused, in particular, on creating social and political parity for women. They carried signs that read Perdonen las molestias, esto es una revolución : Pardon the inconvenience, this is a revolution.\n\nBy 1995, the central government had launched a brutal counterinsurgency campaign, escalating a political and social rebellion to full guerilla warfare. The war between the EZLN and Mexico's federal government officially lasted just 11 days before the rebels decided to suspend armed combat and enter into a dialogue with the state. In February 1996, the Zapatista army and the federal government signed the San Andrés Accords, the first and only document ever signed between the government and the rebels, agreeing to, among other things, preservation of natural resources in indigenous land and a higher degree of self-determination in public expenditures and infrastructure plans. The government has never taken seriously the commitments made in the accords. Two years after signing them, paramilitaries stormed into Acteal.\n\nThe village's first encounters with violence followed an internal land dispute that began in early 1992 when a man in a nearby community refused to recognize his sisters' right to inherit land from their father. That dispute devolved quickly into violence, with the man shooting the nephews who had laid claim to the land and denouncing five leftist activists, including several local priests, as the instigators of the dispute. When those leaders were imprisoned, a group of 400 men and women from the Tzotzil ethnic group, including many from Acteal, joined forces and launched a protest movement that eventually prevailed over the arbitrary detentions. Emboldened by their success, they formalized their movement in December 1992 under the name Las Abejas , or the Bees.\n\nHeavily influenced by the leftist branch of Catholicism known globally as liberation theology, Las Abejas saw echoes of their own cause-rights to ancestral lands and resources, equality among men and women-in the Zapatista movement. But as the EZLN took up arms in a guerrilla war against the government, Las Abejas declared themselves pacifists. They identified with the demands of the EZLN but objected to its use of armed force. In the months leading up to the massacre, paramilitary groups comprised mostly of indigenous people trained by the military displaced some 6,000 people in the hills surrounding Acteal between May and December 1997. Many sought refuge under Las Abejas.\n\nThat December morning, Acteal's neutrality came to an abrupt end.\n\nAs the guns fired, Lupita fled; she didn't stop running and didn't stop crying. The others who had escaped scolded her and told her that if she didn't stop sobbing, the soldiers would find them. She contained her tears and kept walking until she came across her brother, Juan, who'd been playing at some distance from the village when the gunfire began. She told her brother that the rest of the family had died; she felt dead herself.\n\nHours later they came across a group of women from a Zapatista camp several miles away from Acteal. As the night progressed, Zapatista fighters who'd gone up to Acteal to investigate returned to the camp. \"When I saw the Zapatistas, I ran to ask them if they knew whether anyone else from my family had survived,\" Lupita recalls, but the information they returned with was muddled. Some said her whole family had died, others that her mother and older sisters had survived. Neither was true.\n\nIn the days, weeks, and years since the massacre, Lupita cobbled together the story of what happened that day from the testimonies of survivors-including some of her siblings-and aid workers who entered the village in the immediate aftermath. The shooting began at 11:30 a.m. and continued until 6 p.m. Women were raped, their breasts cut off. One was sodomized with a tree branch. Soldiers slashed open the wombs of four pregnant women, tore out the babies, and batted the tiny corpses back and forth with their machetes-\"so the Indians will stop multiplying,\" they chanted. The soldiers were themselves Tzotzil, bought for a few pesos and the promise of power. Acteal became a killing field, a message of extermination: If you're not an allied Indian, you're a dead Indian. At a Zapatista camp in the village of Polhó, Lupita learned that just four of her nine siblings had survived. Both of her parents died.\n\nThe bodies laid out under the mountain sun for hours before military and Red Cross paramedics arrived to gather them up and carry them to the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez for autopsies. According to survivors, some of whom insisted on remaining with the bodies, the soldiers in charge of transporting the corpses attempted to dispose of them quietly by the roadside; the survivors, EZLN fighters, and representatives of international aid groups stopped them. The autopsies weren't performed until the following day and weren't returned to the villagers, now gathered in Polhó, until Dec. 24-already in an advanced state of decay. On Christmas, Bishop Samuel Ruíz, a prominent figure in the struggle for human rights in southern Mexico, gave a Mass on the same basketball court where the bodies of the dead had been laid out the day before. \"This is the saddest Christmas of my life,\" he said, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"How could someone do something like that?\" Lupita asks even now, all these years later. \"Above all, being part of our community. We're friends, neighbors, family,\" she shook her head, still in disbelief. \"Indigenous people were the ones who attacked and the ones who died. You can't understand it.\"\n\nIndigenous rights, including those guaranteed in the San Andrés Accords, continue to be systematically violated in Mexico today, both by the state and by non-state actors working with their tacit permission. The images of masked Zapatista rebels that once flooded the international news have long since faded in the public memory (at least outside Mexico), but the conflict they brought to the world's attention more than 20 years ago rages on. Where Acteal was widely reported both within and outside Mexico, the recent displacements in Chenalhó-the same municipal district-have gone largely unreported and unnoticed.\n\nFor the last 45 years, the people of Chenalhó have been engaged in a legal battle with the neighboring village of Chalchihuitán to reclaim over 44,000 acres of what they consider to be their ancestral land. Tensions between the communities have ebbed and flowed over the years since the land was originally deeded to Chalhihuitán under the agrarian reforms of President Luis Echeverría. Armed paramilitary groups have emerged, disarmed, and emerged again. According to Friar Gonzalo Bernabé Ituarte Verduzco, founder of the Friar Bartolomé de las Casas Center for Human Rights, \"these armed groups are descendants of the early nineties, some very likely of the same actors of the Acteal era, since most of them were released from jail.\"\n\nThe violence came to a head in November last year after an Agrarian Tribunal ruled that Chenalhó did, indeed, own the land, a decision that the government did not formally make known until Dec. 13. Why they waited so long is unclear. What is clear is that the intervening weeks saw armed groups from Chenalhó redouble their efforts, ultimately displacing 6,000 people from both towns and killing 11, in an unsettling echo of the months that led up to the Acteal massacre. Watchdog groups that focus on the region worry that the activity of paramilitary groups, the government's refusal to disarm them, and the continued atmosphere of impunity surrounding criminal activity in the area could lead to another massacre on the scale of Acteal.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, 30 people linked to the Acteal massacre were released from prison. The president at the time of the killings, Ernesto Zedillo, moved to the United States shortly after the end of his presidential term in 2000 to become a professor at Yale University. After a 2011 lawsuit filed by ten anonymous plaintiffs claiming to be survivors of the Acteal massacre, the U.S. State Department recommended that Zedillo should receive diplomatic immunity (the suit itself was problematic, originating with plaintiffs whom members of Las Abejas said they knew nothing about). A year later, Zedillo was appointed as a member of \"The Elders,\" a group that describes itself as \"an independent group of global leaders who work together for peace and human rights.\"\n\nEvery year, the people of Acteal relive the horror of what happened that day, recalling the events in vivid detail. Some perform re-enactments. Villagers see the ritual retelling of their story as essential, not only as a way to pay respect to the martyrs who helped bring global visibility to the guerrilla war in Chiapas, but also as a reminder to those who remain in power that the horrors that took place here will not be erased from history.\n\nIn 2015, Lupita's brother, Juan, delivered a speech to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, D.C., on the massacre and its impact on the community. Representatives of the Mexican state said they were more than happy to reach a \"friendly solution\"-a euphemism for a cash payout. It was not the first time that Lupita and her siblings had received such an offer. For Lupita, to accept the offer would mean putting a price on the lives of the dead, on the blood of her parents. What Lupita and Las Abejas seek, in the end, is that the state recognize its role in the massacre by trying those who are materially and intellectually responsible to prevent any such atrocity from taking place again.\n\n\"Neither land nor life has a price. Acteal is a horror that cannot be forgotten, and to be here, on this land, is to be able to weave a memory that we can share, to make our struggle and that massacre visible,\" she says today. \"We don't want to be silent because that's what they're asking for.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Comes After Decriminalizing Abortion?\n\nIn 2019, Aurelia García Cruceño, an 18-year-old Indigenous woman living in Guerrero, Mexico, had a miscarriage. The bleeding was so intense, according to news reports , that she lost consciousness. When she woke up in a hospital bed, she noticed that her hands and feet were handcuffed. The Guerrero Prosecutor's Office detained her for allegedly having ended her baby's life. She hadn't known she was pregnant.\n\nAurelia's case is tragic, and it isn't an anomaly. It demonstrates a series of interconnected failures between Mexico's health and legal systems, which too often accept gender violence as the status quo. Time and again, these systems restrict women's access to reproductive health care and education-and then punish them for the consequences of their lack of access, or for trying to seek it. According to case files obtained by the feminist advocacy organization GIRE, at least 367 women were reported for abortion crimes between 2010 and 2020 in the country. Nearly 34 percent of those women went to trial; 43 percent of women who went to trial were convicted. This is almost certainly an undercount-GIRE obtained more than 3,600 case files on crimes related to abortion over the 10-year period, but 78 percent of the files didn't specify the person's gender, and may have also encompassed men reported for violence against pregnant women. But even these imperfect estimates provide a window into a problem with immeasurable impact.\n\nOn Sep. 6, though, the fight for reproductive justice in Mexico experienced a big win: The country's supreme court ruled that the federal criminal penalties for abortion were unconstitutional, effectively decriminalizing abortion nationwide.\n\nSeptember's ruling built on a 2021 supreme court decision that declared the criminalization of abortion in the state of Coahuila to be unconstitutional. While limited in scope, the 2021 decision set an important precedent, and activists from around the country doubled their efforts to file suits against national and local penal codes, which they claimed amounted to unconstitutional violations of their human rights. The Sep. 6 decision was the result of one of those suits.\n\nThe ruling was cause for celebration within and outside Mexico, and for good reason. But Mexico's experience also provides an important window into the chapter after decriminalization-and all the structural and social changes that need to happen to make it a true victory. For decriminalization to really translate into a future with greater access to reproductive health care, abortion-seekers need access to psychological and social support, as well as clinics and hospitals stocked with essential drugs, supplies, equipment, and trained specialists.\n\nThe ruling also comes with plenty of caveats: Decriminalizing on the federal level is not legalizing, and even still, the measure won't be completely official until Mexico's congress changes the federal penal code. Abortion is still a crime in 20 out of 32 states, and the ruling only applies to the federal prosecutor's office and federally run public health institutions like IMSS and ISSSTE, which treat those who have public medical insurance, and other public hospitals available for the uninsured. Still, this is no small thing: In 2022, federal public hospitals treated 44 percent of people seeking primary care across the country.\n\nBut this theoretical expansion of services collides with the fact that Mexico's health care system is in crisis. In 2022 , 50 million people-around 4 of every 10 citizens-had insufficient access to health services. At the beginning of the year, the government reported a deficit of more than 180,000 physicians; the waiting periods for medical appointments can escalate to months, and a consistent drug shortage has been leaving people without their medication for the past five years. The administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, meanwhile, has been consistently reducing the national budget for health. This has pushed almost 49 percent of people to seek treatment in the private health sector, increasing the out-of-pocket expenses of the poorest people in the country from 30 to 50 percent between 2020 and 2022, sometimes leaving them in complete poverty .\n\nSimultaneously, the rates of gender violence have steadily increased in Mexico. More than 70 percent of women have experienced some type of violence in their lifetimes. In 2022, the rates of sexual and family violence increased in 27 and 23 states respectively, and the country reached a new record of emergency calls reporting sexual violence. Between 2015 and 2022, reported femicides increased 127 percent.\n\nThe stress on the national health system and the growing rates of gender violence mean that millions of women in the country have no access to quality women's health services, and many are exposed to obstetric violence. They struggle to get contraceptive methods and quality prenatal checkups, and experience unjustified cesarean sections, medical discrimination, and lack of interpreters if they speak an Indigenous language, and some have to travel great distances to the nearest health care center.\n\nThis was true for Fernanda, from Oaxaca, whose case was documented by GIRE. She was 18 when she was raped. The assault gave her the legal right to request an abortion, which she did-but she was repeatedly denied care. At one clinic, the gynecologist who refused to treat Fernanda falsely informed her that it would have been a crime to do so, according to GIRE. Another hospital also refused to perform the treatment Fernanda was legally entitled to, saying they would only accept emergency cases. Left without options, Fernanda had to travel to Mexico City to terminate her pregnancy.\n\nAll this is to say, yes, we can and should celebrate decriminalization in Mexico. But the world in which any woman-regardless of language, skin color, or socioeconomic status-can walk into a clinic, request an abortion, receive it, and feel safe throughout the process is still a distant reality. To arrive there, several things need to happen first.\n\nTo start, states need to follow the lead of the supreme court and move to decriminalize and legalize abortion locally. Legislators need to modify the federal General Health Law and state health laws to include the circumstances under which abortion is legal and the mechanisms to ensure that public and private clinics offer the service. Currently, the General Health Law and most state laws don't address the legal interruption of pregnancy, and without a clear set of guidelines, it will be hard for hospitals to provide treatment. Doctors can still refuse to perform an abortion under the excuse that it goes against their personal beliefs, that they don't want to go to jail, or that they don't have the know-how, equipment, or manuals to do so. Victories in the courts need to be solidified in local laws, regulations, and programs, as well as medical education and health care operating guidelines.\n\nOne example to draw from is Mexico City's health law, which stipulates that all women must have access to free and quality procedures to terminate a pregnancy through the 12 th week of gestation, as well as counseling and reproductive health and family planning services. The Mexico City law provides that doctors can object to performing the procedure if it interferes with their personal beliefs, but they need to refer the patient to a willing doctor. (Unless it's a life-or-death situation, in which case no one can refuse care.)\n\nEnsuring reproductive health care access also requires informing women of their rights and supporting them physically and psychologically. Systemic gender violence and the culture of putting women's rights on the back burner have been consistent barriers to legislating abortion and making women feel safe to request care, as they continue to face rejection, stigma, and inequities from male-dominated institutions and frameworks. For example, since 2013, Mexico's General Victims Law has established that victims of rape in every state must be guaranteed access, if they want it, to terminate their pregnancies. In practice, however, things happen differently: When Aurelia was released in December, she had spent three years in prison for the miscarriage of a pregnancy that resulted from a rape. Fernanda, too, was unable to access the care she was legally entitled to in her home state. These overpowering gaps between the law, medicine, and women's experiences demonstrate how far we have to go.\n\nStill, there's reason for hope. Each year in March, hundreds of thousands of Mexican women take to the streets in massive mobilizations to demand their rights. They also participate in organizing activities like the national strike known as \"A Day Without Us,\" where women disappear from public spaces for one day. They organize in collectives to help facilitate safe, accompanied medication abortions, and they file a deluge of suits like the one that eventually resulted in decriminalization. Many of their actions serve as models in the fight for reproductive justice in other countries, including the United States.\n\nTo turn a legal victory into tangible improvements for reproductive health care, September's ruling is challenging Mexico to address a cascade of structural issues. It's a big ask, one that will require legal commitment, financial investment, and culture change. But with it comes the opportunity to finally guarantee women's access to reproductive justice and rights-and show other countries a path to do the same.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How Mexico Conquered the Oscars\n\nRoma , Alfonso Cuarón's intimate masterpiece, has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film. Yalitza Aparicio, the Oaxacan schoolteacher and acting novice who plays Cleo, a young Mixtec woman who finds heartbreak and solace while working for a middle-class family in Mexico City, has been nominated for Best Actress. She is the first indigenous woman to be nominated in the category. Her co-star Marina de Tavira also earned a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Cuarón himself is in the running for the impressive trifecta of director, screenwriter, and cinematographer (he will be in a club all his own if he wins all three). If Roma takes Best Picture-it has at least a strong shot -it will be the first foreign language film to take the Academy's top honor. No filmmaker-not even legendary directors like Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman, both multiple winners in the foreign language category-has managed such a feat.\n\nRoma 's success at the Oscars would be a triumph for Cuarón, a versatile man of the cinema capable of conjuring the unexpected in the massive canvas of a Harry Potter movie, the eerie stillness of space in Gravity , or the black-and-white frame of Roma , where the director re-creates his childhood home and 1970s Mexico City in Proustian detail.\n\nRoma 's achievements also belong to a generation of filmmakers unlike any other in the history of the art form. If Cuarón wins again, the Mexican trio of Alejandro González Iñárritu, Guillermo del Toro, and Cuarón will take home their fifth Oscar in the past six years in the Best Director category-del Toro for last year's The Shape of Water , Iñárritu for The Revenant and Birdman and Cuarón for 2013's Gravity . Of course, the list of foreign-born movie directors who have reached the pinnacle of their careers on Oscar night is long, but few countries can claim to have produced a cohesive group of collaborators with the level of success three Mexican auteurs have enjoyed for more than two decades.\n\nWhat makes Iñárritu, del Toro, and Cuarón so unique? Renowned Mexican film critic Fernanda Solórzano believes the group's success began with their individual decisions to leave Mexico. \"They recognized early on that the industry in Mexico couldn't give them either the conditions or the budget they needed to advance their careers,\" Solórzano told me. \"They could have become complacent, they could have simply rested on their laurels. Instead, they chose to take risks. All three have been courageous.\"\n\nAt different moments in the early stages of their careers, Cuarón, Iñárritu, and del Toro worked in Mexican television, then a telenovela-producing juggernaut. While others made fortunes repeating tear-jerking formulas, the three directors looked to the big screen. Both Cuarón and del Toro directed their first movies when they were around 30 years old. Cuarón's Sólo con Tu Pareja , a playful urban comedy co-written with his brother, Carlos, became a smash hit. Del Toro's Cronos , a dizzying tale of alchemy and vampirism, followed a couple of years later. Iñárritu, who had already revolutionized Mexican radio in the '80s, would join the club in 2000, with the celebrated Amores Perros . After those first movies, none of them looked back. Actor Diego Luna, whose career Cuarón helped launch in the critically acclaimed Y Tu Mamá También , agrees. \"The three of them left Mexico immediately in search of greater challenges,\" he explained in an email. \"I believe that each of them, in his own peculiar way, understands risk as an essential part of success.\"\n\nAll three directors are also constant innovators, both narratively and technically. For Solórzano, this resourcefulness comes not only from the trio's creative passions but from the very concrete challenges they faced while trying to develop their craft in Mexico, where inventiveness becomes not a creative luxury but an obligation in an industry that depended, back then, mostly on public funding. \"For better or worse, in Mexico there are always obstacles,\" she told me. \"They had to learn to think outside the box.\"\n\nThis inventiveness carried over when the directors finally had more resources at their disposal. Under the hood of Gravity , for example, is an obsessive exercise in the geometry of filmmaking, engineered by Cuarón and Emmanuel Lubezki, his virtuoso cinematographer and another member of Mexico's historic filmmaking generation. Iñárritu's Birdman , for which he won the first of his two Oscars in directing, is an experiment in the art of the long take, with Lubezki's eyes once again at the viewfinder. The Revenant , a gorgeous and violent epic with a grueling production history that almost drove Iñárritu and his actors to the brink of insanity , and The Shape of Water , a product of del Toro's vivid and colorful imagination, are also exceptional and spellbinding pieces of filmmaking. Roma is but the latest example of Cuarón's ambition to experiment with cinema's sights and sounds, a drive so compulsive that it sparked a lively debate over whether viewers should avoid simply streaming the movie at home and instead head to the theaters, where its director's full powers are better on display.\n\nAnother factor that explains the rise of the three great Mexican directors is the way they have chosen to approach Hollywood itself. Instead of trying to shape the business to their own particular tastes, all three chose to, as Diego Luna explained it to me, \"play the industry's game\": earning their stripes as commercially viable directors in Hollywood while pushing for riskier, more complex projects. Luna told me that none of the three directors has ever just \"reacted to what the industry demands, which is generally some sort of repetition on a theme. Rather, they've always tried to find original ways into a story, always innovating and surprising the industry. The way they make decisions and how unafraid they are of failure ... I find that truly admirable.\"\n\nAnd then there's the sheer joy all three men derive from their craft. When I interviewed Cuarón in 2004 on the press tour for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban -widely praised as the series's best installment-he explained a theory he had come up with along with del Toro. \"Remember when your mom used to give you a big bowl of cereal in the morning and you had to finish before you could get to the prize, the small toy that was at the bottom of the box?\" Cuarón asked me, with a certain mischief. He went on to explain how both he and del Toro thought of the more commercial movies they had directed as the \"cereal\" that would allow them to make passion projects like The Devil's Backbone or Y Tu Mamá También , the fabled toys in the story. \"Now, Guillermo and I have a secret that we don't tell our mothers,\" Cuarón whispered with a playful grin. \"We love the cereal as well!\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "No Matter How Many Tildas Swinton It Contained, I Couldn't Enjoy Suspiria\n\nIn Slate's annual Movie Club, film critic Dana Stevens emails with fellow critics-this year, K. Austin Collins , Amy Nicholson , and Bilge Ebiri -about the year in cinema. Read the first entry here .\n\nDear friends,\n\nWith her tale of teaching documentary filmmaking in a refugee camp in Jordan, Amy offers an antidote to the sense of contraction and entrapment that's so prevalent in America right now: We should all just get as far out of the country as possible and experience the world through the eyes of someone radically different. The furthest away a 2018 release may have taken me, in time as well as place, was the never-named South American colony that was the setting of Lucrecia Martel's mordantly satiric Zama . Kam and Amy, I see that both of you, like me , have this one on your Top 10 lists for the year. How to describe the charms of a film so brutally uncharming in its subject matter? Zama is the intermittently violent but mostly static story of an 18 th -century colonial official, Don Diego de Zama-played with magisterial absurdity by Daniel Giménez Cacho-waiting year after year for a transfer out of the backwater settlement where he's posted. But as Martel's film unfolds in laconic, sometimes enigmatic vignettes, it becomes clear that not only is Zama going nowhere, there may be nowhere to go, then or now, that's free of the moral corruption that's rotting his world from the inside out.\n\nLos Angeles Times critic Justin Chang aptly described Zama as a \"dense, sweltering miasma of a movie\"; it lets you smell the humidity on the walls and the patriarchal oppression in the air. Though he writes self-martyring letters to a faraway wife and family, Zama has a child he ignores by a local indigenous woman (María Etelvina Peredez) who appears to despise him even as she submits to his crude advances. In an early scene he tries and fails to bed a noblewoman (Lola Dueñas) while a silent slave (Tendjyb Manigat) stands only feet from the two of them, wielding an intrusively creaky straw fan. Zama , based on a 1956 novel by the Argentinian writer Antonio di Benedetto, proceeds according to a jagged, dreamlike rhythm that can be alienating, but once you enter its world every visual and sonic detail has a nightmarish inevitability. If Martel's three previous masterpieces La Ciénaga , The Holy Girl , and The Headless Woman hadn't already done the trick, Zama would confirm her as one of the world's essential filmmakers.\n\nBilge, thanks for pitching me a fun-to-smash softball with that question about 2018 movies we thought would hit big but that somehow failed to catch on. I didn't share your personal excitement about First Man , but I admired its craft, its sparseness, and its resolute indifference to feel-good jingoism. (Only in 2018 would we have to spare three seconds for a ginned-up argument about whether Movie Neil Armstrong planted an American flag on the moon with sufficiently ostentatious patriotism.) Those closing scenes on the moon, with their silent pans of a blank, open expanse, felt somehow lonelier than any previous cinematic glimpse of the lunar surface. Framing a space-travel biopic not as a triumphal epic but as an intimate domestic drama with a less-than-happy ending was a bold (and maybe not that marketable) decision, but Damien Chazelle is a bold filmmaker, gifted beyond his years and commendably eager to take on new formal challenges. I won't be joining in the chorus of jeers until he makes a bad movie-and even then, why? We all deserve the chance to screw up.\n\nThe 2018 movie I would cite as one I went in certain I would love, and was confused and disappointed when I didn't, was Suspiria , Luca Guadagnino's remake of Dario Argento's giallo classic about a girls' dance academy run by murderous witches. Maybe it was just that diminishing-returns phenomenon that sometimes happens in films built around the occult-Amy, you observed this in the last 20 minutes of Hereditary , when all the richly suggestive questions the movie has raised about motherhood, memory, trauma, and grief narrow down to (spoiler alert?) a semicircle of naked people chanting in a treehouse. It's hard for plots about black-magic cults not to end on a discordantly silly note, especially if you, like me, regard slow psychological disintegration-what we assume may be happening in the first two-thirds of both Suspiria and Hereditary -as more deeply and lastingly scary than, say, sacrificing a goat with a pentagram shaved into its flank. (Not that that happens in either movie, but you know what I mean-every occult-themed horror flick has its own version of Pentagram Goat.)\n\nAs a Guadagnino enthusiast since his operatic melodrama I Am Love (which also starred a resplendent Tilda Swinton), I was excited to see what this artisan of color and mood would do with the painterly schlock of a B-movie maestro like Argento. I hoped either to sit through Suspiria in a state of sickening suspense or to luxuriate in its campy visual excesses. But this two-and-a-half-hour witchstravaganza never quite allowed for either reaction. Instead the movie's intricate structure seemed labored-again, as with The Favourite , all those fussy intertitled chapters!-and its attempt to incorporate a Holocaust subplot felt both cheap and strained. Casting Swinton in two roles-as the manipulative dance mistress and, credited under a fake name, as the old man who decides to investigate the suspected coven-was a playful coup on the director's part, but the movie itself is so leadenly un playful, so insistent on pointing up its own artfulness and multiplicity of meaning, that I wound up resenting Guadagnino's attempts to shock me with gangrenous dancers and up-close compound fractures.\n\nI tried to rewatch Suspiria a few weeks ago, wondering if a home viewing-which as Inkoo notes can sometimes allow for a different, more private response than encountering a movie in the company of an audience-would soften my irritation with what struck me the first time as its inordinate self-love. But I couldn't make it past that excellent early sequence in which Dakota Johnson's frenetic dancing operates as a kind of telekinetic weapon, remote-controlling the torture of another dancer in a separate room. I knew the movie would never get that viscerally scary again, and two and a half hours felt like a long time to wait around for a few dozen exploding ballerinas.\n\nKam, tell me not about your surprise disappointments of 2018 but about your moments of unexpected ravishment. What were some performances this year that showed you a new side of an actor you thought you had figured out, or introduced a previously unknown performer into your personal pantheon?\n\nOff to shave a pentagram into my goat,\n\nDana\n\nRead the previous entry .

      "text": "\"Coca Is Not Cocaine\"\n\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA-A leather-faced Indian wearing an embroidered technicolor ensemble sits down next to me in the waiting room of the Movement Toward Socialism (known in Spanish as MAS) headquarters, looking like he just stepped out of a time machine. I compliment him on his jazzy get-up. He smiles proudly and tells me, in broken Spanish, that it's Incan. I tell him I'm here to talk to Evo Morales. He nods knowingly and borrows my pen and paper to write his name and provenance. I read that he hails from the \"Regional Union of the Indigenous District of Raqay Pampa,\" a remote outpost three or four hours' drive from Cochabamba. He has undertaken a long journey to pay his respects to the chief.\n\nJust then, Evo Morales breezes into the waiting room, wearing chinos and a Polartec jacket. He looks more like an ad for Eddie Bauer than the leader of Latin America's best-organized indigenous movement. MAS party members and other hangers-on immediately clamor around him. Morales works the room, displaying a magnanimous concern for his people. At nearly 6 feet tall, he towers over his constituents, mainly poor farmers from the tropics of Cochabamba. But the crowd also includes the members of the press and city-dwellers, testimony to Morales' stature and broadening appeal.\n\nA longtime champion of Bolivia's coca growers and thorn in the side of pro-market governments, Evo, as they call him, is trying to refashion himself as the leader of all Bolivians. His strategy of uniting indigenous groups-long excluded from the Bolivian political system-with other disaffected voters nearly carried him to victory in the 2002 presidential election. He is ready for another go at the presidency, and if the October unrest that sent former President Sanchez de Lozada fleeing the country resumes, Morales may get his chance well before the scheduled 2007 elections.\n\nAs president, Morales would likely turn his \"coca is not cocaine\" battle cry into the law of the land, reversing nearly 20 years of U.S.-funded coca eradication and alternative development policy in Bolivia. Even more nettlesome to Washington, Morales makes no secret of his distaste for U.S.-backed neoliberal policies and American intrusion in the region. A Morales presidency would no doubt add Bolivia to the roster of populist Latin American governments inconvenient to the United States.\n\nOnce we are face-to-face in his office, Morales speaks bluntly about coca. \"The policies implemented by the United States in the war on drugs are a complete disaster,\" he declares emphatically, referring to the U.S.-funded coca-eradication campaign in Bolivia that has brought about the militarization of Chapare. He places the blame for the drug problem squarely on the American appetite for cocaine. \"The origin of narco-trafficking is the demand. The market. When you don't deal with the demand of the market, the problem is going to continue to grow.\"\n\n\"To defend the coca leaf is not to defend narco-trafficking,\" Morales says matter-of-factly, repeating the coca growers' refrain and the MAS party line as if it were the irrefutable truth. Though most Bolivians drink coca tea and many chew the coca leaf, this legal market is small. The coca growers distance themselves from the drug trade by claiming ignorance of the source of the demand for coca leaves. According to Morales, narco-trafficking should be stamped out everywhere, including in Bolivia, but coca production should be legal and subject to no limits, never mind that coca is the primary ingredient in cocaine.\n\nMorales describes the U.S.-funded alternative development effort in Chapare as a misguided policy that merely pushes poor farmers to produce crops for which there is little demand. His solution is a radical overhaul of the current policies. \"Rather than give us money for repression, why doesn't the international community support us by buying our [alternative] products at subsidized prices?\"\n\nFrom the drug war to neoliberalism, Morales stands firmly against what he sees as undue Yankee interference in the region. Chipper and relaxed, he conjures an image of a Pan-Latin force that faces down the U.S. hegemony: \"We have to look for Latin American unity. We have to strengthen the socialist movements, to stop the aggression of the imperialist.\" Morales sees a decisive role for the indigenous movement in this showdown. \"We are the nightmare of the United States, all because we represent a new politics of life, a politics of defense of humanity,\" he declares.\n\nA campaign poster that hangs on the wall behind him perfectly captures Morales' vision for the indigenous masses. Kitschy headshots of MAS members of congress, most in traditional clothing, are piled up under a blow-up of Morales wearing some sort of lei. A silhouette of a faceless Indian, illuminated by bright sunshine and brandishing a rainbow checkered flag-the symbol of indigenous unity-towers over them. Inscribed at the top is Indian insurrectionist Tupac Katari's legendary promise to the Spanish army before his execution in 1781: \"I will return, and I will be millions.\" As if to decipher the poster's rather unsubtle meaning, Morales declares, \"After 500 years of resistance, we've decided to change from resisting to seizing power, like absolute owners of this noble land.\"\n\nEver since he won an astonishing 20.9 percent of the vote, versus Sanchez de Lozada's 22.5 percent, in the last presidential election, Morales has watched his prestige soar internationally. Erstwhile curiosity of the Bolivian political scene, Morales now hobnobs with friends Hugo and Fidel. His editorials grace the pages of the Financial Times and the Washington Post . He recently had the dubious honor of receiving a peace prize from Muammar Qaddafi in Libya.\n\nOfficial U.S. distaste for Morales' coca politics and socialist ideas has only burnished his image at home. During the 2002 presidential election, the U.S. ambassador warned the Bolivian people that a Morales win would result in the withdrawal of hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid. The approach backfired, and outraged Bolivians voted for Morales in droves. Morales can barely conceal his delight when he recalls the embassy's gaffe. \"The enemies were transformed into the campaign managers of MAS and of Evo Morales,\" he quips.\n\nAmong Bolivians, Morales has capitalized on his image as a genuine man of the people in a sea of corrupt politicians. \"He's never betrayed us,\" insists MAS congresswoman Elena Almendras. Born to a Quechua mother and Aymara father, Morales ascended the ranks of Chapare's coca growers' union-known for the hard-nosed politics of its members-to become its most able leader. He cannily placed the cocaleros' cause at the forefront of the national dialogue by organizing road blockades that paralyzed the country. Bolivians recall the miserable Spanish he spoke early in his political career: Morales would frequently lapse into Quechua, the dominant indigenous language of Chapare, on the evening news.\n\nNow that his political ambitions have grown, Morales' challenge will be to soften his strong association-in the eyes of most Bolivians-with the coca growers. Congresswoman Almendras, who wears the traditional long braids, full skirt, and bowler hat of an indigenous woman, claims, \"MAS wants to lead all Bolivians, not just the coca growers. It wants to lead the Guaranis, the Aymara, the cocaleros , all the poor.\"\n\nBut Bolivian economist Fernando Bustamante remains skeptical. \"Evo has lots of problems at home, especially among other socialist groups. It's difficult to say that he's a national leader.\" Though six out of every 10 Bolivians are indigenous, Bustamante believes that uniting Bolivia's 30-plus indigenous groups under one political movement may be impossible. Morales' base of support is overwhelmingly concentrated in the tropical lowlands and high valleys in the center of the country. \"The Indians from the east, for example, will never recognize him as their leader,\" claims Bustamante.\n\nMoreover, the middle class is not likely to embrace MAS's plans for land reform and the socialization of the economy. \"I don't know what will happen to Bolivia. But, to be sure, the party of the cocaleros will not represent my interests,\" one young professional told me. \"Things will change for us, and for the worse. I'm thinking of leaving the country.\"\n\nBut, when asked how MAS will become the leader of all Bolivians, Morales is sanguine. Flashing a confident grin, he chirps, \"We already are.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Killers of the Flower Moon Is a New Kind of Scorsese Masterpiece\n\nWhen Martin Scorsese's Silence was released in 2016, I wrote that, though I ardently hoped it would not be his last, that meditative and deeply personal film would have made a fitting capstone to an illustrious career. In the seven years since, the now octogenarian master, his career well into its sixth decade, has made both another sweeping big-screen epic, The Irishman , and a project for the small screen, the playful semi-documentary Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story .\n\nIf he wanted to spend the remainder of his life resting on his laurels as one of the most beloved and influential artists in any medium, while continuing to be a force in the world of film preservation and a supporter of up-and-coming cinematic talent, his repose would be more than well-earned. But as is clear from Scorsese's soul-searching recent interviews (the one upside of the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike is that, by keeping actors from promoting new releases, it's given us extra Marty face time), the director of Mean Streets , Taxi Driver , Raging Bull , The King of Comedy , After Hours , The Age of Innocence , Goodfellas , The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street , and [insert your own celebrated masterpiece and/or underrated genre experiment here] has never been one for laurel-lounging. With Killers of the Flower Moon , an adaptation of the nonfiction bestseller of the same title by David Grann , Scorsese explores what is for him new terrain-his first Western, only his second feature (along with Kundun ) to foreground the lives of nonwhite characters, and one of the few (alongside The Age of Innocence and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore ) to place the experience of a female character, in this case the Osage woman Mollie Burkhart (Lily Gladstone), at or near the center of the story.*\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is set during the 1920s, when a series of brutal murders stretching over years sowed a climate of fear across a swath of oil-rich Oklahoma territory legally belonging to the Osage Tribe-but primarily and corruptly controlled by white businessmen, lawmen, and con artists. Like Silence, Killers of the Flower Moon is a cathedral of a movie, cavernously huge in ambition and scale, yet oddly intimate in its effect on the viewer. But if Silence was a cathedral in the austere Romanesque style, Killers is full-on Gothic, its surface a profusion of gargoyles, monsters, sinners, and saints.\n\nKillers ' setting, a lonely stretch of prairie dotted with frontier settlements (Gray Horse, Pawhuska, Fairfax, and a disreputable gambling outpost called Whizbang), has something in common with the urban jungles that have often served as the location for this filmmaker's work. In these unpaved mean streets, social hierarchies are overturned as well-off Osage families build and furnish grand houses, wear their wealth in the form of jewels and furs, and get around town in fashionable cars chauffeured by white servants. The intertitles of a silent newsreel that appears early on capture the combined sense of amusement and resentment that this carnivalesque reversal of norms creates in the wider culture. But for all their economic might, the Osage lack political and social power-or more accurately, the freedom to exercise that power, since many holders of underground mineral rights, including Mollie and her family, require white \" guardians \" to access their own money.\n\nPartly as a result of this legal setup, marriages between Osage women and white men in the territory are not uncommon. Two of Mollie's sisters already have white husbands, so it's no family scandal when Mollie marries her hired driver, Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), newly arrived in town after military service in World War I. Ernest's uncle is William King Hale (Robert De Niro), a powerful local rancher with a longstanding connection to the Osage community. \"Call me King,\" this soft-spoken yet lordly man tells his nephew by way of welcome. The ostensibly intimate moniker turns out to be a chilling sign of both Hale's authoritarian nature and the far reach of his influence.\n\nFrom the start, Ernest and Mollie's relationship has an economic element that both parties fully acknowledge. As he sweet-talks her late one night at her graciously appointed dining-room table, she parries his flirtation with the dry observation that \"Coyote wants money.\" But her joke is a form of flirting too, and Ernest laughingly acknowledges his appreciation for life's finer things. A good deal of time is spent early on establishing this fact, which will later become the movie's aching heart: For all the racial, social and economic divides that make their marriage fraught with the potential for exploitation, Mollie and Ernest are in love.\n\nUnlike Grann's suspensefully constructed book, Scorsese's adaptation never withholds the truth behind the two-dozen-plus murders that will eventually tear through the community. From the start we see how Hale manipulates the gormless Ernest, and hear how the older man's pious speeches at Osage religious and social events contrast with his private machinations. But the conspiracy to destroy Osage lives and capture Osage wealth extends its tentacles much farther even than Hale's circle of influence. Gradually the magnitude of the scheme expands to include the local doctors, two brothers who also happen to be the area's go-to undertakers; the insurance companies that make it easy for white settlers to collect hefty settlements on Indigenous lives and property; and the complicity, whether through malevolence or systemic neglect, of local, state, and federal officials. Late in the film, an officer from the United States' newly formed \"Bureau of Investigation\" shows up at the Burkharts' door to ask questions about the unsolved murders in Osage country, and what has for two-plus hours been a love story embedded in a portrait of organized crime suddenly morphs into a heart-pounding courtroom drama, as the weak-willed Ernest flails between his fear of his powerful uncle and his real, if twisted, loyalty to his broken, bereaved, but still trusting wife.\n\nAn early draft of the script, like Grann's book, paid considerable attention to the federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons), whom DiCaprio was at first slated to play. But in part at the actor's suggestion, Scorsese and his co-screenwriter Eric Roth ( Forrest Gump , Munich , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , the 2018 A Star Is Born ) did a complete rewrite, focusing instead on Mollie and Ernest's marriage and reducing White's role to the final hour of the film. Scorsese has said that this change was crucial to discovering what Killers of the Flower Moon should be: not a cops-versus-bad-guys whodunit but \" a template for that tragedy of love, trust, and betrayal of the Indigenous people .\" Without ever hammering the point home, the film makes Ernest's monstrous betrayal of Mollie a kind of scale model for the foundational American crime of Native American genocide, one that leads us to sense our own complicity in this vast web of violence.\n\nWhat's hard to convey in the format of a review is the enveloping, overpowering experience of watching Killers of the Flower Moon . The opening scene, in which an outdoor Osage ritual is interrupted by the sudden explosion of a geyser of black oil, is accompanied by a soaring score by Robbie Robertson, a part-Indigenous Canadian musician and longtime Scorsese friend who died earlier this year. The cinematography, worthy of an Old Master painting, is by Rodrigo Prieto ( The Wolf of Wall Street , Silence , The Irishman ). The almost dementedly intricate production design, created by the legendary Jack Fisk in his first collaboration with Scorsese, brings the past to life in the smallest and most unexpected details, such as a billiard parlor that contains its own in-house barber station. The costumes, splendidly imagined by Jacqueline West, also deliver jolts of surprise: Mollie's wedding outfit, while based on a historical photograph, fits into the time's popular image of neither a white nor an Indigenous woman.\n\nThe sense of idiosyncrasy and specificity that makes this film feel so different from a standard period Western comes not just from the craft side, but from the performances. As played by the stupendous Lily Gladstone, Mollie is quiet, watchful, reserved-but never stoic or pitiably long-suffering in the style of a stereotypical onscreen \"Indian.\" We see her experience longing, lust, grief, suspicion, forgiveness, and fury, even as she's obliged to conceal her true feelings-and the extent of her awareness of the deceit all around her-in order to survive in a white-controlled world. Scorsese has been criticized in the past for failing to deliver female characters as complex and believable as the men his movies usually showcase. In the portrait of Mollie Burkhart, embodied by a performer as intuitive and artful as any he's ever worked with, he has outdone himself. DiCaprio, too, gives a career-best performance as the deservedly miserable Ernest, who lacks both the brains and the backbone to resist the pernicious influence of his uncle (played by De Niro with a malignant cunning that can't help but evoke some of the skilled practitioners of false piety in our current political moment). In the late scenes where Plemons' straight-laced investigator interrogates Ernest with cool efficiency, the DiCaprio character's stammered self-contradictions and cowardly reversals even provide some dark and much-needed comedy.\n\nAt 3 hours and 26 minutes, Killers of the Flower Moon makes for a long sit even for those who've grown used to our era of ever-extending runtimes. It is never dull, though the scope of the storytelling and the sheer quantity of side characters are so enormous that the movie requires a fair amount of focus and concentration on the viewer's part. My only substantive critique of this sublime motion picture is that, as befits an epic on the David Lean scale, it could have used an old-school intermission. This would have provided a break for the audience's backs and bladders, but just as importantly, it could have allowed the jumbo-sized story a bit of room to breathe. I can even pinpoint the place in the narrative where such a pause might have made sense, perhaps accompanied by that gorgeous score as a way of keeping the audience anchored in the movie's world.\n\nI'll end not with the statement that Killers of the Flower Moon could stand as a worthy swan song for its creator (though that is certainly true), but with a profound wish that the swan keep singing. Scorsese has already spoken about his desire to adapt another nonfiction book by David Grann, The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder , and also chatted with no less a world figure than the Pope about making a film about the life of Jesus , something he's done before with 1988's controversial The Last Temptation of Christ . Killers ends on a breathtaking stylistic swerve, an epilogue that recasts the tale of the Osage murders in a storytelling medium other than film. I'll preserve the beautiful surprise of this sequence by noting only that it represents an unprecedented moment of self-disclosure and self-critique from an artist keenly aware of the moral responsibility he bears in recounting a true-crime story in which his ancestors, and those of any white member of the audience, were on the side of the criminals. His passion to keep making work that expands his and our sense of what art can and should do, and his ability to turn out one of the best films of his career this late in life, is proof that he is more than equal to the task of carrying on.\n\nCorrection, Oct. 12, 2023: This article originally misstated that Killers of the Flower Moon is Scorsese's first film to foreground nonwhite characters.

      "text": "The TV Club, 2018\n\nTo all my gentle, loving Tuunbaqs:\n\nIt's interesting to consider The Terror in this year of adaptation, because it's a series that really does change its source material in countless ways. Some of those changes are to account for better knowledge of what, precisely, happened to the HMS Terror and Erebus , knowledge we have now that their wrecks have been found at the bottom of the Arctic but that author Dan Simmons did not have when he published the novel of the same name in 2007. (Briefly: Both book and show are about a very real 1840s British naval expedition to the Arctic led by John Franklin that completely disappeared from the face of the Earth. What little we know of the men's fates includes that cannibalism was involved.)\n\nBut just as many of those changes were made to make the material fit 10 hours of television. The most consistent complaint about the series, for instance-that it starts a little slow-turned out to be a strength, to my mind, because it built out the show as a small-town drama (set on two ships) that started out in horror-movie territory and then spun more out of control with every episode, as the gigantic Tuunbaq (some kind of cross between a polar bear and a god) stalked the men across the ice. Using the first three episodes to establish the underpinnings of a well-known TV genre paid huge dividends in the last few episodes, as showrunners Soo Hugh and David Kajganich (who also wrote the wonderful new version of Suspiria ) brutally stripped away those underpinnings.\n\nAnd, finally, I appreciated how the series removed Simmons' male perspective and replaced it with something a little more eerie and omniscient. One need only look at the divergent fates of the one significant woman in the book and the series to see how thoroughly Simmons' book was reimagined as a cautionary tale about the limits of masculine codes, the sins of colonialism, and the dangers of poking the natural world until it pokes back. That's why something that bugged many other critics, and might normally bug me-the fact that the series was about a bunch of white guys (and one indigenous woman)-ultimately became a strength. The show understood why these codes inspire a sort of fond nostalgia in some, while also ruthlessly picking apart their flaws.\n\nI don't want to remove Kajganich, who wrote most of the season's best episodes, from this equation, but in Hugh, the series found someone like a TV Kathryn Bigelow-a writer fascinated by men and masculinity but also able to view it from an outsider's perspective and dissect the ways these codes sell short those who live under them. And in Jared Harris, Hugh and Kajganich found the exact actor needed to expose the flaws in those ideas and try looking for something new. The actor, always terrific, has never been better, and the final shot of him has hung with me all year, in a way little else has.\n\nThe Terror is a show where the ending made me rethink the beginning and made me like the whole even more. This is a risky strategy in television, which I still believe is at its best when it plays to the medium's episodic strengths, but when it works well, it pays considerable dividends. Shows from Lifetime's semi-astonishing, semi-trashy You to Homecoming to Sharp Objects to My Brilliant Friend -all, like The Terror , adaptations that altered their source material in interesting, occasionally too subtle, ways-pulled off similar feats. I didn't quite get Homecoming , for instance, until its final sequence of shots, when everything it had been trying to do snapped into place. Similarly, Sharp Objects ' final revelation was treated by many as a contrived \"big twist,\" but the \"twist\" underlined all the themes the series had developed all along about trauma and the way it gets passed down across generations.\n\nYou dovetails niftily with The Terror and a few of my other favorites we haven't discussed so far (notably Starz's Counterpart , a moody little spy series about parallel universe starring two J.K. Simmonses-what a gift!) as well as basically everything we have discussed so far: They're all shows about what you do when you realize the world you live in is irretrievably broken, and you're not sure either how to survive in it or how to build a better one. Even Nanette tackles this idea, in the unlikely form of the stand-up special. Deconstruction was everywhere, but it was happening within the confines of established genres, and it was more about the ways those genres build up their broken worlds and less how the rules of storytelling work.\n\nThis is why Atlanta rocketed to the top of my list when it debuted back in March and hasn't really left that spot-which is also thanks to the haunting image of Teddy Perkins in his crumbling manse, another one that's stuck with me for the whole year. Every episode of Atlanta is its own, distinctive thing, but it's also, subtly, playing around with some classic sitcom storytelling device, like an unusual encounter with a kooky guest star or trying to go out for a date with your girlfriend when mishaps keep befalling you, then caps It by unveiling the white privilege inherent in those familiar structures (something I wrote a lot more about here ).\n\nAtlanta is a very traditional comedy down in its bones , but it's also deeply indebted to pulling apart the ways that traditional comedy stories change irreparably when you put a black person in 2018 America at their center. It somehow straddles a best-of-all-possible-worlds scenario, where it's at once one of TV's most episodic shows but also telling a deeply serialized story filled with rich character development; it's at once hugely traditional and completely of the moment. Its status as a comedy speaks to how TV drama seems a little spooked by the present, setting its tales in alternate worlds or the past, where comedy keeps running at the present head on.\n\nIn the large collection of things we haven't talked about, it's probably worth shouting out late night (where I'm intrigued by Netflix's Patriot Act but feeling a little burned by how quickly the service churns through promising late-night shows before just ditching them entirely) and kid's programming (where I know Steven Universe remains a favorite of many and where Adventure Time had a hugely emotional, hugely affecting finale, even if I keep thinking it aired in 2013 or something). There's so much TV! But in this case, I think, that's a good thing-the artistic ambitions of programs that are out of the way and off the radar continue to grow, even as TV dramas can feel a little ossified.\n\nI definitely want to talk about the #MeToo ramifications of programming this year, especially when it came to BoJack , which apparently accidentally tackled the topic . But I've talked enough, and for once, I'm content to just shut up and listen.\n\nSadly no longer watching Grey's Anatomy , />Todd\n\nRead the previous entry .

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"My sister's murder will probably never be solved.\"\n\nby John Paul Brammer\n\nBridget Tolley simply wants justice for her mother.\n\nHer life changed on October 5, 2001, when her mother, Gladys, was struck by a police cruiser and killed.\n\n\"I started asking for a public inquiry into her death,\" Tolley, an Algonquin woman from the Kitigan Zibi reserve in Quebec, Canada, told Vox. \"There was so much wrong with the case. They didn't let the family identify the body. The brother of the cop that killed my mother was put in charge of the investigation.\"\n\nShe paused. \"Would you be okay with that?\"\n\nTolley, who grew up poor, said this sort of tragedy is a fact of life for many indigenous people in Canada - both those who live on reserves and those who move to urban areas. She said when she was a child, her father died after shooting himself in the heart. To cope, Tolley turned to drugs and alcohol, but she became sober after her mother's death. It was a necessary move, she said, because she was so angry with the police. They blamed her mother's death on alcohol.\n\nToday, Tolley is a leader in Families of Sisters in Spirit, a grassroots group led by indigenous women dedicated to seeking justice for Canada's missing and murdered indigenous women. Though indigenous women make up just 4 percent of Canada's female population, they represent 16 percent of women murdered in the country.\n\nA national inquiry into the missing women, a campaign promise from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is finally underway . But many questions remain.\n\nTolley said there are currently two women missing from her reserve. \"They went missing in 2008,\" she said. \"For me, they're missing. Not kidnapped. Not trafficked. Not until we know for sure.\"\n\nCanada's government defines a missing person as \"anyone reported to police or by police as someone whose whereabouts are unknown,\" Annie Delisle, head of media relations for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told Vox. \"They are considered missing until located.\"\n\nIf the missing person is under 18, Delisle said, she is classified as a missing child and will be considered missing until returned to appropriate care and control.\n\nHowever, Magen Cywink, an Ojibwe woman of the Whitefish River First Nation, told Vox that finding these missing women has been hindered by police undercounting them in the past or treating cases dismissively. The latter happened when the daughter of one of Cywink's friends went missing.\n\n\"They told [Cywink's friend] she'd be home soon,\" she said. \"'She's a teenager. She's out drunk.' It should be the families who decide who is missing. It should be whenever it's out of character for the woman to not be in contact.\"\n\nHer own sister, Sonya Nadine Cywink, was found murdered at an Aboriginal historic site, Southwold Earthworks, nearly 22 years ago. She was pregnant at the time. The Ontario Provincial Police said she died of blunt force trauma, and no suspects were identified.\n\n\"My sister's murder will probably never be solved,\" she told Vox. \"I'm not angry. I'm not vengeful. I can't be. I have to have a clear understanding of what needs to be done.\"\n\nBecause so many cases concerning missing indigenous women have fallen by the wayside, a need for a community-led database has risen to keep track of these women. Activist groups like It Starts With Us (with which Cywink is involved) and Sisters of Families in Spirit have stepped up to count the women police haven't identified as missing - women whose cases aren't being investigated or who go ignored.\n\nWhen an indigenous woman disappears, the reason is not always immediately apparent. Cold cases abound. Some families have been waiting for more than 20 years and bodies still haven't turned up. \"Missing\" is an umbrella term that can encompass them all.\n\nBut Tolley said she prefers the term \"stolen.\"\n\n\"They were taken from us,\" she said. \"They are stolen.\"\n\nA 2014 study by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police puts the number at nearly 1,200 murdered or missing indigenous women from 1980 to 2012. But indigenous rights groups dispute that claim.\n\nAudrey Huntley is a paralegal working for indigenous rights in Canada. She is also the co-founder of No More Silence, a support network for activists, academics, and researchers working to stop the murders and disappearances of indigenous women. She said the RCMP's count is much too low.\n\nBoth No More Silence and Sisters of Families in Spirit were created after the Conservative government of former Prime Minister Stephen Harper cut funding to the Native Women's Association of Canada, a group that was documenting cases of missing and murdered indigenous women, in 2010.\n\n\"A huge chunk of what we do is data collection,\" Huntley said. \"We have to. We look at every single case.\"\n\nThe organization has been working on a database in Ontario for about three years, Huntley said.\n\nAnother motive behind a community-led database is the lack of hard data on all fronts for indigenous people in Canada. Police crime records are scattershot, and police forces do not systematically collect ethnicity data. Police officers are not required to collect information on the race of suspects, and a study published in the Canadian Journal of Law and Society says Canadian law enforcement agencies suppress collection of racial data. Adding to this is the underreporting of domestic abuse, and general mistrust of police in indigenous communities.\n\nHuntley also stresses that trans people, two-spirit people , and sex workers are undercounted in these statistics.\n\nSo for a more accurate representation of the crisis, indigenous activists have turned inward toward their own communities before the police.\n\nThere is no clear profile of a person who kills or kidnaps indigenous women - attackers run the range from sex traffickers to serial killers, rapists, and even family members. There is no \"typical\" scenario. Instead, both indigenous activists and police point to systemic vulnerability.\n\nIndigenous women are vulnerable in all the ways other women in Canada are, only, to the extreme.\n\n\"It's the socioeconomic conditions that colonization and genocidal institutions that have made them vulnerable,\" Huntley said. \"Perpetrators know who they're going to get away with killing or not.\"\n\nIndigenous activists point to the legacy of colonialism in Canada for creating this environment - disenfranchisement from wealth, the push to put indigenous people on poor, isolated reserves, and the ongoing acts of cultural genocide against indigenous people.\n\nThe following are just some of the problems aboriginal people suffer from disproportionately:\n\nAccording to the RCMP , a common thread among many of the cases is sex work.\n\n\"The natives who move off isolated reserves,\" Cywink said, \"have trouble finding jobs. They are very poor. They get involved with sex work. They're the ones who are most vulnerable.\"\n\nCywink's sister Sonya turned to sex work after she moved to London, Ontario, from the reserve. She, like many women exploited by sex traffickers, faced sexual abuse early in life.\n\nAboriginal women also experience dramatically higher rates of violent victimization and sexual abuse in the home, with some 24 percent reporting assault from a current or former spouse.\n\n\"It seems like the women who get murdered on reserves are killed by domestic partners,\" Cywink said. \"Those are the murders that do get solved.\"\n\nWhere in Canada is this happening? The short answer: anywhere that indigenous women live, whether it's in a big city or on a far-off reserve.\n\n\"If you're in a remote community and a woman goes missing, then it's likely someone from that community,\" Huntley said. \"But in the city, that's violence from strangers.\"\n\nHuntley also noted the link between the presence of non-indigenous labor forces on indigenous land and higher instances of rape and murder.\n\n\"It's about the land,\" she said. \"You tend to see a skyrocket in rapes and STDs and HIV where things are being built.\"\n\nShe points to the areas where a dam is being built in the Peace River Valley region in British Columbia, where many First Nation and Métis people live, as a place of high activity of violence against indigenous women. Amnesty International has also pointed to the site as a violation of the rights of indigenous people.\n\n\"Where the land is violated, women are violated,\" Huntley said.\n\n\"If you look at the big cities - at Vancouver or Winnipeg - there are urban Indians there,\" Cywink said. \"Murders happen more often in those cities. Poor natives move off reserves to live there, and they are at high risk.\"\n\nThe hacker group Anonymous created a map of the missing and murdered indigenous women in 2013 using police data.\n\nEach case of a missing or murdered woman is represented with a red dot. Huntley notes that the police data is somewhat unreliable, but it does illustrate how dispersed the cases are throughout the country.\n\nDozens of indigenous women have also disappeared along Highway 16, which bisects British Columbia and passes many native reserves. Indigenous communities dubbed it the Highway of Tears because so many women have gone missing there. Signs warning against hitchhiking have been put up, as women hitchhikers are the most common target along the highway. It's gotten so bad that a bus route is being planned to address the needs of women traveling along the highway - 10 years after a bus route was initially proposed.\n\nAnd how long has this been happening? \"Since 1492,\" Huntley said, referencing Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas.\n\nHuntley and other indigenous activists point to Canada's legacy of anti-aboriginal institutions, particularly the traumatic history of residential schools. They were created for the forced assimilation of indigenous people into Euro-Canadian culture. They were also sites of frequent physical and emotional abuse; as Cywink put it, they were made to \"kill the Indian to save the man.\"\n\nHuman rights groups have called the residential schools - the last of which closed in 1996 - institutions of cultural genocide. As many as 6,000 indigenous children have died there after generations of rape , abuse, and suicides.\n\nLast year, Justice Murray Sinclair, the first aboriginal judge appointed in Manitoba province in Canada and the current chair of the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said in a report that these schools share a \"devastating link\" with large numbers of missing and murdered aboriginal women. One element at play was the systemic lack of attention for victims of abuse.\n\nA national inquiry into the missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada was a key campaign pledge from Prime Minister Trudeau, which he fulfilled at the end of 2015 . He also promised to increase funding for programming and to review laws affecting aboriginal communities.\n\nLast month, Trudeau met with indigenous leaders in Vancouver to discuss the much-anticipated inquiry. In June he became the first sitting prime minister to be interviewed by an aboriginal media network , and he acknowledged the role of preserving indigenous culture in improving the mental health of indigenous people.\n\nIt's yet another small step forward for a government that has historically ignored the problems facing its indigenous peoples.\n\nBut if this has been happening to indigenous women since European colonialism began on the continent, then why now?\n\nPart of it is increased media attention. In 2014, a particular case involving a murdered child made headlines across Canada.\n\nThe body of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine was pulled from the Red River near the Alexander Docks in Winnipeg. Her body was wrapped in a bag. For many Canadians, her death was their wake-up call. This, paired with the shift in government from Prime Minister Harper to the liberal Trudeau, opened the opportunity for an inquiry.\n\n\"Harper ... was never going to do this from the get-go, and he was in office for 12 years,\" Cywink said. \"They've asked for an inquiry since the early '90s. It's fallen on deaf ears.\"\n\nIt was after Fontaine's case that Harper made a statement on the missing and murdered indigenous women, saying he opposed a national inquiry and that the situation was best handled by police.\n\nBut ultimately, it was the tireless work of indigenous rights activists that finally brought the issue to light.\n\n\"Over a quarter of a century, do you believe that?\" Cywink said. \"That's half of my life that I've been marching. Why now? They should have done this a long time ago. We needed it 25 years ago.\"\n\nThe inquiry will commission research and testimony on the missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada. It's meant to yield recommendations on how to remedy the situation.\n\nBut while there was a hard push for the national inquiry and it received the support of most Canadians, most are cynical about its outcome.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, 79 percent of Canadians supported the inquiry, but 48 percent of those polled were pessimistic about the outcome of the inquiry; 35 percent called the problem \"basically unresolvable.\"\n\nCywink shares this skepticism. She attended an event in Winnipeg before the formal inquiry process kicked off. She described it as, \"basically a sham.\"\n\n\"Not many families got to share their stories,\" she said. \"We were put at a table with a bunch of bureaucrats.\"\n\nShe says if the inquiry does not work closely with the families of the victims, the government might as well \"flush it down the toilet.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the groups that rose up to continue the work - Families of Sisters in Spirit, It Starts With Us, and No More Silence - remain directly involved with the families of victims. Indigenous activists say it's the families, not the government, who will lead the way to addressing this problem.\n\nDonations to these groups assist in much-needed data collection, paying legal fees of family members, and tracking new cases.\n\nAs the national inquiry inches forward, indigenous activists said they hope to be consulted on every part of the process. But recommendations from past inquiries on aboriginal communities have not been heeded, and so doubt remains.\n\nA legacy of colonialism has ravaged Canada's aboriginal communities - yet they survive to this day. And the advocates involved say they maintain hope for answers.\n\n\"If I didn't have that tiny bit of hope,\" Bridget Tolley said, \"I wouldn't be able to go on.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

      "text": "Why the way we talk about Yalitza Aparicio's journey to the Oscars matters\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Roma actress has been lauded for her style - but she's also been the target of racist attacks.\n\nby Gaby Del Valle\n\nLess than a year ago, Yalitza Aparicio was an unknown preschool teacher from a small town in Mexico. Now Aparicio, who was nominated for Best Actress for her role in Alfonso Cuarón's Roma , is a red-carpet regular whose style and unexpected rise to fame often make headlines. Vogue predicted that the 25-year-old actress is \"about to emerge as a true fashion icon.\" Fashionista called her a \"style star to watch.\" Her Golden Globes look, a silky baby pink Prada dress, got her a spot on a handful of best-dressed lists, including Glamour's and the Cut's . And tonight at the Oscars, Aparicio wore another pastel, princessy gown: a tulle seafoam green dress with a sparkly bodice by Rodarte.\n\nAparicio is undoubtedly this year's breakout star. Her life story and red-carpet style are often used to frame her rise to fame as a real-life Cinderella story: A young indigenous Mexican woman gets plucked from obscurity by a world-renowned director, delivers an incredible performance, and then goes on to enjoy all the trappings of celebrity.\n\nThis framing, while technically correct, reveals an ugly truth about Hollywood: Despite recent strides made with regards to diversity and inclusion, Aparicio's newfound celebrity status is still considered extraordinary. In Hollywood, women like Aparicio are considered the exception, not the norm.\n\nUnlike most of her fellow nominees in the Best Actress category, Aparicio has no previous acting experience . (Lady Gaga, the only other nominee with no previous major movie roles under her belt, has the benefit of being an international pop star.) Aparicio's unlikely stardom has been a point of intrigue since Roma 's release. Born and raised in Tlaxiaco, a small community in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, Aparicio studied to be a teacher and had no desire to be an actress; she wasn't even particularly interested in watching movies, she said in a recent interview with the LA Times , because she never saw people who looked like her represented onscreen. Her father is Mixtec; her mother is Triqui. Neither demographic is particularly well represented in Mexican media, where celebrities tend to be lighter-skinned - descendants of the colonizers, not of those who were colonized - and more than 70 percent of indigenous people live in poverty.\n\nAparicio only attended the casting call for Roma , she said in interviews, because her older sister wanted to audition but couldn't do so because she was pregnant. After being offered the role, she reportedly accepted by telling Cuarón, whose movies she had never seen, \"I have nothing better to do.\"\n\n\"I had just graduated. I had to pay back the loans I took to get my degree,\" Aparicio said in the LA Times profile, one of the few pieces to challenge the Cinderella story narrative head-on. \"I thought, my mother will be proud and I can use this to pay for my expenses.\"\n\nNotably, Aparicio is the second Mexican woman ever to be nominated for an Oscar in the Best Actress category, as well as the first indigenous woman in the Americas to receive the honor.\n\nAparicio's story isn't just extraordinary; it's groundbreaking. And it's clear that there are still people who don't know how to deal with it. Despite the accolades Aparicio has received since Roma debuted at the Venice International Film Festival in August, the actress has also been the target of racist attacks, especially in her home country. Her newfound fame hasn't served as a shield from the racist vitriol - if anything, her celebrity status has only exacerbated it.\n\nIn November 2018, Aparicio posed for a Vanity Fair spread in which she wore beautiful vintage-inspired Gucci and Prada blouses. The response was troubling. \"Although she dresses in silk, she's still an Indian,\" one commenter wrote in Spanish . \"By trying to be inclusive, [these magazines] only fuck things up more,\" said another . \"I think they're making her look ridiculous.\" A month later, Aparicio became the first indigenous woman to appear on the cover of Vogue México. In a January interview with the New York Times , Karla Martinez, the editor-in-chief of Vogue México and Vogue Latinoamérica admitted that the racist and classist responses to the Vanity Fair photos made her worry about how people would react to Aparicio's Vogue cover.\n\nMore recently, Mexican actor Sergio Goyri criticized the Academy for nominating Aparicio, whose character in the film he referred to as a \"fucking Indian who says 'Yes ma'am, no ma'am,'\" for the Best Actress category. Aparicio, for her part, used Goyri's racist tirade as a teaching moment. \"I am proud to be an Oaxacan indigenous woman,\" she said in a statement , \"and it saddens me that there are people who do not know the correct meaning of words.\"\n\nThe reactions to Aparicio's rise to prominence, both positive and negative, are indicative of the discrimination indigenous people face in Mexico and throughout Latin America and the dearth of indigenous representation in movies and other media. Even the \"Cinderella story\" framing of her discovery by a famous director underscores how unlikely her fame is - not because of a lack of talent, but because of a lack of complex, dynamic roles written with women like Aparicio in mind. Fans and critics alike have treated Aparicio as a de facto standard-bearer not only for indigenous Mexicans, but also for indigenous women across the Americas. Aparicio is well aware of this.\n\n\"I know that everything that I am doing - if I do something wrong, they might think we are all that way. So I have to take good care of that image, our image,\" she told the LA Times earlier this month. She made a similar point in a February interview with NBC : \"I'm showing off the diversity we have in Mexico. I'm representing this community that is extremely talented, but sometimes, we don't notice them. I feel this responsibility because I feel the need to represent them in the right form that they deserve.\"\n\nTonight on the Oscars red carpet, she had a similar message for her community in Oaxaca. \"Thank you for all the support you've given me,\" she said in an interview. \"I hope I'm representing you with dignity.\"\n\nSo what comes next? In a February 20 interview with ET Online, Aparicio revealed that she has received \"a lot of offers\" for new roles. \"But because of the timing,\" she said, \"I haven't been able to commit to anything because I want to make sure I give it my all.\"\n\nHopefully Roma is just the beginning for her. But until Hollywood begins supporting - and casting - more indigenous women, Aparicio will be forced to carry the weight of representing a large, diverse group of people on her own.\n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?

She is a member of the Kokama people, who live deep in the Amazon rainforest, on the shore of the Solimões River, bordering Colombia and Peru.\n\nTwo months later, the Kokama had registered the highest number of Covid-19 deaths among Indigenous people in Brazil: Nearly 60 people, according to Brazil's Indigenous People Articulation (APIB), a national nonprofit organization. Among them was the Kokama leader Messias Kokama .\n\nMany Kokama villages, which are accessible only by boat, have implemented checkpoints to keep out non-Indigenous people during the pandemic. However, the hospital in Tabatinga, the nearest city with the most infrastructure to treat patients, is overwhelmed - meaning those in greater need must be taken to Manaus, almost 700 miles away, by plane.\n\nMeanwhile, Indigenous leaders across the country say federal government agencies have not provided them with sufficient support to combat this pandemic - like universal access to food and health care, which are guaranteed by federal law, and enough protection in their lands so they can isolate without the threat of being invaded (and infected with coronavirus from land grabbers).\n\n\"We are calling on this government, or lack of government, to be held responsible for the death of our people, and asking the federal attorney's office to help us get compensation all the deaths in our Kokama family due to Covid-19,\" Edney Samias, one of the Kokama's caciques, or leaders, told me.\n\nBrazil has almost 900,000 Indigenous people, of over 300 different ethnicities. Around 64 percent live in Indigenous areas - lands that, by the Constitution, are supposed to be owned and exclusively enjoyed by Indigenous people and currently make up 14 percent of the country's square footage. Over 180,000 Indigenous people live in the state of Amazonas, where the Kokama reside, which has been the hardest-hit area in cases per capita.\n\nAccording to official figures reported by the Health Ministry's Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health (SESAI), nearly 4,200 Indigenous people have tested positive for Covid-19, and almost 120 have died. However, the death estimates from Indigenous communities and groups are much higher: Over 320 deaths - 144 in Amazonas alone - as of June 20, further showing the disconnect between Indigenous people and the government's response.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently minimized the dangers of Covid-19, describing it as \" a little cold \" and calling alarm over the pandemic \" hysterical .\" He has undermined isolation orders imposed by state governors, called for the country to reopen despite the growing outbreak and even personally attended anti-lockdown protests . In the meantime, Brazil reached more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases last weekend .\n\nBolsonaro's lack of coordinated response to Covid-19, coupled with his desire to reopen the economy too quickly, has positioned Brazil to become the next epicenter of the pandemic . And now Indigenous people have to rely on a government that neglects them - and on a president who wants to \" integrate \" them into the rest of the society.\n\nBrazil's coronavirus outbreak has soared since the first case to be confirmed was reported in late February : Not only are there over a million confirmed positive cases, there are nearly 51,000 reported deaths in the country, as of June 22. However, due to the lack of widespread testing, the numbers are likely far higher - the latest national study estimates cases are at least seven times higher than officially reported.\n\nIn the first week of June, the government temporarily stopped publishing overall data on Covid-19 cases and deaths, and only the ones of the day-of. The move - called by Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes a \"maneuver of totalitarian regimes\" - was quickly overruled, but it showed Brazil has further isolated itself from the rest of the world during the pandemic.\n\nThe worst affected area in cases per capita is the state of Amazonas - 64.1 deaths per 100,000 people, compared to around 24.1 nationwide, according to the Health Ministry on June 21. In Manaus, which is the closest big city for many Indigenous communities and their place of last resort for medical treatment, the public health care system collapsed between April and May.\n\nThe city has made international headlines due to its cemeteries and funeral services being grotesquely overwhelmed. New trenches were dug and refrigerated containers installed to accommodate the spike in deaths. One family even reportedly had to bury their father themselves because of the lack of gravediggers.\n\nAccording to a study published by the Federal University of Amazonas this month, Manaus will be the first Brazilian city to \"beat\" the coronavirus, projecting a drastic reduction in the speed of deaths in the city since peaks in the past couple months. However, cases are moving to rural areas, where most Indigenous communities are located. In June, one-third of reported cases happened outside of capitals and metropolitan regions.\n\nSamias said Kokama people are scared to go to hospitals and die away from their families, and many would rather die at home. \"My uncle Idelfonso Tananta told me he would rather die hugging his children, grandchildren, and wife,\" he recounted. \"And that day eventually came.\"\n\nAfter visiting a doctor and being told to isolate at home, Tananta continued to get worse. \"One evening he started feeling really sick and out of breath, he went to the bathroom and collapsed there. They put him in the hammock and he fell on the floor, where he took his last breath, hugged his children and wife, smiled, and died.\"\n\nSamias also mentioned that after people stopped going to hospitals, the number of deaths decreased. \"Only those with below 40 percent [oxygen] saturation go to the hospital. Other than that, they are being treated with traditional medication and Ayahuasca.\"\n\nSince April, as cases among Indigenous people began to appear, the governor of Amazonas and both former health ministers have promised to build a hospital dedicated exclusively to Indigenous people. And on May 25, the Health Ministry announced the inauguration of a wing for Indigenous people in a hospital in Manaus dedicated exclusively for Covid-19 patients.\n\nHowever, those Indigenous people living outside of Indigenous areas cannot be admitted into the wing. These people (36 percent of Indigenous people in the country live in urban areas) are also not allowed to be treated by Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts (DSEIs) - which are SESAI's primary care networks within Indigenous areas - and must depend on the country's universal health care system or military hospitals.\n\nIn Tabatinga, Samias's father faced this problem. Since he lived in the outskirts of Tabatinga, he had to be taken to a military hospital and was put on a list to be transferred to Manaus. For days, Samias waited for a plane to arrive, but was never given a clear timeline of when or even if it would happen. The doctor \"told me it depends on the government and can't inform me if it's coming or not. We're counting on luck.\"\n\nWhen patients do finally get to a hospital, many are not counted as Indigenous. \"This for us is very worrisome because we have Indigenous [people] in an urban context for a variety of reasons: They came for work, to study, cities have expanded into their villages. And when they are going to hospitals, they are accounted as normal citizens ... because there is no Indigenous ethnicity on forms,\" said Sonia Guajajara, the executive coordinator of Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil.\n\nThis helps explain the discrepancy in official reported cases and deaths among the Brazilian Indigenous population and those from Indigenous groups. And the problem with not having accurate numbers is that it leads to a lack of necessary measures to fight the spread of the virus.\n\nThe contingency plan to protect native communities during the pandemic, many criticized, didn't address the specific local needs of each Indigenous community, nor the shortage of resources in the entire country: It relied on DSEIs to develop and carry out their own detailed plans.\n\nThe problem with DSEIs is not only are they dependent on SESAI for purchases of materials - like PPE and fuel - but they also most lack infrastructure for even basic care, let alone coronavirus testing and treatment.\n\nCarlos Alberto Llevado is a Cuban doctor who from 2013 to 2016 worked in São Gabriel da Cachoeira in Alto Rio Negro (a region with one of the largest populations of Indigenous people in the country) as part of a federal government program implemented by former President Dilma Rousseff that placed medical professionals in marginalized communities throughout Brazil.\n\nHe recalled worrisome conditions in the districts he worked in due to mismanagement of funds and lack of government oversight. \"I remember a photo of the ceiling [of a health center] filled with bats, and their feces dripping down the walls,\" Llevado told me.\n\nIn 2009, only 63 percent of the overall Indigenous population in Brazil, and 35.5 percent of those within Indigenous areas, had access to clean water, according to the government. Llevado said that of the few places that had water storage containers, many didn't have tops, and would consequently have animal waste in them. \"I visited communities that had never seen clear water before - they only used river water. As the name says, Alto Rio Negro [Black River], the water looks like watered wine.\"\n\nBeyond health care, many families have to travel great lengths and stand in long lines to receive social benefits, such as Bolsa Familia - a federal government program launched in 2003 to provide financial aid to poor families in the country, and was estimated to serve over 100,000 Indigenous families in 2014.\n\nBefore stay-at-home orders were enacted in the Solimões region on March 22, many Kokama were still traveling to cities to get their benefits, where they were likely exposed to the virus. \"The decree came too late,\" said Glades Rodrigues, the president of the nonprofit organization Kokama-kukamiria Indigenous Federation of the People of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. \"A lot were already infected because of the due date to receive benefits and salaries. And everyone comes to the city, since there are no banks in our communities.\"\n\nSince people are being told to stay at home and can no longer travel to cities to get their aid, the delivery of food baskets (known as cestas basicas) - which provide products like rice, beans, coffee, and oil - to these communities is urgently asked for.\n\n\"At this time, we need food baskets to be taken to our communities, not the emergency assistance money,\" Samias said, echoing what Indigenous leaders have been asking from the government. \"Through donations we're able to, little by little, give food baskets to hungry families, since they couldn't get the emergency assistance.\"\n\nTo help address this problem, the Minister of Women, Family and Human Rights, Damares Alves, announced the delivery of over 310,000 food baskets to 154,000 Indigenous families beginning in May, with the help of the National Indian Foundation (Funai) - which is in charge of protecting and promoting the rights of Indigenous people, including health, education and land demarcations - as well as the National Supply Company (Conab), linked to the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nThe purchase of these food baskets is being done by the Conab with money from the ministry and the delivery done by the 39 regional units of Funai, which told me they would use \"preventive measures guided by the health agencies in order for the action to take place in a safe and effective manner\" - but have not detailed what the preventive measures are nor the logistics for delivery.\n\nIn a press conference on June 9, Alves said that the baskets were purchased and that in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, all destined baskets had arrived. The Federation of Indigenous Organizations of Rio Negro has said they weren't officially notified of the operation and have no information of where these baskets were delivered. APIB has demanded that the ministry officially inform what communities received deliveries, \"in order to prove the veracity of the information given.\"\n\nAs of June 14, just over 105,000 baskets of the 310,000 promised had been delivered.\n\nOn top of that, experts fear that the scrapping of Funai over the years, which under Bolsonaro suffered a 40 percent cut in the government's 2020 budget, increases the risk that Indigenous people will not be properly cared for during the pandemic.\n\nFrom the additional 10.8 million Brazilian reals ($2 million) in emergency funds Funai received from the federal government to be used in the fight against the pandemic, almost 10 percent was spent for the purchase of new vehicles and maintenance of ones they already had.\n\nBut there's another layer to this problem: Bolsonaro's pick for the head of Funai in July 2019, Marcelo Xavier da Silva - who, shortly after taking the post, said Indigenous land demarcation would stop being based on \"ideological\" criteria . He also has strong ties with Nabhan Garcia, a senior agriculture minister, who \" froths hate for Indigenous people, \" according to da Silva's predecessor, General Franklimberg de Freitas.\n\n\"We used to have structural problems with Funai. Now, we also have ideological problems,\" said Guajajara.\n\nIn April, for example, Funai set new rules for issuing Declarations of Recognition of Land Limits, which forced landowners to respect the boundaries between their lands and those of the Indigenous peoples (even if those lands were still in the process of official demarcation). Under new guidance, Funai will only issue the declaration for reserves and Indigenous lands approved or regularized by presidential decree.\n\nThis directly impacts Indigenous people's safety, given there are currently 237 areas waiting for official demarcation, which are now at risk of being sold, divided, or invaded in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nGoing back to his campaign days in 2018, Bolsonaro has made clear his intentions to open up the Amazon for commerce and extinguish territorial protections for Indigenous populations. During his first year as president, deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest rose to its highest in a decade, according to data from Brazil's space research agency (INPE) - coinciding with efforts to scale back the fight against illegal mining, logging, and ranching.\n\nInvasions in Indigenous lands also hit a record in 2019 - according to an analysis by CIMI (Indigenist Missionary Council), there were 160 cases of \"possessory invasions, illegal exploitation of natural resources and various damage to property\" in Indigenous areas, an increase of 40 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nAnd yet, Bolsonaro has said that as long as he is president \" there [will be] no demarcation of Indigenous lands .\" On the second day of his mandate, Bolsonaro tried to transfer the right to land demarcation from Funai to the Ministry of Agriculture - a move that stoked fears that preserved areas would be opened up to greater commercial exploration and controlled by interests opposed to environmental preservation. The decision was eventually overruled by the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd in the midst of the pandemic, deforestation in the Amazon increased over 50 percent in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the same period last year. Indigenous lands are also being invaded , coinciding with the lack of oversight in the rainforest and the exoneration of two inspection chiefs from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources after a massive operation in April to remove illegal loggers and miners from Indigenous lands in the state of Pará.\n\nIn the absence of leadership from the government, NGOs, public figures, and politicians have spoken out. In a letter to the World Health Organization on April 23, the Mixed Parliamentary Front in Defense of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples - a caucus launched in 2019 to further Indigenous rights in Brazil's Congress - called for specific measures, like an emergency fund for Indigenous people to ensure their protection during the pandemic.\n\nJoenia Wapixana, the first Indigenous woman elected as a federal deputy in Congress , is working with other parliamentarians to strengthen the contingency plan for Indigenous people in Brazil.\n\nIn March, she proposed a bill for additional resources to the Indigenous Health Care Subsystem, providing monetary aid, an increase in health care infrastructures to handle those in need of hospitalization, and the strengthening of territorial protections.\n\nThe bill was approved in Congress with some modifications, such as guaranteeing the stay of missionaries in areas of isolated communities and restricting aid to Indigenous who live in villages - a move that was vehemently criticized by Indigenous groups. It is currently awaiting presidential authorization.\n\nIndigenous leaders say Bolsonaro's government still needs to do more. \"There is an action from the government, but it is insufficient to meet current needs or demand. And then it is up to us, the Indigenous people, to put this pressure on the responsible bodies so that they can implement what was already authorized. But we cannot assume this responsibility that belongs to the government,\" Guajajara told me.\n\nIn the meantime, Indigenous people are suffering. Kokama received food baskets from Funai in mid-May, but are still heavily relying on donations of food and hygiene products for those in need. On May 14, Edney Samias's father died while he was still waiting to be taken to Manaus. The last time Samias had seen his dad was when he was admitted to the hospital.\n\n\"I'm tired of speaking, I don't know what to say anymore,\" Samias told me. \"But we are here, asking the world to listen, to hear our cry.\"\n\nMariana Castro is a Brazilian journalist based in New York City.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDomestic workers are trying to reverse 100 years of exclusion from US labor laws. Hollywood is helping.\n\nby Alexia Fernández Campbell\n\nOne of the most thankless professions in the US - and one of the fastest-growing - had its moment in the spotlight Sunday during the 91st Academy Awards ceremony.\n\nAs he received an Oscar for the movie Roma , Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón paid tribute to millions of housekeepers and nannies who spend their lives taking care of other families.\n\n\"I want to thank the Academy for recognizing a film centered around an indigenous woman, one of the 70 million domestic workers around the world without work rights, historically relegated to the background of the cinema,\" he said during his acceptance speech for the Best Director award.\n\nThe movie's central character, Cleo, is a housekeeper of Mixtec heritage (one of Mexico's largest indigenous groups) who works for an affluent family in 1970s Mexico City. The portrayal of Cleo by Yalitza Aparicio, an indigenous actress from Oaxaca, drew international praise and sparked discussions about the lack of indigenous representation in pop culture. The movie also drew applause from housekeepers, nannies, and other domestic workers who often feel invisible in the global economy.\n\nDomestic workers in the US are taking advantage of the Roma buzz to raise awareness about their second-class status in the US workforce. They want the public to realize that housekeepers, nannies, and home health aides have fewer rights than other workers: Most of them aren't protected from sexual harassment and discrimination under federal law, and they don't have the right to unionize. They've been campaigning to change that, and now they've enlisted Hollywood's help.\n\nLast week, Cuarón recorded a public service announcement supporting the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, a congressional bill that would give all domestic workers the same legal rights afforded to other workers, plus some new ones: paid sick days, regular scheduling, and retirement benefits.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) plan to introduce the bill this spring, according to the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents about 2 million nannies, housekeepers, and home health aides across the country.\n\n\"This [bill] will provide us with the respect, dignity, and recognition that we all deserve,\" June Barrett, a home health aide from South Florida, told me. Barrett has been advocating for the bill, and got the chance to meet Cuarón Sunday in Hollywood during a red carpet event for domestic workers. She's worked as a nanny and housekeeper for more than 14 years, she told me, and said the story of Cleo in Roma was her story, too, and the story of millions of poor women who leave their own families to take care of someone else's.\n\nThe domestic workers' campaign is part of a broader effort to mobilize an isolated workforce that is often overlooked and exploited under the law. It's also an attempt to gain economic security for one of the fastest-growing and lowest paid occupations in the US.\n\nOnly one industry is expected to grow faster and add more jobs to the US economy than domestic work in the coming years: the renewable energy business.\n\nAfter that, home health aides and personal care assistants are expected to be the fastest-growing occupations within the next decade - with about 1.2 million new positions added to the US economy between 2016 and 2026, according to the latest estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .\n\nThat spike is expected for two main reasons. First, the baby boomer generation is aging, and a growing number of families will likely hire aides to help care for them at home. Second, the expansion of Medicaid insurance under the Affordable Care Act has made it possible for more low-income families to cover the cost of home care services.\n\nBut even though domestic workers are in high demand, they are among the lowest-paid workers in the country, and most get no benefits. The median annual salary for a home health aide was $23,000 in 2017 , slightly above the $20,420 federal poverty level for a family of three. About 88 percent of domestic workers don't have paid time off or other benefits either.\n\nCongress is largely to blame for this.\n\nWhen Congress first passed federal labor protections in the 1930s as part of the New Deal, they excluded two groups of workers: domestic workers and farm workers.\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), for example, excluded both groups from the right to earn the minimum wage or get overtime pay. Farmworkers and domestic workers were left out as a concession to Southern lawmakers, whose states were highly invested in paying low wages to personal servants.\n\nAt the time, that workforce was overwhelmingly black and Latinx, and excluding them from a minimum wage was intentional. Today, about a quarter of farmworkers and 67 percent of housekeepers earn less than the minimum wage.\n\nLawmakers later amended the FLSA in the 1970s to cover most domestic workers, but not live-in housekeepers and nannies. Farmworkers are still excluded from the law.\n\nBoth groups were also excluded from the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which gave workers the right to form labor unions and organize for better working conditions.\n\nThen, when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, domestic workers were left out inadvertently. The law didn't include protections for workers whose employers have fewer than 15 employees. That means it's technically legal for employers to sexually harass their nannies and housekeepers, or to discriminate against them based on race, religion, gender, or national origin.\n\nThe same thing happened a few years later, in 1970, when Congress passed the Occupational Health and Safety Act . The landmark labor law, which established a worker's right to a safe and healthy work environment, also left out domestic workers and farmworkers.\n\nThis is not a tiny part of the workforce. More than 12 million US workers - about 10 percent of the workforce - worked for firms with fewer than 10 employees in 2017, according to data from the Department of Labor (the data set does not have a category for firms with fewer than 15 employees).\n\nMillions of them are housekeepers, nannies, home health care aides, and other occupations made up mostly of women of color. They're also farmworkers who harvest crops at small family farms.\n\nThese overlooked workers are now demanding equal treatment from Congress. Last week, House Democrats introduced the Fairness for Farm Workers Act, which would give agriculture workers the same minimum wage and overtime protections as the rest of the US workforce. Domestic workers are also campaigning for equal rights under federal law.\n\nThe fact that housekeepers and nannies can't unionize has made it hard for them to fight congressional efforts to exclude them from labor protections. So instead, they began organizing at the national level in 2007, launching the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The nonprofit group advocates for housekeepers across the country, and has pushed change at the state level.\n\nSo far, eight states have passed laws extending labor protections to domestic workers: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Nevada. In July, the city of Seattle did too.\n\nNow the group is taking their campaign to Capitol Hill. Hundreds of domestic workers have been traveling to Washington, DC, in the past year to talk to lawmakers about their need for federal labor protections. In April, a group of them met with Harris, Jayapal, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\n\nAnd Democratic lawmakers are listening.\n\nIn November, Harris and Jayapal announced their plan to introduce the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. They are currently drafting the bill, and domestic workers expect it to be introduced this spring.\n\nThe bill would close all the loopholes in federal labor laws that exclude domestic workers. It would also require employers to give them meal breaks, rest breaks, and some paid sick days. In addition, employers would have to establish fair scheduling practices and a system for workers to report sexual harassment.\n\n\"Passing this Bill of Rights will demonstrate that domestic work is not only work, but work that is critical to our economy and society,\" wrote Harris, Jayapal, and Ai-Jen Poo in a November op-ed for CNN. \"We must extend protections to those who have been silenced and overlooked for decades.\"\n\nDomestic workers are not so silent anymore. Not only have they persuaded high-profile Democrats in Congress to join their cause, they now have Hollywood on their side too.\n\nOn Sunday, Poo, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, attended the Oscars ceremony as Cuarón's guest. The group also hosted a red carpet event for dozens of domestic workers from around the country.\n\nBarrett, the home health aide from Florida, told me she attended the event and met Cuarón.\n\nShe said she kissed the Oscar trophy he received for directing Roma .\n\n\"Who would have thought that a girl from Jamaica with no parents, who's been raped and abused, would ever be able to have that opportunity?\" she told me. \"There's power in organizing and power in telling our stories.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Roma would be an unusual Best Picture winner. Here's why it deserves the honor.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOur roundtable discusses the Oscar chances for Alfonso Cuarón's deeply personal family drama, set in Mexico City.\n\nby Alissa Wilkinson , Nisha Chittal , Eliza Barclay , and Tim Ryan Williams\n\nEach year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominates between five and 10 movies to compete for the Oscars ' Best Picture trophy - its most prestigious award, and the one given out at the very end of the ceremony. There's no strict definition for what makes a \"best\" picture; it's easiest to think about it as an honor given to the film that Hollywood thinks best represents the year in movies.\n\nSo whatever film wins Best Picture essentially represents the American movie industry's view of its role in driving culture, as well as its capabilities and aspirations, at a specific point in time.\n\nEvery year's nominee slate, then, is a rough approximation of the options from which the industry will choose as it attempts to characterize its past 12 months. And one thing that's definitely true about the eight Best Picture nominees from 2018 is that they exhibit a lot of variety.\n\nThere's a superhero film , two political satires (one set in an 18th-century royal court and one set in the White House ), a movie about infiltrating the KKK , a classic Hollywood remake , a classic Hollywood feel-good buddy comedy , a rocker biopic , and a sweeping domestic drama . And thinking about what the Academy voters - as well as audiences and critics - found enticing about them can help us better understand both the state of Hollywood and, broadly speaking, what we were looking for at the movies this year.\n\nIn the runup to the Oscars on February 24, Vox's staff is looking at each of the eight Best Picture nominees in turn. What makes this film appealing to Academy voters? What makes it emblematic of the year? And should it win?\n\nHere, we talk about Roma , the highly lauded black-and-white drama from Mexican director (and previous Oscar winner) Alfonso Cuarón. Joining the conversation are Alissa Wilkinson, Vox's film critic; Eliza Barclay, senior editor for health and science at Vox; Nisha Chittal, Vox's audience engagement editor; and Tim Williams, copy editor.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson: More than any of the other films nominated for Best Picture this year, Roma is the critical darling. It won awards from major critics' groups and nearly universal plaudits, which have helped with its status as a frontrunner for the Best Picture trophy. It's also tied with The Favourite for the most Oscar nominations in 2019 ; its 10 nominations include nods for directing and cinematography for its director, Alfonso Cuarón, who won the latter category for his direction of Gravity in 2014.\n\nYet, it's honestly a bit of an oddball, as Best Picture contenders go. It's in black and white. It's in Spanish and the indigenous language Mixtec, with English subtitles (at least if you're watching it in the US). It doesn't have any recognizable movie stars to most audiences (its star Yalitza Aparicio , who's up for Best Actress, had never acted before the movie). Set in 1970, it's the story of a young woman who works for a middle-class family in Mexico City during a time of political unrest. It's the kind of slow, contemplative film that typically has a small release in specialty theaters.\n\nBut Roma differs from other films of its sort in one huge way: It was distributed by streaming giant Netflix, which means that although it was ultimately released theatrically, it was also available to people all over the world to watch on their TVs and computers and even their phones (a level of access and convenience that Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos suggested people would love ). It's Netflix's first Best Picture nominee . And if it wins, it will be a huge deal not just for Netflix, but for the film industry.\n\nSo I'm wondering: How did you first see Roma ? What did you think of the movie? And what about it do you think makes it a Best Picture contender?\n\nTim Williams: America is doing movie theaters totally wrong. This is my obnoxious opinion after seeing Roma in Mexico City (where it was filmed) in an alarmingly beautiful cinema plaza. Look at these pictures !\n\nMovie theaters can certainly survive by selling ever-more-expensive fancy food ferried to you by bent-over servers in the dark. But wouldn't it be great to make them communal spaces again instead?\n\nThe pageantry of going to the movies is obviously a big part of Roma (and we all know the Oscars love a movie about movies), with several key scenes - including the one where Cleo tells her boyfriend Fermin about her pregnancy - occurring in or just outside of movie theaters. But it's a lot more than that, obviously.\n\nWhich was somewhat lost on me because I saw it the first time without subtitles, despite speaking almost no Spanish.\n\nI was sort of hoping a handsome stranger would whisper translations in my ear, but it was still a magical way to experience the movie. Another reason I think Roma has had such success at the Oscars is the immediacy of its images - what Alfred Hitchcock called \"pure cinema.\" (To describe his own movies!) It's a foreign film, but the dialogue is often added color, not the thrust of the storytelling.\n\nI was astounded, watching the opening credits, to see that there is a full minute of the camera fixed on gray tile - before the tide of the morning suds washes over the screen. It's stunning, like so many images in the movie, but it also tells so much about the place and characters, without dialogue.\n\nNisha Chittal: I watched it on Netflix! Honestly that was part of the appeal, that it was so much more easily accessible. Seeing movies in theaters is so expensive - it's like $17 a ticket in New York City, which means it costs more to see one movie in a theater than an entire month of Netflix.\n\nI loved it. The story was so moving, the cinematography and directing were so well done -the way Cuarón filmed the scenes around the house where Cleo worked was just fascinating to watch. So much of the film focuses on the sort of small, mundane things that make up everyday household/family life, yet it was still so interesting and compelling to watch. Yalitza Aparicio was so wonderful!\n\nEliza Barclay: I saw Roma in the theater (having read Alissa's recommendation to see it there ). The film was a very poignant experience on a few levels.\n\nFirst, I lived in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City (a.k.a. Distrito Federal, or DF) for three years, from 2004 to 2007, working there as a freelance foreign correspondent, and there were so many atmospheric details about street vendors in Roma in the film that mapped perfectly on my memory.\n\nFor instance, the camote (sweet potato) vendor who rattles along the streets pushing his small cart and advertising his presence with a sorrowful high-pitched whistle. This is one of those distinctive DF sounds still present today that you come to know, and it was a tradition I found bizarre until I just accepted it. And it delighted me to see it in the film.\n\nAnother scene that was just so spot-on was when Cleo emerges from the movie theater looking for her date who has abandoned her, and is confronted with a bunch of garish vendors selling whimsies. To be a pedestrian in DF is to be regularly overwhelmed by street vendors hawking all manner of things you don't need in that moment. It also means, though, that the street life there is unparalleled in its activity and its entrepreneurial creativity.\n\nI could name so many other scenes that were so deeply, authentically DF, and that captured a distinct strain of fearlessness running through the people there - the scene at the country retreat with the fires, with kids and adults pitching in to put out flames, creating no doubt significant anxiety for risk-averse American viewers ...\n\nBut on another level of poignancy, I just found the tenderness, intimacy, and gentleness of the relationship between Cleo and the kids to be absolutely extraordinary. I've never seen anything quite like it in a film before. The love, the kindness, and the best of human nature were captured and conveyed in the way that she cared for them, and the way that they loved her back.\n\nThat authentic emotion to me is the core of what makes Roma a Best Picture contender.\n\nAlissa: I think what you're all getting at well is that this is a really emotional film to watch for a lot of people. Which is startling, when you think about it - it's slow, and set in a different time and place, and the black and white in particular really sets it apart from \"reality,\" in a way. Something you all pointed out is how the small details of the setting, the household, the sounds, the street vendors all build the world that Cleo lives in, without having to do a lot of over-explaining for those who are less familiar.\n\nI'm wondering how the details of domestic life work for you against the backdrop of what's happening in the film. Roma is about Cleo's life with the family she works for, but while that's happening there is serious political and social unrest occurring as well. The film is purposefully set in 1970 and 1971, when land grabs and revolts were happening in Mexico . The film's pivotal scene, when Cleo's water breaks in a furniture store, happens in the midst of the Corpus Christi massacre , in which student demonstrators were attacked by a shock group trained by the government.\n\nWhen I talked to Yalitza Aparicio , who plays Cleo, she noted that all of this history is very present for her and her indigenous community, especially when it's been echoed more recently in incidents like the 2014 \"disappearance\" of activist students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College . And the Domestic Workers' Union has been out promoting the film as a vital look into domestic workers' lives, not just in the past but today.\n\nWere you thinking about any of this watching the film? How do you think the small domestic drama works against Roma 's bigger backdrop? And is there anything about the film that adds to this larger story?\n\nTim: The workers' union has rightly seized on the movie to amplify its message. But I wonder if this film is really the best possible vehicle. Cuarón's film is a sort of love letter to his childhood housekeeper, and the love shows clearly, especially in the relationship between one of her charges, the precocious dreamer Paco, and Cleo. Her work is given dignity, and she has a rich inner life outside it.\n\nAnd this relationship is not uncomplicated. Cleo briefly joins a family gathering around the TV and is even invited to curl up next to one of the boys. But then she is quickly sent to fetch tea, and this separation repeats throughout the film. Still, Cleo is a member of the family - its backbone, really. In the film's wide panning shots, she's often kept at the center as the family enacts their drama about the house on the outskirts.\n\nBut it's clear that Cleo's situation is not quite typical. It's unlikely that another home would instantly show support when a maid reveals a pregnancy. Roma is a film in which political forces intercede on the domestic, but class war at home is repressed.\n\nWhat would a less rosy picture of domestic workers' lives look like? I think the answer is in Guie'dani's Navel , another 2018 film about an Oaxacan maid that otherwise couldn't be less aligned with Cuarón's vision.\n\nIn that film, Zapotec Guie'dani, a modern-day teenager, joins her mother to work for a wealthy Mexico City family. It's clear from the moment she steps into the home of their employer (which like in Roma has a grand entrance but functions to keep people out) that she will never become \"one of them.\" And she never wants to, refusing their clumsy gifts and offer to tutor her (to feel less guilty about using child labor).\n\nThe family is clearly uncomfortable with ordering Zapotec around but chooses to simply separate themselves as much as possible. In Roma , Cleo smoothly weaves her native dialect together with Spanish; in Guie'dani's Navel , Zapotec is mocked for daring to speak her own language. We see little of Cleo's room in Roma , but Guie'dani's Navel doesn't let us forget Zapotec's bare closet. The airy, modern home has none of the wide panning shots of Cuarón's film: This place is Zapotec's prison, and the confinement leads to a violent climax.\n\nGuie'dani's Navel is carefully directed, and the amateur Oaxacan actors are every bit as riveting in their performances as Aparicio is in hers. It doesn't have the scope or stunning images of Roma , but I think it's a perfect counterpart to it.\n\nBut to get back to the actual film we're discussing, I was interested in what people saw in the recurring images in the film. The water, the planes that pass over the film's opening and ending (and drown out a very bizarre scene involving a muscle man/hippie guru). It seems like there's something there with the international forces working on the city, but I'm not really sure what. This is the \"problem\" with a film as beautiful as Roma : Everything seems full of meaning.\n\nMaybe it's just a nod, like the camote men, to the quirks of the city.\n\nNisha: I'll admit that I did not know a lot about the Corpus Christi Massacre before watching Roma , so I spent some time reading about it after watching the film. ( This explainer was helpful .)\n\nI think the political backdrop that the film's story was set against was incredibly important to the story - it further highlighted the class divisions and tensions that were already bubbling in the city at the time.\n\nFermin, the man who briefly dates Cleo and gets her pregnant only to abandon her, is seen training to be part of \" Los Halcones ,\" the secret paramilitary force that the Mexican government trained to fight against student activists. The scene where Cleo and her employer watch the massacre/protests at a distance from inside the furniture store while Cleo is going into labor - only to then be confronted by some of the Halcones, including Fermin himself - is haunting. We don't learn too much about Fermin's life and what got him into martial arts, and eventually into Los Halcones. And by all accounts, he's not a good guy: He abandons his pregnant girlfriend, and he's last seen brandishing a gun in front of innocent student activists.\n\nBut we do see in some earlier scenes that he lives in relative poverty in a rural area outside the city, and I had to wonder whether those circumstances - desperation and poverty - are what drove him to get involved in Los Halcones.\n\nTim: Fermin is bad news from the moment he enters the picture: Why is he snatching one of the girls' Coke? He's also uninterested in following through on plans to go the movies; he has Cleo to impress with his much less frivolous martial arts (which at first Cuarón seems to lavish attention on, but in the later scenes are shown to be a farce).\n\nHe's clearly a kid wrapped up in a twisted ideology; he tries to say the right things to Cleo when she breaks the news of her pregnancy, then wanders off because the lies he's been told about self-sufficiency are much more comforting. Antonio - Roma 's other male figure - also gets away with such thinking, though less extreme. The women don't have that luxury; the children occupy all their time.\n\nEliza: During the scene where Cleo's water broke, I was definitely thinking about the general pattern of violent repression of student groups happening in many countries around the time of Corpus Christi. I thought the chaos of that scene - and the chaos of the following scene in the hospital - was so powerful, with the way the camera lingered and encompassed these very uncomfortable moments of suffering. There are wide, wide images, giving us no escape from the pain of a woman whose boyfriend is shot, the pain of Cleo losing her baby with the doctors trying furiously to save her.\n\nThe scene where Fermin rejects Cleo to her face also brought out the theme of intense racism and economic subjugation - especially of indigenous groups like the Mixtec - in Mexico that persists today.\n\nAnd yet somehow there's also some mystery in Cleo's sense of self; we never quite know how personally she takes the rejection, how much she feels shame about being a domestic worker or not. And of course Roma 's ending offers some equalizing healing, in what she is able to do for the children and the mother.\n\nAlissa: The film itself ran into a few snags related to the social context of our time, too. The news recently broke that Jorge Antonio Guerrero, the Mexican actor who plays Fermin in the film, will be able to attend the Oscars ceremony after all, after being shut out of the US during most of the Oscar campaign period due to repeated denials of his visa.\n\nAnd, even more strikingly, Yalitza Aparicio, who is an indigenous woman and nominated for playing Cleo, was the subject of apparently racially motivated rumblings among some Mexican actresses to keep her out of contention for various awards and racist attacks online after landing on the cover of Vogue Mexico .\n\nBut I think the film has a fighting chance at winning a lot of Oscars this year, even if it doesn't land Best Picture, and that's a coup for everyone involved, including Netflix. If it does win, it will mean a lot for films like Roma , and might even prompt Netflix to invest in similar projects in the future.\n\nSo my question to you all is: What one place or historical setting would you love to see Netflix invest its film production dollars in?\n\nTim: Ads for Roma (and other Spanish-language Netflix-produced shows) were everywhere when I was in Mexico City. Netflix clearly sees these projects as a way to take over every screen on Earth. Hopefully the company will continue to support interesting films in Mexico and not just charge into the next market, colonial-style.\n\nBut if for some reason Bulgaria is next, Netflix should throw some money at Tonislav Hristov. His 2016 documentary The Good Postman localizes the Syrian refugee crisis in a tiny Bulgarian town. It's surreal, captivating, and I'd love to see what he tackles next.\n\nEliza: Gosh, this is a hard question. But I'd love to see more films set in Tibet!\n\nMore specifically, films about the spread of Buddhism out of India, into countries like Tibet and China.\n\nNisha: This is a tough question! I loved Netflix's Sacred Games (not a film, but a TV series) which was filmed in India and starred Indian actors and was just incredibly well done. I'd love to see Netflix do more perhaps in Southeast Asia - a region of the world that I think deserves more coverage.\n\nWhen Crazy Rich Asians came out last summer, many people pointed out that the film focused on Singapore's Chinese population ; other ethnic groups that live in Singapore - Malaysians, Indians, and others - were not represented onscreen. I'd love to see Netflix invest in more stories from Southeast Asian countries that have historically been underrepresented, like Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, or Indonesia.\n\nAlissa: Netflix has the ability (and maybe the interest) to invest in filmmakers who hail from those countries, too, which would be in stark contrast to most Hollywood studios' practices. There's more than one way to be a disruptor, and Roma - and the attention paid to it by the Oscars - proves that, whether or not it wins Best Picture.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOur roundtable discusses the Oscar chances for Alfonso Cuarón's deeply personal family drama, set in Mexico City.\n\nby Alissa Wilkinson , Nisha Chittal , Eliza Barclay , and Tim Ryan Williams\n\nEach year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominates between five and 10 movies to compete for the Oscars ' Best Picture trophy - its most prestigious award, and the one given out at the very end of the ceremony. There's no strict definition for what makes a \"best\" picture; it's easiest to think about it as an honor given to the film that Hollywood thinks best represents the year in movies.\n\nSo whatever film wins Best Picture essentially represents the American movie industry's view of its role in driving culture, as well as its capabilities and aspirations, at a specific point in time.\n\nEvery year's nominee slate, then, is a rough approximation of the options from which the industry will choose as it attempts to characterize its past 12 months. And one thing that's definitely true about the eight Best Picture nominees from 2018 is that they exhibit a lot of variety.\n\nThere's a superhero film , two political satires (one set in an 18th-century royal court and one set in the White House ), a movie about infiltrating the KKK , a classic Hollywood remake , a classic Hollywood feel-good buddy comedy , a rocker biopic , and a sweeping domestic drama . And thinking about what the Academy voters - as well as audiences and critics - found enticing about them can help us better understand both the state of Hollywood and, broadly speaking, what we were looking for at the movies this year.\n\nIn the runup to the Oscars on February 24, Vox's staff is looking at each of the eight Best Picture nominees in turn. What makes this film appealing to Academy voters? What makes it emblematic of the year? And should it win?\n\nHere, we talk about Roma , the highly lauded black-and-white drama from Mexican director (and previous Oscar winner) Alfonso Cuarón. Joining the conversation are Alissa Wilkinson, Vox's film critic; Eliza Barclay, senior editor for health and science at Vox; Nisha Chittal, Vox's audience engagement editor; and Tim Williams, copy editor.\n\nAlissa Wilkinson: More than any of the other films nominated for Best Picture this year, Roma is the critical darling. It won awards from major critics' groups and nearly universal plaudits, which have helped with its status as a frontrunner for the Best Picture trophy. It's also tied with The Favourite for the most Oscar nominations in 2019 ; its 10 nominations include nods for directing and cinematography for its director, Alfonso Cuarón, who won the latter category for his direction of Gravity in 2014.\n\nYet, it's honestly a bit of an oddball, as Best Picture contenders go. It's in black and white. It's in Spanish and the indigenous language Mixtec, with English subtitles (at least if you're watching it in the US). It doesn't have any recognizable movie stars to most audiences (its star Yalitza Aparicio , who's up for Best Actress, had never acted before the movie). Set in 1970, it's the story of a young woman who works for a middle-class family in Mexico City during a time of political unrest. It's the kind of slow, contemplative film that typically has a small release in specialty theaters.\n\nBut Roma differs from other films of its sort in one huge way: It was distributed by streaming giant Netflix, which means that although it was ultimately released theatrically, it was also available to people all over the world to watch on their TVs and computers and even their phones (a level of access and convenience that Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos suggested people would love ). It's Netflix's first Best Picture nominee . And if it wins, it will be a huge deal not just for Netflix, but for the film industry.\n\nSo I'm wondering: How did you first see Roma ? What did you think of the movie? And what about it do you think makes it a Best Picture contender?\n\nTim Williams: America is doing movie theaters totally wrong. This is my obnoxious opinion after seeing Roma in Mexico City (where it was filmed) in an alarmingly beautiful cinema plaza. Look at these pictures !\n\nMovie theaters can certainly survive by selling ever-more-expensive fancy food ferried to you by bent-over servers in the dark. But wouldn't it be great to make them communal spaces again instead?\n\nThe pageantry of going to the movies is obviously a big part of Roma (and we all know the Oscars love a movie about movies), with several key scenes - including the one where Cleo tells her boyfriend Fermin about her pregnancy - occurring in or just outside of movie theaters.

Netflix clearly sees these projects as a way to take over every screen on Earth. Hopefully the company will continue to support interesting films in Mexico and not just charge into the next market, colonial-style.\n\nBut if for some reason Bulgaria is next, Netflix should throw some money at Tonislav Hristov. His 2016 documentary The Good Postman localizes the Syrian refugee crisis in a tiny Bulgarian town. It's surreal, captivating, and I'd love to see what he tackles next.\n\nEliza: Gosh, this is a hard question. But I'd love to see more films set in Tibet!\n\nMore specifically, films about the spread of Buddhism out of India, into countries like Tibet and China.\n\nNisha: This is a tough question! I loved Netflix's Sacred Games (not a film, but a TV series) which was filmed in India and starred Indian actors and was just incredibly well done. I'd love to see Netflix do more perhaps in Southeast Asia - a region of the world that I think deserves more coverage.\n\nWhen Crazy Rich Asians came out last summer, many people pointed out that the film focused on Singapore's Chinese population ; other ethnic groups that live in Singapore - Malaysians, Indians, and others - were not represented onscreen. I'd love to see Netflix invest in more stories from Southeast Asian countries that have historically been underrepresented, like Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, or Indonesia.\n\nAlissa: Netflix has the ability (and maybe the interest) to invest in filmmakers who hail from those countries, too, which would be in stark contrast to most Hollywood studios' practices. There's more than one way to be a disruptor, and Roma - and the attention paid to it by the Oscars - proves that, whether or not it wins Best Picture.

      "text": "Justin Trudeau faces backlash after photo and video are uncovered showing him in brownface\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis is now the third confirmed instance of the Canadian prime minister wearing offensive makeup.\n\nby Jennifer Williams\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the handsome, charming champion of Western liberal ideals of diversity and inclusion, is facing a mounting political crisis after revelations that he appeared in brownface on more than one occasion in his not-too-distant past.\n\nIt all started on Wednesday evening, when Time magazine published a photograph of Trudeau wearing offensive makeup at an Arabian Nights -themed party at West Point Grey Academy, the private day school where Trudeau was a teacher in 2001. The photo appeared in the school's 2000-'01 yearbook. Trudeau was 29 years old at the time the photo was taken.\n\nIn the image, Trudeau is dressed in a white turban decorated with a large feather in the front and what looks like a flowing white robe - what he later described as an \"Aladdin costume.\" His face, neck, and hands are all covered in dark brown makeup. He stands with a group of four women, his arm around one - none of whom are wearing brownface.\n\nSpeaking to reporters shortly after the story broke, Trudeau said, \"I deeply regret that I did that. I should have known better, but I didn't. ... I'm deeply sorry that I did that.\"\n\n\"I take responsibility for my decision to do that. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time,\" Trudeau said, adding that he knows now that it was racist. \"I'm pissed off with myself for having done it.\"\n\nWhen asked if he'd ever done something like this at any other time in his life, he revealed that in high school he'd participated in a talent show in which he \"wore makeup and sang 'Day-O,'\" referring to a traditional Jamaican folk song.\n\nThen, on Thursday, yet another instance of Trudeau appearing in brownface surfaced. Canada's Global News obtained video showing Trudeau, his face and neck covered in dark brown makeup, laughing, raising his hands in the air, and sticking out his tongue. He is dressed in a T-shirt and ripped jeans. His arms also seem to be covered in the dark makeup, but it is a bit difficult to tell for sure given the grainy quality of the video.\n\nIt's unclear when and where the video was taken, but it appears to be a separate instance from the Arabian Nights party. The Liberal Party of Canada, which Trudeau leads, confirmed to Global News that it is Trudeau who appears in the video.\n\nThe prime minister is currently on the campaign trail in advance of the country's federal elections on October 21. He indicated to reporters that he planned to continue campaigning, saying he'll have to work harder now to convince voters of his values.\n\nHe's already facing the fallout from an unrelated political corruption scandal in which he and his political allies were accused of improperly pressuring Canada's now-former minister of justice and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould , to drop criminal corruption charges against the Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin.\n\nThat scandal has somewhat tarnished his shiny image as a proponent of progressive values, as Vox's Jen Kirby explained :\n\nTrudeau, who became prime minister in 2015, made transparency, inclusion, and openness a centerpiece of his leadership philosophy, and he became democracy's biggest cheerleader . He modeled his governing platform on promoting gender equality and indigenous rights.\n\nHis alleged pressure campaign and the eventual sidelining of Wilson-Raybould - a former prosecutor and indigenous woman who was once a symbol of Trudeau's diverse and gender-balanced cabinet - very much looks like a betrayal of those values.\n\nThe big question in the upcoming election was whether Trudeau's record on other issues and his personal boyish charm would be enough to convince voters to reelect him. The revelation that he once chose to wear brownface multiple times - including at least once while he was a teacher attending a school function, no less - will certainly cause some voters to rethink whether Trudeau is the man they thought he was.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nWith near daily strikes against Yemen's Houthis, is there an end in sight?\n\nThe latest on the trade war.\n\nBusinesses and consumers are already appearing to panic.\n\nThe political balancing act at the heart of the new conclave.\n\nChina came to Trump's trade war ready to fight.\n\nTrump's tariffs might actually be good for Ukraine.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

The Justice Department also found that Native women are victims of murder over 10 times the national average. But without assistance from non-tribal federal, state and local agencies, these cases have gone underfunded and uninvestigated.\n\n\"The new MMU unit will provide the resources and leadership to prioritize these cases and coordinate resources to hold people accountable, keep our communities safe, and provide closure for families,\" Haaland said in a statement posted to the Department of Interior's website Thursday.\n\nAs the crisis drags on and the numbers of the dead and disappeared rise, Indigenous women across the country live in fear of violence. Activists say they are looking for systemic solutions to end the cycle of loss and death in the communities.\n\n\"We see what representation looks like. You have an indigenous woman leading as secretary of the interior with the authority and the ability to address some of the most pressing crises in Indian country,\" Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, told ABC News. \"However we have to recognize this as just the start ... It's not enough to search for them when they go missing or investigate the crimes when they're murdered. We have to be at the point of prevention.\"\n\nRoughly 1,500 American Indian and Alaska Native missing persons have been recorded across the U.S. by the National Crime Information Center, and about 2,700 cases of homicide have been reported to the Federal Government's Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n\nHowever, activists say law enforcement agencies do a poor job at maintaining complete, accurate records of the data on these cases.\n\nA study by the UIHI reports that many law enforcement systems don't include a racial category for American Indian, Native American, or Alaska Native, or that they categorize Native peoples inaccurately. The data that agencies do have is also often inaccessible to these communities who may not be able to financially afford to seek out this information.\n\nWithout proper records to hold leadership accountable, Indigenous communities won't have the ability to advocate for themselves and law enforcement can't combat a problem it doesn't know exists, activists say.\n\n\"Law enforcement was effectively hiding the disproportional impact in our communities by the non-collection of race and ethnicity,\" Echo-Hawk said. \"As a result of that, for many years, when our tribal leadership would go to them and push for resources and highlight this issue, they'd say, 'but where's your data?' But we know the data isn't there because they're not collecting it. This is purposeful erasure.\"\n\nEcho-Hawk also said that since perpetrators of violence rarely get caught, the Native community remains a vulnerable target for crimes.\n\nColleen Medicine, program director at the Association on American Indian Affairs, agrees. She said she believes the missing data is a large part of the issue and is affecting the help needed to heal this community.\n\n\"Our people go missing three times over. The first time is physically. They're physically stolen, abducted, taken, murdered. Then they're missing in the data. The third time is -- they're not home with their families, they're not home in their communities,\" Medicine said. \"That's why we have to be our own advocates.\"\n\nEcho-Hawk says she and other activists like Medicine will be watching the administration closely to ensure the new unit makes the progress it promises.\n\n\"I'm tired of seeing our people live in fear for their mothers, for their sisters, for their grandmothers,\" Echo-Hawk said. \"These are the things that we live with as indigenous women live with every day\"\n\nHaaland, a New Mexico congresswoman and the U.S.'s first Indigenous cabinet secretary, made this issue a priority of hers during her confirmation hearings.\n\nThe Missing & Murdered Unit will build upon the work of a 2019 task force dedicated to these cases, called Operation lady Justice. The MMU will work with Tribal investigators, as well as the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the FBI. This new unit will also support marshal law enforcement resources throughout Indian country and help uncover new information in witness testimony, material evidence and suspects.\n\n\"Whether it's a missing family member or a homicide investigation, these efforts will be all hands-on deck,\" Haaland said. \"We are fully committed to assisting Tribal communities with these investigations, and the MMU will leverage every resource available to be a force-multiplier in preventing these cases from becoming cold case investigations.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Stephen Fincher, Steven Hughes, Aaron Pettigrew and Dr. Rolando Toyos,\n\nDemocrats got their top recruit in coaxing former Gov. Phil Bredesen off the sidelines.\n\nThe race to replace Corker is important for Republicans; they need to keep it red as protection against losing a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Democrats are looking to become the majority party in the Senate and are looking to ride a wave of momentum after deep-red state Alabama elected a Democrat to the Senate in a strongly contested special election in December 2017.\n\nKEY DATES\n\nPrimary: Aug. 2\n\nElection: Nov. 6\n\nBy MEGHAN KENEALLY\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nKelli Ward\n\nRepublican\n\nAn osteopathic physician and ran an unsuccessful bid against Sen.

Diegel\n\nRepublican\n\nA certified financial planner and former Air Force special operations intelligence officer.\n\nAge: 39 (Sept. 27, 1978)\n\nMichelle Griffin\n\nRepublican\n\nA doctor who calls for changes in health care, English as the national language, and improvements in veteran's care.\n\nAge: N/A\n\nKyrsten Sinema\n\nDemocrat\n\nA current congresswoman who has a relatively moderate voting record and already made history by becoming the first bisexual member of Congress.\n\nAge: 41 (July 12, 1976)\n\nDeedra Abboud\n\nDemocrat\n\nA Muslim-American attorney who is originally from Arkansas but who has lived in Arizona for 20 years.\n\nAge: 46 (Nov. 11, 1971)\n\nChris Russell\n\nDemocrat\n\nA lawyer who is driven by outrage over the lack of bipartisan work to solve problems.\n\nAge: 49 (May 19, 1968)\n\nEve Reyes-Aguirre\n\nGreen Party\n\nAn indigenous woman and mother of four, she's venturing into politics for the first time.\n\nAge: 42 (Sept. 8, 1975)\n\nDoug Marks\n\nLibertarian\n\nHe ran an unsuccessful congressional race in Illinois before successful running for city council and is now trying again in his new home state.\n\nAge: N/A\n\nTHE STAKES\n\nA lively cast of characters and the center seat to the debate over immigration policy will keep the Arizona Senate race bustling through November.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake's decision not to seek re-election opened up the seat -- and Republican field, allowing the warring factions of the party to vie for the spot. The Democrats, led by Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, are hoping that their opponents' infighting could lead them to help make the state a deeper shade of purple than it already is.\n\nThe Republican primary will not only be a competition of differing ideas on the border wall and immigration, but also show the competition between the candidates as they tout their respective ties to President Donald Trump. Kelli Ward, who unsuccessfully went up against Sen. John McCain in his 2016 re-election, had an early lead in the race that was helped by the backing of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and financial support from conservative fundraiser Rebekah Mercer.\n\nBut two key opponents could threaten her hold on her base.\n\nSheriff Joe Arpaio threw his name in the race in January, months after being pardoned by Trump, and ex-fighter pilot Rep. Martha McSally flew into the competition touting her tendency for tough talk. While these three candidates are vying for the more conservative voters in the state, there are four others who will be nipping at their heels until the Aug. 28 primary.\n\nKEY DATES\n\nThe primary is on Tuesday Aug. 28.\n\nThe general election is on Nov. 6.\n\nBY MARIAM KHAN\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nSen. Heidi Heitkamp\n\nDemocrat - incumbent\n\nCurrently representing North Dakota in the U.S. Senate\n\nAge: 62 (Oct. 30, 1955)\n\nRep. Kevin Cramer\n\nRepublican\n\nRepresentative from North Dakota's At-Large Congressional District (2013 to present)\n\nAge: 57 (Jan. 21, 1961)\n\nTHE STAKES\n\nThe Senate race in North Dakota between incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and at-large Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer is all but a toss-up.\n\nHeitkamp is among the most vulnerable senators up for re-election in November. President Trump won North Dakota in the 2016 presidential election by roughly 36 percentage points over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis puts Heitkamp in a uniquely challenging place. She'll have to peel off Republicans and independent voters and keep her liberal, democratic base happy at the same time.\n\nShe's also running in a state where President Trump remains fairly popular, and thus it works in her benefit to stay on friendly terms with the president.\n\nShe has voted in favor for almost all of Trump's cabinet nominees. Last month she snagged a prime spot at the White House for a bill-singing event. And last year, she hitched a ride with the president on Air Force One to an event in North Dakota.\n\nAt one point, Trump told the crowd Heitkamp was a \"good woman.\"\n\nBut Heitkamp has her work cut out for her. She's running against a highly popular candidate who has just as much name recognition as she does.\"\n\nKEY DATES\n\nNove. 6, 2018: General election\n\nBy NIA PHILLIPS\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nChris McDaniel RepublicanMississippi state Senator, lawyer, 2014 U.S. Senate GOP Candidate Age 46 (Feb. 28, 1971)\n\nCindy Hyde-Smith RepublicanMississippi Agricultural secretary, former Mississippi state Senator, beef cattle farmer Age 58 (May 10, 1959) **need to confirm this**\n\nMike Espy DemocratFormer U.S. representative, former U.S. Agricultural secretary, lawyer Age 64 (Nov. 30, 1953)\n\nTHE STAKES\n\nIn Mississippi, Republicans are scrambling to maintain both of their U.S. Senate seats after Sen. Thad Cochran announced his retirement beginning April 1. Now, they look toward a November special election, strategizing on which of two non-traditional candidates they will rally behind to send to Washington.\n\nComplicating the plan, the Magnolia State's \"jungle primary\" format where candidates battle in an open election regardless of party affiliation. If one person is unable to win 50 percent of the vote, Mississippians will return to the polls once again three weeks later, deciding between the top-two contenders.\n\nRepublican Chris McDaniel, a lawyer and former conservative talk-show host with a large social media presence is working to fire up his conservative support base, after gaining wide recognition in a narrowly-lost primary fight against Cochran in 2014.\n\nThe Tea Party candidate who originally declared his run against incumbent Sen. Roger Wicker is instead focusing on the special election. McDaniel's path to Capitol Hill, however, is now seemingly more difficult after an early endorsement by political outsider Steve Bannon. Despite President Trump giving his early support for Wicker, McDaniel continues to align himself with the commander-in-chief's political values.\n\nPossibly standing in McDaniel's way is Gov. Phil Bryant's interim Senate pick: Cindy Hyde-Smith.\n\nThe beef-cattle farmer who served as Mississippi's commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce since 2011, launched her fall campaign the same day as Bryant's announcement. Hyde-Smith could potentially make history if she were to become the first woman to represent the Mississippi in U.S. history.\n\nBut one potential wrinkle for the longtime lawmaker is her political past.\n\nThe former state Senator's also a former Democrat, switching to the Republican party in 2010. And her past affiliation's already fuel to the fire for McDaniel, immediately noting Hyde-Smith's Democratic past just moments after the governor announced his pick.\n\nBut, the Republicans will also have to wait and see who the Democrats bring to the table in the special election as they hope to have a similar outcome as their neighbors in Alabama this fall.\n\nFormer Washington insider Mike Espy telling ABC News he has a \"strong intention\" to run for Cochran's vacant seat. The attorney was elected as Mississippi's first African American Representative in U.S. Congress since the Reconstruction era. Espy additionally worked as the U.S. Agricultural Secretary during the Clinton administration.\n\nKEY DATES\n\nSPECIAL ELECTION: Nov. 6, 2018\n\nBY ALISA WIERSEMA\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly\n\nDemocrat\n\nIncumbent senator\n\nAge: 62 (Sept. 29, 1955)\n\nMike Braun\n\nRepublican\n\nBusiness owner\n\nAge: N/A\n\nRep. Luke Messer\n\nRepublican\n\nCongressman\n\nAge: 48 (Feb. 27, 1969)\n\nRep. Todd Rokita\n\nRepublican\n\nCongressman\n\nAge: 47 (Feb. 9, 1970)\n\nTHE STAKES\n\nThis year's Indiana Senate race is sure to feature showdowns in the primary and general election cycles, putting Vice President Mike Pence's home state in the spotlight for battles within his own party, as well as across the aisle.\n\nThe matchup is set in a state President Donald Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016 -- meaning incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly is looking at a tough race against a slew of Republicans eager to take his seat.\n\nIndiana businessman Mike Braun launched into the field with the first ads of the election cycle. Candidates on the right also include House Representatives Todd Rokita and Luke Messer, who are duking it out in an intra-party war marked with personal jabs.\n\nSuch heated exchanges set the stage well ahead of this year's midterm cycle, meaning whichever Republican candidate comes out on top will have already fought hard just to get the party's nomination.\n\nAs for the incumbent, Donnelly will have to fight a bitter battle to defend his seat at home and on a national level. While Donnelly aligns with Republicans on issues like abortion, he has a target on his back for voting against tax reform that was painted on by the president himself during a tax event last fall in Indianapolis.\n\n\"If Sen. Donnelly doesn't approve it, because you know, he's on the other side, we will come here. We will campaign against him like you wouldn't believe,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nKEY DATES\n\nFiling deadline: Feb. 9, 2018\n\nPrimary: May 8, 2018\n\nBY MATTHEW FUHRMAN\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nDean Heller\n\nRepublican - incumbent\n\nAppointed to the Senate by Gov. Brian Sandoval in 2011, elected in 2012\n\nAge: 58\n\nJacky Rosen\n\nDemocrat\n\nCurrently represents Nevada's 3rd District in the House of Representatives\n\nAge: 60\n\nTHE STAKES\n\nNevada is one of the few states where Democrats have a chance to pick up a senate seat in 2018. In fact, it's the only state with a Republican senator up for reelection in a state won by Hillary Clinton. Nevada is a quintessential swing state; it has sided with the winner of the presidency for all but two elections in the last 100 years, voting for Gerald Ford in 1976 when Jimmy Carter was elected, and going for Hillary Clinton in 2016 when Donald Trump was elected.\n\nIncumbent Republican Dean Heller was appointed to the Senate by Governor Brian Sandoval in 2011, and ran to keep the job one year later. Heller squeaked out a win, beating challenger Shelley Berkley by less than 12,000 votes statewide. Will a Republican who won by such a small margin be able to hold on if a blue wave sweeps across the United States this November?\n\nExpect health care to play a major role in the Nevada election. Sen. Heller opposed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, but decided to support repeal after President Trump suggested he was open to supporting another Republican in the Nevada Senate race. Immigration also will play a major role in the race with Nevada's large immigrant population, as well as gun rights following the October 1st shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nKEY DATES\n\nElection day: Nov. 6, 2018\n\n18 For 18' is ABC News' powerhouse political coverage of the 2018 midterm elections.
