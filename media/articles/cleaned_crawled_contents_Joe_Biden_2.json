      "text": "'Lasting impact': How Biden is preventing Trump from undoing his legacy in final weeks\n\nEven though President Joe Biden has pledged to peacefully handing the reins of power to President-elect Donald Trump on January 20th, he's still aiming to make sure his successor won't be able to easily undo his signature legislative accomplishments.\n\nThe Financial Times recently reported that both Biden and his Cabinet are working at breakneck pace to spend down tens of billions of dollars in projects that have already been approved by Congress before the Trump administration can claw it back or spend it elsewhere. Domestically, this includes $39 billion in incentives for semiconductor manufacturing plants throughout the U.S. as part of the CHIPS and Science Act, which is fueling approximately 115,000 manufacturing jobs in multiple states.\n\nSecretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said her agency is instructing employees to work overtime and through the weekends to make sure the CHIPS and Science Act funds are out the door before Trump's inauguration less than two months from now. This apparently also included one-on-one calls to tech executives in an effort to fast-track several deals currently in the works.\n\n\"The CHIPS team has announced preliminary agreements with two dozen companies for CHIPS awards, and over the next two months, plans to announce preliminary agreements for all $39 billion of that funding, and is well on its way towards securing final agreements for may of those entities [where] preliminary awards were announced,\" an unnamed White House official told the Financial Times.\n\nOne of Biden's most significant legislative achievements was the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Earthjustice referred to as \" the largest climate spending bill ever .\" One major component of that law was the appropriation of $369 billion in clean energy subsidies, which Trump campaigned on repealing . Biden climate advisor John Podesta told the Times that if Trump tries to undo the IRA, he may face unexpected resistance from Republican state governments.\n\n\"Many Republicans, especially governors, know all this activity is a good thing for their districts, states and for their economies,\" Podesta said.\n\nAnother big chunk of unspent money Biden is aiming to get out the door is $7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine that has yet to get to Kiev. Biden is aiming to fast-track that money before Trump gets into office, under the assumption that the president-elect will allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to conquer contested territory in Eastern Ukraine without putting up a fight.\n\nThe U.S. has already approved Ukraine's use of long-range weapons to strike at Russian targets, and is sending anti-personnel mines to the Ukrainian military to use against Russia along with the larger anti-tank mines it's already been deploying. Biden believes Kiev will be in a stronger negotiating position with Moscow if it has more weaponry at its disposal when Trump is inaugurated.\n\nFinally, Biden is urging Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to make the most of the Democratic majority's final months to speed through his last remaining judicial nominees. Schumer recently took advantage of several Republicans' absence in the chamber to hold votes on several nominees that had been held up, getting those judges confirmed to lifetime positions while Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) were with Trump on a SpaceX flight.\n\n\"We've been working with [Senate Democrats] very, very closely to get as many of the president's nominees confirmed because he believes that he wants to leave a lasting impact on the judiciary,\" a White House official said."

And Fox News host Tammy Bruce responded by raging against Biden .\n\nThe outgoing president told reporters, \"Is there anything President Trump could take from President Carter? Decency, decency, decency. Can you imagine Jimmy Carter walking by someone who needed something and just keep walking? Can you imagine Jimmy Carter referring to someone by the way they look or the way they talk? I can't. I can't.\"\n\nThe following day, on Fox News' \"Outnumbered,\" Bruce described Biden as \"mean\" and a \"bully.\"\n\nBruce told an \"Outnumbered\" panel , \"(The) American people have made their decision. We're all Americans. We're moving forward. We will disagree politically and philosophically. But it's just a remarkable and a shameful thing to watch. But it is classic Biden. This is what we've been seeing, and it's partly what the American people don't like.\"\n\nBruce continued, \"You might not agree with Trump's style. But Biden is presented as being.... the unifier and the nice guy. You know, Scranton, Joe. And he's mean and he's a bully. And it's a shame and it's embarrassing, and it's unfortunate.\"\n\nBruce, now 62, was once a prominent figure in liberalism and the feminist movement, but she later took a hard-right turn and became a Fox News pundit.\n\nThe Los Angeles native served as president of the National Organization for Women (NOW) from 1990-1996, but she turned against liberalism and the Democratic Party during the 2000s and developed a strong presence in right-wing media.\n\nWatch the full video below or at this link ."

      "text": "'Is that a joke?' Biden gives snarky response to reporter's question during press conference\n\nPresident Joe Biden couldn't help but ridicule a reporter's question at the end of a recent press conference.\n\nBiden on Wednesday announced the conclusion of months-long ceasefire and hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas that he helped broker with Qatar and Egypt, in which a temporary ceasefire in Gaza is due to take effect on Sunday. Hamas has agreed to return dozens of Israeli hostages held captive since its October 7, 2023 attack, including seven U.S. citizens. This would mark an end to the fighting that has raged for nearly 450 days, which has resulted in 46,707 Palestinian deaths (including more than 18,000 children) according to Al Jazeera .\n\n\"This is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May,\" Biden said. \"Secondly, it's America's support for Israel that helped them badly weaken Hamas and its backers and create the conditions for this deal. And thirdly, I knew this deal would have to be implemented by the next team. So I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice, because that's what American presidents do.\"\n\nHowever, President-elect Donald Trump is also claiming credit for the deal. The Washington Post reported that one unnamed diplomat credited the progress of the talks to Trump's influence as the incoming president, saying it was \"the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal.\"\n\n\"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.\n\nBut when one reporter asked Biden directly at the end of his press conference if Trump deserved credit for the deal, the outgoing president offered a pithy response as he walked away.\n\n\"Is that a joke?\" Biden said. \"Oh.\"\n\nWatch the video of the exchange below, or by clicking this link ."

But the 46th president of the United States is using one of his final public appearances to take swings at Republican-led states' economic management.\n\nNBC News recently reported that Biden didn't hold back when blasting how his political opponents in state governments across the country handled the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic - particularly when it came to rebuilding their economies after millions were put out of work due to the virus. Biden's remarks came in response to a question from MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell,  who asked the outgoing president why his administration \"invested more in red states than blue states.\"\n\n\"Red states really screwed up in terms of the way they handled their economy and the way they handled manufacturing and the way they handled access to supply chains,\" Biden said. He also admitted that, despite getting the U.S. economy back on track in the wake of the pandemic, he made a \"mistake\" in \"not getting our allies to acknowledge that the Democrats did this.\"\n\nBiden said he overlooked the need to \"let people know that this was something the Democrats did, that it was done by the party,\" when it came to passing critical legislation like the American Rescue Plan . That legislation - which passed largely on party lines - injected roughly $2 trillion into the economy that provided relief for renters, workers, homeowners, student borrowers, small businesses and state governments to aid in pandemic recovery.\n\n\"Ironically, I almost spent too much time on the policy and not enough time on the politics,\" the president told O'Donnell.\n\nThe outgoing president observed that Trump's decision to sign the first wave of Covid-19 stimulus checks was smart politics. Even though it didn't result in him winning the 2020 election, Biden said voters' hazy memories going into the 2024 election led to a lot of confusion about who was ultimately responsible for getting the U.S. through the pandemic.\n\n\"It helped [Trump] a lot, and it undermined our ability to convince people that we were the ones that were getting this to them,\" Biden said."

      "text": "How MAGA Republicans are 'deflecting blame' while making an economic 'collapse more likely'\n\nU.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) reacts, on the day U.S. President Donald Trump holds a joint session, in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 4, 2025.\n\nDuring his 2025 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump claimed that the Biden Administration created major economic problems for the United States. And Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claims that economically, former President Joe Biden \"left (Trump) a pile of poop.\"\n\nBut in fact, the U.S. enjoyed record-low unemployment rates and robust job creation during much of Biden's presidency. The national unemployment rate, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), was only 4.1 percent in December 2024 (Biden's last full month in office). In January 2023, U.S. unemployment was a mere 3.4 percent - the lowest since May 1969 , CNBC reported.\n\nIn a biting column published on March 11 , MSNBC's Paul Waldman argues that Trump and his allies are pointing the finger at a former president while pushing bad economic policies that could lead to a painful \"collapse.\"\n\n\"While Trump and his allies alternately deflect blame and insist that everything will be fine,\" Waldman warns , \"there's one thing they will never admit: Almost everything the (Trump) Administration and congressional Republicans are doing to the economy is making a collapse more likely. They seem to know it, but either they don't care or they're hoping that the damage will be limited while they go about gutting the federal government.\"\n\nWaldman continues , \"For the last 35 years, over six presidencies, the U.S. economy has followed a cycle: A Republican president presides over a recession, a Democratic president gets elected and cleans up the mess; then, a Republican gets elected and screws everything up all over again. It was a good bet the cycle would continue with the second Trump presidency; the only surprise is that it's happening so quickly.\"\n\nThe Trump policies that risk creating a deep recession, according to Waldman , range from steep new tariffs to draconian cuts to the federal workforce.\n\n\"Trump's constant toggling on tariffs has left businesses uncertain about whether to invest and consumers nervous about renewed inflation, since tariffs are essentially a sales tax on imported goods,\" Waldman observes . \"If they go into force in full, the effects could be widespread, including pushing up the price of houses and cars. Probably in anticipation, consumer confidence is down, and consumer spending recently dropped for the first time in almost two years. The stock market has been tumbling, with Monday, (March 10) the worst day on Wall Street this year.\"\n\nWaldman stresses that mass layoffs of federal workers will inevitably hurt the private sector in a variety of ways.\n\n\"The (Trump) Administration's planned layoffs of hundreds of thousands of government workers are in and of themselves a substantial hit to the economy,\" Waldman warns . \"What hasn't gotten as much attention is the likely effects of Musk's canceling federal contracts and programs willy-nilly. Most Americans probably don't realize that while there are about 3 million federal employees, including postal workers, even more private-sector jobs depend on federal contracts and grants. They include everything from airplane machinists to medical researchers to child care specialists to food service workers.\"\n\nPaul Waldman's full MSNBC column is available at this link ."

And one of Biden's priorities is reforming the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn an op-ed published by the Washington Post on July 29, Biden cites the High Court's controversial 6-3 immunity ruling in Trump v. the United States as a glaring example of why reforms are badly needed.\n\n\"This nation was founded on a simple yet profound principle: No one is above the law,\" Biden writes . \"Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. No one. But the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision on July 1 to grant presidents broad immunity from prosecution for crimes they commit in office means there are virtually no limits on what a president can do.\"\n\nREAD MORE : Why Kamala Harris laughs at J.D. Vance\n\nBiden continues , \"The only limits will be those that are self-imposed by the person occupying the Oval Office. If a future president incites a violent mob to storm the Capitol and stop the peaceful transfer of power - like we saw on January 6, 2021 - there may be no legal consequences. And that's only the beginning.\"\n\nThe president laments in addition to overturning \"settled legal precedents\" like Roe v. Wade , the High Court has been \"mired in a crisis of ethics.\" And he goes on to lay out his game plan for \"three bold reforms.\"\n\n\"First, I am calling for a constitutional amendment called the No One Is Above the Law Amendment,\" Biden explains . \"It would make clear that there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office.... Second, we have had term limits for presidents for nearly 75 years.\"\n\nBiden continues , \"We should have the same for Supreme Court justices. Third, I'm calling for a binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court. This is common sense. The Court's current voluntary ethics code is weak and self-enforced.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's full op-ed for the Washington Post is available at this link (subscription required)."

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) has been warning that Pam Bondi - former Florida attorney general and President-elect Donald Trump's new nominee for U.S. attorney general - will likely be all in on Trump's \"revenge\" campaign if confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nKlobuchar, during a late November interview, told ABC News, \"Does it concern me that revenge would be part of her mission? Of course it does.\"\n\nDuring an August 2023 appearance on Fox News , Bondi threatened, \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted... The investigators will be investigated.\"\n\nJournalist Eleanor Clift shares Klobuchar's concerns . Her solution: President Joe Biden must exercise his \"preemptive pardon\" powers while he still has a chance.\n\nIn a November 26 opinion column for the Daily Beast , Clift argues, \" Trump knows how the game works, and he's been upfront for months about using every lever of government to seek retribution from those who he believes wronged him. His choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi, is an election denier who should be disqualified on that alone. Instead, she is expected to lead the charge purging the DOJ of anyone who worked on prosecuting Trump, while also wasting taxpayer money to dig up alleged fraud from the 2020 election.\"\n\nClift continues , \"Trump has threatened many of his adversaries, and he will soon have the power to make good on his threats. President Biden must act and use his pardon power to safeguard a lengthening list of people who are on the receiving end of Trump's threats. They will say they've done nothing wrong, and they're right. Preemptive pardons are problematic, a get-out-of jail free card when you haven't committed a crime. But they're needed now that President-elect Trump is gearing up his revenge tour.\"\n\nClift cites special counsel Jack Smith as a likely target of Trump's \"revenge\" campaign.\n\n\"Before he leaves office, Biden should pardon Liz Cheney, a profile in courage who we haven't heard from since the election, and Nancy Pelosi, another unafraid leader and favorite target of Trump,\" Clift argues. \"Then, the two generals deserve pardons: Mark Milley, who said he fears being recalled into service so Trump can court-martial him, and John Kelly, Trump's longest serving chief of staff who said Trump is a fascist.\"\n\nClift adds , \"Also in the crosshairs are Adam Kinzinger, the former GOP congressman who served on the 1/6 committee, and Senator-elect Adam Schiff, who oversaw Trump's impeachment and is the butt of Trump's nasty nicknames.\"\n\nEleanor Clift's full Daily Beast column is available at this link (subscription required)."

He's commuted the sentences of nearly everyone who was on federal death row, and he's granted to his son Hunter a sweeping pardon .\"\n\nHe's also considering action on advancing the Equal Rights Amendment, according to sources familiar with the discussions, and his team has been discussing preemptive pardons for individuals who Trump might target for retribution, and many of the recent moves have been the result of months of planning that began when Biden dropped out of the race, shared with his Cabinet in September and accelerated after the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"This Cabinet meeting comes at a time when we have four months left in the administration,\" the president told Cabinet members in September, when he asked them to take action to burnish his legacy. \"We're going to keep running through the tape, because the vice president and I are determined to keep making sure that the democracy delivers what the American people are asking for and what we provided.\"\n\nThe administration has focused on spending money already allocated by Congress and proposing regulations that would make it more difficult for the incoming administration to derail those plans, but Republicans could use the the Congressional Review Act to disapprove more than 1,300 climate, education, health-care and labor regulations set forth by Biden.\n\n\"In another little-noticed example, the incoming Trump administration will find what may be an unwelcome surprise Tuesday, when a new rule becomes legally effective, giving a 12 percent pay raise to about 14,500 blue-collar employees who serve at three Army depots and some Veterans Affairs facilities,\" the Post reported. \"The raise, authorized by the Office of Personnel Management in October, will appear as a final rule in the Federal Register on Jan. 21, meaning the incoming Trump administration will have to pay for it, at a cost of $150 million a year.\"\n\nThat move comes as Trump and his allies Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have vowed to cut trillions of dollars from the federal budget and drastically reduce the workforce, but they may find some of Biden's workplace protections are too well-established by now to overturn.\n\n\"It does strike me as reasonable to get your preference into place and make them as difficult as possible to overturn,\" said Andrew Rudalevige, a professor at Bowdoin College who has studied executive actions. \"A lot of this unilateral action is fragile, so it makes it limited to what you can do.\""

      "text": "Who exactly is trying to push Biden out?\n\nAt a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, last Friday, President Biden said, \"Some folks ... are trying to push me out of the race.\"\n\nTo whom was Biden referring?\n\nCertainly not to Trump or the Republicans, who have been uncharacteristically silent about the whole question of whether Biden should drop out. They couldn't push him out of the Democratic race anyway.\n\nNor was he referring to Democrats in Congress. Almost all have been publicly supportive of Biden. Only eight House Democrats out of 213 have called for him to drop out, and only one Senate Democrat has gone that far.\n\nWas Biden referring to the leaders of the Democratic Party? Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Senate majority leader and House Democratic leader, respectively, have been supportive of Biden, at least in public.\n\nREAD: Pelosi hints at something big coming\n\nHe couldn't have been talking about the Democratic National Committee. Not a single DNC member has called for Biden to exit the race.\n\nWas Biden talking about the elite punditry on cable TV and on the op-ed pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post - almost all of whom have called for Biden to drop out?\n\nDoubtful. The chattering class has little or no influence on the preferences of average voters. How many people at that Wisconsin rally read opinion pieces in The New York Times ?\n\nDid Biden have in mind some collection of gray-bearded leaders of America - a group of unofficial elder statesmen, perhaps including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, whose counsel carries extraordinary influence behind the scenes?\n\nThere is no longer any such group. (I recall a time decades ago when a few old Democratic fixers such as Lloyd Cutler, held significant sway behind the scenes of official Washington. Not any more.)\n\nBut there is one small group of people in America with the power to push Joe Biden out of the race. Who are they? The major donors to the Democratic Party.\n\nThey're the ones Biden is angry with.\n\nOn Monday morning, Biden called into MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and railed against the big-ticket donors who have been pushing him to withdraw.\n\n\"I'm getting so frustrated with the elites ... the elites of the party,\" he said on the air. \"I don't care what the millionaires think.\"\n\nBingo. It was the first time any modern president has admitted that the elites of the party are the millionaires (and billionaires) who fund it, which gives them extraordinary political power - perhaps enough to push Biden out of the race.\n\nIn truth, the Democratic Party is little more than a national fundraising machine, as is the GOP.\n\nI'm not faulting Biden for expressing his frustration with the party's big money elite. He's simply stating the truth. America's donor class has become extraordinarily powerful, in both parties.\n\nBiden and his top aides aren't hiding this reality. To the contrary, they're actively portraying the effort to remove him as driven by the party's wealthy elite.\n\nThis may be an exaggeration. The polling data I've seen suggests that concerns about Biden's age and evident decline worry a wide swath of the public.\n\nBut Biden is trying to persuade the party's major donors of his viability. Soon after Biden shared with the hosts of \"Morning Joe\" his frustrations with the moneyed elite of the party, he held a Zoom call with that very same elite.\n\nIn that call, according to The New York Times , he told them that they had to shift the focus of the campaign away from him and onto Trump.\n\nTelling them to shift their focus seemed further evidence that, at least in Biden's mind, the party's biggest donors were responsible for focusing on Biden's debate stumbles in the first place. And it was they who must shift their focus back to Trump.\n\nI just read a New York Times op-ed by actor George Clooney, who calls for Biden to drop out. I'm not aware of any special political expertise Clooney brings to the table, except for what he states in the very first paragraph of his op-ed: \"I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history,\" he writes. \"Last month I co-hosted the single largest fundraiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election.\"\n\nI guess that makes Clooney's view highly relevant.\n\nOver the last week and a half, I've been immersed in countless discussions about whether Biden should drop out of the race. I expect you have as well.\n\nBut those discussions are irrelevant. You and I aren't going to persuade Biden to stay in the race or to drop out.\n\nOnly one group is going to persuade him - the Democratic Party's biggest donors. If they decide to stop funding the Biden campaign, Biden has no chance of winning.\n\nIt's now becoming a game of chicken. If the biggest donors stop funding Biden and Biden stays in the race notwithstanding, he clearly loses. Yet so do we all.\n\nBiden's efforts over the last few days confirm much of what I've increasingly observed over the years. The real political power in America, regardless of party, lies in the hands of big money.\n\nNOW READ: Yellow journalism exposed: The unfair targeting of Biden's flaws vs Trump's crimes\n\nRobert Reich is a professor of public policy at Berkeley and former secretary of labor.

The unprecedented announcement, delivered less than four months before the election, immediately upended a campaign that both political parties view as the most consequential in generations.\n\nThe president - intent on serving out the remainder of his term in office - quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump and encouraged his party to unite behind her, making her the party's instant favorite for the nomination at its August convention in Chicago .\n\nThe announcement is the latest jolt to a tumultuous campaign for the White House, coming a week after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nA party's presumptive presidential nominee has never stepped out of the race so close to the election. President Lyndon Johnson, besieged by the Vietnam War, announced in March 1968 that he would not seek another term after just a single state's primary. Biden's July decision comes after more than 14 million Democrats cast votes supporting him through the primary process.\n\nHarris, in a statement, praised Biden's \"selfless and patriotic act\" and said she intends to \"earn and win\" her party's nomination.\n\n\"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party - and unite our nation - to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\" she said.\n\nBiden's decision to bow out came after escalating pressure from his Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate , in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former president's many falsehoods .\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden wrote in a letter posted Sunday to his X account.\n\nNearly 30 minutes after he delivered the news that he was folding his campaign, Biden threw his support behind Harris.\n\n\"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" he said in another post on X. \"Democrats - it's time to come together and beat Trump.\"\n\nHarris faces a staggering political to-do list in the coming days: securing the votes of delegates to claim her party's nomination, picking a running mate, and pivoting a massive political operation that had been built to reelect Biden to boost her candidacy instead. Harris, if elected, would be the first woman and the first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nThere were early signs that the party was moving to coalesce around Harris, who scored the endorsements of the Congressional Black Caucus and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even before she had commented on Biden's decision to quit the race. But notably, former President Barack Obama held off, pledging support behind the eventual party nominee.\n\nWhat to know :\n\n\"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,\" the Clintons said in a statement.\n\nBut Obama, who had privately shared doubts about Biden's reelection chances, stopped short of endorsing Harris even as he praised Biden for his decision to leave the race.\n\n\"I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBiden's decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide \"detail\" about his decision.\n\nHarris found out about Biden's plans on Sunday morning and senior campaign and White House staff were notified just minutes before the letter went out, according to people familiar with the matter who commented on the private discussions on condition of anonymity. Biden had been reflecting on his future for the past couple days and the decision was closely held.\n\nNow, Democrats have to urgently try to bring coherence to the nominating process in a matter of weeks and convince voters in a stunningly short amount of time that their nominee can handle the job and beat Trump. And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden.\n\nThe decision marks a swift and stunning end to Biden's 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years.\n\nBiden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one , which would have made his nomination a formality. Now that he has dropped out, those delegates will be free to support another candidate .\n\nHarris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaign's war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules.\n\nBiden's campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation - a sign of the advantage she has in the race for the Democratic nomination. Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also filed paperwork changing the names of their joint fundraising committees to reflect Harris' candidacy.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin.\n\nIt remained to be seen whether other candidates would challenge Harris for the nomination. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had been discussed as a possible replacement for Biden last year, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who challenged both Biden and Harris for the Democratic nomination in 2020, threw their support behind her Sunday.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee's chair, Jaime Harrison, said in a statement that the party would \"undertake a transparent and orderly process\" to select \"a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\"\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who left the Democratic Party earlier this year to become an independent, is considering re-registering as a Democrat to vie for the nomination against the vice president, according to Jonathan Kott, a longtime adviser to Manchin.\n\nHarris was spending Sunday afternoon calling Democratic elected officials and delegates as she works to lock up the nomination.\n\nHarris received her first delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. The Tennessee Democratic Party posted on X that its delegation voted during a meeting Sunday to back Harris after Biden's departure from the campaign.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly - each from a swing state and mentioned as a possible running mate for Harris - also endorsed Harris Sunday evening.\n\nTrump reacted to the news in a post on his Truth Social site, in which he said Biden \"was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve.\"\n\n\"We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,\" he added. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nWhile Trump and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear, his campaign had nonetheless ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified.\n\nDemocratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Biden's decision.\n\n\"His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American.\"\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York praised Biden as \"one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.\"\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Biden should immediately resign if he is not fit enough to run for office. In a statement, Johnson said, \"November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\"\n\nIn addition to his planned address to the country, Biden still intends to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week, according to a person familiar with the president's schedule who was not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nThe exact timing of the meeting is still not set in stone as Biden continues to recover from COVID. Netanyahu is scheduled Wednesday to deliver an address to Congress and he is also expected to meet with Harris while in Washington.\n\nIn 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But once he secured the job he spent decades struggling to attain, he was reluctant to part with it.\n\nBiden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump.\n\n\"Probably 50 of them,\" Biden replied. \"No, I'm not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him.\"\n\nBiden is already the country's oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was \"watch me.\"\n\nAnd watch him they did. His poor debate performance prompted a cascade of anxiety from Democrats and donors who said publicly what some had said privately for months, that they did not think he was up to the job for four more years.\n\nConcerns over Biden's age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection , though Trump is just three years younger at 78. Most Americans view the president as too old for a second term , according to an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . A majority also doubt his mental capability to be president, though that is also a weakness for Trump.\n\nBiden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesn't walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot.\n\n\"I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,\" he told supporters at a rally in North Carolina a day after the debate. \"Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.\"\n\nBut voters had other problems with him, too - he has been deeply unpopular as a leader even as his administration steered the nation through recovery from a global pandemic, presided over a booming economy and passed major pieces of bipartisan legislation that will impact the nation for years to come. A majority of Americans disapprove of the way he's handling his job , and he's faced persistently low approval ratings on key issues including the economy and immigration.\n\nBiden's motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump. He had retired from public service following eight years serving as vice president under Obama and the death of his son Beau but decided to run after Trump's comments following a \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when white supremacists descended on the city to protest the removal of its Confederate memorials.\n\nTrump said: \"You had some very bad people in the group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. On both sides.\"\n\nBiden's wife, first lady Jill Biden, responded to the president's announcement by reposting Biden's letter announcing his decision and adding red heart emojis.\n\nGranddaughter Naomi Biden Neal said on social media, \"I'm nothing but proud of my Pop.\" She said he has served the country \"with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction\" and \"our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him.\"\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden said Monday that his stewardship of American foreign policy has left the U.S. safer and economically more secure, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump will inherit a nation viewed as stronger and more reliable than it was four years ago.\n\nBiden trumpeted his administration's work on expanding NATO, rallying allies to provide Ukraine with military aid to fight Russia and bolstering American chip manufacturing to better compete with China during a wide-ranging speech to reflect on his foreign policy legacy a week before ceding the White House to Trump.\n\nBiden's case for his achievements will be shadowed and shaped, at least in the near term, by the messy counterfactual that American voters once again turned to Trump and his protectionist worldview. And he will leave office at a turbulent moment for the globe, with a series of conflicts raging.\n\n\"Thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the worldwide competition compared to four years ago,\" Biden said in his address at the State Department. \"America is stronger. Our alliances are stronger. Our adversaries and competitors are weaker. We have not gone to war to make these things happen.\"\n\nThe one-term Democrat took office in the throes of the worst global pandemic in a century, and his plans to repair alliances strained by four years of Trump's \"America First\" worldview were quickly stress-tested by international crises: the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine , and Hamas' brutal 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war in the Middle East .\n\nBiden argued that he provided a steady hand when the world needed it most. He was tested by war, calamity and miscalculation.\n\n\"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play,\" Biden said. \"America is once again leading.\"\n\nTrump, hours after the remarks, said Biden had overseen \"a terrible four years\" in American foreign policy.\n\n\"When you look at what happened, during this last four-year period, I think it was the lowest point in the history of our country,\" Trump said in a Newsmax interview. \"It's been so bad.\"\n\nWith the U.S. completing its 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden fulfilled a campaign promise to wind down America's longest war .\n\nBut the 20-year conflict ended in disquieting fashion: The U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed , a grisly bombing killed 13 U.S. troops and 170 others, and thousands of desperate Afghans descended on Kabul's airport in search of a way out before the final U.S. aircraft departed over the Hindu Kush.\n\nThe Afghanistan debacle was a major setback just eight months into Biden's presidency that he struggled to recover from.\n\n\"Ending the war was the right thing to do, and I believe history will reflect that,\" Biden said. \"Critics said if we ended the war, it would damage our alliances and create threats to our homeland from foreign-directed terrorism out of a safe haven in Afghanistan - neither has occurred.\"\n\nBiden's Republican detractors, including Trump, cast it as a signal moment in a failed presidency.\n\n\"I'll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country,\" Trump said in his lone 2024 presidential debate with Biden , just weeks before the Democrat announced he was ending his reelection campaign.\n\nWith Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden rallied allies in Europe and beyond to provide Ukraine with billions in military and economic assistance - including more than $100 billion from the U.S. alone. That allowed Kyiv to stay in the fight with Russian President Vladimir Putin's vastly bigger and better-equipped military.\n\nBiden's team also coordinated with allies to hit Russia with a steady stream of sanctions aimed at isolating the Kremlin and making Moscow pay an economic price for prosecuting its war.\n\nBiden on Monday marveled that at the start of the war Putin thought Russian forces would easily defeat Ukraine in a matter of days. It was an assessment U.S. and European intelligence officials shared.\n\nInstead, Biden said his administration and its allies have \"laid the foundation\" for the Trump administration to help Ukraine eventually arrive at a moment where it can negotiate a just end to the nearly three-year old conflict.\n\n\"Today, Ukraine is still a free and independent country with the potential for a bright future,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump has criticized the cost of the war to U.S. taxpayers and has vowed to bring the conflict to a quick end.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan made the case that Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, should consider the backing of Ukraine through the prism of a dealmaker.\n\n\"Donald Trump has built his identity around making deals, and the way you make a good deal is with leverage,\" Sullivan said in an interview. \"Our case publicly and privately to the incoming team is build the leverage, show the staying power, back Ukraine, and it is down that path that lies a good deal.\"\n\nIn the Middle East, Biden has stood by Israel as it has worked to root out Hamas from Gaza. That war spawned another in Lebanon, where Israel has mauled Iran's most powerful ally, Hezbollah, even as Israel has launched successful airstrikes openly inside of Iran for the first time.\n\nThe degradation of Hezbollah in turn played a role when Islamist-led rebels last month ousted longtime Syrian leader Bashar Assad , a brutal fixture of Iran's \"Axis of Resistance.\"\n\n\"Iran is weaker than it's been in decades,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's relationship with Israel's conservative leader Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been strained by the enormous Palestinian death toll in the fighting -now standing at more than 46,000 dead - and Israel's blockade of the territory, which has left much of Gaza a hellscape where access to food and basic health care is severely limited.\n\nPro-Palestinian activists have demanded an arms embargo against Israel, but U.S. policy has largely remained unchanged. The State Department in recent days informed Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East negotiator, said the approach has put Iran on its heels, but Biden will pay a reputational cost for the devastation of Gaza.\n\n\"The administration was either unable or unwilling to create any sort of restraint that normal humans would regard as significant pressure,\" Miller said. \"It was beyond Joe Biden's emotional and political bandwidth to impose the kinds of sustained or significant pressures that might have led to a change in Israeli tactics.\"\n\nMore than 15 months after the Hamas-led attack that prompted the war, around 98 hostages remain in Gaza. More than a third of those are presumed dead by Israeli authorities.\n\nBiden's Middle East adviser Brett McGurk is in the Middle East, looking to complete an elusive hostage and ceasefire deal as time runs out in the presidency.\n\n\"We are on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition,\" Biden said.\n\nTrump, for his part, is warning that \"all hell\" will be unleashed on Hamas if the hostages aren't freed by Inauguration Day.\n\nSullivan declined to comment on Trump's threats to Hamas, but offered that the two sides are in agreement about the most important thing: getting a deal done.\n\n\"Having alignment of the outgoing and incoming administration that a hostage deal at the earliest possible opportunity is in the American national interest,\" he said. \"Having unity of message on that is a good thing, and we have closely coordinated with the incoming team to this effect.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter , sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family.\n\nThe Democratic president had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. The move on Sunday night comes weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House.\n\nIt caps a long-running legal saga for the younger Biden, who publicly disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020 - a month after his father's 2020 victory - and casts a pall over the elder Biden's legacy.\n\nBiden, who time and again pledged to Americans that he would restore norms and respect for the rule of law after Trump's first term in office, ultimately used his position to help his son, breaking his public pledge to Americans that he would do no such thing.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversed his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for his family's benefit. Here's what to know.\n\nIn a statement released Sunday evening, Biden said, \"I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nThe president's sweeping pardon covers not just the gun and tax offenses against the younger Biden, but also any other \"offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\"\n\nIn June, Biden categorically ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son, telling reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case, \"I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.\"\n\nAP correspondent Jennifer King reports on President Biden's move to pardon Hunter Biden.\n\nAs recently as Nov. 8, days after Trump's victory, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, \"We've been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.\"\n\nThe elder Biden has publicly stood by his only living son as Hunter descended into serious drug addiction and threw his family life into turmoil before getting back on track in recent years. The president's political rivals have long used Hunter Biden's myriad mistakes as a political cudgel against his father: In one hearing, lawmakers displayed photos of the drug-addled president's son half-naked in a seedy hotel.\n\nHouse Republicans also sought to use the younger Biden's years of questionable overseas business ventures in a since-abandoned attempt to impeach his father, who has long denied involvement in his son's dealings or benefiting from them in any way.\n\n\"The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,\" Biden said in his statement. \"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.\"\n\n\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,\" Biden added, claiming he made the decision this weekend.\n\nThe president had spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, with Hunter and his family, and departed for Angola later Sunday on what may be his last foreign trip as president before leaving office on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nHunter Biden was convicted in June in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when , prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.\n\nHe had been set to stand trial in September in the California case accusing him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. But he agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges in a surprise move hours after jury selection was set to begin.\n\nDavid Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who negotiated the plea deal, was subsequently named a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to have more autonomy over the prosecution of the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden said he was pleading guilty in that case to spare his family more pain and embarrassment after the gun trial aired salacious details about his struggles with a crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe tax charges carry up to 17 years behind bars and the gun charges are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though federal sentencing guidelines were expected to call for far less time and it was possible he would have avoided prison time entirely.\n\nHunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month in the two federal cases, which the special counsel brought after a plea deal with prosecutors that likely would have spared him prison time fell apart under scrutiny by a judge. Under the original deal, Hunter was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and and would have avoided prosecution in the gun case as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled last year when the judge raised concerns about unusual aspects of the deal. The younger Biden was subsequently indicted in the two cases.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team this weekend released a 52-page white paper titled \"The political prosecutions of Hunter Biden,\" describing the president's son as a \"surrogate to attack and injure his father, both as a candidate in 2020 and later as president.\"\n\nThe younger Biden's lawyers have long argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict the president's son amid heavy criticism by Trump and other Republicans of what they called the \"sweetheart\" plea deal.\n\nRep. James Comer, one of the Republican chairmen leading congressional investigations into Biden's family, blasted the president's pardon, saying that the evidence against Hunter was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability,\" Comer said on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBiden is hardly the first president to deploy his pardon powers to benefit those close to him.\n\nIn his final weeks in office, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in law, Jared Kushner, as well as multiple allies convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Trump over the weekend announced plans to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. envoy to France in his next administration.\n\nTrump, who has pledged to dramatically overhaul and install loyalists across the Justice Department after he was prosecuted for his role in trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election, said in a social media post on Sunday that Hunter Biden's pardon was \"such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice.\"\n\n\"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\" Trump asked, referring to those convicted in the violent Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.\n\nHunter Biden said in an emailed statement that he will never take for granted the relief granted to him and vowed to devote the life he has rebuilt \"to helping those who are still sick and suffering.\"\n\n\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction - mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,\" the younger Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team filed Sunday night in both Los Angeles and Delaware asking the judges handling his gun and tax cases to immediately dismiss them, citing the pardon.\n\nA spokesperson for Weiss did not respond to messages seeking comment Sunday night.\n\nNBC News was first to report Biden was expected to pardon his son Sunday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Josh Boak in Nantucket, Massachusetts, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden needs to end his campaign. The first presidential debate, held last night, was a disaster. It was clear from the outset that Biden looked old, sounded old, and yes, is in fact very, very old.\n\nThis has been rumored for a while. Last night, it was confirmed.\n\nPanic seemed to set in among Democrats within minutes of the candidates taking the stage-on social media, at shell-shocked \"watch parties.\" Full freak-out mode was achieved by the 20-minute mark.\n\nBiden's voice kept trailing off, and he kept getting lost in his train of thought. Donald Trump was sneering and lying. He said a bunch of stuff that made no sense-about club championships, cognitive tests, the whole farce of it. It didn't matter. The only thing that mattered in this debate was Biden: his hushed and halting voice. His befuddled resting face. He looked like he wanted to be in bed. Or maybe every Democrat in America was just projecting. People kept sending me vomit emojis, among other things.\n\nAides soon leaked that the president had a cold. Whatever. He hasn't looked this bad in public for years. It was painful to watch, and it's not getting better. The whispers were polite, deferential for a while. Eighty-one? Really? Is he up to this?\n\nClearly not. Biden needs to step aside, for the sake of his own dignity, for the good of his party, for the future of the country . This debacle of a debate was a low point. It needs to be a turning point.\n\nAt least expectations for Biden were extremely low going in. At best, he met those expectations. At worst, well-when I surveyed the social-media chatter at 11:30 p.m., a large majority of people sympathetic to Biden seemed to be taking the under.\n\n\"At Least No One Is Accusing Biden of Using Drugs,\" read one headline in New York magazine. In Atlanta, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Georgia's Senator Raphael Warnock were immediately asked in the post-debate \"spin room\" whether Biden should step aside, as many have already suggested. \"Absolutely not,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"This night was a total disaster for Biden,\" tweeted the former Republican congressman and ubiquitous Never Trumper Joe Walsh. \"He looked way too old. He looked like he's no longer capable.\" Walsh added that every word out of Trump's mouth was a lie and he remains a direct threat to democracy, \"but Trump won this debate going away.\"\n\nEven Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking on CNN, declined to address questions about her boss's performance except to acknowledge that \"it was a slow start.\" (In fairness, Trump's former vice president isn't even supporting him.)\n\nThe best part of this debate for Democrats is that it happened on June 27. There are nearly two months to go until the Democratic Convention in Chicago. If Biden has any sense of how he performed-and hopefully some tough love from those closest to him will make it abundantly clear-he will quit, and soon. It will be a mess to pick a replacement in eight weeks. Harris would have a natural advantage, but the Democrats should throw it open to all comers: Governors Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, Senators Warnock and Amy Klobuchar, all the usual mentions and some surprises. See what happens in Chicago.\n\nWhatever happens would not be as bad as what happened to Biden last night in Atlanta. Or, for that matter, to the scores of people around the country and globe who have been forced to root for him against the catastrophic alternative. Denial had its place, but it is not a strategy. This is no time for second-guessing or hand-wringing or bed-wetting or dawdling. The Democrats' problem has never been more apparent. Last night was a bitter way to get the message, but there it was, in full ashen display. If Trump poses the threat to democracy that Democrats insist he does, they need a much better athlete on the stage.\n\nThere's plenty to blame for this imbroglio-beginning with Biden and his hubris, but also the legions of Democrats who refused to say in public what they've all been saying in private for months: that they feared Biden was too old for this. Ideally, the process would have started a year ago, or 18 months ago. It would have been nice if one or three of them-other than Representative Dean Phillips -had actually dared to run against him in a primary. (Shout-out to Phillips, by the way, the clear-cut winner of the I-told-you-so primary.)\n\nBut again, blame can wait, and the judgment of history will be harsh enough if Trump winds up back in the White House. Right now, though, there's still time to do something. Time for action."

      "text": "Biden's Tarnished Legacy\n\nHe failed to grasp both the political moment and the essential mission of his presidency.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden still imagines that he could have won. Asked by USA Today 's Susan Page whether he could have beaten Donald Trump if he had stayed in the race, Biden responded: \"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes.\"\n\nReality thinks not.\n\nOf course, we'll never know for sure, but the evidence (including polling) suggests that he would have been crushed by an even larger margin than Kamala Harris was. Biden's answer is a reminder that his legacy will be tarnished by his fundamental misreading of the moment and his own role in it.\n\nTo be sure, Biden can point to some impressive successes. He leaves behind a healthy and growing economy, a record of legislative accomplishment, and more than 230 judicial appointments , including a Supreme Court justice. And then there were the failures: the chaotic exit from Afghanistan ; a massive surge of migrants at the border in 2023. Although Biden was not solely to blame for inflation-factors included the Federal Reserve's low-interest-rate policy and Russia's invasion of Ukraine-his spending policies contributed to the problem . And even though he rallied Europe to the defense of Ukraine, critics suggest that he also misread that moment-Phillips Payson O'Brien argued in The Atlantic in November that the Biden administration \"treated the conflict like a crisis to be managed, not a war to be won.\" Ukraine's uncertain fate is now left to Biden's successor.\n\nA charismatic and energetic president might have been able to overcome these failures and win a run for reelection. Some presidents seize the public's imagination; Biden barely even got its attention. He presumed that he could return to a Before Times style of politics, where the president was a backroom bipartisan dealmaker. Whereas Trump dominated the news, Biden seemed to fade into the background almost from the beginning, seldom using his bully pulpit to rally public support or explain his vision for the country. Trump was always in our faces, but it often felt like Biden was ... elsewhere.\n\nBiden also misread the trajectory of Trumpism. Like so many others, he thought that the problem of Trump had taken care of itself and that his election meant a return to normalcy. So he chose as his attorney general Merrick Garland, who seems to have seen his role as restoring the Department of Justice rather than pursuing accountability for the man who'd tried to overturn the election. Eventually, Garland turned the cases over to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought indictments. But it was too late. With time running out and a Supreme Court ruling in favor of broad presidential immunity, Trump emerged unscathed. And then came the sad final chapter of Biden's presidency, which may well overshadow everything else.\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2020, Biden described himself as a \"transition candidate\" and a \"bridge\" to a new generation of leaders. But instead of stepping aside for those younger leaders, Biden chose to seek another term, despite the growing evidence of his decline. With the future of democracy at stake, Biden's inner circle appeared to shield the octogenarian president. His team didn't just insist that voters ignore what was in front of their eyes; it also maintained that the aging president could serve out another four-year term. Some Democrats clung to denial-and shouted down internal critics-until Biden's disastrous debate performance put an end to the charade.\n\nEven then, Biden stubbornly tried to hang on , before intense pressure from his own party forced him to drop out of the race in July. Now he is shuffling to the end of his presidency, already shunted aside by his successor and still in denial.\n\nAs the passing of Jimmy Carter reminds us, presidential legacies are complicated matters, and it is difficult to predict the verdict of history. But as Biden leaves office, he is less a transformational figure than a historical parenthesis. He failed to grasp both the political moment and the essential mission of his presidency.\n\nOther presidents have misunderstood their mandate. But in Biden's case, the consequences were existential: By his own logic, the Prime Directive of his presidency was to preserve democracy by preventing Donald Trump's return to power. His failure to do so will likely be the lasting legacy of his four years in office.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nYou're Going to Die.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nIt was a very hard thing for President Joe Biden to do, and it was the right thing for him to do.\n\nBiden announced today that he would step aside as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIn a letter to the nation, America's 46th president said, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President.\"\n\nThe decision by the 81-year-old Biden was very nearly inevitable, as his chances to defeat Donald Trump collapsed and the odds of a Republican landslide victory increased, but its announcement was nevertheless a stunning moment. In an instant, Democrats were liberated from an issue, Biden's age, that had hung like a millstone around their necks. This will unleash an enormous amount of energy within the party. What was looking like a rout is now a race.\n\nThere will be plenty of commentary on what this means for both parties. But I find my thoughts this afternoon going to President Biden and his family-and to this agonizing denouement for a man who was first elected to public office more than half a century ago, at the age of 29.\n\nBiden was clearly reluctant to make this decision; it was in many ways forced upon him, and by a particularly painful process. The party he loved and to which he has dedicated his entire adult life turned on him, including former colleagues and trusted friends. They were right to urge Biden to step aside-it had to be done, and those in Biden's party took no delight in doing it-but from the president's perspective, this felt like a betrayal.\n\nI imagine this triggered Biden's insecurities, the sense that he was never taken as seriously as he should have been. He has created a narrative about himself, and not without reasons, as Comeback Joe. His political career was declared finished multiple times, including in 1987, when he withdrew from the presidential campaign because he was caught plagiarizing the life story of Neil Kinnock; in 2016, when President Barack Obama pushed his own vice president aside in favor of Hillary Clinton; and in 2020, when his campaign was flat on its back until it was resurrected in South Carolina. So it's not surprising that Biden, facing the worst crisis of his political life, would tell himself that this is just another obstacle to overcome, another chance for the scrappy kid from Scranton to prove the experts wrong, and in doing so, it would only add to his legend.\n\nBut this is different. This is a story without a comeback. Persistence, determination, and grit have nothing to do with this. Biden is in the midst of a rapid and irreversible physical and mental decline. This was evident even before the June 27 debate with Trump, but on the CNN stage in Atlanta, his debilities were on excruciating display. Many Americans, including those who have been most supportive of Biden, felt that night should never have been allowed to happen; that those who loved him should have protected Biden from the unforgiving glare of the spotlight; that Biden in this state should have been seen only within the privacy of family, not broadcast to the world.\n\nHis public appearances since then haven't been quite as bad as what we saw on the debate stage, but they have been bad enough.\n\nBiden's withdrawal, then, wasn't simply necessary because he had lost the confidence of the country and even his own party. For him to agree to step aside means, on some level at least, he is acknowledging that he is entering a difficult final chapter of his life. There is grief in that. Coming to that point will of course stir up powerful emotions-denial, anger, bitterness that those he trusted have betrayed him. That isn't true, but it feels true to him, as it might to many of us.\n\nComing to terms with mortality is never easy. We rage against the dying of the light . Many elderly people face the painful moment of letting go, of losing independence and human agency, when they are told by family they have to give up the keys to the car; Biden was told by his party to give up the keys to the presidency. Of course this proud man would fight to hang on.\n\nBut in the end, and to his credit, Joe Biden got to where he needed to be, and not a moment too soon. Staying in the race would have been an act of monumental selfishness. As it is, what he did will be seen as an act of impressive selflessness.\n\nIt's not clear whether Trump can be beaten. Democrats have dug themselves into a deep hole. But at least they now have a fighting chance."

      "text": "Biden Silences the Doubters\n\nHe's always been master of \"the connect.\"\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nIt is hardly fashionable to say positive things about Joe Biden these days. I myself have been among his doubters, convinced that he'd never be able to win a rematch against Donald Trump. I imagined myself on a flight bound for Reykjavík, Lisbon, Sydney, wherever on November 6, staring backwards out the window and squinting at the smoking ruins of American democracy, grimly praying that I wouldn't turn into a pillar of salt.\n\nBut it's undeniable that Biden gave a stunning speech last night, and it wasn't just because there was a game on quality to his remarks, the thwapping sound of a gauntlet hitting the ground. It's because he managed to do that thing he does best, which his aides long ago described to Richard Ben Cramer in What It Takes as \" the connect .\" Biden's primary strength has never been formulating policy or grand ideas. It's been his ability to read a room, to sweep in the energy that's already there, and to make the most impersonal settings feel deeply intimate, like one-on-one discussions. And last night, in his State of the Union address-generally the dullest and most choreographed of presidential rituals-he did just that.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The most unusual State of the Union in living memory\n\nThere was a call-and-response quality to the whole affair. In the after-chatter, the one spontaneous part of this ritual, Representative Gregory Meeks told Biden he was \"a Baptist preacher tonight!\" And Senator Raphael Warnock, an actual Baptist preacher, approvingly called it \"a sermon.\" During the address, Biden was also engaging with his hecklers (I'm looking at you, Marjorie Taylor Greene); razzing his legion of obstructionists (\"If any of you don't want that money in your district, let me know\"); and cheerfully replying to boos. (\"Oh no? You guys don't want another $2 trillion tax cut for the super wealthy? That's good to hear.\") He spoke in different registers, at one point lowering his voice and talking far more casually and amusingly about a meeting with the leaders of a business roundtable a year and a half ago. (\"They were mad that I-they were angry-well, they were discussing why I wanted to spend money on education.\") And I'm fairly confident that he was the first president delivering the State of the Union to mention potato chips.\n\nAs he was wrapping up, Biden directly addressed Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, once (and maybe still) clearly his pal, because until Donald Trump came along, Graham was one of the most reliable bipartisan players in the Senate. \"I know you don't want to hear any more, Lindsey,\" he said. \"But I've got to say a few more things.\"\n\nThis was a reminder that Biden remains, in some sense, a creature of the Senate, a place where once upon a time you spoke with those with whom you disagreed, because alliances across the aisle were necessary in order to pass legislation. Mitch McConnell and the more radicalized Trump caucus changed all that, believing obstruction was a better political strategy, and it wasn't that hard to do, seeing as they didn't much believe in government anyway. But Biden still has an element of LBJ in him, believing in persuasion-and sharing, to boot, his wariness and resentment of fancy-pants Ivy League elites.\n\nI still flinch when Biden mixes up leaders and countries, though Trump does the same and knows one-thousandth of what Biden does and speaks with zero coherence. Trump's followers will forgive anything; Biden's won't. And I still fear that Biden may not have the stamina to consistently deliver the sort of barn burner he gave last night on the campaign trail. That kind of energy is hard to sustain, even if you've got the freakish stamina that state and national politics requires, or what one of LBJ's aides called \"extra glands.\"\n\nRead: Biden is still the Democrats' best bet for November\n\nBut last night, Biden proved that he's not at all the frail, rapidly dementing Ichabod of GOP caricature, and in fact may be far better at this whole reelection thing than Democrats had suspected. He may make his naysayers in the mainstream press rethink the conventional wisdom for a while. This SOTU might make all of us STFU, however briefly.\n\nBiden still has, at the very least, a flair for retail politics. The best proof of that was how long he lingered once the speech was over-35 extra minutes-chitchatting with everyone in the chamber. The Secret Service kept urging him to leave; Speaker Mike Johnson tapped his watch , also signaling that it was time to go. But Biden remained, even as the lights were dimming all around him . At 81, he couldn't resist the connect."

      "text": "How Risky Is COVID for an 81-Year-Old?\n\nOnce again, Joe Biden has COVID-19.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nToday, for the third time in two years, President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19, the White House said. The president was in Las Vegas-attempting to convince voters, donors, and his fellow lawmakers that he is still the candidate best poised to defeat former President Donald Trump in November-when he fell ill with a runny nose and cough, according to a White House statement . He's already taking the antiviral Paxlovid and will isolate at his home in Delaware.\n\nSince Biden's first two COVID bouts-an initial case and a rebound shortly thereafter in 2022-much has changed for the president, and for the trajectory of the pandemic. Biden's cognitive abilities have come under more intense scrutiny, especially following a debate with Trump last month in which the president demonstrated difficulty completing sentences and holding on to a train of thought. Reported rates of COVID infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have declined-thanks in large part to vaccination-and precautions have become ever more rare. Biden is vaccinated and has superb access to medical care. Chances are, he will be fine. Yet one basic fact remains unchanged: COVID is still capable of inflicting great damage, especially upon the elderly.\n\nIn June, according to provisional CDC data, about four out of every 100,000 Americans over the age of 75 (or 0.004 percent) died with COVID-19. That's a far cry from the staggering fatality rates of 2020 (roughly 0.17 percent for the same age group in April of that year), but still sizable in comparison with younger Americans' risk. The June 2024 COVID death rate among 30-to-39-year-olds, for example, is two out of every 10 million . Hospitalizations tell a similar story for the elderly: Last month, more than 60 out of every 100,000 Americans over 75 were hospitalized with COVID. And according to the CDC, this is likely an undercount.\n\nStill, the risks of COVID seem to increase over even just a few years of life for the elderly. People 75 or older are currently 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized and seven times as likely to die with COVID as people ages 65 to 74. And people in their 80s can accumulate health problems with startling speed. Heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, and stroke-all maladies more likely to affect older people-increase a person's chances of serious complications from COVID.\n\nBiden is as likely as any American of his age to come away from this infection with minimal long-term effects. So far, according to the White House's statement, his symptoms are mild, he has no fever, and his blood-oxygen level is normal. He was first vaccinated against COVID in 2020 and has received several shots since, most recently in September . Vaccines are proven to mitigate the most serious risks of the disease, especially among the elderly. And should things take a turn, Biden, as president, has care teams and resources at his instant disposal.\n\nThat said, as far as COVID is concerned, good for an 81-year-old is not reliably good. And COVID does not have to kill someone to have troubling, lasting effects. Even mild bouts of COVID can lead to symptoms that linger for weeks or years and range from inconvenient to debilitating. In a study published today, about 7.8 percent of patients infected since Omicron became the dominant variant in the United States developed long-term symptoms. Given current concerns about the president's health and brainpower, any further deterioration is a sobering prospect. A report published by the National Academies of Science last month found that older Americans are especially at risk of cognitive impairment following a COVID infection. What would that mean for a man who has already shown signs of substantial decline-a man subjected to the rigors of one of the most demanding jobs on the planet during the most crucial political campaign of our lifetimes, who refuses to lift the burden of American democracy from his aging shoulders?\n\nTen days ago-after Biden's feeble debate performance, but before a gunman attempted to assassinate his opponent at a rally-the president made a perplexing statement. Addressing the crowd at a Pennsylvania campaign event, he declared, \"I ended the pandemic.\" The reality is that COVID continues to upend lives every day. Americans should be mindful that it could still upend elections, too.\n\nLila Shroff contributed reporting."

      "text": "C'mon, Man\n\nDoes Joe Biden really understand the stakes?\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here .\n\nNever underestimate the destructive power of a stubborn old narcissist with something to prove.\n\nIdeally no one gets hurt along the way: Maybe grandpop refuses to give up his license, drives into an oak tree, and only the car gets totaled. But sometimes there are casualties: Maybe a pedestrian gets hit.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, 81, is acting like one of history's most negligent and pigheaded leaders at a crucial moment, and right now, we are all pedestrians.\n\nSince his debate debacle nearly two weeks ago, much of America has been locked into the classic \"Will he or won't he?\" cliffhanger. Will Biden step aside and not run for reelection, as massive majorities of voters have for years said they want him to do? Or will he persist in pursuing one of the most ill-fated and ill-advised presidential campaigns ever carried out?\n\nThe spectacle has been endlessly depressing, unless you're Donald Trump or want him back in the White House-in which case you're relishing this slowly unfolding, self-owning, party-destroying wreck. Next week's Republican National Convention is shaping up to be a week-long Mardi Gras of MAGA in Milwaukee.\n\nTim Alberta: Trump is planning for a landslide win\n\n\"The radical-left Democrat Party is divided, in chaos, and having a full-scale breakdown,\" Trump said during a rally in Miami last night, sounding downright giddy. This was a rare declaration from Trump that checks out as 100 percent true. \"They can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president,\" Trump continued. \"Sleepy Joe Biden or Laughing Kamala.\" He taunted Biden by challenging him to another debate, followed by an \"18-hole golf match.\"\n\nAll of this has been thoroughly dispiriting to the majority of Americans who are eager to vote for someone besides Trump. It could easily get worse, too: Imagine what the September debate could look like for Biden if it bears any resemblance to the Accident in Atlanta. Imagine Election Night, or whatever unfolds after, while Biden licks his wounds and ice-cream cones back in Rehoboth Beach and staggers into his forced and disgraced retirement. His legacy-scorers will not be kind. Historians will be brutal. And Biden will deserve his own special place in the pantheon of Great Leaders Who Refused to Go Gracefully, to Tragic Effect.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, hold my prune juice.\n\nIt is now obvious that Biden has in no way internalized the disaster toward which he is defiantly ambling-or, more to the point, toward which he is leading his party and his country (and, for that matter, NATO, Ukraine, thousands of as-yet-not-deported immigrants, and unprosecuted Trump \"enemies\"). He seems fully indifferent to any consideration beyond his own withered pride and raging ego.\n\n\"I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and did the good as job as I know I could do,\" Biden said in what was probably the most quoted line-and not favorably-from his Friday-night interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos . \"That's what it's all about\" is how Biden ended that thought, which seemed to unleash a furious internal cry from so many viewers: No, that's not what this is all about.\n\nC'mon, man.\n\n\"That is the answer that most concerned me,\" Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said Sunday morning on NBC's Meet the Press . \"This is not just about whether he gave it the best college try.\" Wasn't this, supposedly, about the fate of democracy? Existential threats and all the big words and phrases that Biden and his campaign have been tossing out for months? You have to wonder, in retrospect, if they were sincere about how must-win this election really was, given how cavalier Biden sounds.\n\nAs of now, it looks as if Biden is committed to \"riding this out\" and \"staying the course,\" no matter how unfit he might be for the ugly course ahead. This is, maddeningly, the only consideration that now matters, because Biden is the ultimate decision maker. Democrats have no practical way to force him out of the race, except hoping that he comes around and is willing to place the country's best interests ahead of his own. Corny idea, right? But he controls this story, which since the debate has only made him look more and more foolish, selfish, and, yes, likely to lose.\n\nIn the shell-shocked aftermath of Atlanta, many pointed out that at least there was time to do something. It was only June. Biden could reconsider whether it was wise to keep going. No shortage of Biden allies from the Democratic consultant and donor classes, elected office, and the media called-almost immediately-for him to end his campaign. \"The next few days will be critical,\" they said-for Biden to come around; for Democrats to assess their situation and figure out a Plan B (Kamala Harris?), Plan C (a mini-primary?), or Plan Something Else.\n\nDemocrats have now been saying \"the next few days will be critical\" for nearly two weeks. Roughly half of them seem more than eager for Biden to get over himself so they can get on with the business of saving themselves. But Biden controls the clock, which is ticking, and which he seems determined to run out.\n\n\"Biden is treating us the way Trump has treated Republicans for a decade,\" the columnist Josh Barro wrote yesterday on Substack. \"He's pointing a gun at the head of the Democratic Party and threatening to shoot if he doesn't get his way.\"\n\nClearly the White House has no serious answer for people's widespread and legitimate doubts about the president's capacity to serve, let alone for another four-year term. \"Watch me\" has been Biden's glib rejoinder to this question since he came into office-disingenuous at best, given how rare his press conferences, interviews, and unscripted appearances have been. When voters do have the chance to watch Biden-as 50 million debate-viewers did-the results can be grim.\n\nThe other go-to response to nervous Democrats from Biden loyalists has been, simply, \"Calm down.\" \"The polls are wrong.\" \"Joe's got this.\" \"Don't be a bed wetter!\" (\"I'm not sure incontinence is the metaphor you want to go with,\" Jon Stewart pointed out Monday on The Daily Show .)\n\nRogé Karma: Age isn't Biden's only problem\n\nFew elected Democrats have called for Biden to step aside. Instead, they keep insisting that they support him as their nominee-albeit, in many cases, as if they're saying so with the aforementioned gun to their head. Trump is on track \"to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado told CNN's Kaitlan Collins last night. \"The White House has done nothing since the debate to demonstrate they have a plan to win this election.\" But he, too, stopped short of asking Biden to withdraw.\n\nIt seems obvious that the White House has no plan, except to continue to keep Biden mostly out of view and limit him to set-piece and teleprompter appearances. One rare exception to this will occur tomorrow, when Biden will preside over a much-anticipated press conference with other leaders at a NATO summit, a spectacle that will almost certainly be dominated by questions about his age and fitness. It says something about the bleak state of affairs that more than one prominent Democrat I've spoken with in recent days said they secretly hope Biden face-plants again. \"This is a terrible thing to say,\" one White House official told me. \"But that might be the only thing that could force him out at this point, while there's still time to rewrite the ending.\""

      "text": "The Salesman\n\nExperienced, emotional, marked by personal tragedy and political setback, Joe Biden is in many ways the antithesis of the president he serves. But his stock has risen steadily in the West Wing, and with the Democrats poised to lose much of their leverage in the midterm elections, the vice president's unique skills and attributes may prove ever more crucial to his administration's success.\n\nEarly in 1973, not long after he was sworn in to the Senate seat he would hold for more than three decades, Joe Biden attended a dinner party in the upscale Washington suburb of McLean, Virginia. The event, thrown by Biden's fellow freshman senator J. Bennett Johnston Jr., of Louisiana, offered the newcomers a chance to mingle with some of the Senate's old guard.\n\nPolitical analyst Charlie Cook, then a freshman at Georgetown University working as a congressional intern, remembers well both the evening and the presence of Biden, a 30-year-old unknown from Delaware. \"A bunch of us kids had been wrangled into serving drinks and helping out in the kitchen,\" he said. \"All of us were floored by how young Biden was. He was more one of us than one of the senators! And sure enough, when the grown-ups retreated to the dining room, Biden drifted back to the kitchen to hang out with us 20-somethings ... It was hard for us to believe that someone our age, give or take a few years, was already a United States senator.\"\n\nElected when he was just 29, Biden was the youngest member of the upper chamber in modern times, and the sixth-youngest in American history. Inexperienced and unheralded, he'd nonetheless ousted a veteran incumbent, J. Caleb Boggs, who had enjoyed the full backing of President Richard Nixon and the national Republican Party. Biden arrived in Washington with the luster of unlimited promise. Back home they compared him to Kennedy, a parallel he would consciously exploit. He was a man for whom the White House seemed not merely a possibility, but a likelihood. In a notoriously revealing 1974 profile that Kitty Kelley wrote for The Washingtonian , Biden talked about becoming \"a good senator\" and \"a good president.\" Biden's sister, Valerie, who had managed his surprise victory, told Kelley, \"Joey is going to be president someday. He was made to be in the White House ... Just you wait and see.\"\n\nFast-forward to 2007 and the presidential-campaign fields of Iowa. Biden's once-slender facial features had thickened somewhat, giving him the look of an elder statesman straight out of central casting. What little remained of his modishly long hair had gone white; toward the front of his otherwise bald dome a patient hair-plug regimen had replanted a thin copse of strands, which he combed back, so that when the lighting and angle were just right it afforded the semblance of a silver mane. And he didn't just look the part. He was one of the most recognized and influential members of Congress. Scarred by intense personal tragedy, a close brush with his own mortality, and his share of embarrassing missteps, Biden at age 64 was a survivor, in life and in politics. Though the luster of the wunderkind was long gone, the talents he had displayed at the outset of his career had matured. Yet here he was, six months away from the first contest of the 2008 presidential campaign, badly trailing a pack of less-seasoned Democratic hopefuls, mired in the low single digits in every poll, and struggling to raise enough money just to keep going.\n\nIt was a mystery. Back home in Delaware, Biden had a bond with voters that transcended issues and party politics, one that bordered on reverence. \"I remember being in a cheesesteak shop in Claymont, just outside Wilmington, just eating dinner by myself one night years ago, when Joe came in to order something,\" said Cris Barrish, now a senior reporter for The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware. \"It was like royalty or Jesus Christ himself had walked in. He didn't know a reporter was watching, so none of this was for my benefit, but he charmed everybody in that place for a full five minutes. He knew the names of all the women behind the counter. Everyone seemed to want a piece of him, to touch him. That was the first time I fully appreciated the appeal he enjoys in this state.\"\n\nBut that unfailing local electricity, which had propelled him back to the Senate with ease in five consecutive elections, stubbornly refused to travel. His first run for the presidency, in 1987, had sputtered out of the gate, when Biden was discovered passing off as his own passages from a speech by a British Labour politician. Now, 20 years later, he was on his way to another early fizzle. In those months before the Iowa caucuses-where Biden would ultimately finish with less than 1 percent of the vote-it was fair to wonder why he even bothered. Might he be seeking something else? Might he be angling to become secretary of state in the next Democratic administration, or even vice president?\n\nRiding with Biden as he raced from one Iowa event to another, Gannett's Nicole Gaudiano, who had been covering Biden's trifle of a campaign for one of the few newspapers still interested, The News Journal , asked him exactly this question. Biden crushed the suggestion with such flourish and finality that Gaudiano couldn't fit the whole denial into the story she was writing. She reported it in full in a blog post:\n\nToday, Vice President Biden's sunny, spacious office sits just down the hall from the main lobby of the West Wing, at the hub of American power. The other guy on the ticket may have gotten the oval-shaped room overlooking the Rose Garden, but Biden's-which faces west, toward the Eisenhower Executive Office Building-is only a few quick strides away. Sitting across from the vice president this summer on facing sofas, I reminded him of the Iowa quote, emphasizing the word Shermanesquely .\n\nHe leaned back, folding his big hands before him, and shrugged.\n\n\"That was absolutely, positively true when I said it. I swear to God. Ask anybody. I never, never, never, never aspired to be vice president. It had nothing to do with who the hell the president was.\"\n\nCertain allowances need to be made, of course, for campaign rhetoric. But I believe him. Both quotes, from the campaign trail and from the White House, are so prototypically Biden: direct, earnest, forceful, earthy, overstated-note the triple no in the first and the quadruple never in the second-and ultimately, as it turns out, negotiable.\n\nBiden is a salesman-a high-level one, but a salesman at heart. His father sold cars back in Wilmington, and the son has all the same moves. He is a virtuoso talker. That fluency is not a gift but an accomplishment: attaining it meant defeating a severe boyhood stutter, a feat in which he still takes pride. His prodigious loquacity is not about vanity, as his critics claim-although Biden is as vain as the next successful man. It's about selling. It's about the deal. In fact, that's one of his favorite expressions: Here's the deal .\n\nIn What It Takes , the monumental chronicle of the 1988 presidential campaign, author Richard Ben Cramer had this to say about Biden, then in his first formal run for the presidency:\n\nFor most of his adult life, Biden has been selling himself. In 2008, he began selling Barack Obama. The vice presidency is a perfectly respectable office, to be sure, but historically it has been a ticket more often to obscurity than to distinction. It has few official duties or responsibilities that rise above the ceremonial. It was most famously described by Franklin Delano Roosevelt's two-term VP, John Nance Garner, as being worth less than \"a bucket of warm piss.\" For a man of Biden's early promise and abiding energy, it is a comedown. But midway through the administration's first term, he seems to be making it work.\n\n\"I was talking to the president about this just the other day,\" said David Axelrod, one of Obama's senior advisers. \"He was saying that choosing Joe was really the first presidential decision he made, and that as time goes on, he's more and more convinced it may have been his best.\"\n\nThe relationship with Biden was by no means a given. Axelrod noted that not long before being asked to take the second position on the ticket, Biden had been competing hard against Obama, and had seen himself as better qualified for the top job. Lashing together two such big egos was risky. \"It's a little like a shotgun wedding,\" Axelrod told me. \"Sometimes they take, and sometimes they don't.\"\n\nDeclaring his determination \"not to be a pain in the ass\" to the president, Biden has carved out a dynamic role, one of the most involved of any vice president. He is close to the president on a professional level, but seems content to remain on the outer fringe of Obama's trusted core. The idea, he says, is to be \"value added.\"\n\nWalter Mondale is widely considered the first truly modern vice president, in that he was not simply a replacement waiting in the wings, but an important player in the administration in his own right. With the exception of Dan Quayle, every VP since has fit this mold-none more so than the man Biden succeeded, Dick Cheney, who some believed was, on certain issues, actually steering the ship. And while that was an exaggeration, there is no doubt that Cheney built himself a kind of shadow national-security staff during President George W. Bush's two terms. One of the first things Biden did when taking office, he says, was to hand back many of those positions: \"I mean, Cheney had, like, 30, or whatever the hell it was,\" he told me. \"I said, 'Mr. President, you can't have two national-security staffs.' So I went to [National Security Advisor] Jim Jones, whom I recommended for the job. And I said, 'Jim, here's the deal. I don't want any of these staff.' And he was like, 'Holy God, you're kidding.' I said, 'Under one condition: I get to help pick these guys, and I can individually task them [with duties when I need something]. I'll let you know who I'm tasking, but that's it.' We only need one National Security Council. There used to be two. Literally, not figuratively. I mean, literally.\"\n\nNo one believes Obama would want, need, or tolerate a Rasputin across the lobby. But whether it has been managing the tricky drawdown of American involvement in Iraq, or implementing the $787 billion Recovery Act, or soothing worries in Eastern Europe over Obama's revised missile-defense strategy, or helping select two Supreme Court nominees, Biden seems the opposite of a pain in the ass. He has made himself indispensable.\n\nDuring the three-month deliberations over Afghanistan strategy, Biden was the harshest skeptic at the table. Encouraged by Obama, he vetted the military's plans so insistently that to some in the chain of command, he became the enemy. This evidently included the man in charge of the war effort, General Stanley McChrystal, who was portrayed in a Rolling Stone article joking with his inner staff as they derided the vice president. The president accepted McChrystal's resignation, and the general apologized to Biden, who says the gesture wasn't necessary. \"To be very blunt with you, I was flattered,\" Biden told me. \"I mean, it was clear that I was the only guy they worried about.\"\n\nLike most modern vice presidents, Biden has been subjected to the constant ridicule and caricature that seem to accompany the office. And he is, by his own admission, prone to verbal blunders. But Biden's stock has risen steadily in the West Wing, and as the Democrats appear poised to lose much of their leverage in Congress in the upcoming midterm elections, his long experience as a legislator, his warm relationships with his former Senate colleagues, and his relentless salesmanship are likely to become even more important to the president. Even his occasional well-publicized gaffes have served to humanize a leadership team that all too often seems aloof, cerebral, and elitist.\n\nAnd here's the curious thing. By stepping back, by sublimating his own considerable ego and ambition, by settling for second place, Joe Biden may finally have found a way to transplant that Delaware magic. In making his own political fortunes secondary, he has advanced them further than he ever could have on his own.\n\nJoe Biden doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you. There's the direct contact with his blue eyes, the firm handshake while his other hand grasps your arm, the flash of those famously perfect white teeth, and an immediate frontal assault on your personal space. He shoulders right through the aura of fame and high office. Forget the Secret Service, the ever-present battery of aides and advisers, the photographers clicking away: the vice president of the United States moves in like an old pal with something urgent to tell you-just you. If he's in a chair, he'll scoot it closer; when the furniture's not portable, he'll lean forward, planting his elbows on his knees, gesturing with both hands while he speaks, occasionally reaching over to touch your arm or leg for emphasis.\n\nAboard Air Force Two, when Biden wanders back to the cheap seats to greet the reporters in his entourage, he isn't content to simply stand in the aisle and banter. He leans, he reaches, and before you know it he's lowering himself to the cabin floor.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President,\" a reporter protests politely, \"take my seat.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" Biden says, cheerfully dismissing the gesture. And then the second-highest office holder in the free world is seated on the aisle floor, legs stretched out on worn blue carpet, elbows propped on the aisle-side armrests, so he can resume his monologue at eye level, close in.\n\nBiden is well known for commuting between Washington and Wilmington aboard Amtrak, a habit he started decades ago when he was a widower with two small boys. Sitting alone in one of those cramped, four-seat Acela booths around a table, Biden would often recognize passengers and wave them over to join him. I had the pleasure myself once years ago, riding the train from Washington to Philadelphia. The space was knee-to-knee intimate-perfect for his purposes-and Biden held forth animatedly for the entire 70-minute trip. When he stepped off at Wilmington station, the sudden silence in the car seemed like a physical presence, the onset of a vacuum. When I described the experience to a friend who'd taken the same ride more than once, he nodded knowingly and said, \"We call it getting 'Bidened.'\"\n\nBiden is famous, of course, for talking too much. Indeed, it is exceedingly rare to find anyone in a prominent position who does so much of his thinking out loud. This habit has led not only to a propensity for straying off message-a propensity that has bedeviled generations of his political handlers-but also to an outsize reputation for oratory. The vice president is a confident and skillful public speaker, to be sure, but he is best at rousing the converted, rather than at the higher art of persuading the skeptical and undecided. His thousands of turns behind public podiums have yielded not a single indelible speech. The one for which he is most famous is the one he'd most like to forget: the disastrous campaign-trail appearance at the 1987 Iowa State Fair, in which he borrowed liberally, and without attribution, from the British Labour politician Neil Kinnock.\n\nBiden's special talent isn't speaking, but talking . The first is a public act, a practiced performance. The latter is personal and improvisational. All good salesmen know that the key to closing the deal is trust. You need to hold your customers' attention and convince them that you are just like them . Biden is eager to share his own experiences, because trustworthy men have nothing to hide. He takes you immediately into his confidence-this is often what gets him in trouble with reporters-so that you will offer him your own. His language is instructive. He interjects Look , to make sure you are listening closely. If he feels his pitch straying into abstraction, he'll stop mid-sentence to say, Let me break this down for you . He'll dispel complexity with a personal story- My dad, he used to say to me, \"Joey,\" he'd say ... His syntax is confiding, authentic, and peppered with mild profanity. He repeats himself for effect- no, no, no; never, never, never . Despite his patrician appearance, he is proudly, stubbornly blue-collar- Call me Joe .\n\nBiden always has facts and figures handy, but he seeks your support less with logic than with bonhomie. His own emotions are so close to the surface that when he is excited, you feel it; when he is disappointed or sad or angry, he chokes up and his eyes moisten, and you feel that, too. The depth of his belief is, as Richard Ben Cramer put it, \"like a hand\" on your back.\n\nBiden admits his weakness for revealing too much on occasion, but he sees it as a strength, a part of his \"brand\": his gaffes reflect his determination to remain just Joe , to tell it like it is. But his problem runs deeper. Biden has the limber storyteller's tendency to stretch. Though hardly a hanging offense-who among us hasn't burnished a tale now and then?-it's a dangerous tendency on the national political stage. In addition to the plagiarism scandal, in which he embellished his family's humble origins, Biden has in the past exaggerated his scholastic résumé, and when selling himself seems compelled to pump up the facts to his own benefit. Remember that comment to me earlier about handing back to National Security Advisor Jim Jones the \"30\" staffers assigned to his predecessor? It seems Cheney's staff had 10 people, not 30, and of that number, Biden retains seven who report to him directly, while three others have been handed back, or merged with Jones's office. So the correct number is one-tenth Biden's estimate-\"like, 30, or whatever the hell it was.\" We will have to take his word that they now all work together seamlessly. For many years, he described the driver of the truck that struck and killed his first wife and their daughter in December 1972 as drunk, which he apparently was not. The tale could hardly be more tragic; why add in a baseless charge? The family of the truck driver has labored to correct the record, but Biden made the reference to drunkenness as recently as 2007, needlessly resurrecting a false and painful accusation.\n\nMore recently, Biden has told a story of privately upbraiding President George W. Bush over the Iraq War. Challenging Bush's assertion that he was a \"leader,\" Biden claims to have told him, \"Mr. President, turn around and look behind you. No one's following.\" The former president's deputy chief of staff, Karl Rove, insists the exchange never took place, calling the vice president \"a blowhard\" and \"a liar.\" And though Biden sticks to his story, his past brushes with embroidering the truth continue to haunt him.\n\nThough plenty smart, Biden is not an intellectual. He makes few references to books and learned influences in his speeches and autobiography, and he displays little interest in theory. An indifferent student at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University College of Law-he describes the latter as \"boring\"-Biden got by with prodigious cramming sessions. Today, by contrast, he is described by Tony Blinken, Biden's national-security adviser, as a compulsive studier who likes to be overbriefed.\n\n\"He likes to tell the story of the time he got up on the Senate floor to deliver a speech on a bill concerning stripper wells\"-that is, oil wells nearing the end of their productive lives-Blinken said. \"When he finished, an opponent, Senator Russell Long, from Louisiana, got up and asked, 'Senator Biden, have you ever seen a stripper well?' He had not. Long proceeded to demonstrate such an intimate knowledge of wells and oil extraction that the import of Biden's own argument was just overwhelmed. Now he demands that his briefings go 50 feet deep, even if the discussion is only expected to go five feet deep.\"\n\nAs a senator, his proudest legislative accomplishment was the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which broadened law enforcement's tools to protect women from abusive partners. Biden's congressional voting record was generally left of center, but not dramatically so. He was inspired as a young man by the civil-rights movement, he is a strong civil libertarian, and he clearly sees an active role for government in American life. But at the same time, the laissez-faire U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sometimes rated him highly for a liberal lawmaker-as high as 71 percent in 2008.\n\nIn his personal life, Biden could hardly be more traditional. In the scruffy '60s, when so many young men of his generation went unkempt as a social and political statement, Biden dressed up for class in college, sometimes wearing a tie. He says his first wife, Neilia, described him as \"the most socially conservative man she had ever known.\"\n\nThough Biden prides himself on his foreign-policy fluency, he's been all over the map on national-security issues. Author Tom Ricks likes to point out that Biden voted against the Gulf War in 1991 (a quick triumph); in favor of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 (a prolonged disaster); and against the \"surge\" in troops to Iraq in 2007 (a remarkable success). Though Biden has sometimes opposed military action, during the Bosnian War his was the loudest voice in Congress in favor of arming the Muslim minority and encouraging the NATO air strikes against the Serbs.\n\nOn the global stage, as in Delaware, the guideposts in Biden's political landscape are often not ideas, but people. Many of the world leaders with whom the United States has business are men and women he has known for years, even decades. In fall 2009, for example, after Obama had decided to abandon plans to build land-based missile defenses in eastern Europe-a move interpreted as a concession to Moscow-the White House sent Biden on a three-day swing through Poland, Romania, and the Czech Republic to reassure the leaders of those countries that their security would not be compromised. Biden had mastered the details of the issue-the virtues of sea-based anti-missile technology versus land-based, and so on-but his most important asset was that he knew many of the leaders personally.\n\nBarry Pavel, senior director for defense policy on the National Security Council, was along on that trip. He describes the way Biden, in high-level meetings, would wave his hand and reduce the expert advisers accompanying him to decorative furniture. \"It's a thing he does,\" Pavel said, referring specifically to discussions Biden held in Warsaw with Polish leaders. \"We're across the long tables with the coffee and the water and stuff, in these formal meetings, and he'll say, 'Now, these guys are going to tell you all the statistics and these are the brainiacs, but I'm here to tell you, this is much better for Polish security. I'm here to tell you, this is in your interest.' He connects in a very streetwise way ... And that's something I couldn't do, and there are few people in the government who could play the role, I think.\"\n\nAnd once he has connected, once he's leaned in close and has your undivided attention ... well, watch your wallet.\n\nHere's the deal .\n\nIn his 2004 book, The Seven Basic Plots , British author Christopher Booker distills down what he considers the archetypal human narratives. The second of these (after \"Overcoming the Monster\") is \"Rags to Riches,\" which he defines thus:\n\nThis is, in effect, the story that Biden tells in his 2007 campaign autobiography, Promises to Keep .\n\nWe begin with little Joey Biden, growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, crippled by a stutter so dreadful that he is dubbed Joey \"Bye-Bye\" Biden or \"Joe Impedimenta,\" by classmates and teachers alike. He overcomes the disability through diligent practice and eventually delivers a speech at his high-school graduation.\n\nLike many of the heroes in rags-to-riches tales, Biden is a lost child of privilege, a prince among paupers. His father had grown up close to a wealthy maternal cousin, with whom he shared a posh life of country estates, sailing, and partying. But a series of business ventures gone sour sent the senior Joe Biden crashing back down to the blue-collar streets of Scranton, where he was reduced to moving his family in with his in-laws and eventually taking a job as a car salesman when he moved his family to Delaware. \"He was the most elegantly dressed, perfectly manicured, perfectly tailored car sales manager,\" Biden wrote. \"He was a great dancer. He loved to sing, and he had a thoroughgoing grace; I never saw him flustered in a social setting.\"\n\nIn Joey's eyes, the family had been exiled from wealth and social standing; regaining this lost patrimony has been one of the central themes of Biden's life. As a boy, he set his heart on Archmere Academy, a Catholic prep school on a leafy campus across the road from the house his family moved to in Claymont, Delaware, when Joey was 10. His parents couldn't afford the full tuition, but Joey eventually entered a work-study program, and labored on the school's grounds crew in order to attend classes with the elite. He was a handsome boy and a good athlete, and he worked hard at fitting in, at looking and sounding the part. Biden's fascination with the outward trappings of wealth is evident in his description of his first visit to the upstate New York home of his eventual first wife, Neilia Hunter:\n\nBiden would later marry Neilia, finish law school, and set out to build for them the same kind of lavish life. He had the taste and style of an affluent young man, and what he lacked in money he made up for in drive. Cramer vividly records the newly married Biden's pursuit of a suburban mansion equal to his ambitions, an estate that had once belonged to Delaware's native gentry, the du Ponts. It was a purchase that stretched his real and projected means beyond easy belief, but Biden was undeterred. He pursued it with an enthusiasm bordering on obsession, exhibiting the kind of optimism and artful deal-making that would distinguish his whole adult life. He got the house, and has since assiduously maintained the affluent lifestyle he grew up admiring.\n\nBiden's rise was so rapid that his future prospects seemed limitless. Before he was 30, he had an enviable suburban homestead with a beautiful wife and three children, and had somehow managed to win election to the United States Senate. But it all came tumbling down in an instant on December 18, 1972. Just weeks after the election, before Biden had been sworn in, Neilia accidentally steered her car into the path of a truck in rural Delaware. The collision killed her and their baby daughter, Naomi. Their two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were severely injured. Overcome with grief, Biden questioned his faith, contemplated suicide, and was so filled with rage that he walked the streets of Wilmington at night, half-looking for a fight.\n\nOne of his first decisions was to abandon his hard-won Senate seat. He memorably told reporters, \"We can find another senator; my boys cannot find another father.\" Ironically, it was this heartfelt statement that may have permanently cemented Delaware's passion for its young senator. He was eventually persuaded to change his mind, as he tells it, by the kindness and stubbornness of then-Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and other prominent senators. He took his seat a few days after the other members of his class had been sworn in, in 1973. It was arranged for him to take his oath of office beside the hospital bed where Beau was recovering from his injuries. Even then, he still had his doubts. He began making plans to move with his boys to Vermont, to start over where no one knew them.\n\nBiden's ferocious love for his sons was a testimony to his character that would endure through decades of commuting home every night to Wilmington. Who could fail to be moved by it? If such a thing happened today-a promising junior senator, stricken with tragedy, soldiering through his grief, gathering close his wounded boys-it would play out breathlessly on cable TV and the Internet before the entire world. In 1972, it was primarily a local story, which made its impact at home all the more intense. It touched hearts in every corner of Delaware, and voters there have never forgotten. It explains the deep connection reporter Cris Barrish witnessed at the Claymont steak shop all those years ago.\n\nBiden and his boys gradually recovered and, over time, the young senator emerged as the most eligible bachelor in Washington. In 1974, when he was interviewed for The Washingtonian by Kitty Kelley, an early pioneer in the art of the embarrassing celebrity profile, Kelley clearly charmed her subject. Biden foolishly (and typically) took her into his confidence, speaking openly of his grief, and in startlingly intimate terms about his relationship with the departed Neilia. Biden described her as \"my very best friend, my greatest ally, my sensuous lover.\" The two of them had enjoyed a \"sensational\" marriage, sharing everything \"from sex to sports.\" He spoke of his ability to \"satisfy her in bed\" and, showing Kelley a picture of Neilia in a bikini, enthused that \"she had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn't she?\" He spoke openly, needily, of his desire to meet the right woman and remarry: \"I want to find a woman to adore me again.\"\n\nIt was painful to read, especially for Biden. In his autobiography, he wrote: \"It was devastating. I'd been very wary of the press until then. Now I began to actively hate it.\" But he had done this to himself. For all its prurience, the story captured Biden exactly: the frank emotionalism, the recklessly unguarded nature, the penchant for drama, the ambition, the unashamed romanticism.\n\nRomance would return not long after, when Biden spotted Jill Jacobs-like Neilia, a gorgeous blonde-in posters advertising Delaware's New Castle County park system. They were set up on a blind date, and he swept her off her feet. She married Biden in 1977, raised Beau and Hunter, and gave birth to the couple's daughter, Ashley, in 1981. Together, they restored the perfect picture, and set Joey's rags-to-riches story back on the rails. Biden received a bad scare in 1988, when a brain aneurysm came near enough to killing him that a priest administered last rites. But he recovered from this, too. (When he speaks of it, Biden often credits his humiliating plagiarism stumble in the prior year's presidential campaign with saving his life; had he stayed in the race, he says, he likely would have ignored the warning signs that sent him to the doctor.)\n\nThough Biden is consistently ranked as among the least-wealthy U.S. senators, his family has enjoyed a distinctly affluent lifestyle. All three children attended Ivy League schools; eldest son Beau is now the attorney general of Delaware. But if appearances are one thing, the Biden brand is another. Despite the suburban estate, the well-tailored suits, the impressive golf game-Biden shot a 77 the first time Obama invited him out, and he likes to joke that he has not been invited back (he has been)-Biden is still the kid on the grounds crew, the kid with something to prove, Joey Bye-Bye from the streets of Scranton.\n\nAccording to Biden, it went like this: it was spring 2008. He was out of the race for president. He knew his campaign was dead when he finished fifth in Iowa-\"We got our asses kicked\" is how he puts it-behind Obama, John Edwards, Hillary Clinton, and even New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. \"It was no problem,\" he told me. \"I ran my race. I have no regrets. Went out and did what I thought. Said what I said.\"\n\nObama and Clinton were slugging it out in the remaining primaries, and Biden was back to being the senior senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, still commuting most days in his familiar seat on the Acela. It was there, in fact, in June, that he fielded the first call from Obama about the vice presidency.\n\nDuring the campaign, he had mocked the freshman Illinois senator for parroting his own more seasoned views on complex issues, had notoriously patronized him as \"the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\" and had repeatedly characterized Obama as too inexperienced for the job. But that was all part of the game, Biden says. The two men liked each other, and Biden respected Obama's political skills. Still, it would have been hard for Biden not to see this 46-year-old, first-term colleague as a parvenu, as someone cutting in line. But such is the nature of political stardom in America. Biden's early role model, Jack Kennedy, had been even younger when he ran for president.\n\n\"Joe,\" Obama said, \"I'd like your permission to vet you.\"\n\nFor someone in Biden's position, this was not a surprise. He had declined to endorse either Clinton or Obama after dropping out of the race months earlier, and had offered both candidates advice in the months since. On a trip to the Virgin Islands after he dropped out, he and Jill had talked through the option of accepting a job in a new Democratic administration-Biden thought Clinton was as likely to ask him as Obama was-and they had decided he would not, regardless of who won the nomination. But one remote possibility remained. It had come up in a conversation with John Marttila, one of his senior advisers, at a final meeting of his campaign staff.\n\nMarttila told him, \"You really ought to be vice president.\"\n\n\"John, I do not want to be vice president,\" Biden replied. \"Do not talk up vice president for me, okay?\"\n\nMike Donilon, a campaign consultant, reminded Biden of the importance that civil rights had held for him throughout his career. \"You mean to tell me,\" Donilon asked, \"if an African American tells you that he needs you on the ticket in order to win, you'll say no?\"\n\nThe question was left hanging. There was no certainty at that point that Obama would be the nominee. Months later, when the call on the train came, that prospect was more certain. But Biden doubted that Obama would end up choosing him. There was the friction between the two men during the campaign, for one. And more than that, Biden was leery of becoming a vice-presidential also-ran, whose name was floated and then discarded. He had seen presidential front-runners \"drag that bloody rag through the Senate,\" he said, giving everyone the scent.\n\nHe told Obama: \"No, no, no. Look, pal, I told you I'd help you. I'll do anything you want.\"\n\nSo, said Obama, why the hesitation?\n\n\"Yeah, but that didn't include vice president,\" said Biden.\n\nObama said he thought \"anything\" should mean anything , adding, \"I need an answer now.\"\n\n\"If you need an answer now, the answer's no,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Well, how much time do you need?\" Obama asked.\n\n\"I don't need any more time.\"\n\nObama told Biden to think about it more anyway. So Biden called a family meeting. Present were Jill, their sons, his sister, Valerie, and longtime aide Ted Kaufman, who has since been appointed to Biden's Senate seat.\n\n\"I don't want to do this,\" Biden told them. But Jill's reaction surprised him, given the decisions they had made on vacation.\n\n\"You really ought to do it,\" she said.\n\nJill, whom Biden describes as fiercely partisan, was alarmed by the possibility of continued Republican governance, of John McCain in the White House. \"You can't possibly let that happen,\" she said. And Biden came back to Donilon's point, and the central role civil rights had played throughout his political career. How could he refuse to help the first viable African American candidate?\n\nSo Biden called Obama back and agreed to be vetted. \"But here's the condition,\" he said. \"Even if you pick me, I'm not prepared to accept it unless you and I have some very long conversations.\"\n\nWhich is why months later, on August 6, 2008, when the list of prospective running mates had been whittled down to two or three, Biden flew to Minneapolis for a secret meeting with the Democratic nominee. A private jet picked him up at the small Wilmington airport. (\"A Learjet, or something like that,\" Biden said. \"I sure would like to have had one of those when I was campaigning.\") He was smuggled into the candidate's hotel through an underground garage. They talked for three hours.\n\nThe political logic in choosing Biden was plain. He was the picture of a traditional American elder statesman, a perfect balance to the newcomer at the top of the ticket with the dark skin and foreign-sounding name. Biden's decades of experience would add heft to Obama's slender résumé and, at the same time, his Joey-Bye-Bye-from-Scranton persona might be able to shore up Obama's weakness with white, blue-collar voters-a vulnerability Clinton had revealed and exploited.\n\nBut even if choosing Biden made sense for Obama, did it make sense for Biden?\n\nAccording to an account of that Minnesota conversation Biden gave to The New Yorker , the two men discussed everything from \"foreign policy and possible appointments to the federal courts to the legislative strategy that would be needed to pass an Obama agenda.\" Obama questioned Biden about some of his successes in the legislature, and asked if he might be more interested in a Cabinet post than a spot on the ticket. (He was not.) Discussing the job of vice president, Biden said that he would not want to be handed a sweeping, open-ended task to go off and manage on his own, like Vice President Al Gore's charge to reorganize the federal government. He wanted to be in the inner decision-making circle for all major issues, the last person in the room to have Obama's ear. If he was to tackle any specific assignments, he wanted them to be limited ones with an end date.\n\nNot long after that session, Obama picked Biden. Axelrod said that in addition to satisfying the obvious considerations-is he qualified to be president if it comes to that? does he balance the ticket politically?-Obama believed that Biden's long experience in Congress would be an asset on the ticket and would help him govern. Beyond those factors, Obama was swayed by a more immediate practical consideration.\n\n\"Senator Obama felt strongly that Joe understood the challenges and rigors of a national campaign,\" Axelrod told me. Obama \"had learned from his own experience. He felt that it had taken him four to six months of campaigning to get comfortable with the demands.\" The other candidates on Obama's short list, reputed to be Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, would have been as new to a national campaign as Obama had been a year earlier. Biden, who had impressed Obama during their primary debates, would not need months to hit full stride.\n\n\"At the last meeting ... there were all these high-powered lawyers in my Capitol office's so-called hideaway,\" Biden told me. \"And so they're all sitting there, eight, nine of these lawyers, and at the end, Jim Hamilton\"-a Washington lawyer who assisted with the vetting of potential VPs-\"Jim says, 'Well, just one last question, Mr. Chairman.' He said, 'Why do you want to be vice president?'\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Biden.\n\n\"And he looked at me-you can ask him-he looked at me and he said, 'No? Why?'\"\n\n\"Guys,\" said Biden, \"I'm not asking to be vice president, okay? If the president wants me to be vice president-our nominee wants me to be vice president, needs the help- obviously I'm not going to be able to say no. But if you're asking me why do I want to be-I don't want to be vice president.\"\n\n\"Is that really your final word, like, you know, your final answer?\" Hamilton asked.\n\n\"Yeah, that's my final answer,\" said Biden.\n\n\"But I had decided by then, if he were to ask me, obviously I'd do it,\" Biden told me. \"If, in fact, they could show me that, (a) I could actually help him win in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio, etc., and if (b) in fact he really did want me to help him govern, what the hell do you say? But I never-swear to God-I never, ever, ever, ever thought that I'd be asked, and I never contemplated being vice president.\"\n\nDonilon's argument had prevailed. Obama's skills were evident, but beyond them was a narrative that reached back to the founding of America. Here was an African American candidate poised to write, not an ending, but a triumphant new chapter to one of the central and most troubling threads of the American story.\n\n\"And it was driven home to me on the 17th of January\"-inauguration weekend-Biden told me. \"I'm standing on a platform [at the train station] in Wilmington, Delaware. If you looked to the northwest and the southeast, it was no-man's-land back in 1968. That's the part of the city that got burned down ... when Dr. King was assassinated ... And here I am, 40 years later. And it hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm standing there on a cold day, waiting, and all of a sudden I'm looking out ... And I thought to myself, Son of a bitch. I'm standing here waiting for the first black man in the history of America to pick me up to ride 110 miles to be sworn in as vice president of the United States with the first African American .\"\n\nHe recalled seeing enormous crowds of cheering black citizens along the route, as the train moved slowly south. One man in particular-\"I knew him,\" Biden said-held a child up so close to the train that Biden worried for his safety. \"I came back five days later, I'm home, and I run into him at a thing they did for me,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'What the hell were you doing, holding the baby up like that?' And he said, 'Joe, I wanted my grandson to be able to say \"I saw it. I saw it. It's real. It's real.\"' So that's what I mean. The two things I cared about most in my career were the civil-rights movement, and foreign policy and these wars, and here I am with a guy who in one fell swoop\"-Biden clapped his hands-\"changes everything.\"\n\nIn March, the vice president gave an informal speech at a fund-raiser at an opulent home in northwest Dallas, standing behind a podium in a large room decorated with modern art. He began by talking about Barack Obama.\n\n\"I didn't know how good he was until I joined the outfit,\" Biden said. \"And then I realized why it was I did not win. So for those of you who endorsed me first, you all made a mistake.\" It's not unusual for Biden to give several speeches a day, so most of the things he has to say, he says more than once. This comment about the president, and variations upon it, is repeated often.\n\nBiden's unqualified respect was not always there. Like many of those who sought the Democratic nomination, Biden felt early on that the press was giving Obama a free pass, in part thanks to his race. But after more than a year and a half in office, any doubts about Obama's talents have disappeared. Biden is not given to downplaying his own gifts, but he clearly regards Obama as something of a phenomenon.\n\nIn part, this transcends Obama's personal qualities. \"Look, I ran for president,\" Biden told me, \"because I honest-to-God believed that for the moment, given the cast of characters and the problems of the country, I thought I was clearly the best-equipped to lead the country ... But here's what I underestimated: I had two elements that I focused on, which made me decide to run. One was American foreign policy, and the other was the middle class and what's happening to them economically. If Hillary were elected or I were elected, and assume I did as good a job as I could possibly get done, it would have taken me four years to do what [Obama] did in four weeks, in terms of changing the perception of the world about the United States of America. Literally. It was overnight. It wasn't about him. It was about the American people ... It said, these guys really do mean what they say. All that stuff about the Constitution, and all about equality, I guess it's right.\"\n\nBut Biden has been impressed by Obama the man as well. \"He has a backbone like a ramrod,\" the vice president told me. \"He sits there, he gets handed the toughest damn decisions anyone has since Roosevelt, and he sits there and he wants an opposing view. He wants to hear all of it, and he'll sit there and he'll listen. He'll ask really smart questions, and he'll decide. And it's like he goes up, he goes to bed, he doesn't re-litigate it. I mean, the guy's got some real strength. And the thing about him is-what I find impressive is-he really starts off almost everything from a moral and ideological construct, knowing exactly who he is ... He knows what he thinks. When he talks about [the theologian and political theorist Reinhold] Niebuhr, it's not because he's trying to impress. He really does think about the social contract. I mean, the guy's thought it through.\n\n\"He reminds me of [Bill] Clinton. I don't think he'd like it, and maybe Clinton wouldn't like it, but whenever you're with Clinton ... he was never afraid to say to you, 'I don't understand that. Explain that to me.' Or 'I didn't know that.' Because he knew you'd never walk out of the room thinking you were smarter than he was. Barack has the same internal confidence.\"\n\nThat said, it's clear that Biden feels he has the superior people skills-not that he puts it that way. He says the skill set he brings is \"different,\" but it's a difference he values, and one that he sees as part of his contribution to the administration. Obama's \"personality is more reserved,\" Biden said. \"He has the ability to touch large audiences, but he is a little more buttoned-up. I'm a little more Irish. I'm more old-school. What used to be normal. [Bill] Clinton and I are more similar, whereas [Obama] and probably some of the newer candidates are more similar, in terms of the way they went through the system.\" It is just a difference in style, Biden says, but it works. \"I think we complement each other.\"\n\nThere was some initial worry in the White House over Biden's looseness in front of cameras and microphones. Most of his slips have proved minor-such as the one that earned a withering presidential look and nudge on Day One, when Biden, standing beside Obama behind a podium, poked fun at Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts for flubbing his recitation of the oath of office at the inauguration. But some have been more troubling. During the swine-flu epidemic of 2009, when the administration was treading a delicate line between stressing caution and triggering a panic, Biden told a Today show audience of millions, in a nutshell, to avoid air travel. \"I would tell members of my family-and I have-I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now,\" he said. \"If you're in a confined aircraft and one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me.\" The air-travel and tourism industries reeled. Visibly annoyed, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs found himself before the pressroom podium trying to explain what Biden had \"meant to say.\"\n\nBut while Biden's batting average for such bloopers is unquestionably high, the administration has come to see it as a feature, not a bug. Gibbs explained to me, \"It is true [Biden] has earned a reputation, and he definitely has a tendency to say whatever is on his mind when it is on his mind, and that has been much, much more of a plus for us than a detriment. Not just in public. The president wants to know what people really think, what their opinions are, and he has benefited a lot by listening to the questions the vice president asks in meetings. His experience and his candor are valuable things for us. When you look at the two of them side by side, they share none of the same background or experience. In some ways, they could not be more different. But they complement each other powerfully.\"\n\nJudged strictly by appearances, the black, youthful Obama is without question the least likely man ever to occupy the Oval Office. Biden, on the other hand, is close to what you might get if you digitally blended the portraits of the 43 white men who have been president. Where Obama is cerebral, Biden is emotional. Where the president is methodical, the vice president is steered more by his gut. And where Obama is famously disciplined both in public and in private, Biden is-well, you know.\n\nOn March 23, minutes before the national health-care-reform bill-signing, Biden famously greeted the president behind the podium by saying, \"Mr. President, this is a big fucking deal.\" Some alarmed White House aides showed the incriminating video to Gibbs. \"The sound is not that good on my office computer,\" Gibbs told me, \"and one of the guys said hopefully, 'I think he might have said \"This is a big freaking deal.\"' I said, 'Have you ever actually heard the vice president use that word?' Later, when [Biden] talked to me about it, he said that he didn't think he could be heard. I said, 'You were standing in front of a podium in the White House with a microphone and the whole world watching!'\" Still, in the end, Gibbs couldn't deny that Biden had a point, tweeting, \"And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right ... \" It was a big fucking deal.\n\nIf the White House is still worried about Biden's verbal blunders, there's little evidence of it. He is being encouraged to speak more in public, not less, and is regularly trotted out to the Sunday-morning TV interview shows, where his loose verbal style has long made him a favorite, and where he can mix it up with the administration's critics while allowing the president to remain above the fray. There are some weeks when the vice president is more the public face of the administration than his boss.\n\nAnd Biden has grown accustomed to the constant ridicule. He is a regular target for the late-night talk-show hosts-\"Joe Biden is living proof that people can give up sensitive information without being tortured,\" quipped David Letterman in May 2009. On Saturday Night Live , cast member Jason Sudeikis regularly portrays him as a cheerful, loud, fast-talking buffoon, wincingly tolerated by the more sober, judicious Obama. \"It's always been that way,\" Biden said. \"I think it's the nature of the office. When you come to be vice president, it is clear that all you are is an appendage of, you know, a part of-it's not a bad thing, it's just-by nature, it's a diminishing office.\"\n\nI watched Biden on his visits to Warsaw, Bucharest, and Prague last fall, as he arrived with all of the pomp and circumstance of a head of state- the red carpets, the ceremonial bands, the squadrons of security-and I wondered how it felt for him to have landed so close to his life's goal, and yet short of it.\n\n\"I crossed the Rubicon about not being president and being vice president when I decided to take this office,\" he told me. \"The only power you have is totally, completely, thoroughly reflective. There is no inherent power. And so it depends totally upon the relationship you have with the president.\"\n\nBiden is pleased with that relationship, and seems to be enjoying the perks of the office. The biggest change, he says, is his mode of travel, which has both its pleasures and its drawbacks. On the one hand, he has helicopters, jets, and fleets of armored SUVs at his fingertips, and he often brings members of his family along with him on state trips. He and his wife now live at the official Vice President's Residence on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory during the week, but travel back to Wilmington most weekends. During his first year in office, he insisted on taking the train home, which was troubling for his security detail.\n\n\"First time we get on, one of the conductors sees me and he goes, 'Joey!' and he grabs my cheek,\" Biden said, grabbing a thick pinch of flesh to illustrate. \"He's an Italian kid from North Jersey. And, swear to God, Secret Service was going to take his arm off because he reached out for me and he grabbed my cheek. So it drives them crazy.\"\n\nSecurity concerns have since prevailed: Biden now usually makes the commute on a small jet. But when he's home in Wilmington, he insists that his Secret Service detail maintain a very low profile. \"It's so easy to get bubble-ized,\" he said. \"I told them, 'Guys, look, I'll do whatever you tell me I've got to do in Washington and in other states, but in Delaware, no limos, no police escort, and I don't want any goddamn ambulances following me.'\"\n\nOne weekend, he and Jill decided they wanted to go see a movie, so they went to their usual multiplex near Route 202, the Regal Brandywine Town Center 16. The vice president and his wife got in line to buy tickets and, when they reached the window, learned that the movie they wanted to see was sold out. Disappointed, they turned to leave.\n\n\"And the Secret Service says, 'What do you mean?,'\" Biden said, chuckling. His escort felt an exception should be made for the second couple of the United States. \"I said, 'Look, no, no, no, no. Do not do this. They're sold out, they're sold out.'\n\n\"In Delaware,\" Biden said, \"there's a semblance of reality. I still go to the drugstore. I still go to the hardware store. I still go to the haunts that I go to, and restaurants. Because after all these years, in Delaware, I'm Joe.\""

      "text": "How Risky Is COVID for an 81-Year-Old?\n\nOnce again, Joe Biden has COVID-19.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nToday, for the third time in two years, President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19, the White House said. The president was in Las Vegas-attempting to convince voters, donors, and his fellow lawmakers that he is still the candidate best poised to defeat former President Donald Trump in November-when he fell ill with a runny nose and cough, according to a White House statement . He's already taking the antiviral Paxlovid and will isolate at his home in Delaware.\n\nSince Biden's first two COVID bouts-an initial case and a rebound shortly thereafter in 2022-much has changed for the president, and for the trajectory of the pandemic. Biden's cognitive abilities have come under more intense scrutiny, especially following a debate with Trump last month in which the president demonstrated difficulty completing sentences and holding on to a train of thought. Reported rates of COVID infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have declined-thanks in large part to vaccination-and precautions have become ever more rare. Biden is vaccinated and has superb access to medical care. Chances are, he will be fine. Yet one basic fact remains unchanged: COVID is still capable of inflicting great damage, especially upon the elderly.\n\nIn June, according to provisional CDC data, about four out of every 100,000 Americans over the age of 75 (or 0.004 percent) died with COVID-19. That's a far cry from the staggering fatality rates of 2020 (roughly 0.17 percent for the same age group in April of that year), but still sizable in comparison with younger Americans' risk. The June 2024 COVID death rate among 30-to-39-year-olds, for example, is two out of every 10 million . Hospitalizations tell a similar story for the elderly: Last month, more than 60 out of every 100,000 Americans over 75 were hospitalized with COVID. And according to the CDC, this is likely an undercount.\n\nStill, the risks of COVID seem to increase over even just a few years of life for the elderly. People 75 or older are currently 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized and seven times as likely to die with COVID as people ages 65 to 74. And people in their 80s can accumulate health problems with startling speed. Heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, and stroke-all maladies more likely to affect older people-increase a person's chances of serious complications from COVID.\n\nBiden is as likely as any American of his age to come away from this infection with minimal long-term effects. So far, according to the White House's statement, his symptoms are mild, he has no fever, and his blood-oxygen level is normal. He was first vaccinated against COVID in 2020 and has received several shots since, most recently in September . Vaccines are proven to mitigate the most serious risks of the disease, especially among the elderly. And should things take a turn, Biden, as president, has care teams and resources at his instant disposal.\n\nThat said, as far as COVID is concerned, good for an 81-year-old is not reliably good. And COVID does not have to kill someone to have troubling, lasting effects. Even mild bouts of COVID can lead to symptoms that linger for weeks or years and range from inconvenient to debilitating. In a study published today, about 7.8 percent of patients infected since Omicron became the dominant variant in the United States developed long-term symptoms. Given current concerns about the president's health and brainpower, any further deterioration is a sobering prospect. A report published by the National Academies of Science last month found that older Americans are especially at risk of cognitive impairment following a COVID infection. What would that mean for a man who has already shown signs of substantial decline-a man subjected to the rigors of one of the most demanding jobs on the planet during the most crucial political campaign of our lifetimes, who refuses to lift the burden of American democracy from his aging shoulders?\n\nTen days ago-after Biden's feeble debate performance, but before a gunman attempted to assassinate his opponent at a rally-the president made a perplexing statement. Addressing the crowd at a Pennsylvania campaign event, he declared, \"I ended the pandemic.\" The reality is that COVID continues to upend lives every day. Americans should be mindful that it could still upend elections, too.\n\nLila Shroff contributed reporting."

      "text": "What Biden Didn't Realize About His Presidency\n\nIn his first interview after his inauguration, Biden explained what he got wrong about Trump-and what he still hoped to squeeze out of Republicans.\n\nJoe Biden had been president for less than two weeks when he told me something he'd heard from a friend after the election. Biden was like the dog that caught the car, the friend told him-after a lifetime of dreaming of becoming president, he'd finally done it. \"I said, 'No, I think I got the bus,'\" Biden told me, reflecting on the combined crises of the pandemic, the economic collapse, and the shaky future of American democracy. \"I'm the dog that caught the bus.\"\n\nThis isn't the presidency Biden had expected when he entered the race two years ago. He had expected that his task would be reorienting American politics away from Donald Trump's influence and rebuilding the middle class in the hopes of preventing Trumpism from taking hold again. He did not expect that he'd need to deal with so much despair-or have the opportunity to make so much systemic change.\n\nBiden was behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office when we spoke, in his first interview as president. So much had changed for him in his transformation from presidential sidekick to potential world-historical figure. Sitting behind that desk 12 years ago, Barack Obama had once referred to Biden, his vice president, as the \"employee of the month.\" Now Biden is the boss, and he seemed to project a new sense of confidence. He told me pointedly: \"I'm going to say something outrageous-well, not outrageous: I have the most progressive platform any Democrat who's ever been president has run on.\"\n\nAt the time we spoke, I was wrapping up my new book about the Trump-era Democratic Party and the 2020 presidential campaign, which I'd been working on for four years. As I moved us off small talk and into questions, I told Biden that my editor and I had just settled on the title Battle for the Soul . It was inspired by a line that Biden had delivered repeatedly on the campaign trail, introduced in an essay for The Atlantic he wrote after the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville: \"We are living through a battle for the soul of this nation.\"\n\nRead: The inside story of Joe Biden's most fateful decision\n\nBiden chuckled for a second, a short laugh of sarcastic disbelief. \"The difference between you and me, pal,\" he said, \"is I actually believe it.\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"I think you may have been onto something.\"\n\n\"Everybody in the press thought that the party had moved, that I was from another era, that it wasn't relevant. 'What the hell are you talking about, \"the soul of America\"? For Christ's sake, Joe, talk about global warming,' or whatever the hell they wanted me to talk about,\" Biden said. \"But back then, what I saw with Trump was he didn't understand anything about who we are as a people.\" Biden rattled off his objections to Trump: \"His transparent selfishness, his willingness to say anything, his overwhelming appeal to prejudice and division. He didn't have any social redeeming value, as far as I can see.\" Biden acknowledged that he had misjudged how many Americans would buy into Trump's politics, including his eventual claim that the 2020 election was stolen: \"I underestimated his ability to take the big lie and turn it into something that was salable.\"\n\nHad the Democratic Party been prepared for the 2020 campaign? I asked Biden. No, he replied. Democrats hadn't appreciated how much of a challenge Trump posed to the fiber of America itself: \"The people who built the country are the people who are all being left behind. When that happens, and you don't have a counter-voice to The reason you lost your job is because of an immigrant; the reason you lost that job is because those Black folks are taking your job -it opens up the door to the Charlottesvilles of the world.\" He echoed something that he'd said right after the attack on the Capitol, back when he was still president-elect: \"There's a direct line between Charlottesville and January 6.\"\n\nStill, at the time of our conversation, Biden hadn't written off the GOP. When we spoke, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming hadn't yet been kicked out of GOP congressional leadership for calling out the former president's lies about the election. Biden was early into his negotiations over the Democrats' first COVID-19 relief bill, and believed that he could still get a few Republicans in Congress to support him. (In the end, the American Rescue Plan passed without a single Republican vote in the House or the Senate.) Were there really deals to be made with the Republicans who had voted to overturn the election results on January 6- after law enforcement had chased the rioters out of the Capitol building?\n\n\"They're in a really tough spot,\" Biden said. \"You expect people to be willing to get into the second edition of Profiles in Courage , but it's awful hard ... I think there's enough people out there, but I don't know.\"\n\nThree months later, even Republicans who were critical of the role Trump played in the insurrection have reverted to embracing the former president. They look poised to reject their own negotiated deal for a bipartisan commission to investigate the attack, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that \"100 percent of our focus is on stopping this new administration.\" Although Biden critics have long said that he was naive to expect any bipartisan cooperation, the president did go into the White House prepared to face some GOP obstructionism-after all, he was vice president during the Obama years. But he's been disheartened to see many Republicans confirm his worst assumptions.\n\nPeter Wehner: Trump is marching down the road to political violence\n\nWe covered much more in the interview: what living in the White House is like, the book he told me he wants to write after his presidency is over, and the deep and complicated ways he feels connected to his late son, Beau, who he had once hoped would become president.\n\nTalking to Biden that day, I remembered something that a panicked donor had told me in October 2019. At the time, Biden's primary campaign was falling apart: He was bumbling through events, funding was drying up, and supporters were desperately trying to convince people not to write him off. \"This isn't Obama,\" the donor told me. \"No one's saying this is going to be a transformational president.\" What the donor meant was that Democrats could count on Biden to beat Trump-and that that was good enough. I didn't relay the donor's comments to Biden, but I didn't need to. He knows that's how people felt. And he knows that many people might see his win primarily as a reaction to Trump. But as I write in the book, he still has ambitious goals for his presidency, inspired by one of his predecessors-during our interview, he pointed out that a portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal, was hanging in the most prominent spot in the Oval Office, over the fireplace. How close he'll get to achieving those aims is a subject for another book."

      "text": "A Disaster for Joe Biden\n\nWatching the president at the first debate was at times almost physically uncomfortable.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nWhat a disaster for Joe Biden.\n\nIn tonight's first debate of the presidential campaign, the president appeared meandering, confused, and extremely frail. Biden's performance was at times almost physically uncomfortable to watch and will greatly amplify the calls for him to step aside .\n\nThe question for many people before the debate was whether Biden would stumble. They didn't have to wait long for an answer. He looked and sounded shaky from the moment he stepped somewhat creakily onstage in Atlanta. His voice came out in a faint whisper. And a few minutes in, Biden completely lost the thread while assailing Trump's fiscal policy. He began by attacking Trump for giving tax cuts to billionaires and building up more debt than any president in any four-year period. Then he started to get bogged down:\n\nWe have a thousand trillionaires in America. I mean billionaires in America. And what's happening? They're in a situation where they in fact pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they paid 24 percent, 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they'd raise $500 million-billion dollars, I should say-in a 10-year period. We'd be able to wipe out his debt, we'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do-child care, elder care, making sure we continue to strengthen our health-care system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the COVID-excuse me, dealing with-look, if we finally beat Medicare ...\n\nAs Biden struggled to grasp his own point, his time ran out. \"Thank you, Mr. President,\" the moderator, Jake Tapper, said. It felt like a mercy.\n\nBiden also struggled on abortion, one of Democrats' strongest lines of attack on Trump . But Biden seemed unable to compose his answer, including a bizarre aside about Laken Riley , a woman allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant in what has become a MAGA cause célèbre.\n\n\"There's many young women who've been-including the young woman who was just murdered and he went to the funeral-the idea that she was murdered by an immigrant coming in, they talk about that but here's the deal, there's a lot of young women being raped by their in-laws, by their spouses, brothers and sisters, it's just ridiculous and they can do nothing about, they try to arrest them when they cross state lines,\" Biden said. With some difficulty, one could discern the outlines of an answer there-Biden was talking about women seeking abortions after rape and incest in states that ban the procedure-but it was extremely hard to follow.\n\nBiden didn't have another moment quite that bad, but he was never good. The president struggled to finish a thought or complete a sentence. As Trump spoke, a split screen showed the president's face looking slack and agape. Biden's attempts at emoting incredulity instead read as confusion. He struggled to finish his answers in the allotted time.\n\nRead: What kind of 'psycho' calls dead Americans 'losers' and 'suckers'?\n\nHis set pieces fell flat, including an emotive one about his late son, Beau. Citing Trump's remarks about veterans, Biden said: \"My son was not a sucker , he was not a loser. You're the sucker. You're the loser.\" It would have been a great line if it had been delivered with any force. Instead, it sounded like reading off a card.\n\nMentioning Trump's alleged sexual relationship with Stormy Daniels, Biden accused Trump of having \"the morals of an alley cat,\" which would surely have brought the house down at a debate between Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson but did nothing to erase impressions that he's too old in 2024. (In the midst of the debate, Biden staffers began telling reporters that the president is suffering from a cold.)\n\nBiden also seemed very much to be hemmed in by the format of the debate, while Trump used questions on any subject to turn to his favorite talking points. One result was that Biden's favored campaign theme, Trump's threat to democracy, didn't come up until about 40 minutes into the debate, when Tapper asked Trump about the January 6 insurrection.\n\n\"Let me tell you about January 6,\" Trump replied. \"On January 6 we had a great border. Nobody came through, very few. On January 6 we were energy-independent. We had the lowest taxes ever. Lowest regulations ever. On January 6 we were respected all over the world.\"\n\nTapper tried to redirect Trump to the insurrection, and Trump responded by lying about trying to call in the National Guard. This was classic Trump-bluster and misdirection. But anyone looking for reassurance that Trump would respect the rule of law didn't receive it. The only implication was that a vote for him is a vote for the good life, not for democracy. Trump also continued to push his lie about fraud tainting the 2020 election.\n\nBiden was also itching to call Trump a \"convicted felon,\" but didn't get there until five minutes later. Trump steamrolled him and said, nonsensically, \"This man is a criminal.\"\n\nRead: Ruth Bader Biden\n\nThat projection was also classic Trump. He made little sense either, though he made little sense with bravado and seemed positively youthful and energetic next to Biden. He mostly managed to avoid coming off as the overbearing bully he often is on a debate stage, though not entirely. At one point, he used Palestinian as an apparent slur, saying of Biden, \"He's become like a Palestinian, but they don't like him, because he's a very bad Palestinian, he's a weak one.\"\n\nIf the purpose of debates such as this one is to show voters something new about the candidates, then it didn't work. And how could it? Both men are very well known, and very little liked, by the entire American public. Nor was there much to learn about policy: Trump doesn't care about it, and Biden kept getting mixed up in details about it.\n\nWhen the debates were announced in May, some pundits viewed it as a win for Biden, who was trailing Trump narrowly but consistently. His campaign wanted to put Trump in front of Americans early in the campaign, and remind them of the chaos and division that he produced. It was a bold gamble by the president, and he lost."

      "text": "Republicans Get Disgraced Doctor to Probe Biden's Mental State\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nTexas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson said a House panel will probe whether former White House doctor Kevin O'Connor concealed former President Joe Biden's mental decline.\n\nJackson, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee's subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, told the New York Post in a story published Friday that the GOP \"will look into whether or not we actually had a shadow presidency for a large part of [Biden's] term\" and that O'Connor \"will absolutely, positively be implicated in the cover-up of this. He is a massive, massive part.\"\n\n\"He was probably putting President Biden on lots of medications that we have no clue of-in efforts to try to treat his cognitive decline,\" he alleged. The subcommittee has yet to formally announce any investigation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJackson is a physician who served in the White House Medical Unit under former Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump before he was elected to Congress in 2020. In 2021, a report by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General stated that Jackson had \"engaged in inappropriate conduct involving the use of alcohol\" on two presidential trips, and \"made sexual and denigrating statements about one of his female medical subordinates to another of his subordinates.\"\n\nJackson alleged O'Connor, whom he said he's known for a long time, \"would do or say anything to cover up and protect [the Biden family], regardless of what it meant professionally.\"\n\nBiden, the oldest president in U.S. history when he left office at 82, faced growing questions about his fitness for office as his term wore on. O'Connor wrote in a February 2024 memo that the president \"continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.\"\n\nBy avoiding sit-down interviews and large press conferences , the president's apparent mental decline only became apparent during his catastrophic performance in the televised debate with Trump last June. He relinquished the Democratic nomination to former Vice President Kamala Harris on July 21.\n\nThe move spurred Republicans to question whether his team had concealed signs of his supposed mental decline and were doing the president's job for him.\n\nIn July, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for White House aides, including O'Connor, to discuss Biden's cognitive state, but it is not clear whether he responded to the voluntary request.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nGot a tip?

Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKlain told Whipple that the octogenarian president \"didn't know what Trump had been saying and couldn't grasp what the back and forth was,\" going on to say Biden \"didn't really understand what his argument was on inflation,\" and \"had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job.\"\n\nAccording to Klain, Biden was \"out of touch\" with American politics, obsessing instead about foreign leaders and being head of NATO, saying, \"these guys say I'm doing a great job as president so I must be a great president.\"\n\nBiden, who was 81 at the time, apparently deluded himself into believing that looking confused-which drew heavy ridicule online -would be an effective strategy, according to Whipple: \"If he looked perplexed when Trump talked, voters would understand that Trump was an idiot. Klain replied: 'Sir, when you look perplexed, people just think you're perplexed. And this is our problem in this race.'\"\n\nThe book states that he struggled to get through debate practice, calling it quits just 25 minutes into the second mock debate. \"I'm just too tired to continue and I'm afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,\" he reportedly said before heading off to bed.\n\nWhipple said that as the debate drew closer, Klain feared it would be a \"nationally televised disaster.\"\n\nOn June 27, those fears were realized when Biden delivered a catastrophic debate performance that exposed his devastating mental and physical state to the country.\n\nIn the weeks following the debate-which also saw an assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania-pressure mounted from some of the Democratic Party's biggest names for Biden to step aside. Initially defiant, he relinquished the Democratic nomination to Kamala Harris on July 21.\n\nAt the time, Klain told The Daily Beast he regretted the president's decision because he believed \"he was our best candidate in 2024.\"\n\nKlain's new comments to Whipple suggest, however, that the longtime political adviser and other members of Biden's team were increasingly aware of the president's mental and physical deterioration, even as they continued to project outward appearances of confidence in his abilities.\n\nA Biden ally pointed the Daily Beast to past statements that don't add up with Klain's assertions in the book, including comments he made after the debate in which he brushed off Biden's performance as a \" bad debate night ,\" and claimed that the president had \" done well \" in the practices.\n\nDonors may be trying to 💰💰members to oppose @JoeBiden , but grass roots funding is strong and he is the right candidate to beat Trump https://t.co/OVlTFyDjdF\n\nWhipple's book, Uncharted : How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History , will be published next week.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nGot a tip?

And that's what [the] ADP [jobs report] also backed up,\" Payne said. \"Also, work hours are getting longer and wage growth is getting slower. That's where the labor crisis is going to show up.

Employment in the federal government declined, obviously, given the so-called Department of Government Efficiency 's sweeping cuts.\n\nAfter Bartiromo said how several potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would bring a recession, Payne claimed \"most people are already in a recession\" considering \"just 10 percent of the population buy[s] 50 percent of the goods and all of the so-called excess cash is long-gone from the bottom 75 percent of this country.\"\n\nPayne added, \"When I went to the polls in November, they were in a recession.\"\n\nPayne contended that the metrics used to measure the economy's condition need to be re-examined because they're \"so way off.\"\n\nBartiromo responded: \"We'll see if Joe Biden's recession shows up.\"\n\nAfter a commercial break, Bartiromo agreed with former 2016 Trump campaign adviser Stephen Moore, who insisted that Donald Trump \"inherited a god-awful mess from Biden.\"\n\n\"That's why I said earlier it would be Biden's recession,\" she said.\n\nThe Trump-friendly host then forecasted a negative response to her latest comment, alluding to the reaction she garnered earlier this week when she didn't appear all that concerned with Trump's tariffs harming automobile sellers.\n\n\"I know the haters out there will slam me later.

Right to the end of the campaign, he insisted he would have beaten Donald Trump.\n\nLess than six weeks before election day, he said his polling figures had been promising and he went on The View to insist : \"I was confident I would beat Trump. He's a loser.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile no one will ever know how the president's re-election campaign would have fared, Harris only managed about 67 million votes, with some counts continuing, compared to the 81 million votes Biden won in 2020, the most ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. White House election.\n\nMost distressing for Biden's supporters was Harris' performance in Pennsylvania, the \"Blue Wall\" states, and in reliably blue-collar strongholds like New Jersey and New York which she won with much-reduced majorities.\n\nThe president's circle was enraged that the finger-pointing had already begun in the Harris campaign within hours of Trump's resounding victory, with most of the barbs aimed directly at the Oval Office.\n\nAccording to Politico 's 'Playbook' , Biden loyalists were especially bitter over unnamed quotes in a Politico article claiming the president was the \"singular reason\" for the damning defeat and saying a Democratic primary race would have given Harris more time and opportunity to run a better campaign.\n\nThe Biden aides blamed Barack Obama 's advisers for the Harris missteps that ultimately cost her any hopes of the White House.\n\n\"There is no singular reason why we lost, but a big reason is because the Obama advisers publicly encouraged Democratic infighting to push Joe Biden out, didn't even want Kamala Harris as the nominee, and then signed up as the saviors of the campaign only to run outdated Obama-era playbooks for a candidate that wasn't Obama,\" a former Biden staffer told Playbook.\n\nThe aide added they'd like a shot of \"whatever they're drinking if 100 extra days of campaigning for Harris instead of Biden would have changed the results of last night!\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was at the forefront of efforts to depose Biden in July, and she admitted mid-October that she had not spoken to the president since her intervention pressured him to quit in July.\n\nShe told the Guardian that some of Biden's camp had not forgiven her for damaging his legacy through her actions.\n\nThe loss of Pennsylvania was particularly vexing for the president, who won the state in 2020.\n\n\"The deposing of Biden will remain a great source of controversy within the Democratic party. It's clear that Biden, even with his cognitive disabilities, would have performed better than Harris in states like Pennsylvania,\" political scientist Steven Schier told Newsweek.\n\nDetermined not to be a lame duck president for the remainder of his term, Biden is seeking to be a uniting force in the party, say Democratic Party sources. While he is determined to offer a gracious transition to the incoming administration, he is being urged by supporters to make his final months count as the party rebuilds.\n\nOlympic gymnast Simone Biles was among those urging positive action, posting on X: \"Mr Biden, I need you to stand up, straighten your back and make some things shake before your departure xoxo the women in America.\"\n\nMr Biden, I need you to stand up, straighten your back and make some things shake before your departure xoxo the women in america 💙\n\nBut Republicans were quick to jump on the Democratic Party's internal retribution as they reveled in Trump's victory.\n\nDonald Trump Jr posted on X after his father's emphatic win: \"The only person happier than me this morning. has to be Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe only person happier than me this morning. has to be Joe Biden.\n\nAides insist that the president is far from happy, but he is determined to protect his legacy of 52 years of service for the Democratic Party and the country.\n\nReporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Biden's Offer to Raise Money for Dems Falls Flat\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nDemocrats are rejecting Joe Biden . Again.\n\nThe former president tried to make a comeback earlier this week, promising to raise funds and campaign for Democrats amidst some rock bottom polls. As MAGA takes the main stage and President Donald Trump eliminates programs that Biden helped create, the former president is telling fellow politicians to put him back in the game.\n\nHe met privately last month with new Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin, reported NBC , and promised to boost the Democrats' credibility and funds, but it seemed like his offer fell flat. Party activists, donors, and other lawmakers all argue that Biden is too closely linked to the 2024 defeat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPlus, at 82, he isn't exactly a lively vision for the future, they say.\n\nAfter the last election, a number of high-profile Democrats even expressed anger at the former president for putting Kamala Harris in a position to fail. They say he should have dropped out sooner and question his intellectual sharpness. Even though Biden passed the torch to Harris last summer, voters argued it was too little, too late.\n\nTrump won in a landslide, with a majority of the electorate voting Republican for the first time in decades.\n\nIn a new NBC News poll, only 27 percent of registered voters said they had positive views of the Democratic Party, the lowest figure in polling since 1990.\n\nAs Democrats search for reasons why their policies aren't resonating, they are also desperate for broader investments and a clearer path ahead. Regardless, they say Biden's not the answer.\n\nFormer first lady Jill Biden also offered to step-up, saying that she would raise money for fellow Democrats and help in any way she can, reported NBC.\n\nSome Democrats still rally behind Biden. DNC Vice Chair Jane Kleeb told NBC that if you were to call any state party chair and ask them if they wanted Biden to be a speaker for their dinner, \"the answer would be yes. He is beloved by the party and beloved by the voters.\"\n\nBut others say that the party is desperate for younger, fresher faces. A March 16 CNN poll showed that only 1 percent of those surveyed felt like Biden reflected the party's core values, compared to more progressive leaders-10 percent backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 9 percent preferred Kamala Harris, and 8 percent favored Bernie Sanders. But the numbers still show a significant decline compared to when the poll was conducted in 2017 and 18 percent of participants stood in support of Barack Obama.\n\nThe poll also revealed that only slightly more than a quarter of surveyed U.S. citizens had a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, compared with 33 percent in January, 39 percent last October and 49 percent in January 2021, when Biden first took office. Both the rapid decline and the lack of support for key leaders is testament to an appetite for party-wide transformation.\n\nBut while Democrats are eager to forget Biden, Trump is keeping him relevant by constantly referencing him and implementing policies to counter his. Trump announced this week that he was ending Secret Service protection for Biden's two children, with no warning. Biden did the opposite when Trump took office, ensuring that Trump's children had extended protection for six months.\n\nTrump also referenced his predecessor more than 400 times since the inauguration. He's often become a foil for the president or someone for the Republican Party to point fingers at when their plans go awry.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, had an explanation for why the party's casting so much blame: \"We are still very much fixing so many of the problems created or started by the Biden administration.\"\n\nBut Biden left office two months ago, and key issues persist-or, in the case of the economy-even worsen.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nkenneal.patterson@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "It's Time for the Real Joe Biden to Stand Up-And Show Some Spine\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nJoe Biden wants you to know that his comments last Thursday about conditioning the bipartisan infrastructure plan and linking it with a more expensive Democratic-led reconciliation bill did not blow up the deal. In fact, he has been able to \"clarify\" his position. But has he?\n\nAs ABC News' Rick Klein notes, his clean-up-on-aisle-nine statement on Saturday \" did not really solve the apparent disconnect .\" Next, Team Biden sent advisor Cedric Richmond to the Sunday shows, and even he couldn't give a straight answer . On Monday, Press Secretary Jen Psaki likewise demurred. You can't blame them. As the president, Biden is responsible for casting a clear vision. He has the additional burden of representing a voice of clarity in a world of chaos. For the first time in a long time, Joe Biden isn't up to the job.\n\nIt's possible that this is just a momentary blip, and the deal will ultimately come together. But last week's flub suggests deeper, more fundamental problems, even as it exacerbates the issue at hand. Biden stumbled while walking a high-wire, and that stumble left him vulnerable. There are plenty of Republicans who would prefer not to give Biden a \"win.\" Truth be told, if I were a Republican politician, I wouldn't like the idea that compromises and concessions I negotiated in good faith would be immediately rendered moot by a party-line vote. Yoking the two bills together also creates the impression that Republicans have abetted the whole thing, but that's only part of the problem. Cleaning up the mess with Republicans now requires taking something away from progressives. And Bernie Sanders is now saying, \" No reconciliation deal, no bill .\" Blood is in the water, and sharks on both sides of the aisle are circling.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt's worth asking: Why did this debacle happen in the first place? Why can't Biden announce what should be a huge \"win\" for his administration without becoming embroiled in controversy? This is more than just a failure to communicate eloquently. It's a symptom of a deeper problem. Biden still needs to decide who he wants to be . Only then will he be able to communicate a clear and coherent vision.\n\nLet me state the obvious: Biden is caught between progressives (like Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) who want to spend many trillions and moderates (like Joe Manchin and Krysten Sinema) who don't. They have staked out mutually exclusive positions. Yet, instead of assuming a leadership role, Biden remains mired in passivity. \"We will let the American people-and the Congress-decide,\" he said in his statement. He's acting like a parent who refuses to intervene and hopes the kids will work it out on their own. Take it from me, that almost never works out.\n\nInstead, Biden must decide who he wants to be and choose which faction he's going to lean on. If Biden wants to be the progressive champion, then he risks losing Manchin. If he wants to be the centrist that (I think) he ran as, then it's time to stand up to AOC. Either way, the time to hesitate has passed. Now, he can communicate this diplomatically. Can Manchin be wooed, persuaded, and cajoled? Does AOC really want to take the blame for humiliating Biden and destroying his presidency? If Biden forces this to come to a head, he may then be able to work out some mutually tolerable understanding.\n\nBiden's worst option is to do nothing and watch time slip away. He may think that if he ignores this problem that it will go away and that things will just resolve on their own. And I can understand why he might think that way. When every other Democrat was falling for \"woke\" Twitter and touting slogans like \"Medicare for All\" and \"Defund the Police,\" Biden resisted the temptation. However, he never really confronted the left. He never really resolved this power struggle by standing up to them and having a \" Sister Souljah\" moment . Instead, he ran out the clock, skating by on strategic ambiguity. It's one thing to muddle your way through a presidential election-it's another thing entirely to try and extend that strategy for your entire presidency.\n\nAs a conservative, I'm admittedly biased about what direction I think he should go. It's clear that Biden does not have the votes to become FDR or LBJ , and he ran as a centrist who wanted to restore bipartisan cooperation and normalcy. Biden's authentic brand, if you'll forgive the term, seems to be consistent with the policies I think he should pursue: bipartisan healing and compromise.\n\nWhat Biden decides to do is less important than his decision to actually do it. It's time for him to pick a lane. Will the real Joe Biden please stand up?\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Nothing. I mean it, not nothing.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Folks, we made a lot of progress and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress and she's going to build on it, I'll be on the sidelines but I can do everything I can to help.\n\n\"He'd [Trump] rather cross [a picket line] than walk one. I have no problem walking the picket line,\" said Biden, who last year became the first president to join striking workers on a picket line. \"Neither does Kamala.\"\n\n\"It's all at risk because of Donald Trump, with the stroke of a pen he can get rid a lot of this, and do you think this guy gives a damn about your pensions?\n\nBiden: Remember Trump for four years promised every month, infrastructure week.

While Harris held events in Detroit and Pittsburgh, Trump, meanwhile, was off the campaign trail on Monday, choosing Truth Social to wish supporters a happy Labor Day while taking jabs at his opponent.\n\n\"Happy Labor Day to all of our American Workers who represent the Shining Example of Hard Work and Ingenuity. Under Comrade Kamala Harris, all Americans are suffering during this Holiday weekend - High Gas Prices, Transportation Costs are up, and Grocery Prices are through the roof. We can't keep living under this weak and failed 'Leadership,'\" he wrote.\n\nBiden's appearance came just hours after he told reporters at the White House that he did not think Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was doing enough to secure a hostage deal.\n\nClosing his speech, he drew on the special bond he shares with his vice president, calling Harris next to him and holding her hand.\n\n\"Let me tell you about this woman. I know her. I trust her. Not a joke. The first decision I made as nominee in 2020 was selecting her as my vice president,\" he said. \"And by the way, it was the single best decision I made as president of the United States of America.\"\n\n\"I know she'll be a good president...she has a backbone like a ramrod. She has the moral compass of a saint, this woman knows what she's doing.\"\n\nBiden concluded by promising Harris could \"make \"Donald Trump a loser again.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden (C-L) embraces US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris during a campaign rally at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 5 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 2, 2024.\n\nThe pair embraced and smiled at each other before Harris paused to lead a chant of, \"Thank you Joe.\" She went on to promise to continue Biden's commitment to the most \"pro-union administration in US history.\"\n\n\"You really get to know somebody when you're in the middle of a fight, when times are hard, when the forces are mighty, when people don't believe something can't get done... and I have spent more time with this extraordinary human being when the cameras were not in the room, when the stales were high... and Joe Biden has always stood with the workers of America... always,\" she added.\n\nNight Editor\n\nmatt.young@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Joe Biden Drops a 2016 Hint by Headlining Harkin Steak Fry in Iowa\n\nIn Washington, the idea of Joe Biden serving as the next president of the United States may be a punchline , but in Iowa, many think it sounds pretty good.\n\nOver the past two and a half decades, Biden has developed a credible political infrastructure in the state, and key Iowa Democratic activists aren't just political allies but friends. The vice president's trip to the Hawkeye State to headline the Harkin Steak Fry, Iowa's premier Democratic fundraiser, on September 15, appears to be a step toward a possible 2016 candidacy.\n\nSupporters made clear, though, that the vice president's trip should not be interpreted as an announcement. Dave O'Brien, a Biden supporter from Cedar Rapids and a Democratic candidate for Congress in Iowa's First District, would say only, \"I don't think anyone is closing off any avenues.\" Said Teri Goodmann, another longtime Biden ally from Dubuque: \"Having visited with the vice president, so much of the future depends on how the rest of President Obama and Vice President Biden's administration turns out.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf Biden does decide to run, he'll find the Hawkeye State to be favorable terrain. Iowa rewards retail politics, and while Biden may be somewhat gaffe prone , he's far more comfortable in one-on-one interactions with caucusgoers than Hillary Clinton is. It also helps that many of the Democratic faithful are big fans of the vice president. \"Activists in the state love Biden,\" said a prominent Iowa operative.\n\nDespite finishing fifth in Iowa in 2008, Biden did surprisingly well in the caucuses. As one high-ranking operative on his campaign that year noted, Biden's camp had projected that he would do well, before he was swamped by the record turnout. In the end, Biden had more caucusgoers identified as supporters before caucus night than John Kerry had four years before, when he won the caucuses. But Biden's campaign, like Hillary Clinton's, didn't anticipate the number of new voters the Obama campaign turned out.\n\nThe other crucial advantage Biden would have if he ran again is his celebrity. In 2008, Biden was running as a senator from Delaware. In 2016, he'll be an incumbent vice president who regularly makes national news. He won't need to introduce himself to caucusgoers. He'll just need to win them over.\n\nThe first step toward doing so will be appealing to the crowd of activists at the Harkin Steak Fry. The event has long been used as a springboard for aspiring presidential candidates, including a freshman senator from Illinois named Barack Obama, who was the featured speaker in 2006. Of course, when asked to comment on why the vice president was attending, a spokesman said the trip was \"a long-standing commitment after the vice president was unable to attend last year.\" His supporter Goodmann echoed the spokesman, noting that while \"clearly anyone [who] might be looking at a presidential bid would be happy to visit key states ... I don't believe that's why\" Biden is visiting Iowa. Instead, the trip is just about fulfilling a commitment to his longtime Senate colleague Tom Harkin that the vice president made last year, she said.\n\nGoodmann also noted that traditional protocol would dictate that potential Democratic presidential hopefuls stay out of Iowa until after next year's Democratic gubernatorial primary, lest they be accused of taking sides. Then again, as Goodmann pointed out, \"If protocol meant something, the vice president would have first dibs on the White House.\"\n\nGot a tip?

A White House official clarified Biden's statements represented his opinion that the ERA was ratified, though never codified in the Constitution, but that he was not issuing any sort of accompanying executive action. Advocates say Biden could have taken a further step and ordered the National Archives to publish the amendment and enter it officially in the Constitution, a move which would have triggered a legal battle with Republicans."

He most likely would have spent less than five years behind bars. Joe Biden correctly labeled the prosecutions as partisan and politically motivated. \"Hunter was singled out only because he is my son,\" Biden said. With the simple stroke of a pen, President Biden saved his son from a terrible ordeal. Before he leaves office, he should extend the same compassion to thousands of people in federal prison, victims of the so-called war on drugs.\n\n\"This is definitely an opening for folks to talk about exactly how expansive we can use the pardon power of the president to make sure that we're correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years when it comes to cannabis crimes,\" Jason Ortiz, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project, said on the Democracy Now! news hour. \"President Biden himself was actually one of the architects of the 1994 crime bill that created a lot of the outrageous sentences that we're now dealing with today.\"\n\nOrtiz was referring to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which Biden championed as a senator, and which accelerated mass incarceration. Udi Ofer, former Director of the ACLU's Justice Division, wrote in 2019, on the crime bill's 25th anniversary, \"Under the leadership of Bill Clinton, Democrats wanted to wrest control of crime issues from Republicans, so the two parties began a bidding war to increase penalties for crime, trying to outdo one another.\"\n\nDemocrats have largely accepted the failure of the 1994 crime bill. In 2015, former President Bill Clinton admitted, \"The problem is, the way it was written and implemented, we cast too wide a net. We have too many people in prison.\" While campaigning for president in 2019 and 2020, though, Joe Biden repeatedly denied that the law he helped write contributed to mass incarceration.\n\nJason Ortiz continued, \"There are over 3,000 federal cannabis prisoners currently incarcerated [who] also have families and have parents and loved ones...So, while I can understand why the president wants to have compassion for his own son, we're really frustrated that he's refusing to extend that compassion to all the parents currently watching their kids waste away in prison.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2022, President Biden issued a blanket pardon for those convicted federally for simple marijuana possession. The Justice Department explained then, however, that \"conspiracy, distribution, and possession with intent to distribute are not pardoned by the proclamation.\"\n\nThe goal of The Last Prisoner Project is to expand the relief from the drug war's draconian sentences to those convicted of distribution and other charges.\n\n\"Right now, we have folks serving decades for trafficking,\" Ortiz said, \"exactly what the hundreds of legal cannabis businesses across the country are currently doing on a regular basis, including in Washington, D.C. We're seeing people sitting in prison for decades for the same activity that is currently generating tax revenue for cities and states across the country. We're paying for schools and building bridges with cannabis dollars, but still letting folks waste away in prison.\"\n\nThe Last Prisoner Project is not alone in calling for clemency. Last month, as President Biden prepared to pardon turkeys as part of an annual Thanksgiving photo op, more than fifty members of Congress sent a letter urging Biden to use the pardon power to address the ongoing crisis of mass incarceration.\n\n\"The United States represents just 5% of the world's population, yet we hold more than 20% of the global prison population,\" progressive Minnesota Congressmember Ilhan Omar said at a news conference announcing the letter. \"Over 1.9 million individuals are currently incarcerated with a disproportionate impact on communities of color. Black men are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of white men, a legacy of systematic inequalities that have persisted for generations...President, Biden has a real opportunity to make a difference in these final days of his term, we are calling on him to act.\"\n\nHunter Biden will very likely never see the inside of a prison cell, nor experience the discrimination and indignities imposed on former felons. President Biden has the power to pardon thousands of people imprisoned for federal cannabis crimes, or commute their sentences to time served and allow them to return home. The power is in his hands, but he still needs to be pushed by the millions of citizens in whose name he wields it.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

But Indigenous political prisoner Leonard Peltier remains behind bars. Over 120 tribal leaders are calling on Biden to grant clemency to Peltier as one of his final acts in office, warning this may be the last opportunity Peltier has for freedom. Peltier is 80 years old and has spent the majority of his life - nearly half a century - in prison despite a conviction riddled with irregularities and prosecutorial misconduct. In December, tribal leaders, including the NDN Collective's Nick Tilsen, met with a pardon attorney at the Department of Justice to prepare a recommendation on Peltier's case for Biden. With only a few days left in Biden's term, Native Americans are eagerly anticipating his decision. \"All of us see a little bit of ourselves in Leonard Peltier, and that's why we fight so hard for him,\" says Tilsen. \"This is about paving a path forward that gives us the opportunity to have justice and begin to heal the relationship between the United States government and Indian people. And so, this decision is massive.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nThere are just days left in President Biden's term. He has made history today, granting thousands of commutations, clemency overall, pardons in his last weeks. The question is: Will he grant clemency to Leonard Peltier? Over 120 tribal leaders are calling on Biden to grant the Indigenous leader Leonard Peltier clemency as one of his final acts in office. In a letter to Biden, the tribal leaders write, quote, \"Our standing in the world as a champion of freedom, justice, and human rights cannot be maintained in a system that allows Leonard Peltier to die in prison.\"\n\nLeonard Peltier recently turned 80 years old. He spent the majority of his life, nearly half a century, in prison. For decades, he and his supporters have maintained Peltier's innocence over the 1975 killing of two FBI agents in a shootout on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and say his conviction was riddled with irregularities and prosecutorial misconduct. The federal government has been repeatedly accused of failing to prove its case against Peltier.\n\nThe former U.S. Attorney James Reynolds, who was a federal prosecutor for the District of South Dakota and was involved in Peltier's prosecution, wrote to Biden in 2021 advocating for Peltier's release. This is Reynolds reading a portion of that letter in a recent video produced by Preston Randolph.\n\nJAMES REYNOLDS : President Joe Biden, I write today from a position rare for a former prosecutor, to beseech you to commute the sentence of a man who I helped to put behind bars. Leonard Peltier's conviction and continued incarceration is a testament in a time and system of justice that no longer has a place in our society. We were not able to prove that Mr. Peltier personally committed any offense on the reservation. As a result to Mr. Peltier's conviction, now arrest, is that he was guilty of a murder simply because he was present on the reservation that day. He has served time for more than 46 years on the hands of minimal evidence, a result I strongly doubt would be upheld in any court today. I believe that a grant of executive clemency would serve the best interest of justice and the best interest of our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we go to Rapid City, South Dakota, where we're joined by Nick Tilsen, founder and CEO of NDN Collective. Tilsen is among the more than 120 tribal leaders who issued a letter to Biden earlier this month as they continue to plead for Peltier's freedom, who's imprisoned in Florida right now.\n\nNick Tilsen, we only have a few minutes. Have you met with the pardon board?\n\nNICK TILSEN : We actually met with the pardon attorney, Liz Oyer. We met with the pardon attorney at the Department of Justice headquarters in December with tribal leaders from around the country and talked specifically about Leonard Peltier and what this would mean for Indian Country. And she was the one who was actually drafting the recommendation, because there will be a recommendation that goes from the Department of Justice to the president's desk. And now that recommendation has been made and is sitting on the desk of the president right now. And he will make a decision in - you know, today or tomorrow, in the coming days, whether he's going to grant clemency to Leonard Peltier. And we don't know - we don't know exactly what the recommendation is, but when we left that meeting, all of the tribal leaders, we felt like - we felt like she was going to bring justice to Leonard Peltier, and we felt like it was going to be a recommendation for his release. And then the decision lies on - the decision lies on the president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, what did the pardon attorney tell you?\n\nNICK TILSEN : The pardon attorney told us that they knew the case inside and out, that they - that one of the primary focuses of this particular meeting that we were sitting in is that the section of the recommendation that she wanted to work on was what this would mean for Indian Country, what this would mean for Indian Country if Leonard Peltier was released. And we talked in depth, that the president of United States issued an apology for the boarding schools, and that it so happens to be that America's longest-incarcerated Indigenous political prisoner in history is, in fact, a boarding school survivor, and that we need to see action from the president, and that this is also an issue that will help illuminate many of the other good things that the Biden administration has done for Indian people. And so, they confirmed - she confirmed that, in fact, there was for sure going to be a written recommendation, and it was going to for sure go on to the president of the United States, and he was going to make a decision before he leaves office.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What is Leonard Peltier's condition in the Florida prison?\n\nNICK TILSEN : Leonard is 80% blind in one eye. He has type 2 diabetes. He's in a walker. He has an aortic aneurysm. His health is deteriorating. And that facility, quite frankly, doesn't even have the capability to meet his medical needs. And so, it's absolutely a dire situation. And we need to get Leonard out of that prison, back home and able to see a doctor almost immediately upon his release.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you tell me if the first-ever U.S. cabinet - Native American cabinet member, Deb Haaland, the former congressmember from New Mexico, has weighed in?\n\nNICK TILSEN : She has weighed in directly to the president. On Air Force One from Washington, D.C., to Arizona, when the announcement was going to be made for the apology for the boarding schools, she weighed in then. She's weighed in several times. And at this point in time, the president of the United States needs to listen to this matriarch and needs to listen to Secretary Deb Haaland, and because this is a priority for Indian Country. And this is a perfect opportunity for the president of the United States to listen to the honorable Secretary Haaland. And she has weighed in. She has not weighed in publicly, but she has weighed in directly to the president as the secretary of the Department of Interior.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to play a clip from - oh, it was over 10 years ago, when I talked to Leonard Peltier in prison on the phone at the time. It was President Obama who was in office.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Leonard, this is Amy Goodman from Democracy Now! I was -\n\nLEONARD PELTIER : Oh, hi, Amy. How are you?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Hi. I'm good. I was wondering if you have a message for President Obama?\n\nLEONARD PELTIER : I just hope he can, you know, stop the wars that are going on in this world, and stop getting - killing all those people getting killed, and, you know, give the Black Hills back to my people, and turn me loose.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It was very interesting, Nick Tilsen, as we break away from that interview - people can hear the whole interview at democracynow.org - that when I asked him to comment, he didn't comment first on his own case. He talked about stopping the wars. If you can, in this last 30 seconds that we have, talk about what it would mean for Native America, for Indian Country, for this country overall, for Leonard Peltier to be granted clemency?\n\nNICK TILSEN : You know, all throughout, the history of the treatment of Indian people by the United States government has been one of injustice. And the reality is, how Leonard Peltier was treated in his prosecution and incarceration is consistent with how this country has treated Indian people. And that's why all of us see a little bit of ourselves in Leonard Peltier, and that's why we fight so hard for him. So this is about Leonard's freedom, but this is about justice for Indian people everywhere. This is about human rights for people everywhere. This is about paving a path forward that gives us the opportunity to have justice and begin to heal the relationship between the United States government and Indian people. And so, this decision is massive. And I really hope that the president of United States weighs this decision. If he releases Leonard Peltier, he will be forever known the president who did that. And American -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Native American activist Nick Tilsen, we're going to leave it there, founder and CEO of NDN Collective. Thank you so much. That does it for our show.

The attack killed 15 people and wounded at least 35 others, carving a path of destruction down Bourbon Street before the assailant was killed in a firefight with police officers.\n\nPresident-elect Trump responded on social media, writing, \"When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true.\" However, President Biden revealed the suspect is a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Houston named Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who was born in Texas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden : \"He served in the United States Army on active duty for many years. He also served in the Army Reserve until a few years ago. The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack, he posted videos on social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS , expressing a desire to kill.\"\n\nThe annual college football game hosted at the nearby Superdome, the Sugar Bowl, was delayed until Thursday following the attack. The FBI said it found an explosive device in the Ford F-150 pickup truck used by the suspect. Shamsud-Din Jabbar had two prior criminal offenses: one in 2002 for theft and another in 2005 for driving with an invalid license. Jabbar obtained a real estate license in 2019; the following year, he posted a video to YouTube introducing himself as a professional real estate agent. Court documents show Jabbar struggled with his finances. In 2020, his second wife was granted a restraining order forbidding Jabbar from sending threatening messages or causing \"bodily injury\" to his spouse or their child."

The outgoing president had repeatedly pledged not to use his office to help his son. Journalist Mehdi Hasan, founder and editor-in-chief of Zeteo , says that while Biden's move makes him a liar and hypocrite, Republican outrage over the pardon is also \"ridiculous\" given how expansively Donald Trump is expected to use the same authority. Hasan also notes that there are 40 people on federal death row and thousands more serving prison time for cannabis offenses whom Biden could help. \"There's so much a president could do with the presidential pardon power for good,\" he says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden has issued a full and unconditional pardon for his son Hunter Biden Sunday evening, just days before Hunter was set to be sentenced for his federal gun conviction and a separate tax evasion case. In a statement, President Biden said, quote, \"The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son - and that is wrong.\" Biden went on to write, quote, \"I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,\" unquote.\n\nPresident Biden and his aides had repeatedly said Hunter Biden would not be pardoned. This is Biden in June being interviewed by ABC's David Muir.\n\nDAVID MUIR : As we sit here in Normandy, your son Hunter is on trial. And I know that you cannot speak about an ongoing federal prosecution. But let me ask you: Will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is?\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Yes.\n\nDAVID MUIR : And have you ruled out a pardon for your son?\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Yes.\n\nDAVID MUIR : You have.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has also repeatedly denied the president would pardon his son.\n\nMARK MEREDITH : From a presidential perspective, is there any possibility that the president would end up pardoning his son?\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN - PIERRE : No.\n\nMARK MEREDITH : Well, is there -\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN - PIERRE : I just said no.\n\nMARK MEREDITH : [inaudible]\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN - PIERRE : I just answered. Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\nPETER DOOCY : It's the first briefing since Hunter was indicted again in Los Angeles. Why doesn't President Biden just pardon him?\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN - PIERRE : The president - I've been very clear: The president is not going to pardon his son.\n\nZEKE MILLER : You've also said several times that the president would not pardon nor commute the sentences for his son Hunter. I just want to make sure that that is not going to change over the next six months. The president is saying -\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN - PIERRE : It's still -\n\nZEKE MILLER : - he would not -\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN - PIERRE : It's still - it's still a no. It's still a no.\n\nZEKE MILLER : It will always be a no?\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN - PIERRE : It's still a no. It will be a no. It - it is a no. And I don't have anything else to add. Will he pardon his son? No.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden's decision to pardon his son comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office after campaigning in part on prosecuting his political enemies, while also vowing to pardon Trump supporters who participated in the January 6th insurrection.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump picked Kash Patel to head the FBI . Patel has vowed to go after what he calls conspirators in the government and media. Trump also picked the real estate developer Charles Kushner to be U.S. ambassador to France. Kushner is Trump's in-law. He is the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. In 2020, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, who spent 14 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to 16 charges of tax evasion and witness tampering in the 2000s.\n\nWe begin today's show with Mehdi Hasan, the editor-in-chief of the new media website Zeteo .\n\nThanks for joining us again, Mehdi. First, your response to President Biden pardoning Hunter, a total, unconditional pardon going back to 2014?\n\nMEHDI HASAN : It is a sweeping pardon, as you just mentioned. And you played the clips. I think we can hold multiple thoughts in our head at one time on Hunter Biden. Number one, did Joe Biden lie when he said he wouldn't pardon Hunter Biden? Clearly, he did. Is he a hypocrite for saying no one is above the law and then bringing his son above the law? Yes. Should the presidency be used to protect family members? No. I think we can all agree on those points.\n\nHaving said that, the kind of outrage from Republicans and some in the media is a little bit kind of ridiculous. We all know that Hunter Biden was targeted. The president is right when he says that they went after his son because he was his son. Anyone called Hunter Smith wouldn't have been prosecuted in the same way for the tax evasion and the gun form, that many people get wrong or provide incorrect information on.\n\nAnd as for the Republicans kind of crying foul right now, you have Kash Patel - I know we're going to talk about Kash Patel - who is a Trump toady who's about to be appointed FBI director, if he can get through the Senate. He's on record saying he's going to go after the Bidens. The Republicans have made very clear they plan to carry on going after the Biden family. So, is it understandable that Joe Biden is trying to protect his son from future investigations? It is understandable. That doesn't make it right. But come on. As you mentioned, as well, a moment ago, Amy, Charles Kushner is about to become ambassador to France. He is the father-in-law of Ivanka Trump who Trump pardoned in December 2020. So, you know, let's just get rid of the presidential pardon power, which would require a constitutional amendment. I think that's the source of all the corruption.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, of course, as we talk about pardons, I mean, it would be very interesting to see President Biden, very significant, pardon, for example, Leonard Peltier -\n\nMEHDI HASAN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - or talk about pardons or commutations for people on federal death row. Biden himself -\n\nMEHDI HASAN : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - has said he's against the death penalty.\n\nMEHDI HASAN : You've got about 40 people, I believe, still on the federal death row. Yes, pardon them. Pardon them now, because we remember when Donald Trump was leaving office last time, he actually escalated executions at the federal level at a rate we hadn't seen before for several years. So, yes, pardon 40 people on death row. Pardon 3,000 people in prison, Amy, on federal marijuana offenses, outdated, ridiculous marijuana offenses. Pardon them, not just your own, you know, former addict son.\n\nThere's so much a president could do with the presidential pardon power for good. We saw Trump misuse it in all sorts of ways for people like Paul Manafort and Charles Kushner and Roger Stone. Now we're seeing Joe Biden misuse it for his own son. Even if it is understandable, it's still wrong. Why not use it for a good cause? But as I say, I would rather get rid of the pardon power, but, of course, we can't do that without a constitutional amendment.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Until that time, though, President Joe Biden remains in the Oval Office. Biden spoke to his cabinet and staff Thursday in a Rose Garden address: \"Now we have 74 days to finish the term, our term.  Let's make every day count. That's the responsibility we have to the American people.\" There is much Biden can and should do in this \"lame duck\" period, before disappearing over the horizon in one final trip aboard the presidential helicopter, Marine One (unless he takes the train to Delaware, as he proudly did throughout his Senate career). He has a narrow window in which to act, and could do significant good, repairing some of his own mistakes and blunting some of what Donald Trump has pledged will begin on Day One.\n\nFirst and most importantly, Biden should suspend all arms shipments to Israel. Period. Not one more bomb, not one more bullet. Israel's mass slaughter of civilians in Gaza is increasingly described as outright, livestreamed genocide. The Israeli military is now forcing the entire population of the northern quarter of the Gaza Strip to leave for the south. This follows the release of \"The Generals' Plan,\" drafted by retired Israeli military officers, calling for the systematic denial of humanitarian aid in the north, which has been labeled ethnic cleansing. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported this week, \"The army has begun the stage of cleansing the northern Strip while it prepares to hold onto the area for a long time to come.\"\n\nIsrael is using US taxpayer-funded arms to decimate Palestinians in Gaza, in clear contravention of US and international law. The people of Gaza are trapped, under siege, surrounded by the Israeli army and navy, with armed drones, helicopters and military jets overhead. They are being driven from their homes, starved, bombed, shot by snipers, killed by tank shells, and forced to live without clean water, sanitation, functioning hospitals, or the basics of survival. Every aspect of their society, their culture, their history, is being erased by Israel's unrelenting bombardment and by smiling, selfie-snapping IDF demolition crews. None of this would have been possible without Biden's support.\n\nHaaretz also reported, in early September, that a \"senior air force official told Haaretz that without the Americans' supply of weapons to the Israel Defense Forces, especially the air force, Israel would have had a hard time sustaining its war for more than a few months.\"\n\nA leaked letter to Israel from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin demanded Israel immediately allow US humanitarian aid shipments to Gaza or face an interruption in arms shipments. They gave Israel until November 13th to comply. But the laws governing arms shipments don't include a month-long grace period; the cessation is supposed to be immediate. Nevertheless, as the deadline approaches, and with the situation in northern Gaza becoming more catastrophic by the day, it seems that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a staunch Trump ally, has no intention of allowing in aid.\n\nDomestically, Biden could preempt some of the violence expected from the incoming Trump administration.\n\nBiden promised to end the federal death penalty when he was campaigning in 2020, after President Trump ordered the execution of 13 federal death row prisoners in his final six months in office. With the stroke of a pen, Biden could commute the sentences of the forty current federal death row prisoners to life in prison. This would empty federal death row, denying Trump the opportunity to engage in another killing spree. Biden could also commute the sentences of the four prisoners awaiting execution on the US military's death row.\n\nBiden could also impact Trump's anticipated mass deportation that was a central pledge of his campaign. Law professors Peter Markowitz and Lindsay Nash from the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York have revived an argument proposed by scores of advocacy groups in the waning days of the Obama administration, that \"the President possesses the constitutional authority to categorically pardon broad classes of immigrants for civil violations of the immigration laws and to thereby provide durable and permanent protections against deportation.\"\n\nBiden could act on the admittedly novel legal theory, by granting millions of undocumented immigrants relief from the myriad and often violently inflicted injustices of the US's failed immigration policies. Such a move would certainly be challenged in court, but would potentially slow down what will almost certainly be a horrendous attempt by Donald Trump to deport up to 12 million US residents.\n\nPeople are organizing now on how to resist the incoming Trump administration. Biden could join them, by using the constitutional powers of the office of the President of the United States, the most powerful position on earth.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

As his term draws to a close and amid outrage over the pardon of his son Hunter, advocates are pressuring Biden - who has pardoned thousands who had been convicted of federal drug charges but were not incarcerated at the time of their pardons - to grant clemency to thousands more who are still in prison over cannabis offenses. The president has a chance to atone for his past support of \"tough on crime\" measures, says the Last Prisoner Project's Jason Ortiz. He says Biden has an opportunity of \"correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years\" and should \"extend the same grace and compassion\" he showed his son Hunter \"to all the folks that he helped put in prison to begin with.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nPresident Biden is continuing to face criticism over his decision to issue a sweeping pardon to his son Hunter Biden. But the president's decision has also brought renewed attention to the power of the presidential pardon. Biden is now facing renewed pressure to commute the sentences of death row prisoners and to pardon or grant clemency to political prisoners like Indigenous leader Leonard Peltier, imprisoned in Florida, and the whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. The group Last Prisoner Project is calling on Biden to use his clemency power to free those still incarcerated in federal prison for cannabis crimes.\n\nWe're joined now by Jason Ortiz, director of Strategic Initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project.\n\nThis is very interesting, Jason. I think they say that Hunter Biden has been clean for something like just over five years. His father has openly talked about his son, formerly an addict. And as he faces bipartisan criticism, talk about what you think this is an opening for.\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Sure. So, this is definitely an opening for folks to talk about exactly how expansive we can use the pardon power of the president to make sure that we're correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years when it comes to cannabis crimes. President Biden himself was actually one of the architects of the 1994 crime bill that created a lot of the outrageous sentences that we're now dealing with today.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing that there are over 3,000 federal cannabis prisoners currently incarcerated on cannabis charges, and these are all folks that also have families and have parents and have loved ones. And we have examples, like folks like Jonathan Wall, who is somebody that was a Maryland resident. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for his first offense. And so, while I can understand why the president wants to have compassion for his own son, where we're really getting frustrated is that he's refusing to extend that compassion to all the parents that are currently watching their kids waste away in prison. Mitzi Wall, who works with the organization Freedom Grow, is the mother of Jonathan Wall. She was joining me this past week when we had the congressional press conference, when we were joined by folks like James Clyburn, Congressman James Clyburn, asking for freedom and clemency for folks like Jonathan Wall. And so, that's one example of 3,000 folks that are currently in prison.\n\nSome of the charges are far more egregious. Folks like Edwin Rubis was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison in the '90s. And so, he's someone that hasn't had a Christmas or holidays with his family. He has a son that's 27 years old. He has currently served 27 years of that federal sentence. He hasn't had a single Christmas with his son because of charges that were orchestrated and architected by President Biden, then as senator, in the crime bill. We have folks that are serving life sentences. Ismael Lira, for a trafficking charge, is currently sentenced on a life sentence for the same activity that is now legal across the country in 25 -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Which is what?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : - different states, including - trafficking. And so, that would be the distribution of cannabis. And so, there is a specific differentiation between what President Biden's previous pardons were intended to do, which was only covering things like simple possession, where right now we have folks that are serving decades for trafficking, which is exactly what the hundreds of legal cannabis businesses across the country are currently doing on a regular basis, including right in Washington, D.C. And so, we're now seeing people sitting in prison for decades for the same activity that is currently generating tax revenue for cities and states across the country. We're paying for schools and building bridges with cannabis activity dollars, but still letting folks waste away in prison. And so, while I can definitely understand why a father would want to have compassion for his son and avoid prison time for his son, we're really asking him to extend that same compassion to all the folks that he helped put in prison to begin with.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: [Jason], you mentioned the previous pardons for simple cannabis possession, but that hasn't led to the release of many of those incarcerated individuals. Can you talk about that?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Yeah, absolutely. So, those pardons were for simple possession, for folks that were currently charged on a federal possession charge. And, now, it is very rare for someone to actually serve prison time for a simple possession charge at the federal level. That generally happens to folks - somebody maybe got caught; they were smoking at a national park or some other sort of federal property where they were unaware of it. But there are nobody in prison for simple possession in the federal prison system whatsoever. So, despite his pardoning of 6,000 charges, zero people were released.\n\nHowever, the charges that we're looking to actually have folks released for, things like cultivation of cannabis, sales of cannabis, those are the charges that folks are currently in prison for. And we want him to expand his use of the pardon to cover all cannabis crimes that are now legal in the majority of the country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, and, Jason, apologies, but, Jason, during your press conference last week, you spoke of, quote, \"the heartbreaking number of Latino fathers incarcerated for life or near-life sentences.\" How do these cases reflect systemic inequalities in federal sentencing?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : So, we've seen for the past 50 years or so that the war on drugs has been racially motivated, specifically targeting young Black and Brown men, and many of those are Latinos, here in the city of New York. There was millions of arrests across the country. We've seen countless young fathers that have been ripped from their families, simply because they were trying to make money to help feed their families.\n\nAnd so, I was somebody who was arrested in high school at the age of 16. I was lucky enough not to get incarcerated, but only because my parents were able to help me through this ridiculous legal process of keeping a 16-year-old out of prison.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing across the country that while these laws are changing, the retroactive relief and the restorative justice for the folks that were impacted has not followed suit with all of the cannabis profits that we're seeing developed across the country. And we know without a doubt that the war on drugs was and is still racially motivated, specifically targeting Blacks and Latinos. And so, we've yet to actually wrestle with that real racist history of the war on drugs. We're simply trying to just move on without addressing the past.\n\nAnd I think the president has an incredible opportunity now to really address the issues that have been developed over the last few years by taking real expansive action, using his clemency power to commute the sentences of the folks that are currently in prison. And roughly half of the folks that are on our list of constituents are Latino. And you can see very clearly just by looking down the list of names who is in there and who is getting out in the future. And Latinos are definitely overrepresented in the prison population generally, but especially in the federal system for cannabis crimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you look at the clemency statistics by president, Biden is at almost the lowest, outside of George H.W. Bush. Biden, Trump, Obama, W., Clinton, H.W. and Reagan - he's number two, among the lowest. Are you speaking directly, are your groups speaking directly with the Biden clemency office? How far are these demands going? You're talking about thousands of people.\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Yeah. So, we have met with White House officials multiple times, and we've explained exactly the folks that we believe are the top candidates for clemency. And while they have been receptive, they have not told us that they're going to take any particular action to help these folks out at all.\n\nAnd so, what we are really doing is hoping that they will take action sooner rather than later. It is true that most of the time most presidents use their clemency powers at the very end of their presidency. However, President Biden has clearly shown that he's not going to wait for everyone to wait until the end of his presidency. He was willing to do it a little bit earlier for his son. And so, we're asking him to extend the same grace and compassion to all the folks that are currently incarcerated and release them immediately, let them join their families for the holidays, let them see their families grow up, and bring joy and happiness back into their lives.\n\nThese are folks that have served a tremendous amount of time already. This is not folks that we're saying did not commit the crime and should be, you know, released without any sort of punishment. Folks like Edwin Rubis have already served 27 years of their life in federal prison for a cannabis charge.\n\nAnd so, while he could wait, we are asking him not to wait, to do this immediately, to show the people that his presidency is going to be one where he will be remembered as addressing the issues that he created and coming to this from a place of compassion, and not continuing the process and continuing the damage done by punitive drug policies.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Jason Ortiz, we thank you so much for being with us, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project.\n\nComing up, Israeli journalist, former conscientious objector Haggai Matar about Gaza and Israel's crackdown on the press. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Fight by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes review - scathing account of Biden, Harris and their election loss\n\nBook details how Biden's circle was reluctant to step down, Harris's handling of a listing ship and a lack of faith in both\n\nIn their book Fight, Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes offer an account of the \"Wildest Battle for the White House\" - and a scathing indictment of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris , the losers of that battle.\n\nBy 2023, a year before the campaign, Biden's age and fitness to be president were the topic of conversation among senior aides. He had difficulty stringing together a coherent sentence, yet there was no serious discussion of his exiting the ticket until it was way, way too late. Harris, meanwhile, was isolated in her party and terrified of facing the press. She took the wheel of a badly listing ship. It sank.\n\nAllen is a veteran political reporter, now at NBC. Parnes is a senior political correspondent for the Hill. Both were once with Politico . Together, they have written two books on Hillary Clinton, HRC and Shattered, and Lucky, an account of how Biden beat Donald Trump to win the White House in 2020. Parnes and Allen possess perspective. Their writing is sober, their sourcing solid.\n\nTheir message is clear: Biden should never have sought re-election and his selection of Harris as his running mate was a mistake from the start. By 2024, Biden was too old and too unpopular. He appeared feeble, if not outright addled. But his aides came to view Harris as a liability and so did those at the top of the party. The president's wife, Jill Biden, opposed Harris's place on the ticket. Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi lacked faith too.\n\nAt the same time, Jill and Hunter Biden , the 46th president's wayward surviving son, bolstered the president's determination to cling on. They could not let go.\n\n\"Nobody walks away from this,\" Mike Donilon, a longtime Biden adviser, purportedly told one prominent Democrat. \"No one walks away from the house, the plane, the helicopter.\"\n\nAllen and Parnes add: \"That was doubly true for the first lady.\"\n\nPushback could be construed as disloyalty. Biden's closest advisers were family members or dependent on him for their living. That proved to be a problem. There were no social peers with incomes and lives of their own, figures in the mold of James Baker, secretary of state and chief of staff to George HW Bush, or Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser and confidante to Barack and Michelle Obama. Biden bristled at being challenged but was a schmoozer, not a leader. He owed his comeback to Covid-19.\n\nOn 27 June 2024, Biden faced Trump on the debate stage in Atlanta - and gave perhaps the most disastrous display in history. Allen and Parnes describe a reception hosted by Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, two days later. The president's aides had affixed fluorescent tape to the carpet, \"colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk\".\n\n\"He knows to look for that,\" one aide explained. Think, President Grampa Simpson. It's a lousy image, whoever the other side is running.\n\nIn 2020, the Trump campaign mocked Biden for hiding in his basement. In turn, Bidenites twitted Trump for his inability to handle stairs. Time passed. By 2023, Trump was approaching 80, but Biden had shuffled past it. In public, he froze. The memes flowed but Biden's woes were not comedic.\n\nAccording to Parnes and Allen, Harris aides \"strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office\". Jamal Simmons, Harris's communications director, drew up a \"death-pool roster\" of federal judges who might swear his boss in.\n\nAfter the debate, Obama and Pelosi were distraught. The debacle left Obama shocked, if not exactly surprised.\n\n\"The 44th president never had much faith in [the] political ability\" of his former vice-president, Parnes and Allen write. \"Less than two weeks earlier, at [a] Los Angeles fundraiser, Obama led Biden offstage by the wrist after the president stood frozen for a few moments while staring into the crowd.\"\n\nObama was disturbed. Parnes and Allen describe a post-debate call.\n\n\"What is your path?\" Obama asked Biden.\n\n\" What's my path? Biden thought as he listened to Obama. What's your fucking plan? \"\n\nHe intuited Obama's endgame. But Obama also lacked faith in Harris.\n\n\"Obama already had determined that he didn't think Harris should take the president's spot on the ballot,\" Parnes and Allen write. \"'That was his position from the outset,' according to one person who spoke to him at the time.\"\n\nPelosi, like Harris from northern California, unlike her a hardened politico with ruthless instincts, thought the same way.\n\n\"She actually was worried when people were panicking the night of the debate, saying 'Oh my God, it's going to be her,'\" Parnes and Allen quote \"someone who spoke to Pelosi\".\n\nObama and Pelosi applied pressure. Biden caved. Harris generated buzz, but not enough. She bested Trump in debate, but memory of that triumph faded swiftly. Harris would not and could not put distance between herself and Biden. The president, his family and his handlers wanted it that way.\n\nBiden and Harris's shortcomings had been clear for years. In June 2019, on the debate stage, Harris trashed Biden over his record on race. Less than six months later, having burned through millions of dollars, she dropped out of the Democratic primary. Her place on Biden's ticket resulted from the threat posed by Trump, the protest-filled aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd, and the leftward drift and outsized role of identity politics within Democratic ranks.\n\nHis opponents brought to a historic low, Trump openly weighs running for a third term, in defiance of the constitution. Whether the Democrats can respond is in grave doubt indeed.\n\nFight is published in the US by HarperCollins"

      "text": "In a new book, top Biden aide describes 'out of it' president before Trump debate\n\nRon Klain tells author Chris Whipple then president could not focus and obsessed about foreign leaders ahead of debate that ended his campaign\n\nIn a new book, Joe Biden's former White House chief of staff paints a devastating picture of the then US president's mental and physical state before the debate with Donald Trump that sent his 2024 campaign into a tailspin, resulting in his relinquishing the Democratic nomination to Kamala Harris .\n\nRon Klain served Biden from 2021 to 2023 , then returned to his side last June to run debate preparation as he had for numerous Democratic presidents before.\n\nAccording to Klain, it turned out that Biden \"didn't know what Trump had been saying and couldn't grasp what the back and forth was\"; left preparation and fell asleep by the pool; obsessed about foreign leaders, saying \"these guys say I'm doing a great job as president so I must be a great president\"; \"didn't really understand what his argument was on inflation\"; and \"had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job\".\n\nAs described by Klain to the reporter Chris Whipple, at one point Biden had an idea.\n\n\"If he looked perplexed when Trump talked, voters would understand that Trump was an idiot. Klain replied: 'Sir, when you look perplexed, people just think you're perplexed. And this is our problem in this race.\"\n\nWhipple's book, Uncharted : How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nBiden is reportedly planning his own book but Whipple's blockbuster is not even the first such volume to hit the shelves. This week saw the publication of Fight, by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, which also contains extensive reporting on Biden's decline and Harris's struggle to win over party elites.\n\nLike Parnes and Allen, Whipple reports both sides of a campaign Trump won despite a criminal conviction, civil penalties including one related to an allegation of rape, and indictments over election subversion and retention of classified information.\n\nBut Whipple focuses another harsh spotlight on Biden, an octogenarian president long beset by questions about his fitness for office.\n\nLast week, Whipple told Politico : \"I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden's final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story.\n\n\"I happen to think that to call it a 'cover-up' is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden's inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.\"\n\nIn early 2024, as the campaign warmed up, Klain was among those who said he believed Biden was the right candidate to beat Trump a second time, telling the New York Times: \"If I thought he wasn't the right candidate to beat Donald Trump, I wouldn't be for him running. But I think he is the right candidate.\"\n\nEven after the disastrous debate, by his own telling to Whipple, Klain believed Biden should have stayed in the race - a statement that jars with Klain's account of debate prep at Camp David.\n\n\"At his first meeting with Biden in Aspen Lodge, the president's cabin,\" Whipple writes, Klain \"was startled. He'd never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.\n\n\"That evening Biden met again with Klain and his team, [Biden aides] Mike Donilon, Steve Richetti, and Bruce Reed. 'We sat around the table,' said Klain. '[Biden] had answers on cards, and he was just extremely exhausted. And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with Nato leaders.'\"\n\nKlain, Whipple writes, \"wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US. 'He just became very enraptured with being the head of Nato,' he said. That wouldn't help him on Capitol Hill because, as Klain noted, 'domestic political leaders don't really care what [Emmanuel] Macron and [Olaf] Scholz think.'\"\n\nKlain, fellow aides and visitors including the film mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg tried to get Biden into shape. Two mock debates were organized, focusing on domestic policy.\n\n\"The first was scheduled to last 90 minutes but Klain called it off after 45. The president's voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject. All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term.\"\n\nKlain says Biden grew irritable, saying he would not make promises as he would be criticized for failing to deliver. Klain says he tried to persuade Biden to run on unfinished business, including his attempt to \"subsidize state and local efforts to do childcare and bring down the cost to $20 a day. And you ought to try to fight for it again.\"\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"Biden seemed befuddled,\" Whipple writes. \"'Well, that just seems like a big spending program,' he said.\n\nKlain said: \"No, sir. It brings down costs for people. It's responsive to inflation. It will bring more people into the workforce. It's good economics. And you know this is something you're for.\"\n\nBut \"Biden didn't want to talk about it\" and \"25 minutes into the second mock debate, the president was done for the day. 'I'm just too tired to continue and I'm afraid of losing my voice here and I feel bad,' he said. 'I just need some sleep. I'll be fine tomorrow.' He went off to bed.\"\n\n\"The president was fatigued, befuddled, and disengaged,\" Whipple writes. \"Klain feared the debate with Trump would be a nationally televised disaster.\"\n\nIt was. On 27 June, Biden arrived at the Atlanta venue with minutes to spare - because, Klain said, \"He was the president of the United States. They weren't going to start without him.\" Onstage, for two hours and six minutes, Biden stumbled, stared and mumbled.\n\nAs described by Whipple, Jill Biden praised her husband's performance but all others around the president could see \"something was terribly wrong\". Whipple quotes an unnamed close friend of Biden who took a call from Valerie Biden Owens. The president's sister and longtime adviser was \"so angry, she was practically incoherent\". The same friend reports a later call from Biden, laughing at his predicament and sounding like the senator and vice-president of old.\n\n\"Where did that voice go?\" the friend wondered ... \"Where did that guy with that voice go? What the fuck happened to this guy?\"\n\nTo Whipple, that was a question \"on which the political fate of the nation would turn\".\n\nEventually, Biden bowed to reality. On 21 July, Klain took a call from Jeff Zients, his successor as chief of staff. Biden was out. Despite the debate disaster, the news was a \"gut punch\" to Klain.\n\n\"Jeff, that's too bad,\" he said. \"I think that's a mistake. I think this was an avoidable tragedy.\"\n\nHarris faced opposition from Democratic grandees including Obama and Nancy Pelosi, but wrapped up the nomination by August. In early September, Klain gave Whipple his interview. With the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate, Harris mounted an energetic campaign. In November, she lost to Trump."

      "text": "Biden skipped White House meeting after Trump debate for photoshoot, new book says\n\nRon Klain tells author Chris Whipple that Biden opted for Annie Leibovitz shoot at critical moment in campaign\n\nIn the aftermath of the disastrous debate against Donald Trump that ultimately ended his political career, Joe Biden skipped a White House meeting with the congressional Progressive caucus in favor of a Camp David photoshoot with the fashion photographer Annie Leibovitz, a new book says.\n\n\"You need to cancel that,\" Ron Klain, Biden's former chief of staff and debate prep leader, told the president, as he advocated securing the endorsement of the group of powerful progressive politicians perhaps key to his remaining the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"You need to stay in Washington. You need to have an aggressive plan to fight and to rally the troops.\"\n\nAs described by Klain to Chris Whipple, the author of an explosive new book on the 2024 campaign, Biden \"seemed to relent. 'OK,' he said.\"\n\n\"But the president's resolve didn't last,\" the book continued. \"That weekend, Biden and his family were at Camp David having their pictures taken\" by Leibovitz.\n\nThe president did speak to the progressives by Zoom, Whipple writes, only to scold them over their stance on Israel and claim to have stronger progressive bona fides than they did.\n\nWhipple's book, Uncharted : How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nKlain was White House chief of staff from 2021 to 2023. He became chief legal officer for Airbnb but returned to Biden's side last June to prepare him to debate Trump.\n\nConcern over the octogenarian president's fitness for the job was a feature of Biden's White House term. As reported by the Guardian, Klain told Whipple debate preparations left him alarmed by Biden's physical and mental decline.\n\nBut Klain told Whipple: \"This was about something other than his age. It was a struggle over power in our party.\" According to Klain, Democratic donors were \"tired\" of Biden because of his ties to labor, and wanted a more business-oriented leader.\n\nSuch calls grew deafening after the debate, in which Biden performed with painful, halting confusion. According to Whipple, Klain called Biden the next day, 28 June, and said: \"Look, we're hemorrhaging badly. We need to get the progressive caucus to the White House this weekend. And you need to agree with them on an agenda for a second term, and they will endorse you. So you can walk out there with one hundred members of Congress saying, 'You should stay in the race.'\n\n\"Biden wasn't convinced: 'Well, I'm supposed to go to Camp David this weekend for a photo shoot with my family.'\"\n\nKlain offered his \"blunt\" advice and Biden seemed to back down, Whipple writes. But the president left Washington anyway, for a stay with family members who were widely reported to be urging him not to drop out of the race.\n\n\"Klain was angry,\" Whipple reports. \"He called [Jeff] Zients, his successor as White House chief of staff. The president needed to rally the progressives ASAP, Klain told him. But Zients didn't share his alarm. 'Look, we've got a plan,' he told Klain. 'We've got a schedule. We're going to stick to the schedule.'\"\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nZients and his team had been trying to rally support for Biden from Democrats in Congress but Klain \"felt more drastic action was needed\". A Zoom call was set up with the progressives. It proved a \"fiasco\", with Biden giving members of Congress led by Pramila Jayapal of Washington state \"a scolding\", saying: \"All you guys want to talk about is Gaza ... What would you have me do?\" and \"I was a progressive before some of you guys were even in Congress.\"\n\nJayapal called Klain. Klain called Zients. Zients passed blame to another Biden aide, Steve Ricchetti, \"the progressives' least favorite White House official\". Klain told Zients: \"Jeff, this is life or death for this presidency this weekend.\" Zients pushed back. Klain was convinced Biden's aides did not have \"a strategy to save his presidency\".\n\nThe battle to force Biden out continued. On 21 July, the president bowed to pressure and quit. Klain told Zients: \"Jeff, that's too bad. I think that's a mistake. I think this was an avoidable tragedy.\"\n\nBiden's vice-president, Kamala Harris, fought off attempts to deny her the nomination, then fought a 100-day campaign that ended in defeat by Trump.\n\nDespite his first-hand experience of Biden's struggles, and his failure to corral the president into doing simple political legwork instead of attending a glitzy photoshoot, Klain still thought Biden could have won a second term.\n\nIn August, he told CNN the president was \"clearly up to the job. He's doing it every day. He's doing it successfully.\"\n\nHe also said Biden had \"done well\" in debate preparation."

      "text": "Democrats' deference to Biden was a disaster. They still haven't learned their lesson\n\nConformity and fear of party leadership are impairing Democrats' ability to fight Trump and drive a progressive agenda\n\nJ oe Biden's insistence on running for re-election was certainly disastrous. It kept credible contenders out of the Democratic presidential primaries and prevented the selection of a nominee who had gained momentum in the winnowing process. Even after his stunningly feeble debate performance on 27 June last year, Biden took several weeks before finally opting out of the race. That left Kamala Harris a mere 107 days between the launch of her campaign and election day.\n\nAmple evidence shows that the Biden team was riddled with obstinate denial and misrepresentation aimed at the public. But tales of tragic egomania in high places can take us only so far. What's essential is to scrutinize how - and why - the Democratic party, its leaders and its prominent supporters enabled Biden and his inner circle to get away with such momentous stonewalling for so long.\n\nDemocrats in Congress, with few exceptions, refused to jump off the Biden 2024 bandwagon until the debate disaster. Similar enabling also came from state party chairs and Democratic governors. Likewise, a wide range of party-allied organizations toed the Biden party line. Meanwhile, many activists took on the role of spectators, if not cheerleaders for another Biden campaign, in an unfolding tragedy of vast proportions.\n\nA common denominator was fear. Fear of being accused of disloyalty to the Democratic president. Fear of being ostracized by fellow Democrats or denounced by anti-Trump commentators. Fear of being accused of weakening the party by pointing out Biden's evident frailty. Fear of damaging personal ambitions or future access to halls of power. And on and on.\n\nThe silence and compliance helped Biden to coast toward renomination. Yet by midway through his term, polling numbers and increasingly shaky public behavior were clear signals that he would be a weak candidate. Support from working-class voters , the young , and people of color drastically eroded.\n\nNotably, leading progressives in Congress assisted Biden in fending off a serious primary challenge. Representative Pramila Jayapal, then chair of the congressional Progressive caucus, made a very early endorsement. \"I never thought I would say this, but I believe he should run for another term and finish this agenda we laid out,\" she said in November 2022. Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Biden in April 2023. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him three months later.\n\nPolls routinely showed that most Democratic voters did not want Biden to run again. But party leaders were on autopilot, choosing discretion over valor, benefitting their relations with the White House but undermining the party's prospects of retaining it - as is now painfully and undeniably clear.\n\nA few weeks ago, speaking at a Harvard Kennedy School forum, Jayapal said : \"I do think had the president just served one term, he would have gone out a hero, he would have passed the torch, he would have been celebrated for his accomplishments, we would have had a really strong Democratic primary with a lot of good candidates, and then we would have had the full election season to fight it out and to actually get somebody who could win.\"\n\nNow, an open question is whether crucial lessons have been learned and will be heeded. At stake is the capacity of the Democratic party to defeat Trumpist forces in the midterm elections next year and in 2028.\n\nThe outlook is not good. A grim reality is that the Democratic party and its loyalists have developed an enduring corrosive culture - which had everything to do with the insistence on continuing to fuel the faulty Biden 2024 locomotive as it dragged the party toward a calamitous defeat.\n\nI am not writing from a vantage point of hindsight alone. In November 2022, days after the midterm elections, my colleagues and I at the progressive non-profit RootsAction launched the Don't Run Joe campaign (renamed Step Aside Joe when Biden announced his candidacy the following spring). During the next 20 months, not one other sizable national organization was willing to push for Biden to forego a re-election bid.\n\nWe began in New Hampshire , the longtime first-in-the-country presidential primary state. (Biden had finished fifth with only 8.4% of the vote in the 2020 Democratic primary there. For 2024, he demoted New Hampshire to make South Carolina first.) On 9 November 2022, our kickoff digital ads reached Democrats across New Hampshire. Within days, upwards of 2,000 Democratic voters in the state had signed a Don't Run Joe petition, conveying this message: \"We cannot risk losing in 2024. We shouldn't gamble on Joe Biden's low approval rating.\"\n\nThat was the gist of our messaging that continued for more than a year and a half via online advertising, email blasts, social media, news releases , media interviews, mass texting to Democratic voters, leafleting at state party conventions and TV ads in several key states and Washington DC. A mobile Don't Run Joe billboard circled the Capitol and White House as well as the site of a Democratic National Committee meeting .\n\nDon't Run Joe placed full-page print advertisements in the Hill, aimed at congressional Democrats. One ad included a picture of men in suits with their heads in the sand. Presented as An Open Letter to Democrats in the House and Senate , the ad declared that \"evasion is no solution\" and concluded: \"Conformity and fear of a White House rebuke have never served Democrats or the nation well. It is time to stop muffling genuine concerns and start being honest about the pivotal downsides of a prospective Biden '24 candidacy. The future of the Democratic Party - and the country - is at stake.\"\n\nToday, conformity and fear are still contagions afflicting the Democratic party, now impairing its capacity to roll back Donald Trump's autocratic rule and effectively fight for a progressive agenda. The rebellion against Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, while encouraging, has not shaken the party's underlying power structure. And habitual deference to uninspiring party leadership does not bode well.\n\nThe day after the president's recent demagogic speech to Congress, the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries , were the featured speakers for \"a virtual National Update and Call to Action\". The next morning, I received a text from a progressive Democratic party activist, who summarized the event as \"sad and weak,\" adding: \"Jeffries and Martin's delivery was anemic, content essentially pablum.\" The activist signed off with the words \"Really frightened\".\n\nI asked if it would be OK to use the activist's name while quoting from the text in an article. The reply was both understandable and symptomatic of how fear prevents the kind of open debate that the Democratic party desperately needs: \"No, I am working inside the party ... \"\n\nNorman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

And he left the spreadsheet with another Harris aide.\"\n\nFight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House is Allen and Parnes's third campaign book after studies of Trump's win over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and defeat by Biden in 2020. The new book is published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nParnes and Allen describe questions about Biden's fitness that grew throughout the 2024 election cycle. Trump and Republicans seized on Biden's age while Biden and White House aides vehemently insisted he was fit for another four-year term.\n\nAlready published extracts of Fight have concerned events after Biden withdrew: Harris's frustration over being unable to distance herself from Biden, an unpopular president, and her team's failure to land an interview with Joe Rogan, the influential podcaster whose three-hour chat with Trump came to be seen as a pivotal moment.\n\nBut Parnes and Allen devote the first half of their book to Biden's long, painful, public decline, leading to his historic decision to step aside while in office and eligible for a second four-year term.\n\nPart one of Fight is called The Unmaking of the President, a nod to The Making of the President 1960, Theodore H White's seminal book on John F Kennedy's win over Richard Nixon. Part two is called What It Took, a reference to Richard Ben Cramer's classic on the 1988 election - in which Biden plays a prominent part as a young Democratic senator whose first presidential campaign crashed and burned in public.\n\nWhen he dropped out in 1987, Biden was 44. In 2020, when his third presidential run ended in victory over Trump, he was 77. In 2023, after two years as the oldest president ever inaugurated, he was past 80 - and showing it.\n\n\"A handful of Democratic National Committee officials already had considered contingency plans,\" Allen and Parnes write. \"In hush-hush talks starting in 2023, these officials gamed out Biden-withdrawal scenarios, according to two people familiar with them.\n\n\"They wanted to make sure the party was ready for every possible circumstance: if Biden launched his campaign and then stepped aside before the primaries; if he won a bunch of primaries and then could not continue. If he secured enough delegates for winning the nomination but dropped out before winning a floor vote at the convention, and if he left a vacancy at the top of the ticket after taking the nomination.\"\n\nAccording to Parnes and Allen, the \"hush-hush\" planning was focused on what party rules said would happen in any such scenario \"and how they might need to be changed, if the president no longer had the desire, or the ability, to run\".\n\n\"One official involved in secret talks put a fine point on the fear that Biden would not make it to election day as the party's nominee: 'It shows what we had to do to prepare with the unique circumstances we had, which was an 80-plus-year-old president who was running.\"\n\nBiden remained determined, egged on by family including his wife Jill Biden and legally troubled son, Hunter Biden, and by veteran aides. Parnes and Allen describe tensions between such factions but also chaotic preparations for what turned out to be the only Biden-Trump debate . That 80-minute meeting took place in Atlanta, Georgia, on 27 June. Biden's performance - stiff, confused and weak - has gone down in history as perhaps the most catastrophic of all time.\n\nStill, it took nearly a month for party pressure to build to a sufficient pitch to force Biden to relinquish his grip on power.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIn a particularly striking passage, Parnes and Allen describe a donors' reception hosted by Phil Murphy, then governor of New Jersey, on 29 June 2024, two days after the debate disaster. Biden reportedly needed to have florescent tape fixed to the carpet, \"colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk\".\n\n\"He knows to look for that,\" one aide explained.\n\nAt the same event, Biden reportedly needed an autocue for \"unscripted\" remarks and then spoke haltingly in a Q&A with Murphy.\n\n\"He didn't look well,\" the authors write. \"He didn't sound vital.\"\n\nSuch moments only increased party pressure. Allen and Parnes report an extraordinary conversation between Biden and Barack Obama , to whom Biden was vice-president between 2009 and 2017. In doing so, they quote Obama but present Biden's thoughts in italics, indicative of close sourcing, perhaps from Biden himself.\n\n\"What is your path?\" Obama asked.\n\n\" What's my path? Biden thought as he listened to Obama. What's your fucking plan? \"\n\nSuch high drama is ultimately matched with brutal pathos. Parnes and Allen report how Obama and other party grandees eventually came to back Harris as the only alternative to Biden.\n\n\"One veteran operative summed up the sentiments of Democrats who worried they would get stuck with Harris but still wanted Biden out: 'Well, at least she has a pulse.'\""

Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House , Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes' account of the campaign that followed, will be published next week - as Trump's second term enters its third tempestuous month. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nPublished extracts from the book have described controversial episodes from Harris's short campaign and conclusive defeat, including her inability to land an interview with the influential podcaster Joe Rogan, in contrast to Trump, and her frustration with close control maintained by former aides to Biden.\n\nLong an issue for Democrats, the question of Biden's age and fitness came to a head on 27 June, when the president performed disastrously onstage with Trump in Atlanta. Parnes and Allen provide detailed and dramatic insights into the crisis.\n\nAmid calls for Biden to withdraw, the authors write, aides to Biden \"frantically push[ed] back in phone calls and in text messages, accusing donors of promoting their own agendas at the expense of Biden, the party, and the country\".\n\nParnes and Allen then switch to using italics, which they say indicates sources describing personal thoughts or descriptions of the private thoughts and conversations of others.\n\n\"It all sounded like a serial killer's conspiracy theory. Donors want to scrap Biden so they can get his wannabe replacements - the governors, with power over state decisions - to beg them for cash , Biden aides argued.\n\n\" This isn't fucking Wall Street financiers versus Ivy League presidents. Our guy isn't scared of your money. We have grassroots donors. We have the support of the voters. We have the nomination in hand. All you're doing is fucking yourself and the president. We will remember this. Capisce?\n\n\"The last threat, the ace in the hole, was Kamala Harris . Even if Biden did drop out and you got your dreamed-up open convention, you would only succeed in nominating the vice-president. Is that what you want? You want her? Look at her polling. No one wants her. Forget it. It's never gonna happen.\"\n\nEntreaties fell on deaf ears. Donors \"cut off hundreds of millions of dollars\". On 21 July, Biden dropped out .\n\nIt was a historic moment but the party moved swiftly to avoid further upheaval. There would be no open convention. Instead, Allen and Parnes describe how opposition to Harris, even from grandees including the former president Barack Obama and the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, was beaten aside by figures including Jim Clyburn, the veteran South Carolina congressman who did much to make Biden the nominee and Harris his running mate just four years before.\n\n\" There are some powerful folks saying, 'Off with both their heads,' Clyburn thought. They're all planning to pass over Kamala .\"\n\nParnes and Allen also describe how before becoming the nominee, and for a time after, Harris \"pined\" for Obama's support. A painful process, it was made worse by Harris never having forged close ties with the former president and his wife, Michelle, ever since being denied access to a VIP area at the Obamas' election celebration in Chicago in 2009 .\n\n\" Doesn't he see what's happening? she thought. Harris felt hurt that he thought so little of her. That pain turned to anger. What's holding him back? \"\n\nAccording to Parnes and Allen, Obama never thought Harris could beat Trump but backed her when he saw he was under threat himself, \"suddenly in a position where his actions against Biden and Harris could diminish him in the eyes of Democratic elites\".\n\nObama endorsed Harris and campaigned for her. So did Pelosi, who spoke of her \"immense pride\" in doing so.\n\nParnes and Allen report a less positive verdict from the former speaker. According to an unnamed \"person who spoke to\" Pelosi on the night of the Atlanta debate, Pelosi \"actually was worried ... saying, 'Oh my God, it's going to be her.'\""

      "text": "Not done yet: still-smarting Joe Biden to focus on his legacy in final months\n\nWith a diary suddenly freed up by the end of his re-election bid, the president is looking to safeguard his achievements\n\nW hen a reporter asked if the White House had already started the transition process, Karine Jean-Pierre seemed bemused. \"Why?\" the press secretary retorted . \"Are you trying to kick us out already? We've got five months.\"\n\nWhatever excitement there is in American politics at the moment, the White House is not the centre of the action. What was expected to be a hectic final sprint towards the presidential election, with Joe Biden pinballing between swing-state rallies , has been replaced by long, languorous afternoons in humid Washington.\n\nSince 81-year-old Biden ended his re-election campaign after losing the confidence of fellow Democrats, his schedule has been appreciably quieter and his public appearances more scarce. As the party's new nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris, 59, barnstorms the country and electrifies crowds , there are some days when Biden lies low and is not seen at all.\n\nJean-Pierre recently acknowledged that the president and White House were still \"recalibrating\" after his decision. \"We are trying to figure out what the next six months are going to look like,\" she told journalists . \"Just give us a beat.\"\n\nSuch absences can create an impression that Biden is less running through the tape than staggering across the finish line. The vacuum can be filled by baseless rightwing conspiracy theories suggesting that Biden is no longer fit for office and that Harris, former president Barack Obama or some other deep state operative is actually running the government.\n\nHowever, analysts say, Biden is making a deliberate choice to work on cementing his legacy - and ensuring the election of Harris to protect it from Republican rival Donald Trump. Though his relevance is diminished, the fact he no longer needs to worry about getting re-elected could prove liberating.\n\nDomestically he hopes to keep money flowing from a series of major legislative wins early in his term that could be undone should Trump return to the White House. He will press to quickly fill federal judiciary vacancies and last month he proposed reforms for the supreme court, calling on Congress to establish term limits and an enforceable ethics code for the nine justices.\n\nForeign policy represents Biden's best hope for a final defining moment. Last week he helped secure the release of the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former US marine Paul Whelan and others in the biggest prisoner swap between Moscow and the US since the cold war.\n\nNow he is racing against the clock to persuade Israel and Hamas to agree to his proposed three-phase ceasefire deal to bring home remaining Israeli hostages and potentially pave the way for an end to the 10-month-old war in Gaza. At the same time, he is desperate to avoid tensions with Iran escalating into an all-out regional conflagration.\n\nBill Galston , a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: \"I would imagine that he is going to devote a lot of time and energy to the situation in the Middle East. He surely doesn't want history to record that the final months of his tenure witnessed the outbreak of the first comprehensive Middle East war in decades, a war that he, like others, has been struggling to avoid.\n\n\"I would think that it's going to be all hands on deck to try to contain the ripples of the Iranian attack when it comes, to try to prevent Israel and Hezbollah from moving from tit-for-tat to something much worse, and finally figure out a way of getting the Gaza ceasefire done.\"\n\nGoverning well might also be a more effective way of helping Harris than making speeches. Enthusiasm for the vice-president at rallies and online has already far exceeded anything that he could muster. Biden is not expected to feature prominently as a campaign surrogate for reasons of both style and substance.\n\nHis low approval rating, especially on issues such as immigration, inflation and Gaza, would saddle his deputy with unwanted baggage. Moreover, the gaffe-prone oldest president in American history would not be a natural fit for Harris's optimistic, future-focused campaign. Her running mate, Tim Walz, told her this week: \"Thank you for bringing back the joy .\"\n\nGalston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, added: \"She needs a chance to separate herself from him without breaking ranks with him and that will be easier if she draws a bright line between her candidacy and his presidency. I'm not saying that he should become invisible but I don't think he should be highly visible either, except in his presidential capacity.\"\n\nPast lame-duck presidents have used their waning days to seek one more big policy win. In 2000 Clinton launched negotiations between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian Authority leader, Yasser Arafat, at Camp David in one last - and ultimately doomed - effort at securing Middle East peace. In 2008 George W Bush signed into law a $700bn bailout of the financial services industry as the global crisis deepened.\n\nBut Biden may still be brooding over how a dismal debate performance in June destroyed his hopes of a second term. He is reportedly smarting over those who orchestrated the end of his 51-year political career and the even swifter embrace of Harris as his replacement. His first in-depth interview since the announcement will be broadcast on CBS News on Sunday.\n\nLarry Jacobs , director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \"I can imagine that there's a lot of frustration in Biden world because Biden would most definitely like to be rounding out his administration and pursuing his policies but the energy and the resources of the Democratic party are about winning the next election.\"\n\nJacobs added: \"If he is campaigning he becomes the subject of the Trump campaign for being frail and clueless. There's nothing good that Joe Biden can do. Also, Kamala Harris needs to clearly identify herself as a distinct and separate brand and she can't do that if Joe Biden is on the campaign trail.\"\n\nHowever, Biden is still sure to receive a rapturous welcome later this month in Chicago, where he is expected to give a prime-time address on the first night of the Democratic national convention before leaving the stage clear for Harris and Walz. The party will be eager to project unity and gratitude for his selfless act in passing the torch.\n\nDonna Brazile , a political strategist and former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: \"He has done more to get this country on the right track than any other president at least in modern history and it's up to him to decide when and where he will enter in the 2024 race.\n\n\"Look, he left the vice-president with millions in the bank, with hundreds of thousands of volunteers, over 400 campaign offices. I don't know how much more we want from Joe Biden but he has given the vice-president a head start and a very healthy start in this 90-day marathon.\""

      "text": "How History Might Remember Joe Biden's Presidency\n\nSenior National Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nMillions of new jobs, many in a flourishing new American manufacturing sector geared toward clean energy.\n\nHigher prices at the grocery store, but also more dollars in paychecks.\n\nA record low in the number of Americans without health insurance, plus a historic - if fleeting - reduction in child poverty.\n\nStronger international alliances, amid a bloody invasion of Ukraine and civilian catastrophe in the Middle East.\n\nThese are among the major developments tied to policy initiatives of Joe Biden's presidency - which, because of his decision not to seek reelection , will end one way or another by Jan. 20, 2025. By any reasonable standard, they add up to a tenure of enormous consequence.\n\nIn less than four years, policy choices from the Biden administration have changed literally millions of lives in the U.S. and around the world, and maybe altered the course of climate change as well. It's no exaggeration to say his record rivals that of any first-term president in the last half-century.\n\nStill, it's early to render definitive judgments on his policy legacy. Too much depends on seeing how his initiatives and decisions play out over time, what precise effects they have and, most immediately, whether his accomplishments even outlast his time in the White House.\n\nIf Donald Trump ends up winning in November, he'll surely have something to say about that.\n\nBiden's signature achievement is the Inflation Reduction Act, the sweeping legislation that passed Congress on a party-line vote and that the president signed in August 2022. The name is misleading: Its central component is a massive federal investment in clean energy that, projections suggest, could add up to more than $1 trillion by the time all the money is accounted for.\n\nTogether with a series of regulations that effectively reduce incentives to create carbon emissions, the law's investments have spurred a boom in factory-building and manufacturing . The proof of the impact is in the solar arrays and wind turbines popping up all across the Southwest and the Great Plains, along with the electric vehicle plants rising in the Midwest and across a new \"Battery Belt\" in the South. These projects mean employment, and represent a significant chunk of the estimated 15 million jobs that the U.S. has created during Biden's presidency.\n\nThe other big piece of the Inflation Reduction Act - and one that, in spirit, hews closer to the name of the legislation - is a series of measures designed to reduce the price of health care , including pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act allows the federal government to negotiate directly with manufacturers, imposes penalties for rapid price hikes, and imposes a $35 cap on insulin for seniors and people with disabilities. Most of the provisions affect only Medicare, and even then only some drugs. But the law gives the federal government authority that counterparts abroad have long had, and that U.S. lawmakers in the future can expand.\n\nYet another Inflation Reduction Act provision offers extra financial assistance for individuals buying insurance through the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. These new subsidies can reduce the cost of insurance by hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year. They are a big reason the proportion of Americans without insurance fell to 7.7% , the lowest level ever.\n\nThe other factor in bringing down the number of uninsured people was a temporary, pandemic-related prohibition on states reviewing and disenrolling people from Medicaid. That prohibition has ended, which means the uninsured rate is likely to creep up in the next year or two.\n\nThe poverty level among children has already come back up, following a record-setting decline that was tied to yet another pandemic measure - namely, a set of tax breaks and direct cash payments in the American Rescue Plan, a Democratic bill that Biden signed shortly after taking office.\n\nBiden and Democratic leaders had hoped to make some of those relief measures permanent. Their efforts to round up the votes fell just short. But the American Rescue Plan did what it was supposed to do: It buoyed the economy and sustained tens of millions of American households, at a time when COVID-19 and the reaction to it threatened to plunge the nation into a full-blown depression.\n\nAll policies have trade-offs, of course. The massive public expenditures behind those relief efforts likely contributed to inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in 2022 . People felt it viscerally when they bought food or clothing, put gas in their car, or tried to buy a house. But inflation was a worldwide phenomenon, tied to supply chain problems and other pandemic-related factors.\n\nInflation has since come back down, at least in the U.S., while wages are up and unemployment is hovering near 50-year lows. Analysts and leaders abroad have noticed, even if American voters haven't, and editors at The Economist have been marveling at \"America's astonishing economic record.\"\n\nBuilding an economy that can continue to thrive in the future has been a big focus of Biden's, and led to the enactment of two other major laws: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , which allocated more than $850 billion for everything from laying broadband lines to repairing dilapidated bridges, and the CHIPS and Science Act , which put nearly $300 billion into high-tech research and development. Both passed Congress with significant Republican votes, remarkable in itself given the polarization in U.S. politics.\n\nBiden didn't achieve any of this alone. He worked closely with congressional leaders, as presidents always do. He also had the benefit of a (mostly) united Democratic caucus that, though smaller in size than its Obama-era counterpart, had a more liberal orientation with far fewer conservative dissenters.\n\nThe dissenters still mattered, enough to kill what Biden had hoped would be another major achievement: historic investment in the care economy intended to raise wages of child care workers and home health aides, while making it easier for families to pay for those services.\n\nAn attempt to pass bipartisan immigration reforms failed as well, leaving the Biden administration without the tools to address a surge in border crossings that has put a major and ongoing strain on city and state governments responsible for the migrants.\n\nBut throughout his presidency, Biden used regulatory power to make incremental progress on long-sought goals he couldn't achieve through legislation - by hiking the minimum wage for federal workers, for example, or forgiving college debt for targeted populations.\n\nRegulatory changes are easier than laws for subsequent administrations to reverse, and they can run into successful legal challenges. That's especially true when lower courts heavily populated with Trump-appointed judges are applying principles handed down from a conservative Supreme Court majority hell-bent on scaling back federal regulatory authority.\n\nBut Biden has done what he could to provide some ideological balance by putting more than 200 judges on the federal bench, more or less matching Trump's rate for the same time span. That includes the appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who in 2022 became the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\nJackson is just 53 years old, which means she can keep writing opinions defending causes like reproductive rights for decades to come. And although today she's stuck putting most of those arguments into dissents with her two fellow liberal justices, she might be around long enough to see the court's majority evolve or change, so that it retreats from its decadeslong march to the right.\n\nThe other area where presidents have more authority to act on their own is foreign policy. And there, Biden has left some especially clear marks, though frequently in ways that were - and remain - controversial.\n\nHe pulled American forces out of Afghanistan for good, a goal his predecessors and (according to polls) the public supported, and evacuated some 70,000 Afghan allies in the process. But 13 U.S. service members and dozens of civilians died in a bombing during the chaotic withdrawal, which ultimately left behind tens of thousands of Afghan allies hoping to escape - and left the Taliban once again in charge of the country.\n\nMore recently, Biden has strongly backed Israel ever since Hamas militants attacked the country and massacred civilians on Oct. 7, 2023. Biden has pushed back only tepidly - and, by most accounts, ineffectively - against an Israeli response that has literally flattened much of Gaza, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving many more in dire, life-threatening humanitarian conditions.\n\nIn both instances, it's hard to know exactly what has happened, or what could have happened in alternative scenarios, given the factual ambiguities of armed conflict and the secretive nature of diplomacy. Biden's handiwork and its impact are clearer when it comes to NATO, which, appropriately enough, held its 75th anniversary summit in Washington just a few weeks ago.\n\nBiden led efforts to expand the alliance with the addition of Finland and Sweden, and to strengthen it by drawing larger financial and troop contributions from member states. In 2022, Biden organized international backing for Ukraine following Russia's invasion, providing diplomatic, financial and military support that are still propping up the country today.\n\nAmerica's support of Ukraine could be one of the first things to go in a second Trump presidency. Trump, whose affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin is no secret, has pledged to demand a cessation of hostilities under terms most analysts think would be highly favorable to the Russians. Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), who is now Trump's running mate, has led calls in Congress for stopping Ukraine aid.\n\nBut the list of Biden accomplishments that Trump could reverse doesn't stop there.\n\nTrump has said he wants to take away the big push for clean energy, vowing to end what he calls the \" electric vehicle mandate \" on \"day one.\" He has said he still wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, just like he tried so desperately to do in 2017, posting on his Truth Social platform that \"Obamacare sucks!\" and promising the same mythical replacement he always touts but never specifies . Even if Trump decides against another run at full repeal, he seems unlikely to support renewal of Biden's extra insurance subsidies, the funding for which runs out in 2025.\n\nIt's difficult to be certain exactly which of these priorities Trump might pursue or when, because he doesn't make concrete policy commitments or issue detailed policy papers in the traditional way. But credible guides to his behavior are out there.\n\nIn addition to documents like Project 2025 , the right-wing governing agenda his current and former aides have put together, there's the historical record from his last turn in office, when he signed legislation reopening the Arctic wildlife lands for drilling, undid new civil rights protections for the LGBTQ+ community, and reversed countless immigration directives.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

But a lot depends on how many of his achievements survive. That's why the best thing Biden may have done for his legacy is giving another, more capable Democrat a fighting chance to protect it.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Joe Biden Dropped Out Of The Presidential Race, And His Job Approval Is On The Rise\n\nSenior Political Reporter, HuffPost\n\nA funny thing happened on President Joe Biden's way to lame-duck status: He started getting more popular, or at least less unpopular.\n\nSince Biden reluctantly stepped aside from the presidential race in late July, his approval rating has steadily ticked up to levels of popularity he had not seen in more than a year, an apparent reflection of both the gratitude of voters who view his decision as selfless and also of a slew of positive economic news in recent weeks. The 81-year-old's improved standing could ultimately benefit his preferred successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, as she aims to defeat former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nDavid Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, said the 48% approval Biden reached in a poll he conducted for USA Today last week was the highest mark Suffolk had recorded during the Democrat's presidency. He suggested voters may now be taking a big-picture view of Biden's presidency rather than rating how they feel he's doing in office at this precise moment.\n\n\"He's taken himself out of [the election], he's entered legacy territory with some voters, they've seen he's passing the torch,\" Paleologos told HuffPost. \"So in that sense, it's not point in time job approval, it's more the totality of his administration over the last four years.\"\n\nPaleologos compared Biden to a retiring athlete getting a last round of applause from the hometown fans: \"You forget the bad games and you remember the time when the athlete performed to your liking or exceeded your expectations. It's the same kind of dynamic.\"\n\nTo be clear, Biden remains far from the nation's most adored politician. In the Suffolk poll, his disapproval rating is effectively tied with his approval rating at 49%. The polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight puts his average approval at 42.3% while his average disapproval is at 52.4%.\n\nBut that's a substantial improvement from July 22, the day after he dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Harris. Then, his approval was just 38.6% and his disapproval was 56.2%.\n\nBiden's net approval in FiveThirtyEight's average is now as high as it's been since May 14, 2023, only a few weeks after he announced he would run for reelection.\n\nBeyond Suffolk, polling from Quinnipiac University and Gallup has also found big increases in Biden's standing. In Quinnipiac's polls, he went from a net -18 approval in mid-July to -7 in a survey conducted last week . Gallup had him jumping from -22 net approval in July to -10 in August .\n\nLooking at the polls provides some indication of who Biden has won over. Both Quinnipiac and Suffolk show large increases in support from young voters, who were more supportive of Biden leaving the race than their older counterparts. In both polls, Democrats and independents also increased their support for Biden, though he was still underwater with the latter group.\n\nThe two polls split on Biden's performance among Black and Latino voters, two traditionally Democratic constituencies he had struggled with. While Suffolk showed some improvement, Quinnipiac showed little movement.\n\nPaleologos pointed to Biden's gains with independent women, who have tilted increasingly Democratic since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Biden went from 47% approval to 58% approval with the group in Suffolk's polling.\n\n\"There's a lot that goes into that: the overturn of Roe, handling the mantle over to a woman who is qualified,\" he said. \"That's the group of voters that prevented the red wave in 2022.\"\n\nInside the White House, Biden aides have attributed his gains in popularity to positive economic news over recent weeks, including low gas prices in the run-up to the Labor Day holiday; consumer confidence hitting a six-month high ; and what the Wall Street Journal called \"giddiness\" about the stock market.\n\n\"Inflation is falling while incomes are climbing, Medicare is negotiating lower drug costs, manufacturing is coming home from overseas, our infrastructure is being rebuilt, rich special interests are paying more of their fair share in taxes, violent crime is at a 50-year low, and unauthorized border crossings are lower than at the end of 2020,\" said White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates.\n\nBates continued: \"The American people are feeling those benefits firsthand and appreciate leadership that puts their bottom lines and their freedoms above everything else, as well as leadership that opposes the MAGAnomics tax increases on working people and radical abortion bans.\"\n\nBiden may also benefit from leaving the political spotlight, and with less media attention on his public appearances, which often reinforced voters' concerns about his age and mental acuity. One Biden ally speculated the elimination of political concerns about Biden's age has led the press corps to cover Biden in a more substantive way, benefiting the president.\n\nBiden's increased popularity could also help Harris down the stretch of the campaign. A key Trump strategy is to link Harris - who is now more popular than either Trump or Biden - to her unpopular boss since voters view Trump as stronger than Biden on major issues like the economy, inflation and securing the U.S.-Mexico border. (Trump's average net favorability on FiveThirtyEight was a smidge better than Biden's job approval at -9.5.)\n\n\"Kamala Harris is spending Labor Day campaigning with her partner-in-crime Joe Biden desperately trying to gaslight the American people,\" Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told news outlets after Biden and Harris' joint appearance on Monday. \"Meanwhile, this Labor Day the American people are working harder than ever to afford gas, groceries, and rent because Kamala Harris broke our economy and is proud of it.\"\n\nBiden's improving popularity could throw a wrench in those plans and also make him a more valuable, or at least less damaging, surrogate for Harris. After campaigning with Harris in Pittsburgh on Labor Day, the president is set to travel to both Wisconsin and Michigan this week.\n\nUltimately, his improving performance could turn out to be bittersweet for Biden, who unsuccessfully fought off voter concerns about his age and mental acuity for months before a disastrous debate performance in June. He then resisted efforts by his fellow Democrats to force him out of the presidential race. His allies had long argued his political standing would improve as the election drew closer.\n\n\"The new poll numbers show his presidency has been meaningful and full of accomplishments, and it is an unfortunate twist of fate that he got elected so late in life,\" Caitlin Legacki, a Democratic strategist who worked as a top aide to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, told HuffPost. \"These numbers clearly show that the earlier polling was much more a commentary on whether people thought he should run for a second term than whether they liked him or his agenda.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "My Father Has Been Unjustly Imprisoned Half My Life Because Of A Law Joe Biden Backed\n\nGuest Writer\n\nWhen I was little, my dad was my childhood hero. He made me feel like the world was conquerable. He was the guy who could fix anything and made every family vacation feel endless. He taught me to read and how to defeat fear on roller coaster rides. The warmth of his hugs brightened my worst day as a child.\n\nBut then, one day, everything changed.\n\nI was only 12 years old when my hero was taken from my world and sentenced to 22 years and 10 months in a federal prison for a nonviolent, victimless cannabis offense. My father, Ricardo Ashmeade , is one of the countless casualties of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that then-Sen. Joe Biden championed during the height of the so-called war on drugs. The bill's three-strike laws and mandatory minimums have disproportionately devastated many Black and Brown communities.\n\nThe first time I visited my dad in prison, I cried. I was 12 years old. He looked the same, but everything around us felt wrong. The room was cold, with distance between us, and guards made the visitation process difficult.\n\nAt first, we tried to visit as much as we could (once a year), but over time, the visits became less frequent because of the challenges involved. The prison was far from where I lived; travel took up an entire day. The cost of gas, food for the trip, and sometimes even hotel stays made it difficult for my family, especially when money was tight. There were stretches where I didn't see him for five years at a time.\n\nThe emotional toll was another factor. Seeing him in prison is not easy. There are strict dress codes, long waits, and the staff and environment itself felt cold and unwelcoming. I still leave visits feeling both grateful to see him and heartbroken that we couldn't just walk out together.\n\nI have spent more than half of my life without my father by my side; 16 and a half years, to be exact. My proudest moments were also a painful reminder of what was missing. Every milestone, like birthdays, school achievements and my sports games, and even everyday life felt incomplete without him. He missed my high school and college graduations. He most likely will miss my graduation from law school, which is a moment I had dreamed of sharing with him.\n\n\"Approximately 3,000 people, including my father, remain incarcerated for federal cannabis offenses.\"\n\nWhen my father was sentenced, I was too young to fully understand what his absence would mean for my family and me. His absence soon became the defining feature of my upbringing. Life became much harder for my family; my father's incarceration forced my family into financial hardship. My two-parent family structure was broken, putting a physical and emotional strain on my primary parent and my siblings. It impacted our housing and educational opportunities because we were constantly moving.\n\nIt also inspired me to take action. It was not just about the pain of losing a parent to the system as a kid, but it was about witnessing how the system treated my childhood hero and how powerless I felt. These years have shaped me profoundly, but they've also left scars I'm still working through.\n\nNow, as an adult, the effects are still there. My dad missed out on being a father, and I missed out on having one. It's a painful reality that shapes who I am and reminds me every day of how much was taken from both of us. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that incarceration doesn't just punish the person behind bars - it punishes everyone who loves them.\n\nToday, as I enter my final semester of law school, my father remains incarcerated, serving time in a system that has already begun to acknowledge its mistakes.\n\nIn 2016, California's Proposition 64 led to the expungement and reclassification of my father's felony cannabis offense as a misdemeanor. Despite this, the federal courts have denied him a rightful resentencing, even though they used this same California conviction to justify his lengthy sentence.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that while cannabis dispensaries profit legally, my father remains in a cell for actions now deemed acceptable under state law. While others now build wealth in the cannabis industry, families like mine are still paying the price for outdated and racially biased policies.\n\nPresident Biden has expressed regret over certain aspects of the bill in recent years. He has acknowledged that mandatory minimum sentences and mass incarceration had negative consequences for many communities. Our communities.\n\nHe can still right history on the war on drugs he once championed; all it takes is the stroke of a pen .\n\nIn October 2022, Biden issued historic pardons that were later expanded to impact 13,000 federal cannabis convictions, offering a moment of hope for families like mine. However, no one has been released from prison under those pardons. Only a commutation can achieve that. Approximately 3,000 people, including my father, remain incarcerated for federal cannabis offenses.\n\nAs I grew older and began to study law, the weight of this injustice became clearer and heavier. This drove me into cannabis advocacy. My advocacy is not just about changing laws but also about healing families torn apart, healing overpoliced communities, and healing the wounds of an unjust system that still hasn't been fully reckoned with.\n\nMy father is my best friend. My relationship with my father, even with him being in prison, is strong and deeply meaningful. Despite the physical distance and all the challenges that come with his incarceration, we've managed to stay close through phone calls, letters and the rare visits we've been able to have. He worked hard to make sure I felt his love and support, even from afar.\n\nWhen I walk across the stage at my graduation in a few months, my father should be free to stand by my side, not as a favor or privilege, but as a matter of justice. Public support for cannabis clemency is overwhelming, with 84% of voters favoring the release of individuals serving time for offenses that are now legal.\n\nPresident Biden has the power to make that happen. He has a unique opportunity now, as his term nears an end, to leave behind a legacy of justice by using his clemency power.\n\nIn a recent interview from prison, my father expressed his hope and pride in me as I received the Last Prisoner Project's (LPP) Cannabis Reform Hero Award . Yet the anguish of our separation loomed over our family like a shadow. He told me, \"I have watched you grow from a distance and want nothing more than to be there for you on your special day.\"\n\nI want my father to see me graduate. I want him to witness the culmination of the work I have dedicated my life to, righting the wrong that took him from me. I have used my voice as a poet and spoken word artist to tell this story, our story. But my words alone won't be enough to free my father.\n\nAs the clock ticks down on Biden's presidency, so does another moment in my life that my father will miss.

      "text": "Joe Biden Says He Fulfilled This 'Obligation' By Dropping Out\n\nBreaking News Reporter, HuffPost\n\nPresident Joe Biden said his decision to withdraw his 2024 candidacy stemmed from his \"obligation to the country\" to make sure Donald Trump doesn't return to the White House.\n\nIn his first interview since dropping out, broadcast Sunday, Biden said he believed talk about Democrats , including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , raising questions about his candidacy would become a \"real distraction\" if he stayed in the race.\n\n\"The polls we had showed that it was a neck-and-neck race, would have been down to the wire,\" Biden told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"But what happened was, a number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was gonna hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic. You'd be interviewing me about 'Why did Nancy Pelosi say ....' 'Why did so-and-so ....'\"\n\nThe president added that when he originally ran in 2020, he intended to be a one-term president and then pass on the torch to the next generation of Democrats.\n\n\"When I ran the first time, I thought of myself as being a transition president,\" he said. \"I can't even say how old I am; it's hard for me to get it outta my mouth. But things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen.\"\n\nUltimately, Biden said, he wanted to make sure former President Donald Trump, whom he described as a \"genuine danger to American security,\" loses in November.\n\n\"The critical issue for me still - it's not a joke - maintaining this democracy,\" he said. \"I thought it was important. Because, although it's a great honor being president, I think I have an obligation to the country to do what [is] the most important thing you can do, and that is, we must, we must, we must defeat Trump.\"\n\nFollowing his announcement in July that he would exit the race , Biden endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris to take over his White House bid. Democrats quickly coalesced around her, and her campaign has shown real signs of momentum. The latest New York Times-Sienna College polls released Saturday showed Harris leading Trump in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin among likely voters.\n\nBiden praised Harris and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as a \"hell of a team\" and said he would do everything in his power to help them get elected, including by campaigning in various states such as Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I talk to her frequently, and by the way, I've known her running mate is a great guy,\" Biden said. \"As we say, if we grew up in the same neighborhood, we'd have been friends. He's my kind of guy. He's real, he's smart.\"\n\nBiden also addressed his poor CNN debate performance, which contributed to his withdrawal, when asked to comment on the questions raised about his health and mental fitness.\n\n\"I had a really, really bad day in that debate because I was sick,\" Biden said. \"But I have no serious problem.\"\n\nBiden said he wants people to remember him as a president who proved American democracy can work and recognize the accomplishments of his administration.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Joe Biden Keeps Repeating His False Claim That He Saw Pictures of Beheaded Babies\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMany atrocities were committed during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7. Yet the president of the United States continues to repeat debunked falsehoods.\n\nOn October 11 , four days after the Hamas-led attacks in Israel, President Joe Biden addressed a group of Jewish community leaders in the Indian Treaty Room of the Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C. \"I've been doing this a long time,\" Biden said . \"I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.\"\n\nIt was a jarring statement. And it was false .\n\nBiden had seen no such pictures, nor received any such confirmation. He made those comments after Nicole Zedeck, a journalist for Israel's i24 News, reported that 40 babies had been decapitated, citing Israeli soldiers at the scene of the attacks at Kfar Aza. A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu subsequently stated that babies and toddlers had been found with their \"heads decapitated.\"\n\nThree hours later, Biden promoted the claim to the world and asserted he personally saw pictures of the horrifying scene, giving the story supreme legitimacy.\n\nHamas denied the allegation, and other Israeli journalists at the scene began reporting they had not seen evidence such beheadings had occurred nor had they been told it had happened by any of the Israeli soldiers they spoke with. Zedeck, the reporter from i24 News who was first to spread the allegation, later tweeted that \"soldiers told me they believe 40 babies/children were killed. The exact death toll is still unknown as the military continues to go house to house and find more Israeli casualties.\"\n\nAn anchor at the network defended the reporter and said that three separate Israel Defense Forces officials had told i24 News \"that around 40 babies & small children were murdered in Kfar Aza, some burned, some beheaded.\" CBS News and CNN also spread Israeli assertions that babies and toddlers had been decapitated.\n\nEventually, the Israeli government was forced to admit it had no evidence to support the claim , though it continued to imply that it might be true. A military spokesperson said that the IDF would not further investigate the beheading charges because it would be \"disrespectful for the dead.\"\n\nWhite House officials then \"clarified\" what they claimed Biden was actually referring to. \"U.S. officials and the president have not seen pictures or confirmed such reports independently,\" reported the Washington Post. \"The president based his comments about the alleged atrocities on the claims from Netanyahu's spokesman and media reports from Israel, according to the White House.\" The purpose of such graphic descriptions, according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, was \"to underscore the utter depravity and the barbaric nature with which these terrorists murdered and butchered innocent Israeli civilians.\" Kirby, who dodged direct questions about whether Biden had personally seen any photos, added, \"And that further underscores why - and this is what the President's specific point was yesterday - that we got to stay with Israel. We've got to continue to make sure they have the support that they need.\"\n\nBiden has never publicly retracted the incendiary claims. And the Washington Post reported that the president had been urged by staffers not to make that allegation in his speech on October 11, \"because those reports were unverified.\"\n\nDespite the Israeli government's comments, warnings about the veracity of the claims from his own advisers, and the extensively documented lists of people killed on October 7 during the Hamas raids, Biden has inexplicably and repeatedly doubled down on the claim that he saw pictures of decapitated babies.\n\nAt a November 16 press conference in Woodside, California, after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden first promoted another debunked charge , that Hamas had what amounted to its own version of a Pentagon under Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. \"Here's the situation: You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military hidden under a hospital. And that's a fact. That's what's happened,\" Biden said . He then declared, \"Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, to where they were cutting babies' heads off to burn - burning women and children alive.\"\n\nThe allegation that Hamas beheaded babies continues to spread across the internet and social media. In a post on Israel's official X account, readers were invited to \"Listen to the eyewitness accounts of the 8 burned babies and one beheaded baby which were butchered by Hamas terrorists on October 7th.\" It featured a video of Israeli Col. Golan Vach purporting to describe what he witnessed. On November 26, an Israeli journalist posted an interview with an IDF soldier who claimed that babies had been hung from clotheslines. The reporter later apologized to his readers and said the story was false. \"Why would an army officer invent such a horrifying story?\" he wrote. \"I was wrong.\"\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Biden, in addition to absorbing the most sensational claims made in Israeli media in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 attacks, was fed other unverified claims directly from Netanyahu, his close friend of many decades. Israel released a video of phone call between Netanyahu and Biden on October 11, the first time Biden publicly made the beheading claim. \"We were struck Saturday by an attack whose savagery I can say we have not seen since the Holocaust,\" Netanyahu told Biden. \"Since we last spoke, the extent of this evil, it's only gotten worse. They took dozens of children, bound them up, burned them, and executed them.\" He added, \"They're even worse than ISIS and we need to treat them as such.\" Significantly, Netanyahu does not appear to have alleged that Hamas beheaded babies, though he did claim that soldiers were decapitated. In an appearance with Biden on October 18 in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu made no mention of babies being beheaded. \"They beheaded soldiers,\" he said . Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was shown extensive graphic images of the aftermath of the attacks during a visit to Israel, also did not mention any beheaded babies.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThere is no doubt that widespread atrocities and war crimes were committed during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 and that children were killed. Yet in many narratives, the burned or beheaded babies story still forms one of the most harrowing details of the October 7 massacres. According to major Israeli media outlets that have worked diligently to identify all of the victims of the October 7 attacks, there was one infant killed that day: a 9-month-old named Mila Cohen who was shot dead at Kibbutz Be'eri as her mother held her in her arms. Cohen's mom, who was shot in the arm, survived.\n\nNone of these facts have altered Biden's commitment to making the debunked beheading claim a key detail in his impassioned defense of the legitimacy of Israel's mass killing campaign , during which more than 18,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 7,000 children. On December 12, at a reelection campaign event at the Salamander hotel in Washington, D.C., Biden said , \"I saw some of the photographs when I was there - tying a mother and her daughter together on a rope and then pouring kerosene on them and then burning them, beheading infants, doing things that are just inhuman - totally, completely inhuman.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nBiden is the president of the most powerful nation on Earth, not a random poster on social media. He supposedly has access to the best intelligence in the world. If he actually has evidence to support this beheading claim - apparently evidence that his closest advisers have not seen - then he should produce it.\n\nThis allegation is one of the most gut-wrenching and horrifying charges to be made about the events of October 7. It is not some insignificant detail that can be explained away by Biden's age or his tendency to exaggerate or stumble into gaffes. It was a detail that fueled the rage and quest for revenge, and was cited when Biden declared that Israel is fighting subhumans in Gaza. \"They're animals. They're animals,\" Biden said on December 12 when he repeated the beheading claims. \"They exceeded anything that any other terrorist group has done of late that I - in memory.\"\n\nThe verified facts, as we currently understand them, are horrifying enough. So why does Biden feel the need to bolster his defense of Israel's indiscriminate war against Gaza by spreading debunked allegations? The latest estimations of the death toll on October 7 are as follows: Israel has officially identified approximately 1,200 Israelis or Israeli residents killed. Of these, 274 were soldiers, 764 were civilians, 57 were Israeli police, and 38 were local security guards. Among the civilians killed, in addition to 9-month-old Mila Cohen, 12 of them were between the ages of 1 and 9 years, and 36 were between the ages of 10 and 19. There are reportedly still bodies that have not been officially identified.\n\nIt also must be noted that multiple Israeli media outlets have reported on \"friendly fire\" incidents in which Israeli military forces responding to the attacks killed Israeli citizens, though there has been no definitive calculation of the number of such deaths and may never be one.\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Haaretz has done extensive work trying to confirm the actual events of October 7 and published an important story debunking some of the most shocking false claims made in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks. Biden should read it.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Joe Biden's Cruel Border Shutdown Follows in Clinton and Obama's Footsteps Too\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe draconian restrictions on asylum-seekers owe a lot to Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, but the path was paved by Democrats.\n\n\"President Joe Biden is pulling from former President Donald Trump's immigration playbook,\" CNN reported on Tuesday. The occasion was Biden's announcement this week of a draconian executive order to temporarily shut down asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border and introduce other drastic restrictions on the basic right to asylum.\n\nCNN was not alone. Numerous commentators, particularly critics of Biden's plan, noted that the decision to halt the asylum process reflects an extremity of border authoritarianism worthy of Trump. \"This action takes the same approach as the Trump administration's asylum ban,\" the American Civil Liberties Union said on X, vowing to go to court.\n\nThere's much truth to it. Biden's border policies have been no less than Trumpian . This is especially true of his use of executive authority to harden border rule, as Trump had done with his 2017 Muslim ban and his own extremist asylum restrictions in 2018.\n\nYet Biden's new asylum restrictions, the details of which were announced on Tuesday, are neither an aberration from his administration's border policies, nor are they a shift away from decades-long Democratic Party standards, since at least the Clinton era.\n\nThis is not to underplay the extremity of Biden's new plan. Under Biden's executive order, the administration will halt asylum requests at the border once the average number of daily encounters has reached 2,500 between legal ports of entry, which has been consistently the case since Biden took office in 2021. Requests will be reopened two weeks after the daily average falls under 1,500 for seven consecutive days. The restrictions went into effect last night.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe order has some exemptions in place for unaccompanied minors, for those with acute medical emergencies, for \"severe\" trafficking victims, and for people who have already made appointments on the Customs and Border Protection app , a burdensome process that can take many months.\n\nThose who can immediately show \"reasonable probability\" of imminent and extreme threat to life or safety, such as grave persecution, rape, kidnapping, torture, or murder are exempt - although the Department of Homeland Security noted that the plan demands a \"new, substantially higher standard\" that there is a \"reasonable probability.\" This standard is higher even than under Trump's harsh 2018 asylum ban.\n\nMigrants who are expelled under the order will receive a minimum five-year bar on reentry to the U.S. and potentially be criminally prosecuted.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., summed it up well: \"This will be one of the most restrictive border policies in modern history.\"\n\nWhile it is true that Biden is bending to Republican pressure over the so-called border crisis - quite literally relying on Trump-era legislation - border fascism has for decades been a bipartisan commitment.\n\nThe convergence between conservative and far-right border politics, with the far right consistently winning the day, can in part be blamed on spineless realpolitik: A February Gallup poll found that 28 percent of Americans believed immigration to be the most important problem facing the U.S.\n\nBetter for a presidential campaign, the logic goes, to lean into the pernicious, anti-migrant crisis narrative.\n\nIt matters little that public sentiment might be affected by years of right-wing fearmongering, to which the Democratic establishment has readily acquiesced, alongside punishing austerity budgets that leave citizens fearful of stretched resources. Democrats and Republicans are fighting to the bottom on immigration - a fight that vocal white nationalist Republicans will always win.\n\nThis is not, however, merely a case of self-identifying centrist Democrats following the evermore fascistic Republican line.\n\n\"I think it's so important to understand how immigration enforcement has been a pillar of the Democratic party's governance for three decades,\" activist and scholar of border imperialism Harsha Walia told Intercepted podcast in February 2021, when it was already becoming clear that Biden's tenure would hardly see the undoing of the border regime.\n\nWalia noted that it was under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - not only Trump - that \"an entire immigration enforcement apparatus\" was established to increase criminalization, detention, deportation, and militarization . It was, Walia said, \"the very bipartisan agenda of detaining and deporting and terrorizing migrant communities.\"\n\nThese structures, she added, were built up and normalized in the Clinton years.\n\nIn 1994, at the very same time that Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Army Corps of Engineers began to fence the U.S.-Mexico border. The neoliberal trade deal further immiserated Mexico's poorest, producing displacement and migration; the U.S militarized the border in preparation. Clinton's 1996 immigration laws significantly expanded the United States' ability to detain and deport migrants with even minor criminal convictions.\n\nAnd Obama relied on the pernicious, racist, classist narrative of only targeting \"dangerous\" criminal migrants. Rightly dubbed the \"deporter-in-chief,\" Obama deported some 3 million people.\n\nThis is a Democratic legacy: hardened borders, the criminalization of migration, the willingness to condemn thousands of people to death through deterrence. This is the necropolitical management of migrants fleeing political and economic turmoil often as the result of decades of ruinous U.S. interventions in Central America.\n\nWhile Trump set the bar of anti-immigrant politics at a subterranean low and promises an agenda of unvarnished fascism should he be reelected, the brutal and increasingly eliminationist exclusion of migrants is a bipartisan project.\n\nBiden's executive order is itself no shift from his only policy record. A war on immigrants is the norm under this administration, from the expedited expulsion of thousands of Haitians in 2021; to his blanket policy in early 2023 to immediately eject asylum-seekers from Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua who cross the border from Mexico without having previously applied for asylum in a third country; to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's increased use of solitary confinement for thousands of detained migrants.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe idea of Democrats as the pro-immigrant party nonetheless persists as a convenient myth on both sides of the aisle. Democrats condemn the intolerable cruelty of Republican nativism, and Republicans, meanwhile, decry Democrats as open-border radicals, regardless of the anti-immigrant continuities between the two party's policies. Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's family separation policy , predictably slammed Biden's authoritarian executive order as somehow \"pro-invasion, pro-illegal migration executive order.\"\n\nThe difference is more one of rhetoric than substance. \"I'll never refer to immigrants as poisoning the blood of a country,\" Biden said on Tuesday. But policies that swiftly reject, eject, cage, and punish desperate migrants attempting to find safety and stability in one of the world's wealthiest nations send the same nationalist message.\n\nDemocrats couch their border logics in the neoliberal language of management and order , rather than explicitly racist \"America First\" slogans. The maintenance of the border - a racist tool that serves capital and divides labor - has the same disastrous, deadly effects no matter what rhetoric justifies it.\n\nAs the American Civil Liberties Union noted of Biden's executive order, it \"will severely restrict people's legal right to seek asylum, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk.\"\n\nWAIT!

With just weeks until President-elect Donald Trump begins his second administration, the letter is a plea for President Joe Biden to \"take simple and immediate action to drastically mitigate the humanitarian crisis.\"\n\n\"You are running out of time to do the right thing, but decisive action could save precious lives in the next two months,\" reads the letter . Twenty \"current, full-time employees of the White House,\" who were not named for fear of professional retaliation, drafted the letter.\n\nThe Intercept spoke with two senior White House staffers who helped draft the letter, which was directed to Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a variety of senior policy advisers.\n\n\"I'm thinking a lot about the concept of legacy and ending well,\" said one of the staffers. \"I personally want to be seen as someone who keeps my commitments and want to be part of an administration that keeps its commitments too.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

But as the 30-day deadline approached, aid groups reported that on average, just 42 trucks were crossing into Gaza per day and sometimes as few as six trucks.\n\n\"If government attorneys believe these statutes are not being violated, the public and the executive branch staff deserve a written explanation of their reasoning.\"\n\nThe White House staffers' letter emphasizes that U.S. law, specifically the Foreign Assistance Act , \"requires cessation of security assistance to foreign governments who impede U.S. humanitarian aid.\"\n\nBut after the 30-day deadline passed without meaningful improvement in the flow of aid, the Biden administration declined to make a finding that the Israeli government was in violation of its legal obligations, with little explanation for its reasoning.\n\n\"If government attorneys believe these statutes are not being violated, the public and the executive branch staff deserve a written explanation of their reasoning,\" reads one of the demands in the White House staffers' letter.\n\nIt also calls on White House leaders to stop the flow of weapons and to pressure Israel \"to halt military operations in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon and enact an immediate, comprehensive, and permanent ceasefire.\"\n\n\"I felt like I needed to do something,\" another staffer told The Intercept, \"as an act of trying to get to the straw that breaks the camel's back - even if this isn't it.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Joe Biden's Terrible Israel Policy Is Really About Getting in Bed With Saudi Arabia\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden's plan to cozy up to Arab dictators is right out of Donald Trump's playbook - but even worse.\n\nWhy does Joe Biden insist on pursuing a foreign policy of blind support of Israel's war on Gaza? In addition to the moral calamity - on full display as Israel bombed Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza - it has also exacted a political cost, damaging his relationship with his base and swing state voters. Critics have attributed Biden's disastrous handling of the war to incompetence or his lifelong Zionism.\n\nWhat is really at the center of the administration's policy, however, is an insidious geopolitical play that will make the world a more dangerous place, advancing U.S. imperial interests under the guise of a diplomatic deal.\n\nBiden wants to tie the U.S. to one of the most abhorrent regimes in the world for decades to come, striking a far-reaching security deal with Saudi Arabia - an agreement that would put American lives on the line to protect the Saudi dictatorship and lock us into a new cold war.\n\nAnd Biden's big plan for peace in the Middle East is straight out of Donald Trump's playbook.\n\nAfter going all-in on Israel's genocidal campaign, the Biden administration is doing everything it can to ram through the Saudi deal, hoping that solving the Gaza crisis can score a win heading into the election.\n\nAs part of the deal, the U.S. would commit to militarily defending Saudi Arabia, a repressive dictatorship that has been a destructive force in the region for years.\n\nBiden's team has long considered a deal with Saudi Arabia to be a cornerstone of Washington's broader Middle East strategy. The pact would build directly on the Trump administration's Abraham Accords - a set of Israeli normalization agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain - but offer something those deals didn't: the security guarantee.\n\nLast year, U.S. officials were on the verge of finalizing an agreement when the surprise October 7 attack by Hamas, and Israel's response, changed everything. Since then, the U.S. has remained committed to supporting Israel's regime change war, providing generous military assistance and unconditional political and diplomatic support.\n\nThis month, reports said talks were on the cusp of a breakthrough. If an agreement isn't stopped, it will cement a hostile approach to Iran and further embolden dictators like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. And it's no secret that Biden's push for a Saudi deal is largely about escalating its proxy war against Iran and \"great power competition\" with China.\n\nWith the election closing in, few influential Democrats are willing to intervene when Biden is so desperate for a win in the region. Fewer still will say what everyone knows about the Saudi pact: It's just a bad deal.\n\nThe push to place American military might between Saudi Arabia and its enemies is a stark reversal. When he ran for president, Biden vowed to make the country a \" pariah \" for its rights violations and halt weapons sales.\n\nInstead, the defense pact with Saudi Arabia would mean sacrificing American blood and treasure to protect a government best known in recent years for its assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its brutal war in Yemen.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nThe exact details of the agreement haven't been made public, but Daniel Mouton, formerly a senior adviser to Biden's top Middle East aide Brett McGurk, outlined the broad strokes of the plan just a month after the October 7 attacks:\n\n\"Long-term security in the Middle East will start with the ability to maintain an enduring regional deterrent order against Iran and its proxies,\" he wrote, laying out a sweeping vision of coordinated maneuvering against Iran, China, and Russia, as well as a push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"This progress will in turn allow for Israel to normalize its relationship with Saudi Arabia and more comprehensively integrate itself into the region,\" Mouton wrote, alluding to the ability to \"fully unlock US arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe specifics reportedly on the table for a Saudi deal would harden the adversarial relationships with Washington and rivals like Iran and China, while softening Israel's isolation even as it loses international legitimacy with the Gaza war.\n\nIn addition to the security guarantee, the U.S. is reportedly considering supporting a Saudi civil nuclear program and offering access to advanced U.S. weapons that were previously off-limits.\n\nFor its part, Saudi Arabia would vow to restrict Chinese investment and move away from Chinese technology, the efficacy of which has been questioned by analysts who fear that the kingdom could turn around and use an inked deal to extract more from the U.S.\n\nThen there is the coup de grâce: normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. It might, however, be the most elusive part of the deal - and not because of Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia has indicated that it's preparing to normalize relations with Israel in return for the creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state, with the crown prince ramping up arrests of those criticizing Israel online.\n\nIsrael, though, is widely considered the remaining obstacle to the trilateral agreement.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flat-out opposes the creation of a Palestinian state and, what's worse, is escalating tensions in the region with his all-out offensive against Gaza.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn response, top Democrats recently began to publicly criticize Netanyahu, in hopes that if Netanyahu can be pushed out, a more moderate Israeli leader would simply take the deal. When Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., took to the Senate floor to attack Netanyahu, mainstream media outlets declared the speech a \"turning point\" in the U.S.-Israel relationship.\n\nThe Biden administration, though, is making lemonade, seeing an opportunity for Israeli-Saudi diplomacy even in the ruins of the Gaza war. According to HuffPost , McGurk, the top Biden aide, is reportedly seeking to have Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf countries build on the rubble of Gaza to ease the pain of normalization.\n\nSo far, with Israeli intransigence, the American body politic has not had to fully confront a deal. However, Democrats, Republicans , and mainstream media outlets are already hyping the potential agreement as a diplomatic triumph that could achieve peace in the region.\n\nThey should be up in arms.\n\nEven MAGA Republicans have reason to oppose a Saudi deal: It goes even further than their president's deals in sacrificing U.S. interests. Trump's Abraham Accords between UAE, Bahrain, and Israel may have shored up those monarchies' dictatorship, but they did not so overtly subsume U.S. security to a foreign country's interests.\n\nUnder Biden, the Saudi regime would be getting a security commitment along with a bunch of other rewards, and Israel would gain legitimacy with its neighbors, while the American people would see no clear benefit in return.\n\nWAIT!

Yes.\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"Are the airstrikes in Yemen working?\" It was a simple question, delivered directly to President Joe Biden this afternoon.\n\nThis article was originally published as a newsletter from Ryan Grim. Sign up to get the next one in your inbox.\n\n\"Are the airstrikes in Yemen working?\"\n\nIt was a simple question, delivered directly to President Joe Biden this afternoon. The president delivered a response that ought to be the epitaph for the period of non-Pax Americana we've been living through since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"Well, when you say, 'working' - are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they gonna continue? Yes.\"\n\nBiden wasn't lying. On Thursday, the U.S. led another round of airstrikes in Yemen. \"U.S. Central Command forces conducted strikes on two Houthi anti-ship missiles that were aimed into the Southern Red Sea and were prepared to launch,\" CENTCOM posted on X.\n\nDoubling down on things that haven't worked, the Biden administration also announced new sanctions on the Houthis, the de facto government in Yemen, along with a new \"specially designated global terrorist\" label, which makes it difficult for the Houthis to engage in global transactions.\n\nThe designation badly undermines the Saudi-Yemen peace talks and threatens to exacerbate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen. It also doesn't make sense: Yemen has been bombed and sanctioned on and off for years, through three presidencies and counting, and the only result has been famine and disease, not a more pliant posture toward the United States or its allies in the region.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn fact, the Houthis emerged from the conflict stronger than before, a point highlighted by Ben Rhodes recently. The Houthis have not been stellar when it comes to governing, to say the least, and getting into another conflict with the United States lets them off the hook for that and boosts their popularity both domestically and in the region.\n\nThere's zero reason to think these sanctions or these airstrikes will get them to stop their blockade of shipping. It's amazing to see Biden admit it. \"Glad POTUS agrees with me that the strikes are not working. Next time come to Congress instead of McGurk,\" Rep. Ro Khanna said on X, referring to Brett McGurk, the Mideast envoy who has overseen this catastrophe yet has somehow still retained his job.\n\nThe way the sanctions are being rolled out has its own story behind it. I joined a background briefing the State Department hosted on the new sanctions, and the transcript is now available. I wanted to highlight one part. From a senior administration official: \"This [terror] destination will take effect 30 days from now to allow us to ensure robust humanitarian carveouts are in place so our action targets the Houthis and not the people of Yemen. We are rolling out, as we take this action, unprecedented carveouts and licenses to help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni people. The people of Yemen should not pay for the price - pay the price for the actions of the Houthis.\"\n\nThe State Department has always insisted, against all evidence and common sense, that U.S. sanctions do not harm civilian populations. Yet here is the State Department saying it is adding \"unprecedented carveouts\" to mitigate the harm of these sanctions to regular people. They said they'll monitor how effectively they immunize people from harm and reevaluate down the road. But think about what an admission that is: Why are these \"unprecedented carveouts\" needed if typical sanctions don't actually harm civilians?\n\nRegular Updates on News and Politics\n\nThat the State Department is waiting 30 days to implement the sanctions is also noteworthy. The Houthis have said they will cease all attacks on shipping if Israel ceases its attack on Gaza. The U.S., too, has said it wants the Israeli attack on Gaza to wind down. But this 30-day delay suggests the U.S. is not at all confident this attack is winding down anytime soon. In fact, the bombing as described by people inside Gaza seems only to be getting fiercer, with disease and starvation spreading, driven by the Israeli refusal to allow in sufficient aid.\n\nTomorrow's episode of Deconstructed is on the rupture inside progressive communities in general post-October 7, and American Jewish communities in particular. It's a rich conversation with Simone Zimmerman, a former Zionist activist who now leads the Jewish American peace group IfNotNow, and the co-directors of the fascinating new documentary \"Israelism.\"\n\nIf you're not subscribed to Deconstructed, you can get it on iTunes or wherever else you listen to podcasts.\n\nThe Ukrainian military is experimenting with ibogaine, a psychedelic drug banned in the U.S. but often used to treat opioid use disorder elsewhere, to treat traumatic brain injury, and promote battle readiness.\n\nTo do so, it is partnering with a founder of the Yippie movement, Irvin Dana Beal, a longtime ibogaine advocate. Beal recently traveled to Ukraine to help launch the project. Oleksii Skyrtach, a Ukrainian military psychologist attached to the 57th Motor Infantry Brigade, provided Beal with a letter for immigration authorities to help him move through customs with the drug.\n\nIbogaine's most famous American patient may well be Hunter Biden, who has battled his own drug addiction with help from ibogaine treatment at a Mexican clinic . At low doses, Beal and researchers behind the project believe ibogaine can have salutary effects on traumatic brain injury as well as help with battle readiness. \"These guys need something for traumatic brain injury,\" Beal said. \"But nobody else is willing to fucking go into a war zone with ibogaine but me, apparently.\"\n\nSkyrtach agreed. \"We really need as much ibogaine as possible,\" he said. \"Even if the war ends now we'll have too many 'rambos' to come back home from the frontline. It'll be much more serious problem [than the] USA faced when thousands of veterans came home from the Vietnam war.\"\n\nMy full story on this fascinating new project is up at The Intercept .\n\nEarlier this week, I was unable to get in touch with Beal to fact-check a few final details for the article, though we figured out another route to get that done. After the story was published, I learned why he had gone dark: He was arrested in Idaho for marijuana trafficking. He has been working with the state of New York to open up a pot shop, and it's legal in lots of states - but definitely not in Idaho. The 77-year-old is facing serious charges .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Biden Is No Hero for Stepping Aside\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPresident Joe Biden doesn't deserve praise for dropping his reelection campaign. He deserves blame for getting us into this mess.\n\n\"An actual hero,\" wrote New York Times columnist and podcaster Ezra Klein of President Joe Biden on X, within 30 minutes of the president's announcement Sunday that he was - finally - ending his run for a second term. \"This is what America First looks like when it's a lived ethos, rather than a mask for narcissism and ambition,\" added Klein.\n\nKlein was hardly the only notable liberal to rush to hagiography for the president.\n\n\"In a world increasingly filled with leaders who have changed laws, killed people, and stormed parliaments to cling to power, Joe Biden just flipped the script,\" wrote former Obama adviser and \"Pod Save the World\" host Ben Rhodes.\n\n\"Mr. Biden has spent a lifetime trying to do right by the nation, and he did so in the most epic of ways when he chose to end his campaign for re-election,\" wrote historian Jon Meacham in the New York Times on Monday.\n\nIt is rare to see political leaders willingly leave the stage of power. This is a problem with the nature of political power and the individuals to which it appeals. It is no reason, however, to treat Biden's choice as one of radical sacrifice for the public good. The alternative would be disastrous: 81-year-old Biden continuing in stubborn refusal, a mumbling and resentful King Lear figure, demanding fealty while unable to recall the names of his senior Cabinet (he called Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin simply \"a Black man\" in an interview last week), among other embarrassments.\n\nReluctantly stepping down in the face of an evermore likely election loss is no more than reasonable. Commentators pretending this is primarily the story of a great leader felled by the eternal forces of time and mortality ignore central reasons for Biden's unpopularity with young people and in key swing states like Michigan - above all his unconditional support for Israel's genocidal war, which should forever mar his legacy .\n\nIf the Biden hagiographers agree on the grave risk of a second Trump presidency, and also agree that Biden is right to step away from the race, then the president's decision should indeed occasion relief. Yet Biden's weeks of intransigence and hubris, truncating the time for the Democrats to recalibrate behind a new candidate against Donald Trump, should at least temper current praise for the president.\n\nIn a letter written just two weeks ago defending his candidacy to congressional Democrats, Biden wrote, \"We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively. I received over 14 million votes, 87% of the votes cast across the entire nominating process. ... This was a process open to anyone who wanted to run.\" The idea that Biden succeeded in anything like an open primary is laughable: The Democratic National Committee treated Biden's nomination as a fait accompli despite polls dating back over a year indicating that Democratic voters would prefer another candidate. The entire party machine bears responsibility for treating our current gerontocracy as the only possible option for so long.\n\n\"Biden was forced to step out of the race by his waning physical and mental dexterity, rather than by any policy failure,\" reported the Financial Times. While it's technically true that it was Biden's abysmal debate performance and ongoing public gaffes that forced powerful allies like former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to urge him to step back, it was not his age and diminished acuity that meant Biden lost support in crucial swing states among young people and thousands of Muslim, and Arab voters, among others.\n\nBiden's strongest presidential achievements - the historic (if insufficient) Inflation Reduction Act climate legislation; the American Rescue Plan pandemic stimulus package; a significant pro-labor record - must be built upon, pushing the Democratic Party further to the left. Biden's successes do not, however, erase a darker inventory.\n\nTaking office mere months after nationwide uprisings against the U.S. racist policing system , Biden - who speaks proudly of his Senate past working with segregationists - opted to fuel further funding into police departments, while repressing Black-led protest movements. Willing to sacrifice the lives and well-being of millions more vulnerable people at the altar of capital and political point-scoring, Biden declared the Covid-19 pandemic \"over\" in only its second year.\n\nThe president has overseen a brutal hardening of borders , including a draconian executive order last month to temporarily shut down asylum requests at the U.S.-Mexico border. And, most damning at all, he has shown unforgivable, unwavering support for Israel's genocide, while demonizing those who protest in support of Palestinian lives and freedoms.\n\nOrganizers with the Uncommitted movement - a non-negligible protest-voter bloc that pledges to vote \"uncommitted\" in order to push the Democrats to end support for Israel's onslaught - have stressed that their position applies to any Democratic nominee.\n\n\"I think it would be a big mistake for the Democratic Party to switch gears but stay the course on this particular issue that has galvanized so many people in an unprecedented way in the primaries and who continue showing up and trying to advocate to be heard in a system that is continuing, they feel, to ignore them,\" Halah Ahmad, a policy analyst and spokesperson with Listen to Wisconsin, the state's \"uninstructed\" campaign , told The Intercept earlier this month .\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAs Biden's vice president and near-certain successor as presidential nominee, Kamala Harris is stained by this administration's intolerable support for Israel's horrors, alongside other condemnable choices - like shuttering the southern border to asylum-seekers. If Harris simply continues in Biden's footsteps, as an avatar for unchanged Biden policy in a younger body, this would be both a gross moral failure and an electoral misstep.\n\nHarris should, as her meme-worthy comment dictates, attempt to be \"unburdened by what has been\" but attuned to this fraught context into which she did simply not fall, coconut-like. Instead of penning paeans to Biden, the focus must be pushing Harris - and the entire Democratic leadership - to alter course. The left would be naive to invest significant hope in Harris, the former prosecutor , beyond the urgency of beating Trump. Biden's departure from the race, though, is an opening to push for nonnegotiable voter demands. A crucial place to start: Call for immediate ceasefire and an end to U.S. funding and arming of Israel's war.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Introduction: Joe Biden's Long War\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe new president's paper trail reveals a man who has often betrayed his own bedrock principles.\n\nVideo: Empire Politician by Jeremy Scahill and Paul Abowd\n\n\"I'm not going to change,\" Joe Biden said in his 2008 vice presidential debate with Sarah Palin. \"I have 35 years in public office. People can judge who I am. I haven't changed in that time.\"\n\nNever in U.S. history has the country had a president with the voluminous paper trail that followed Biden into the White House. Since the Vietnam War, Biden has been in public office for all but four of the past 49 years. He has cast thousands of votes, sponsored or co-sponsored hundreds of bills, and taken public positions on virtually every possible foreign and domestic policy issue. He has served long enough to make it possible to chart, in great detail, the evolution of his positions on a range of issues, to analyze his contradictions, and to draw conclusions about how he sees the role of Congress and the executive branch on the most sensitive and consequential decisions made by the government: decisions about war and organized state violence.\n\nThe Intercept conducted an exhaustive analysis of Biden's political career, with a focus on his positions on dozens of U.S. wars and military campaigns, CIA covert actions, and abuses of power; his views on whistleblowers and leakers; and his shifting stance on the often contentious relationship between the executive and legislative branches over war powers. While many of Biden's positions could be assessed by reviewing his sprawling voting record and public statements, evaluating some of his actions, particularly from the first few decades of his career, required poring over copies of the congressional record, speech transcripts, archival media reports, and declassified government documents, including from the CIA.\n\nThe picture that emerges is of a man who is dedicated to the U.S. as an empire, who believes that preserving U.S. national interests and \"prestige\" on the global stage outweighs considerations of morality or even at times the deaths of innocent people. It also reveals a politician who consistently claims to hold bedrock principles but who often strays from those positions in support of a partisan agenda or because he wants a policy adopted regardless of the hypocrisy or contradictions. Nowhere is this dynamic more pronounced than on U.S. wars.\n\nWhile Biden seldom objects to U.S. military action on moral grounds, he has a long track record of confronting executive power grabs and efforts to usurp congressional authorities. Throughout his time in public office, he frequently intervened in debates over impending wars in an effort to impose constraints on the CIA, the military, and the White House, including, on occasion, when he was vice president. There are also several episodes from Biden's career in which his objections to policy proposals failed to gain traction and he nonetheless supported those wars or operations once they commenced. On a handful of occasions, Biden has publicly retracted his initial opposition to wars or CIA operations, particularly when he perceives them as having been successful or in U.S. interests.\n\nBiden stands out as one of the most passionate legislative defenders of congressional war powers in modern history, beginning with his co-sponsorship of the War Powers Act in 1973, his first year in the Senate. It was this issue - and what Biden denounced as President George H.W. Bush's \"monarchist\" disdain for congressional authorities - that led him to oppose the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq. Soon after Bush declared victory in the Gulf, Biden determined that his opposition was a political mistake and began a transformation into a top hawk on Iraq. The shift would lead to transgressions of his early principles; Biden's career is riddled with moments in which he supported military operations conducted in explicit violation of the War Powers Act, even as he continued to insist that the law mattered. In some cases, he would put up a fight in the runup to U.S. military action in an effort to pressure a president to abide by the law, while in others, he would gently suggest that following the law would be wise but not necessary. Whichever strategy he chose on particular military actions, under both Democrats and Republicans, the end result has been the same: Biden has lent his support to the majority of U.S. wars.\n\nWhile Biden has seldom expressed concerns about the consequences of U.S. wars on non-American civilians, he often questions whether the potential human costs of the deployment of U.S. ground troops are worth the objectives. His late son Beau's service, particularly his 2008 deployment to Iraq, has clearly weighed on Biden's mind as he has articulated a rationale for various foreign interventions. \"I don't want him going,\" Biden said in 2007, after he learned that his son's unit would be sent to Iraq. \"I don't want him going, but I tell you what - I don't want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years, and so how we leave [Iraq] makes a big difference.\"\n\nAs the consummate insider of the foreign policy establishment, Biden has been inclined to tinker around the edges, offering caveats and constraints, rather than directly confronting and opposing the drumbeat for war - an approach that ultimately smoothed the path for wars to happen. Even in cases in which he passionately opposed U.S. military or CIA action, such as in President Ronald Reagan's 1980s campaigns to aid the Contra death squads in Nicaragua and the right-wing military junta in El Salvador , Biden sought ways to tweak U.S. policy in return for his political or legislative support. In the case of the Contras, Biden offered to back Reagan's support of the death squads with an agreement on what \"the Contras could and couldn't do with the money.\" It is a pattern that hearkens back to Biden's opposition to the war in Vietnam; his criticisms centered around denouncing strategic mistakes or foolish decision-making. He did not take that position based on the principles or moral values cited by anti-war protesters, whom Biden decried as \"assholes.\"\n\nSen. Joe Biden, D-Del., introducing the report of an 18-month investigation conducted by his Senate Intelligence subcommittee, says the group reported \"a major failure\" by the government over the years to prosecute serious criminal leaks of sensitive information.\n\nBiden entered the Senate at a crucial moment in modern U.S. history. President Richard Nixon would soon be forced to resign under threat of impeachment and removal. The CIA's abuses, assassinations, and coups, among other scandals, had resulted in a number of congressional investigations, public hearings, and the first real efforts by Congress to impose any sort of limitations or restrictions on the agency's activities.\n\nIn his early Senate career, Biden lambasted the CIA for its abuses, including domestic spying. As an original member of the newly formed Senate Intelligence Committee, Biden found himself in a powerful position to shape the future direction and leadership of the CIA. The cases of two nominees for CIA director early in Biden's career offer a glimpse into the development of his views on secrecy and leakers.\n\nDemocratic President Jimmy Carter had campaigned on a pledge to rein in the CIA, prosecute wrongdoing by its officers and agents, and to cut its budget. He nominated Ted Sorensen, a former aide to President John F. Kennedy and a CIA outsider, to serve as director. Initially, Biden enthusiastically backed the pick, but when he discovered that Sorensen had written an affidavit in support of Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, Biden joined with Republicans to kill the nomination . In his unfiled affidavit, Sorensen described a culture of widespread leaking in Washington, explaining that many officials had leaked far more sensitive documents than Ellsberg with no consequences. Biden, noting that Sorensen had also admitted that he took home government documents for a biography he was writing about Kennedy, suggested that perhaps Sorensen himself should be prosecuted under the Espionage Act. Carter abandoned the confirmation process, and Sorensen bitterly withdrew his nomination, later blaming Biden for \"political hypocrisy.\"\n\nBiden also tried to kill the nomination of Reagan's CIA director, William Casey, in part because of concerns that Casey would return the U.S. to the lawless days of Nixon. Those fears were largely proved correct throughout Casey's tenure, as the Iran-Contra scandal unfolded and the dirty wars in Central America created killing fields in multiple nations. Yet Biden, who ultimately voted to confirm Casey , both publicly and secretly aided Casey's CIA in its war against leakers and whistleblowers . And he helped the CIA sell fraudulent U.S. wars, such as the 1983 invasion of Grenada , to other lawmakers.\n\nBy the time President Bill Clinton took office in 1993, Biden was entrenched in Washington as an influential senator with an ability to dramatically influence both domestic and foreign policy. Throughout the 1990s, he pushed through harsh and punitive policies on crime, while spearheading sweeping surveillance legislation that would form the basis for the Patriot Act after 9/11.\n\nIn the aftermath of his \"mistake\" in opposing the Gulf War, Biden shifted foreign policy gears and spent the entirety of Clinton's two terms in office advocating for the constant bombing of Iraq, promoting regime change as official policy , and using economic sanctions to \" cripple \" the country.\n\nBiden also staked out the most hawkish position on the conflict in Yugoslavia, ultimately encouraging Clinton to wage full-scale war against Serbia. While Biden frequently denounced the genocidal pogrom against Bosnian Muslims and passionately advocated for their defense, he also made clear that his motivation centered around U.S. interests and NATO's credibility. \"Who thinks NATO is going to be around five years from now, sustained by public opinion and a hundred billion dollars' worth of U.S. funds, if NATO can't play any role in bringing peace in this area of the world, or at least stopping the extent of the aggression?\" Biden asked in 1993, as he agitated for the U.S. and Europe to wage war.\n\nBy 1999, with the Kosovo War looming , Biden went so far as to suggest that \"we should have a Japanese-German-style occupation of\" Serbia. His comments presaged an era post-9/11 when the U.S. would attempt such occupations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Biden, who proudly boasted of his record on the War Powers Act, took a different position on a war he supported: \"Arguably, from the constitutional standpoint, [Clinton] doesn't need it,\" he said, adding that it would be preferable for Clinton to get congressional approval.\n\nIn the wake of the September 11 attacks, Biden's decadeslong campaign for checks on executive power could have become a powerful counterweight to the Bush administration's overreach. Instead, he merely offered an anemic critique and rote suggestion. Biden would emerge, in the early stages of the \"war on terror,\" as a leading legislative force supporting the most far-reaching aspirations of the Bush-Cheney White House. He was instrumental in the rushed passage of the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, the blank check given to the president by Congress for a borderless global war. He also boasted of his work in strengthening the Patriot Act and was an early supporter of sending people to Guantánamo Bay prison as well as denying some of them prisoner-of-war status.\n\nBiden was a key figure, during his tenure as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair, in selling the Iraq War and calling for regime change. After the war proved a disaster and the fraudulent claims about weapons of mass destruction were thoroughly debunked, Biden sought to blame his support of the war on a private conversation he had with President George W. Bush. Despite having voted for and promoted the war cause , Biden even claimed that he did not back it: \"Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment,\" he said. It was a typical move for a politician with a record of staking out muddled positions that can be recast with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nAs vice president under President Barack Obama, Biden occasionally offered a dissenting voice. He was skeptical of the plans to raid Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, opposed the regime-change war in Libya, and argued against a troop surge in Afghanistan. But as history unfolded, Biden would praise both the bin Laden raid and the war in Libya. He has said that he sees the role of vice president as speaking straight to the president and encouraging robust debate, particularly over such consequential policies as the decision to use military force.\n\nNow, after decades in the Senate and two terms as vice president - effectively a lifelong campaign for the White House - Biden is the commander in chief, and the final calls will ultimately be his to make. After a half-century of work on the balance of power and congressional authorities, Biden finds himself as a president with a rabidly and evenly divided Senate. His presidency will undoubtedly present him with decisions to make on which branch of government prevails in a dispute, particularly when it comes to war powers.\n\nHis presidency will also exist in a world shaped by policies and dynamics that Biden himself helped establish. He recently announced that he intends to abide by the agreement reached between the Trump administration and the Taliban to end the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Instead of keeping President Donald Trump's May 1 withdrawal date, though, Biden said it will happen by the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. In his speech announcing his intention to end the U.S.'s longest war, Biden portrayed the conflict's history as having begun on September 11, 2001. But during the Carter and Reagan administrations, decades before 9/11, Biden supported U.S. policies that helped incubate both the rise of Al Qaeda as well as the eventual U.S. invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. In 1981, he voted in favor of opening the spigot of U.S. aid to Pakistan to use in supporting insurgents fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. When Clinton conducted the first U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan in 1998, in what was a precursor to the policies of the war on terror, Biden supported it.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Biden voted with all but one of his colleagues in Congress in favor of overt war. In 2009, as vice president, he argued in favor of using the CIA, special operations forces, and drone strikes instead of the large-scale troop surge favored by other administration members. In the end, Obama did both. In the closing weeks of the 2012 presidential election, Biden promised to end the war. \"We are leaving,\" he said . \"We are leaving in 2014. Period.\" Despite this and other pledges during their eight years in office, Biden and Obama passed the war on to Trump.\n\nNow, as commander in chief, Biden is saying that this time, the end is really at hand, albeit with some caveats. While the timing of this shift in U.S. policy on Afghanistan is a direct result of decisions made by the Trump administration, and not Biden, the current plan as it has been described is similar to what Biden advocated for during the first year of his vice presidency in 2009. The administration and military leaders have indicated that Biden will keep CIA and special operations teams in the region to strike as necessary. How many of these forces will discreetly remain inside Afghanistan is unclear, as is the fate of the roughly 16,000 private contractors on the ground. The policy leaves open the option for U.S. forces to redeploy to Afghanistan as Obama and Biden did in Iraq in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after having \"ended\" the war in 2011.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden wave as they arrive at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nAs with many foreign policy issues and U.S. wars, studying Biden's long political history offers a revelatory tour through the excesses, crimes, and contradictions inherent in U.S. empire-building. To produce this project - which consists of 56 entries describing episodes in which Biden played a pivotal role - we reviewed scores of U.S. military operations and CIA activities with a focus on major historical events such as wars, invasions, regime-change campaigns, airstrikes, torture, and abuse of power. It also includes some examination of Biden's role in domestic surveillance policies and civil liberties. This is not intended as a sweeping analysis of Biden's entire foreign policy doctrine; rather, it is centered around a narrower set of issues related to war powers, the military, and CIA. When it comes to Biden's two terms as vice president, we focused only on issues in which Biden held a dissenting view, such as the debates around a troop surge in Afghanistan in 2009 and the U.S. war against Libya in 2011, or in which Biden was a significant voice in the administration on an issue, such as with the cases of National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks. This is also not a project focused on Biden's actions as president but rather a historical analysis of his career leading up to his presidency.\n\nWhile previous actions and policies help inform our understanding of politicians, this history does not exist in a vacuum separated from the politics and realities of the present. Throughout his career, Biden has shown an ability to adapt and evolve and, at times, to abandon what he claimed to be deeply held principles. Undoubtedly, Biden entered office with an image of his place in history and the opportunities the presidency offers him to shape or alter his legacy and the country's future. He also seems keenly aware that his ascent to the presidency required a complicated mixture of internal Democratic Party politics, social justice uprisings, and the chaos of the Trump era. To what extent Biden will defer to the demands presented by the times in which we live or the voices of others in his administration, rather than his own historical commitments, is a question only the next chapter of history will be able to answer.\n\nWe welcome reader feedback and suggestions for coverage of wars and conflicts from the past 50 years that Joe Biden played a significant role in.

      "text": "Inside Biden's Meeting With Civil Rights Leaders\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn a recording obtained by The Intercept, Biden was unenthusiastic about executive action and warned against police reform before Georgia's Senate runoffs.\n\nDemocrats in the House, Senate, and around the country have been urging President-elect Joe Biden to use the maximum amount of executive authority available to him in order to grow the economy, expand civil rights, protect the climate, and otherwise implement the agenda he ran on, despite the expected obstruction from a Republican Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of civil rights leaders urged him privately to take a slew of executive actions during a two-hour virtual meeting. While Biden didn't close the door to anything specific, he was far from enthusiastic about the idea of using executive action.\n\nA recording of the virtual meeting, attended by Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and civil rights leaders, was obtained by The Intercept. Excerpts from it can be heard in this week's Deconstructed podcast , which you can find for free on any platform that hosts podcasts.\n\nHere's what Biden told the civil rights leaders:\n\nSo there's some things that I'm going to be able to do by executive order. I'm not going to hesitate to do it, but what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to do what used to - Vanita [Gupta], you probably used to get angry with me during the debates, when you'd have some of the people you were supporting saying, 'On Day 1, I'm gonna have an executive order to do this!' Not within the constitutional authority. I am not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds. And as one of you said, maybe it was you, Reverend Al [Sharpton], whether it's far left or far right, there is a Constitution. It's our only hope. Our only hope and the way to deal with it is, where I have executive authority, I will use it to undo every single damn thing this guy has done by executive authority, but I'm not going to exercise executive authority where it's a question, where I can come along and say, 'I can do away with assault weapons.' There's no executive authority to do away that. And no one has fought harder to get rid of assault weapons than me, me, but you can't do it by executive order. We do that, next guy comes along and says, Well, guess what? By executive order, I guess everybody can have machine guns again. So we gotta be careful.\n\nBiden also warned the civil rights leaders that pressure on the incoming administration around police reform could hurt the party's chances in the Georgia Senate runoffs, claiming that the Republicans' ability to define that party as in favor of defunding the police is \"how they beat the living hell out of us across the country.\"\n\nBiden insisted that his commitment to police reform was unwavering but argued that the branding effort had done too much damage.\n\nBiden made his comments unprompted, referencing an earlier remark made by NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who had warned that appointing Tom Vilsack to be secretary of agriculture would anger Black farmers in Georgia, as well as Black voters generally in the state, for whom Shirley Sherrod was a hero. Sherrod was fired by Vilsack from her position as Georgia director of rural development for the U.S. Department of Agriculture during Vilsack's previous tenure as agriculture secretary during the Obama administration. Her firing was quickly revealed to have been a mistake and based on an incomplete airing of a video by the late conservative provocateur Andrew Breitbart. Particularly in Georgia, Johnson noted, Vilsack's capitulation was still a sore spot, and nominating him would be \"disastrous\" electorally. \"If you consider the victory that you appreciated in Georgia, it was around 12,000 votes. And so as you consider appointments, you also must consider what impact would that have on voters in the state of Georgia. And I will submit to you that former Secretary Vilsack could have a disastrous impact on voters in Georgia. Shirley Sherrod is a civil rights legend, a hero,\" Johnson said.\n\nOriginal reporting.

It also wouldn't be prudent to have that fight before the Georgia runoffs, he said, before adding that police reform should also be avoided. \"I also don't think we should get too far ahead ourselves on dealing with police reform in that, because they've already labeled us as being 'defund the police' anything we put forward in terms of the organizational structure to change policing - which I promise you, will occur. Promise you,\" Biden said.\n\n\"That's how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we're talking about defunding the police. We're not. We're talking about holding them accountable. We're talking about giving them money to do the right things. We're talking about putting more psychologists and psychiatrists on the telephones when the 911 calls through. We're talking about spending money to enable them to do their jobs better, not with more force, with less force and more understanding.\"\n\nThe slogan \"defund the police\" has been blamed for House and Senate losses by Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., along with other moderate House Democrats. Former President Barack Obama joined in, calling it a snappy slogan that cost votes.\n\n\"I just raise it with you to think about how much do we push between now and January 5 - we need those two seats - about police reform. But I guarantee you, there will be a full-blown commission. I guarantee you it's a major, major, major element,\" Biden said.\n\nWatch the full conversation here:\n\nSubscribe to Deconstructed here or on any podcast platform.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "1999: NATO Bombing of Serbia and Montenegro\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nJoe Biden was an enthusiastic proponent of the 78-day bombing of Serbia and Montenegro and wanted to send in ground troops.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Joe Biden continued agitating for a wider U.S. war in the former Yugoslavia. In his eyes, the U.S., the United Nations, and Europe had all stood by and allowed a genocide to unfold in Bosnia. He was determined to convince the White House and NATO to act aggressively to confront what he charged was Slobodan Milošević's next ethnic cleansing campaign. Throughout 1998-1999, Biden waged a tenacious campaign to sell the Clinton administration and his Senate colleagues on a preemptive bombing of Serbia, which he claimed was necessary to prevent killing and displacement operations against the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo. Biden said \"the objective will be to degrade [Milošević's] military capability so significantly that he will not be able to impose his will upon Kosovo, as he is doing now.\"\n\nBelgrade's position was that it was engaged in a fight against terrorist rebels, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, and that the allegations were propaganda and an attempt to undermine the country's sovereignty. As Western governments began publicly accusing Milošević of ethnic cleansing, Belgrade found powerful allies in Russia and China to prevent a U.N.-sanctioned war. Kosovo, at the time, was a province of Serbia, and many nations considered the situation to be an internal issue and were reluctant to intervene militarily. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was disturbed by what he believed was a multiyear campaign of repression by Milošević's government against Albanians in Kosovo but warned that unilateral action by the U.S. and NATO would constitute a violation of the U.N. charter. Biden routinely denounced the U.N. and scoffed at the notion that the U.S. needed its approval to take action.\n\nBy that time, there was a wide consensus within the NATO alliance that the U.N. had lethally failed in Bosnia and bore responsibility, particularly for the slaughter at Srebrenica. While Biden regularly denounced Milošević for preparing a genocidal war in Kosovo, he again made clear that it was not his sole motivation for demanding military action. \"Let's get something straight, it seems to me at the outset here. There's been no talk about the U.S. interest here. We talk about humanitarian interests - it far exceeds the humanitarian interest,\" Biden said in October 1998. \"If I were president, I would just bomb him, and I mean that sincerely, and I would have the NATO allies come along.\"\n\nBy March 1999, Biden's campaign for war took on an air of imminence. \"I think we will be bombing pretty soon,\" he said on March 19. \"We must move forward with a bombing campaign.\" U.S. lawmakers were sharply divided on the war, with many Republicans and a handful of Democrats opposing it. Biden urged Clinton to sell the war to the public and to get congressional support. But Biden, who proudly boasted of his record on the War Powers Act, took a different position on a war he wanted: \"Arguably, from the constitutional standpoint, [Clinton] doesn't need it,\" Biden said on the eve of airstrikes. \"But I think it's constitutionally wise, and I think it's politically necessary.\" He put the decision to go to war in grand terms. \"At stake is our entire policy in Europe since the end of World War II to promote stability and democracy,\" Biden said. \"NATO's credibility is on the line. We've warned Milošević many times to halt his fascist aggression.\"\n\nDuring the Senate debate on authorizing the war, Biden was asked why he opposed the 1991 Gulf War because it was done without proper congressional authorization but was minimizing such concerns regarding Clinton's desire to go to war over Kosovo. \"There is a big difference,\" Biden replied. \"The difference is, it is in the center of Europe, number one. Number two, if Europe in fact becomes destabilized, we are deeply involved in matters far beyond what is existing now.\" He then said he was wrong not to support the 1991 Iraq War. \"It turns out it made sense to move in the Gulf,\" Biden said, \"and I argue it makes sense for us to take this action now in the Balkans.\"\n\nIn late March, Milošević's government refused to accept an ultimatum that he allow 30,000 NATO forces to enter Serbia and effectively occupy Kosovo. The proposal also asserted that NATO forces had the right to move freely throughout the entire country, not just Kosovo, and that NATO personnel \"shall be immune from all legal process, whether civil, administrative, or criminal.\" The demands were even too much for former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, one of the greatest warmongers in U.S. history. Kissinger criticized the ultimatum, calling it a \"terrible diplomatic document\" and \"a provocation, an excuse to start bombing.\" It seems that Kissinger's analysis was correct, as a senior State Department official boasted at the time that the U.S. had \"deliberately set the bar higher than the Serbs could accept.\"\n\nIn the end, Biden's camp won the day, achieving a non-binding 58-41 Senate vote to support the use of military force, despite the fact that the Clinton administration refused to comply with the requirements of the War Powers Act. In a rebuke of Biden and the White House, the House of Representatives voted against a war resolution by a razor slim majority of one vote.\n\nOn March 24, 1999, ignoring opposition from the U.N. and a sizable number of U.S. lawmakers, the U.S. began what would become a 78-day NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro that saw civilian targets regularly struck, 16 media workers killed when a TV station was bombed, and internationally banned cluster bombs used, including on a crowded market, in attacks that killed between 90 and 150 civilians. The U.S. also bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three journalists.\n\nResidents attempt to salvage materials from a bombed house in Kosovo, on August 16, 1999.\n\nAs the bombs began dropping, Biden said the war was important to make clear \"our ability to secure our interest anywhere in the world.\" At least 450 civilians were killed in the airstrikes, though Serbian estimates put the number much higher. For Biden, the bombing was not enough. \"I've been saying, we should go into the - on the ground; we should announce there's going to be American casualties. We should go to Belgrade, and we should have a Japanese-German-style occupation of that country,\" Biden said on NBC during the bombing. \"It's the only thing that will ultimately work.\"\n\nA month into the air strikes, as many House lawmakers demanded that the War Powers Act be invoked and refused to pass a resolution supporting the war, Biden joined Republican Sen. John McCain in proposing a counterresolution that would authorize Clinton \"to use all necessary force,\" including ground troops in Kosovo, despite no official declaration of war. \"We should never take anything off the table once we're in a war,\" Biden said. The measure was tabled in the Senate and, by a substantial majority, the House voted to block the use of any Defense Department funds for ground operations.\n\nWeeks into the bombing, the American Civil Liberties Union declared that Clinton's military action \"violates the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution because it was not authorized by Congress.\" In a statement reminiscent of Biden's own past declarations on congressional war powers, the ACLU's legislative counsel said, \"Launching a sustained military action is a decision that no one person in our democracy - including the president - can authorize.\" On April 28, a month into the bombing, the House of Representatives rejected a resolution supporting continued airstrikes. Nonetheless, Clinton, with Biden's backing, continued the war.\n\nWhile Biden and his allies claimed that the war was necessary to prevent ethnic cleansing and mass killing operations, the overwhelming majority of Kosovo Albanians killed by Serbian forces were killed after the NATO bombing began. Milošević responded to the airstrikes by unleashing his forces and deploying great numbers of both conventional and special units as well as vicious paramilitaries in a \"systematic and deliberately organized\" mass killing and forced displacement operation. During the bombing, an estimated 700,000 Kosovo Albanians were forcibly displaced. \"The NATO air campaign did not provoke the attacks on the civilian Kosovar population but the bombing created an environment that made such an operation feasible,\" a U.N. commission on the war concluded . Two months into the bombing, Milošević was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for war crimes committed in Kosovo. He was the first sitting head of state to be charged by the tribunal. Despite numerous instances of NATO killings of civilians during the bombing, including the direct strike on a TV station and its use of internationally banned munitions, no U.S. or NATO officials were charged with crimes.\n\nAs the bombing came to a close in June 1999, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell was asked if the War Powers Act was dead. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"I don't think any president has ever felt that it was constitutional. I think it's essentially not functional. Nobody pays any attention to it.\" While McConnell and many Republicans opposed the law long before the Kosovo bombing, Biden had given their drive for unchecked executive power ammunition.\n\nIn June, Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo as U.S. and NATO ground troops moved in. Over the next several years, tens of thousands of Serbs and other non-Albanians were forced from their homes or fled in fear for their lives. \"The inability to stop a new wave of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, in spite of the presence of 40,000 armed [NATO] soldiers, was a major failure for the international community,\" concluded a subsequent U.N. report . Dozens of Serbian monasteries and churches were damaged or destroyed, and Kosovo's new leaders, including top figures from the KLA, began agitating for independence. Biden was a major supporter of the KLA, praising one of its leaders, Hashim Thaçi, as \"the George Washington of Kosovo.\" Thaçi, who became Kosovo's first prime minister after declaring independence from Serbia in 2008, was later indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the ethnic cleansing of Serbs and other ethnic minorities from Kosovo before, during, and after the U.S.-led NATO bombing campaign.\n\nAs for Milošević, a year after the NATO bombing ended, he faced a popular uprising following his rejection of the results of the first round of the country's 2000 presidential election. Amid sustained protests supported in part by the U.S. and other Western governments, Milošević was forced to resign. He was later arrested in a raid on his villa by members of his former special forces and extradited to the Hague war crimes tribunal, where he died in prison four years into his trial.\n\nIn 2016, as vice president, Biden visited Belgrade in an effort to convince Serbia to recognize Kosovo's independence. He faced street protests, primarily orchestrated by right-wing nationalist parties and figures, against his role in the bombings. A sizable number of the protesters also held signs or shouted slogans supporting Donald Trump in his presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. After meeting with Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić, a former top Milošević ally and information minister, Biden offered a rare acknowledgement of the Serbs killed in the bombing. Reading from a prepared statement, he said, \"I'd like to add my condolences to the families of those whose lives were lost during the wars of the '90s, including as a result of the NATO air campaign in terms of responsibility.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "That Time Joe Biden Was Banned From Negotiating With Republicans\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden negotiating a debt ceiling with Kevin McCarthy was Harry Reid's worst nightmare.\n\nFrom the moment Joe Biden announced his candidacy, the biggest risk the country faced from a potential Biden presidency was that he would wind up in high-stakes negotiations with Republican congressional leaders and those Republicans would fleece him blind.\n\nFor months, Biden insisted that he wouldn't ever be in that room, because he simply wasn't going to negotiate with Republicans over lifting the debt ceiling. But he also poured cold water on invoking the 14th Amendment or minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin, which handed Republicans all the leverage. Biden also had the chance to lift the debt ceiling at any point from January 2021 until last December when Democrats still controlled both houses of Congress. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., recently told Politico not doing so is one of his biggest regrets.\n\nInstead, Biden went into negotiations with congressional Republicans without a serious offer of his own. He made a few half-hearted suggestions that a better way to cut the deficit is to target hedge fund managers and the superrich. But when Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy objected, he dropped it. Talks continued at the White House between McCarthy and Biden Monday evening. But with Biden now negotiating the size of the cut, Democrats' only hope is that Republicans can't agree and fail to seize the moment.\n\nAll of this is reminiscent of the last time Biden, as vice president, intervened in high-stakes Capitol Hill negotiations. Afterward, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ordered the White House to never send him down again. He did such a bad job that he got a worse deal out of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell than McConnell had already agreed to give Reid. I covered this moment in my last book, \" We've Got People: From Jesse Jackson to AOC, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement ,\" which was excerpted in The Intercept.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt all came at the end of 2012, and the circumstances were similar. President Barack Obama had just stomped Republican Mitt Romney at the polls in a post-Occupy campaign that centered on economic inequality. Democrats picked up two seats in the Senate, expanding their majority to 53 and adding Elizabeth Warren to their ranks. Though Democrats won more House votes nationwide and picked up a net of eight seats, Republicans held onto the House narrowly.\n\nThe major tax cuts pushed through by President George W. Bush were set to expire at the end of 2012, creating what was called a fiscal cliff. If Congress did nothing, taxes would go up on everybody. Reid told me in an interview for \"We've Got People\" that going over the cliff was precisely his plan. Reid said, \"I thought that would have been the best thing to do because the conversation would not have been about raising taxes, which it became, it would have been about lowering taxes.\"\n\nIn other words, let all the rates go up and then bargain with Republicans to reduce taxes just for middle class and poor people. McConnell similarly knew the difficult position going over the cliff would put him in, and in talks with Reid, he agreed to let rates on people making more than $250,000 per year go back up.\n\nReid felt like he had successfully pushed McConnell to the brink; McConnell had a strong sense that Reid intended to go over the cliff and put Republicans up against a wall. It was now Sunday, December 30, 2012, and Democrats only had to hold out until Tuesday to find themselves in a dramatically improved political position, as the dawning of the new year would mean the tax cuts expired and automatically reverted to pre-Bush levels. At that point, it would be Republicans who would be left pleading for rate cuts.\n\nIn desperation, McConnell reached out directly to Vice President Biden, calling him on the phone and explaining that Reid was refusing to be reasonable. Over the course of the day, McConnell and Biden struck a deal. A senior Republican aide told me, \"Biden gave Republicans everything they wanted in exchange for fixing the fiscal cliff problem.\"\n\nJust like today, the fiscal cliff was only a problem because Biden allowed it to be. Reid would have been happy to drive the car off the cliff and then fight it out amid the wreckage.\n\nIn the same way, Biden could have just ignored the debt ceiling, invoked the 14th Amendment, declaring the debt ceiling unconstitutional, and dared Chief Justice John Roberts to blow up the global economy. McCarthy himself would publicly complain but be privately relieved that he had gotten through this moment with his speakership intact. Future presidents would thank Biden. If future Congresses wanted to rein in spending, they could rein in spending. But they could not threaten the global economy to do it.\n\nOn the morning of New Year's Eve back in 2012, Reid was still feeling good about his position, still ignorant of what Biden had given away. Then McConnell took to the Senate floor and announced that he'd been in talks with the vice president, they were progressing well, and he was hopeful that they'd have legislation to move by the end of the day.\n\nAs details of the deal began leaking out, progressive Democratic senators were floored. A large group of them - including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Al Franken of Minnesota, and Tom Harkin of Iowa - stormed over to Reid's office.\n\nThe deal was awful, they told Reid, and it had to be stopped. Reid told them what had happened, that it was out of his hands and that McConnell had gone around him to Biden. He said he was working on improving it and would be in touch throughout the day.\n\nNone of the senators had any business scheduled - it was New Year's Eve, after all - so Sanders invited them back to his office in the Dirksen building. The Hart building had a popcorn machine, so Harkin asked his staff to bring some by. The crew ended up spending several hours together in Sanders's office, thinking through potential strategies of opposition and waiting to hear from Reid.\n\nInstead, one senator's phone rang, and it was Biden, calling to sell the deal he had cut. In classic Biden fashion, he offered a 10- to 15-minute soliloquy, a meandering argument that largely boiled down to, \"You can trust me; I'm your friend; this is a good deal.\" The senator could barely get a word in before the conversation ended.\n\nMoments after he hung up, another cellphone rang, and it was Biden again. Unaware that the group was all together, Biden proceeded to call each of them, one after the other, delivering the same spiel.\n\nUltimately, it fell to Reid to drag the progressive senators into line. Once it was clear that the White House was on board with Biden's deal and McConnell was all in, that meant that there would be at least 70 or 80 votes for it. The progressive bloc could vote no, but it would only send a message of discord and have no effect on the outcome, Reid told them, coaxing them to support the deal he himself loathed. In the end, all the progressive senators except Harkin voted for the deal. It passed 89-8.\n\nYears later, Reid still regretted how it went down. He told me, \"If we'd have gone over the cliff, we'd have had resources to do a lot of good things in the country - infrastructure development - but it didn't work out that way.\" Letting all the tax rates go back to pre-Bush levels would have yielded the Treasury around $3 trillion over 10 years. Without the deal, taxes on dividend payments to the rich would have been set at 39.6 percent. Under the terms of the deal, they would be set at 20 percent, meaning that the superwealthy would be paying lower tax rates on their passive dividend income than many working people would pay on their wages. It helped fuel the inequality that keeps getting worse and added trillions to the debt at the same time.\n\nNow Biden has another chance to be in the room, and so far, he's getting outmaneuvered by McCarthy.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nWe deserve a presidential candidate who will eradicate high-stakes testing, champion teachers and public schools, and help free students from the shackles of student debt. Joe Biden is not that candidate.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks to supporters during a campaign stop at Berston Field House in Flint, Michigan on March 9, 2020. Mandel Ngan / AFP via Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWith Joe Biden one of only two leading candidates remaining in the Democratic primary, voters deserve to know the truth about his record on public education. Years of thwarting desegregation efforts, pushing privatization, and imposing high-stakes testing make it clear that Joe Biden cannot be trusted to defend our public schools.\n\nAs Delaware's senator, Biden helped Republicans pass George W. Bush's 2001 No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which ushered in the punitive testing regime that so many teachers, parents, and students oppose today. Instead of addressing the glaring racial and economic barriers to educational achievement, NCLB made educators \"accountable\" for poor testing outcomes by laying them off and closing their schools.\n\nAs vice president, Biden spoke in favor of the so-called school reform agenda, which doubled down on NCLB's draconian testing mandates and made federal funding contingent on states supporting charter schools - nearly doubling charter enrollment from 2008 to 2016. Linking teachers' pay and job stability to student test scores proved so destructive that the National Education Association called for Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to resign, and parents, students, and teachers formed a movement to opt out of high-stakes testing.\n\nWhen it comes to school privatization, Biden has been inconsistent at best. Though he has voted against vouchers for private schools, he did speak of them favorably in a 1997 floor speech. Under pressure from the growing nationwide Red for Ed movement, he acknowledged that charter schools take resources away from public schools. But unlike the plan being pushed by Senator Sanders - who was one of the few lawmakers to cast a courageous vote against NCLB - Biden's education platform makes no mention of halting charter school expansion or curbing their excesses .\n\nBiden's record on school desegregation is particularly problematic. A leading anti-busing crusader, Biden said in a 1975 interview that \"[t]he real problem with busing is that you take [white] people who aren't racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children's intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school.\"\n\nWhen Senator Kamala Harris at the July 2019 presidential debate called out Biden's efforts to thwart desegregation, he refused to apologize - instead specifying that he just opposed \"forced busing\" (a term used by conservatives) by the Department of Education , an agency that has played a historic role in protecting students' civil rights.\n\nEarlier that month, at a fundraiser , Biden reminisced about his days collaborating with infamous segregationists while assuring his wealthy donors that \"nothing will fundamentally change\" in their standard of living if he is elected president. Though he later apologized for praising defenders of Jim Crow, he has yet to apologize for his role in undermining federal efforts to integrate schools.\n\nIn terms of higher education, Biden played a major role in passing the 2005 bankruptcy legislation that made it nearly impossible for students in financial distress to discharge their student loans. Biden often touts his relationship with President Barack Obama, but while Biden broke Democratic ranks to support the bill, Obama voted against it. Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy law professor at the time, called Biden out for his \"energetic work on behalf of the credit card companies\" that \"earned him the affection of the banking industry.\" She was right: between 2003 and 2008, when the bankruptcy bill was being debated, Senator Biden received a half a million dollars from credit card companies and banks.\n\nThanks to that Biden-backed 2005 legislation, private student loan debt more than doubled between 2005 and 2011 , from $55.9 billion to $140.2 billion. Today, one in three young adults is strapped with student debt, and 3 million Americans over sixty are still trying to pay it back. Both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders acknowledged this as a crisis and offered plans to cancel student debt. When asked whether he supported their proposals, Biden dismissed them as \" unrealistic .\"\n\nAt a time when school districts are segregated at pre- Brown v. Board of Education levels, educators, parents, and students deserve a candidate who will honor the principle \"separate is not equal.\" We deserve a candidate who will eradicate high-stakes testing, who will champion teachers and public schools, and who will help free students from the shackles of student debt. If his decades-long record is any indication, Joe Biden is not the candidate that our schools so urgently need.\n\nHeather Gautney is national director, campaign co-chair committee and senior policy advisor for Bernie 2020.

Time after time, he blew it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden attends a briefing on the federal response to the Los Angeles wildfires in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 13, 2025, in Washington, DC.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nRead Jacobin 's retrospective on Joe Biden's foreign policy here .\n\nThe trouble with evaluating Joe Biden's presidency on the domestic front is that it both was so much better than anyone had a right to expect and fell far, far short of both what the moment demanded and what the president's most ardent boosters kept telling us it was.\n\nA Joe Biden presidency was always going to be something of a paradox. As one of the leaders of the Democratic Party's lurch to the right, Biden had been, without exaggeration, a key figure in virtually every ailment that led to Donald Trump: mass incarceration, the shredding of the New Deal, deindustrialization, endless wars, the zeal to slash budgets at all costs, a society chained to debt - the list goes on and on.\n\nThe man who helped create these problems over four decades was suddenly tasked with solving them in the Oval Office; the politician who had proudly declared his distaste for radicals , class warfare, and populism was now trusted to steer the country through a radical, populist era of class war - all while exorcizing Trumpism from the American psyche and forging a new New Deal on the back of the most expensive , oligarch-financed campaign at that point in American history. It's no wonder he failed.\n\nEveryone has their own idea of when exactly Biden's presidency fell apart: the August 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal debacle and his media savaging over it; the February 2023 departure of left-curious chief of staff Ron Klain and his replacement by a private equity millionaire; Biden's October 2023 \"bear hug\" of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his razing of Gaza; his disastrous June 2024 debate performance. Really, you could date it much earlier.\n\nThe decision that started the unraveling came as early as April 2021, when Biden decided to cleave in two what was meant to be the centerpiece of his presidency: a trillion-dollar injection to mend the country's long-ailing infrastructure, and his Bernie Sanders-like progressive wish list (free community college, universal pre-K, and Medicare expansion, among other things), later called Build Back Better (BBB). Instead of a single, colossal piece of legislation, they would now, on Biden's orders, be separate bills.\n\nThe move didn't make a lot of sense. The two proposals needed to stay together in one big package for Biden to have the leverage to keep his flimsy Senate majority together; he had been warned by Senate Democrats' number two and others that splitting it would jeopardize its chances, and he had even reportedly expressed privately that he needed to go big and fast and say to hell with GOP votes.\n\nBut despite all this - and despite having just seen his approval shoot up and getting the biggest plaudits of his career for ramming a stimulus bill through Congress on a party-line vote - Biden decided to do it anyway, because, as he explained to \"some of my party who discouraged me from seeking an agreement with our Republican colleagues,\" it was important to show bipartisanship still worked.\n\n\"I know a lot of you in the press, particularly, doubt that unity is possible, that anything bipartisan is possible. It's hard, but it's necessary,\" he said.\n\nJust as he had been warned, the resulting endless negotiations with Republicans over the infrastructure portion killed Biden's momentum, while separating the original proposal into two gave the Senate's corporate rebels the opening they needed to whittle down and block the bill they didn't like, the safety net expansion. As months went by with no progress, inflation ticked up, and the media gave Biden black eye after black eye for leaving Afghanistan, the president had nothing to show for himself, and his approval ratings never recovered.\n\nWorse, once he finally abandoned the progressive portion later that year, Biden would have nothing he could point to that voters would feel directly in their pocketbooks to offset their mounting frustration with a surging cost of living. Two years later, as he worked desperately to pass an enormous military aid bill for several increasingly unpopular foreign wars, he took the exact opposite approach , getting it over the line by stubbornly refusing to split it into two. By a generous read, it was a sign Biden had learned from his mistakes; by a less charitable one, it was a sign of his priorities.\n\nIt was vintage stuff from a man who, for all the rank cynicism and lack of principle that defined his career, had always held a genuine, hokey belief in the importance of the country's two-party duopoly and had been more than willing to sacrifice working Americans to show it. Far from being \"a man who could not choose ,\" Biden's presidency fell apart precisely because he did choose - he just chose poorly, as he had done so many other times.\n\nWhat it meant was that, for all the incessant comparisons to Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, as he departs office, Biden leaves behind no permanent new program or landmark welfare state expansion akin to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. In fact, he oversaw the rollback of the massive welfare state expansion occasioned by the pandemic, sometimes not lifting a finger to fight to keep it, sometimes actively pushing for the dismantling of some of its most popular components. After making an attack line out of the threat of Trump throwing 20 million people off their healthcare in 2020, Biden wound up throwing 25 million off theirs as president.\n\nMeanwhile, what should have been wins were laced with political trip wires. Biden's major contribution to the US safety net, the expanded child tax credit, was a temporary measure that expired a year later, after which the child poverty it had briefly slashed shot right back up again. He allowed Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, but only for ten of them, and only well after he would be done running for reelection, with the fine print watering the measure down even further. He chose the weakest legal rationale for forgiving student debt that all but ensured it would be struck down and delayed.\n\nThese are just some of the reasons the rapturous talk of a populist Biden presidency has rung so hollow. Voters didn't experience a populist presidency, something they kept saying over and over to no avail ; for them, Biden's four years were ones of hunger, evictions, homelessness, dwindling savings, and mounting debt; of low wages and multiple jobs, and of mail carrying flabbergasting medical bills, or news of being denied care or losing their insurance altogether - all as the \"European-style\" safety net enacted during COVID slowly dissolved under their feet.\n\nThe voters weren't imagining it. Biden has expressed regret for not putting his signature on the stimulus checks he sent out like Trump had, but seems to have no introspection over the fact that he nickel-and-dimed voters on the size of those checks before he even took office. One exasperated Democratic door-knocker in Georgia who leaned heavily on those checks to help win Biden a Senate majority called it \"a betrayal of the working class.\"\n\nUnlike Mexico's Andrés Manuel López Obrador , one of the only left-of-center leaders to set his party up for reelection in the age of inflation, Biden chose to punt on raising the minimum wage to $15 early in his term, a key campaign promise that voters would have seen and felt the benefits of as inflation went up, and he never tried to again. Something else that vanished from his vocabulary: the words \"public option,\" a major campaign promise that was last mentioned by Biden in December 2020 - though he did continue a Trump-era scheme aimed at gradually privatizing Medicare. There are countless more examples .\n\nIf these paragraphs described a Republican administration, we'd find it laughable to call it \"populist.\" There's no reason we shouldn't do the same for this one.\n\nBiden's claim that he was \"the most pro-union president in history\" rests on similarly gaunt foundations. It's true Biden was a staunchly pro-labor president and the most pro-labor one in modern memory, banning noncompete clauses and staffing a resolutely pro-union National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which catalyzed an explosion in workplace organizing that arguably made up for his squelching a railroad strike. It's also true that the near-nonexistent bar set by his predecessors let him shuffle to the top spot by simply endorsing a union drive and walking a picket line.\n\nBut this too has its limits. Four years of a pro-labor NLRB hasn't fundamentally reshaped the worker-employer relationship in the way passing major new labor law legislation would have. And for all the importance Biden placed on the NLRB, he leaves office failing , entirely thanks to his and his party's own complacency, to install a pro-labor majority on it that would serve out the first two years of his union-busting successor's coming term. How Biden's pro-union legacy holds up may well rely on what Trump does with this gift Biden handed him on his way out.\n\nBiden's term was full of these kinds of contradictions: the man who ran against what he called Trump's policy of \"cruelty and exclusion\" but continued and legitimized that policy as political common sense; who signed into law the largest climate investment in history while also investing trillions more in the carbon-belching military and making the United States the world's largest fossil fuel producer; who vowed a \"foreign policy for the middle class\" before sending unprecedented billions out of the country for foreign wars and telling Americans to endure higher gas prices for them; who talked about saving democracy while ramping up the domestic war on terror and expanding warrantless spying powers; who promised to exorcize Trump from the soul of America but ended up handing him freer reign than ever to reshape the country in his image.\n\nIn the end, it's a genuine question how much Biden the man was actually committed to his own putative agenda. Once it was dead, Biden barely talked about BBB or its constituent parts again, nor did he make it part of his 2024 campaign. His last three years were consumed instead with foreign policy - incidentally the worst area of his presidency, and one that seemed to become more calamitous the more he made it his central focus. Biden's lame-duck period has been a stark demonstration of what matters to him, rushing out billions for \"wars around the world,\" bragging he had outdone the Cold War on funneling money to weapons manufacturers as he let the NLRB fall by the wayside.\n\nBiden does firmly deserve credit for wrenching the United States from a very likely recession, and doing so with a distinctly un-Biden move: acting on one of the few lessons he and his party seemed to have learned from the Obama years and passing a large fiscal stimulus, deficit be damned. As gloomy as things have been for the US public economically, it would have been much worse without the jump-start this gave the US economy and the fiscal lifeline it gave to tapped-out states and cities.\n\nAfter that, it gets iffy.\n\nBiden's infrastructure bill pumped $1 trillion into various public works projects across the country - a historic investment, even if it still left a shortfall worth trillions more and saw less than half actually doled out by the middle of last year, letting rising inflation and interest rates shave down its value as time went on. The investment served as a further shot in the arm to the economy and funded many worthy projects .\n\nBut it also came at a less-discussed cost: it has opened the door to more privatization of infrastructure, while its overwhelming focus on infrastructure like roads and airports that necessitate and drive the use of fossil fuels and its lack of climate-friendly strings attached threaten to make it a \"climate time bomb ,\" as one transport policy group called it.\n\nLikewise, Biden's industrial policy and attempt to reshore key manufacturing in the United States made a crucial start on a process Trump centered his political identity around but did little about. That effort has seen manufacturing projects started and jobs created, albeit at a slower pace than the political cycle demands, and often without the worker-friendly conditions that were one of its selling points.\n\nMore dubious are Biden and his advisers' claims that they have ended trickle-down economics and even neoliberalism itself . Biden's industrial policy is a creature of both, a supply-side measure with a pro-labor gloss, aiming to shower big business with taxpayer money and hoping it bleeds over into workers' pockets. He even put a Wall Street darling in charge of doling it out - who has, predictably, failed to make sure firms consistently deliver on things like good pay and respecting union rights, or to stop them from carrying out stock buybacks.\n\nBiden's climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), fits squarely in this model too. Another historic investment that looked to reach its policy goals by throwing money at private industry, the law has supercharged the production of renewable energy and the market shift toward it, as well as helping spur state- and municipal-level climate action.\n\nBut it's also come with downsides, like yet another distinctly un-Rooseveltian boost to private ownership of infrastructure, or the fact that its focus on tax subsidies and expensive electric cars meant its benefits were mostly felt by the well-off. This was not the Green New Deal, which wasn't about just spending lots of money on renewables but about creating an entire economic architecture that would ensure moving away from fossil fuels would be easy and painless for rich and poor alike, creating across-the-board buy-in to the idea. Yet few Americans took advantage of the IRA, and many couldn't even point to its impact in their lives, something reflected in the Democrats' dismal Election Night showing.\n\nThere are other bright spots in Biden's presidency - the antitrust work of Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan , arguably the Biden appointee most loathed in corporate circles, comes to mind, as does his major expansion of veterans' health benefits. But this money cannon is, thanks to the BBB's defeat, the heart of Biden's domestic record. Its exact legacy is still uncertain, not just because of the flaws discussed, but because less than 17 percent of it was spent by April last year, and Trump is now threatening to gut the climate measures as soon as he's inaugurated.\n\nWhat we can say for sure is it failed at its political goal of engineering an electoral realignment, partly because of its lengthy timeline, and partly because it was focused on an important but narrow slice of the working class in the construction and manufacturing sectors. Meanwhile, the fight against climate change is still in peril, thanks to more of the self-sabotage that was rife through Biden's presidency: whether his record-high fossil fuel production, his continued hampering of global climate efforts, or his stoking a new Cold War with China, of which his industrial and climate strategies were a deliberate part, and which is already doing damage to both America's and the world's ability to rapidly transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the sum of Biden's domestic record amounted to a larger stimulus and a massive program of subsidizing big business, all justified and motivated by a needless drive for war. In other words, it's roughly what you'd expect an attempt at left-populism to look like if it was tried by Joseph Biden.\n\nIn the end, Biden didn't become \"the most progressive president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt,\" as Bernie Sanders once hoped, and he didn't end trickle-down economics, which Biden recently and preposterously said \"everything I've done in my career\" had been \"designed to change.\" He didn't even do the thing he claimed was the reason he had run for president and erase his predecessor from American political life; instead, Biden will be remembered as the inept, disastrous failure who legitimized and returned to power an emboldened Trump.\n\nBut maybe this is the wrong way to assess him. At the end of it all, Biden succeeded at the one overarching goal of his life, the one he happily lied, started wars, and helped immiserate working Americans to reach: electing Joe Biden president of the United States.\n\nMany were stunned at the destructive selfishness Biden showed in running for a second term (a term he later admitted he wasn't sure he could have served out anyway), and at the crisis and likely doom he stubbornly plunged his own party into by refusing to step aside. But that shock was a testament to how thoroughly Biden's history has been rewritten over the past five years.\n\nIn reality, Biden's career, like many elected officials, was a four-decade-long quest for the boyhood dream of sitting in the Oval Office, picking up and dropping principles, beliefs, and political priorities as he went - whatever suited the path of least resistance. We should probably not be surprised, then, that a man who built his career on lying for both convenience and self-aggrandizement and on shamelessly giving \"different talks to different people,\" as a voter once delicately put it , exhibited so many contradictions as he scrambled to establish some kind of legacy: whether his eleventh-hour transformation from a career-long champion of neoliberalism to its destroyer, his decision to sacrifice his populist agenda for the sake of bipartisanship, or his choice to lurch to the right , as well as to lean on NATO and unpopular \"wars around the world\" as his closing pitch, after running on ending \"forever wars.\"\n\nWhat Biden's presidency meant for liberalism and the broader progressive left is more complicated. On the one hand, Biden proved a successful, last-ditch vehicle for a corporate, media, and political establishment desperate to halt the rise of Bernie Sanders's left-populist insurgency that could have gone toe to toe with Trump's movement, pouring untold money and resources into propping him up against it and shielding him from scandals that could have ended his brittle campaign.\n\nIt worked. Biden - who almost no one in the Democratic establishment, least of all his former boss, had actually wanted to run - nevertheless bumbled his way into crushing the best chance a movement for social democracy had in the United States. That defeat was compounded by Biden's subsequent abandonment of the progressive agenda he had negotiated with that movement and, now, his role in returning to power a Trump and GOP trifecta bent on destroying the organized left. While the neoliberal Biden of decades earlier worked deliberately to kneecap a leftward political shift, the new \"populist\" Biden merely did so by accident.\n\nOn the other hand, Biden gave the Left the important symbolic victory of proving its point, by virtue of having more political sense than Hillary Clinton and bringing Sanders's movement into the fold. To this day, his progressive 2020 run, as tepid as it was, is the only Democratic campaign that's ever beaten Trump, the closest thing to a real-world proof of concept for what the Left has been saying for years about how to win in electoral politics. Biden also gave the broad progressive left a genuine opening - its first in decades - to try and enact its vision, however badly fumbled it was when trusted to his hands.\n\nHis attempt at left-populism is less notable for what it tells us about Biden the man than the fact that he even tried it. It's a testament to how the Left has reshaped the political terrain that one of the leaders of the Democratic Party's rightward turn decided it was in his political interest, and the interests of his legacy, to spend his presidency doing his best Bernie Sanders impression. Barack Obama came into office thinking cutting entitlements is what history would remember him by; Biden, despite a lifetime taking aim at the programs, realized he would be better remembered for not doing so.\n\nIn another time, with a different Biden, even what relative progressivism was eked out of this administration would not have happened. We should look at Biden's four years in a similar way to Trump's, during which, in an act of desperation during the COVID-19 pandemic, the right-wing billionaire signed into law the massive welfare state expansion passed by a Democratic Congress and made a series of shockingly radical executive orders like his eviction ban - all ideas that had their origins on the Left. To different extents, both of these presidents were unlikely figures for the advancement of any kind of progressive policy, but thanks to years of left-wing movement-building and the historical moments they found themselves in, both realized they would benefit from poaching ideas from the Left.\n\nBiden's time in the White House didn't make up for the damage he inflicted on Americans over five decades to get there, let alone fix it. But after being widely pilloried for pledging that \"nothing would fundamentally change\" if he became president, Biden can now at least safely say that's not true. As he departs the White House, Biden leaves behind a country far more disillusioned, divided, and beaten down than when he took office, and places it under the control of a man he believes is a fascist.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Will the media abandon that approach under a President Joe Biden?\n\nJoe Biden speaks at a drive-in election night event at the Chase Center in the early morning hours of November 4, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware.

For those on the Right, like Fox and Newsmax, there's little question. Biden can be every bit the foil Barack Obama was, and right-wingers have new progressives to vilify, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar . The script has already been written: radical socialism is taking over America, and only God-fearing Republicans stand between you and violent anarchy.\n\nFor the other cable TV networks, Donald Trump was the hard drug they could not quit. In the Obama years, CNN and MSNBC were also-rans, trailing badly behind Fox News in the ratings wars. CNN, a twenty-four-hour news network that could not subsist without a daily crisis, seemed to bottom out around 2014, posting disastrously low ratings. Then, in 2015, Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, would air Donald Trump rallies live and uninterrupted, fueling the candidate's ascent in a crowded Republican primary. Zucker knew a good story when he saw one.\n\nIn 2017, MSNBC , unable to marshal much of an audience during Obama's presidency, became a place where every Trumpian outrage and conspiracy could be parroted and expanded to maximalist proportions. Ratings soared. Rachel Maddow became one of the biggest stars in television, rivaling the reach of any Fox host. CNN, too, made a fortune on liberal angst and rage, branding for the Resistance.\n\nFor mainstream liberal outlets - both those that openly identify that way, and those that keep up the pretense of neutrality - the future is less clear. For four years, the top media organizations in America universally benefited from Trump. The New York Times and the Washington Post , which received a remarkable surge of subscriptions from beleaguered readers, almost all Democrats who turned to them for news of Trump's potential downfall, also rebranded for the Resistance. From Russiagate to impeachment to Trump's unhinged tweets, content was never lacking - the show always went on. The Post even devised a new grandiose motto, \"Democracy Dies in Darkness.\" Smaller liberal outlets like the New Yorker , New York magazine, Vox , and the Daily Beast trod a similar path.\n\nMany media organizations played a role as an aggressive and necessary watchdog in the Trump years. The bankrupt access-journalism model, in which reporters allow themselves to be co-opted by powerful actors for mostly meaningless scoops, lost favor in the Trump years, as more journalists and readers recognized that it could not function with a White House that offered so little in the way of reliable information. Trump did revive gossip-infused palace intrigue reporting, with so many staffers cycling in and out, but that did not cause mainstream outlets to abandon their adversarial stance, at least toward Trump himself. The Mark Halperin model of reporting was rightfully discredited.\n\nBut a new problem arises now: Can these many media organizations, so closely linked to the project of anti-Trump resistance, leave behind their role as Democratic Party activists and Biden apologists? As Branko Marcetic wrote in Jacobin in October , the collective decision to entirely suppress the New York Post 's dubious, though hardly fabricated, reporting on Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and cheer on the censorship efforts of Facebook and Twitter - the latter social media giant, in an unprecedented move, locked the Post 's main account and temporarily blocked sharing of the story - could be a harbinger of what's to come. The Post 's story should not have been promoted uncritically, but most media outlets failed in their first duty to the public: to report and find out what's true and what's false. Instead of attempting to verify the facts of the story and then deciding whether to dismiss all of it as bunk, media organizations blacked out the story without making even a perfunctory attempt to explain what it was that had been revealed in the first place and if any of it could be relevant to the public.\n\nStill traumatized by 2016, when Democratic Party operatives attributed Trump's victory to Wikileaks' release of hacked emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, media organizations were determined not to be perceived as aiding and abetting a candidate they regarded as a threat to democracy itself. Once Trump was deemed a fascist - never mind that Trump was a historically weak president who accomplished relatively little beyond judicial appointments, as Corey Robin has convincingly argued - any and all reporting that could be perceived as damaging to his rivals was viewed by the Democratic readership as the greatest of transgressions.\n\nBut as long as Trump was president, at least none of this hindered the practice of accountability journalism vis-à-vis the executive branch.\n\nWhat now? There is a real danger of slipping into a new normal, in which liberal-leaning newspapers and websites fail to report as aggressively on the Biden White House as they did on its predecessors. Aaron Rupar, a prominent Vox editor, recently dismissed an investigative report into the lucrative private-sector careers of Biden's wealthy foreign policy team. \"Blinken participated in society. The horror,\" Rupar tweeted , referring to Biden's pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken.\n\nApparently, to some journalists, founding a high-dollar consulting firm with clients in the defense industry, Silicon Valley, and various hedge funds while also being a partner in a private equity firm can now be equated to the mere act of \"participating in society,\" as if this were an unavoidable part of everyday life. Had a Trump cabinet pick boasted a similar background, it's unlikely Rupar would have been so blasé. The danger is that in the post-Trump era, Democratic corruption will be seen as acceptable because it's not Republican corruption.\n\nThose on the Biden beat should remember that the machinery of American government can be plenty destructive without Trump calling the shots. If they don't, democracy can indeed die in darkness.\n\nRoss Barkan is a writer and journalist in New York City.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Meanwhile, in Washington, DC, in one of Joe Biden's final acts as president, his administration asked Congress to authorize another $8 billion in weapons to Israel (coming on top of the $17.9 billion Biden has given Israel since October 7, 2023).\n\nBiden spent the majority of his life trying to fulfill his dream of becoming president of the United States. He succeeded. As he exits the office, his hands are drenched in blood. From his key role in leading the United States to war on Iraq in 2003 to his loyal support of Israel's genocide, Joe Biden will be remembered by hundreds of millions around the world for the mass murder hidden behind the sterile diplomatic jargon of his administration.\n\nIt's been fifteen months since Israel's onslaught on Gaza began. The Gaza Health Ministry has reported that at least 46,006 Palestinians have been killed during the ongoing aerial and land invasion of the small strip of land roughly the size of Philadelphia. The number killed is likely a drastic underestimate. A Lancet study released earlier this month estimates that the number of deaths has been underreported by around 41 percent . According to the United Nations (UN), Israel has destroyed nine out of every ten homes in Gaza, and at least 92 percent of all roads have been destroyed or damaged. This has left over 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza displaced, most living in makeshift tents, which are routinely bombed by Israel. In one such bombing, Israel targeted a tent hospital in Deir al-Balah where dozens of Palestinians were being treated. Two days before his twentieth birthday, Shaban al-Dalou was one of four patients burned alive as he was being treated, IV in arm, at al-Aqsa Hospital tent camp.\n\nNearly nine months before al-Dalou was killed, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) released a statement asserting the plausibility of Israel's acts in Gaza constituting genocide. Israel was given thirty days to comply with measures laid out by the ICJ, including the demand to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel did not comply, and nothing happened after the allotted period elapsed. In fact, Biden wholly dismissed the ICJ's ruling and continued to give Israel hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of weapons.\n\nBiden spent his last year as president funding the destruction of Gaza and ethnic cleansing measures against two million Palestinians. On day eighteen of Israel's assault on Gaza in 2023, when over six thousand Palestinians had been killed, nearly half of them children, Biden said in a televised address , \"I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war.\"\n\nWithin the first few weeks of Israel's onslaught on Gaza in October and November 2023, as the death toll climbed to ten thousand, Biden's administration vetoed every single UN resolution calling for a temporary halt to the bombing. With every veto, and with every speech doubling down on support for Israel's genocide (a term introduced as early as November 2023), Biden and his spokespeople continued to tout the importance of \" diplomatic negotiations \" as the only way forward. In fact, after vetoing a UN Security Council proposal for a pause in the fighting to allow critical humanitarian relief into Gaza, US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said , \"We are on the ground doing the hard work of diplomacy. We believe we need to let that diplomacy play out.\" Not much effective diplomacy played out under Biden's watch, but gruesome mass death did.\n\nBiden's hawkish stance on Palestine, his complete bowing down to Israel's whims, was not a break from his previous foreign policy positions. Perhaps one of the defining periods of his career was the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq war, when he acted as the driver for war within the Democratic Party. As Branko Marcetic wrote for Jacobin in 2019, shortly before Biden's election,\n\nBiden was one of seventy-seven senators who voted to give Bush the authorization to wage war on Iraq, joining fellow Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Harry Reid, and Dianne Feinstein. Twenty-one Democratic senators, including Dick Durbin, Ron Wyden, and Patrick Leahy, voted against it. \"At each pivotal moment, [President Bush] has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation,\" Biden said on the Senate floor. \"I believe he will continue to do so. . . . The president has made it clear that war is neither imminent nor inevitable.\"\n\nJust as Biden lied to the public about the evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2002, he lied to the public about the events of October 7, first by touting lies about beheaded babies and rape allegations , which were either disproven or lack substantial evidence (though Biden continued to repeat the false claims for many months), then by claiming humanitarian aid was of utmost important to his administration. In reality, his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was fully aware Israel was preventing aid from reaching Palestinians in Gaza and did nothing about it for fear that acknowledging this blatant violation of law would require the United States to halt weapons shipments.\n\nBiden has committed to endless military funding, specifically through weapons shipments, to Israel for nearly two decades. As vice president under Barack Obama, Biden personally flew to Israel to secure \" the largest single pledge of military assistance \" in US history, providing Israel with $38 billion in military funding over ten years. That number now seems small when considering the whopping $17.9 billion Biden gave to Israel in the year after October 7 and the other $8 billion his administration is trying to push through Congress in his last week in office.\n\nThe movement to end the genocide and win a cease-fire and arms embargo on Israel has grown unevenly but tremendously in the last fifteen months. But it could not force a halt in brutality against Palestinians, and it often could not overcome the endless resources marshaled by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other pro-Israel groups against progressive voices in the United States that spoke out against the war. Such voices were too few and far between within the Democratic Party, which lost credibility among large swaths of voters in part due to its inability to deliver what millions of Americans were demanding, a cease-fire. On the campaign trail, Biden and then Kamala Harris repeatedly ignored, openly mocked, and downplayed the importance of Gaza and a cease-fire, despite multiple polls indicating it was an issue close to the hearts of many voters in swing states. In fact, even now, in the last moments before he leaves office, Biden has allowed Donald Trump to take the reins in achieving a cease-fire after fifteen months of standing by as Israel crossed every \" red line \" he drew.\n\nMany postmortems of Biden's administration will no doubt ignore or downplay his role in Israel's genocide. But Palestinians and their many supporters worldwide will never forget his actions and inaction. Biden should be haunted for the rest of his days by the screams of Gaza.\n\nSumaya Awad is Adalah Justice Project's director of strategy and communications, and coeditor of Palestine: A Socialist Introduction (Haymarket Books).\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn July 2019, while campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president, Joe Biden declared in a foreign policy speech, \"It's past time to end the Forever Wars, which have cost us untold blood and treasure.\" But the president-elect - who, as vice president, oversaw wars in Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, and more - is already embracing personnel with strong ties to the military apparatus driving this endless combat.\n\nOn November 10, Biden announced his agency review teams, which he says \"are responsible for understanding the operations of each agency, ensuring a smooth transfer of power, and preparing for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris and their cabinet to hit the ground running on Day One.\"\n\nOf the twenty-three people who comprise the Department of Defense agency review team, eight of them - or just over a third - list their \"most recent employment\" as organizations, think tanks, or companies that either directly receive money from the weapons industry, or are part of this industry. These figures may be an undercount, as the writer was not immediately able to exhaustively source the funding of every employer.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is listed as the \"most recent employment\" of three individuals on Biden's Department of Defense agency review team: Kathleen Hicks (a former defense official under President Barack Obama), Melissa Dalton, and Andrew Hunter. CSIS is a hawkish and influential foreign policy think tank that receives funding from General Dynamics Corporation, Raytheon Technologies, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and other weapons manufacturers and defense contractors, as well as oil companies.\n\nRaytheon is a key supplier of bombs to the US-Saudi war in Yemen, and has aggressively lobbied to prevent any curbs on arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition. Among the weapons that Northrop Grumman manufactures are drones, which have been used by the US military in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia, among other locations. Notably, a New York Times investigation in 2016 found that, based on a cache of email leaks, CSIS was effectively doubling as a weapons industry lobbying firm, pushing for expanded drone sales. Lockheed Martin is a key contractor for the THAAD missile system in South Korea - a system that CSIS has also advocated for without disclosing their conflict of interest. The company also manufactured the bomb that struck a school bus in Northern Yemen in August 2018, killing at least twenty-six children.\n\nCSIS also receives money from a host of governments, including the United States, as well as the United Arab Emirates, which has joined with the United States and Saudi Arabia to wage war on Yemen. CSIS, in addition, receives money from the state-run oil company Saudi Aramco, which effectively amounts to a donation from the Saudi government.\n\nTwo of the individuals named for Biden's Department of Defense agency review team - Ely Ratner and Susanna Blume - list the think tank Center for a New American Security (CNAS) as their most recent employer. CNAS takes a significant chunk of its money from Northrop Grumman, as well as the US State Department ($500,000 or more per year on both counts), and from Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and a host of corporations, including oil companies.\n\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris drew heavily from CNAS to advise her presidential primary campaign. The think tank is known for embracing conventional, pro-war foreign policy, as well as escalation toward Russia and China.\n\nThree people from the team - Stacie Pettyjohn, Terri Tanielian, and Christine Wormuth (also a former defense official under Obama) - hail from the RAND Corporation, a hawkish think tank that receives significant funding from the US Army and the Department of Homeland Security. (These individuals are not being included in the tally of people who work for organizations funded by the arms industry, but nonetheless, their involvement shows the political bent of Biden's Department of Defense transition team.)\n\n\"It's telling the think tanks represented here - RAND, CSIS, and CNAS - are among the top recipients of Department of Defense and Department of Defense contractor funding,\" says Ben Freeman of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative, which recently authored a report on think tank funding. \"CNAS and CSIS are literally number one and number two in terms of donations received from US defense contractors in the last six years. RAND is, by far, the top recipient of Department of Defense funding of any think tank.\"\n\nSharon Burke, on Biden's team, works for New America, which calls itself a \"national network of innovative problem-solvers.\" The organization receives funding from Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, and US Army War College.\n\nShawn Skelly's most recent employer is listed by the Biden team as CACI International, which provides information technology for US military weapons systems. (Because Skelly's LinkedIn page says she worked at CACI until November 2020, we are including her in the tally of people who receive money from or are employed by the weapons industry, given the relevance to her present finances.) Before Skelly started working there, CACI was sued by Iraqis formerly detained in the notorious US military prison Abu Ghraib, on the grounds that the contractor played a direct role in their torture. (The lawsuit is still ongoing.)\n\nVictor Garcia lists Rebellion Defense as his most recent employer. This software company says it helps \"our defense and national security agencies unlock the power of data across all domains.\" It was founded by former defense officials and \"analyzes video gathered via drone,\" according to the New York Times .\n\nOf those remaining, one team member works for JPMorgan Chase & Co., another is retired from the State Department, a few work for universities and other organizations, and one works for the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which says it strives to \"prevent catastrophic attacks with weapons of mass destruction and disruption - nuclear, biological, radiological, chemical and cyber.\" Lisa Coe, also on the team, lists as her most recent employer OtherSide Consulting, a defense industry consultant, according to Defense News . However, because we were unable to independently verify this, Coe is not being included in our count of team members funded by the military or weapons industry.\n\nFarooq Mitha, also a member of the Department of Defense team, is on the board of Emgage, which has garnered criticism for its affiliation with anti-Palestinian organizations.\n\nThe news prompted disappointment from anti-war groups. \"Biden building a team of people with connections to weapons manufacturers and the military industrial complex is a prime example of how militarism and imperialism are bipartisan,\" says Sidney Miralao, an organizer with Dissenters, a group of young people who oppose US militarism and the war industry. \"Democrats and Republicans alike perpetuate and profit off of war and violence in our communities at home and abroad. By continuing the legacy of the revolving door with the defense industry, Biden and his team are setting themselves up to be able to continue growing the military and strengthening the narrative that war is necessary to safety.\"\n\nWhile campaigning, Biden made some overtures to the surging left wing that nearly catapulted Bernie Sanders to the Democratic nomination, forming a unity task force with Sanders backers that issued a series of recommendations , from climate to labor. Yet these efforts to reach out to the Left largely omitted issues of war and militarism, leaving critics of US aggression concerned that a Biden administration would bring a continuation of the wars he's supported throughout his career. Biden played an influential role in backing the 2003 US invasion of Iraq , has been a career-long supporter of Israel's aggression toward Palestinians, and has defended the open-ended occupation of Afghanistan, among other acts.\n\nOutgoing president Donald Trump, for his part, hoisted people with close ties to the arms industry into prominent Department of Defense positions, appointing Mark Esper, a former lobbyist for Raytheon, to the position of secretary of defense. (Trump fired Esper and a number of other senior military officials in recent days, in what appears to be a sign of Trump's effort to stay in power despite losing the presidential election.)\n\n\"Has Biden already forgotten who put him in the position he's in?\" says Ramón Mejía, anti-militarism national organizer with the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, an alliance of community organizations. \"The only reason he's president-elect is because Black, Brown, Indigenous youth mobilized to vote out Trump's fascism. Biden shouldn't make the mistake that Democrats are commonly known to make, which is to abandon the same people who put them there.\"\n\n\"War-making and corporate profiteering is a non-starter,\" Mejía adds. \"We must divest the bulk of our budget from a war-fueling extractive economy, and prioritize investing in a life-sustaining regenerative economy.\"\n\nSarah Lazare is web editor at In These Times .

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nWhy has Joe Biden been such a die-hard defender of Benjamin Netanyahu's genocidal campaign against Gaza? The answer can be found in part through a deep dive into Biden's early political career.\n\nJoe Biden giving a speech, on March 11, 2010, at Tel Aviv University in Israel. (Uriel Sinai / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial speech to Congress Wednesday came just days after President Joe Biden announced he would no longer seek reelection and as the death toll - now reaching more than forty thousand - of Palestinians in Gaza continues to climb.\n\nShortly after the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israelis on October 7, Biden traveled to Israel to literally embrace Netanyahu and offer his full support for his administration's massive assault on Gaza. While occasionally offering stiff rhetoric to Netanyahu's government, Biden has continued to regularly provide it with the diplomatic cover and military aid.\n\nAll the while, a question has remained: What explains Biden's persistent, near-unconditional support for Netanyahu and the Israeli war machine?\n\nThere appears to be some consensus that Biden is driven by a belief in Zionism and a deep emotional attachment to Israel. He has \"a deep-seated, personal commitment to Israel that goes back to his first years as a U.S. senator,\" according to the Washington Post . Biden is a \"true believer\" who \"alone among modern American presidents has an emotional relationship with the idea of Israel, the people of Israel, the security of Israel,\" according to the author of a Biden book, speaking on MSNBC. And Biden has told audiences for decades that his commitment to Israel is \"personal\" and \"began at my father's dinner table.\"\n\nThe reality is more complicated. Over four decades, Biden has also established a reputation as a politician who can choose paths of least resistance, of giving \"different talks to different people,\" as one voter in New Castle County, Delaware, put it in 1978. Or, as another voter that year put it more harshly, Biden \"is a phony.\" That election year, data showed that half of Delaware voters, including 39 percent of those supporting Biden, agreed he was inconsistent.\n\nThe most common example is Biden's famous flip-flop on busing. But there are many others, too. After running as a Rooseveltian populist, Biden also urged his party to become more hawkish on both war and the deficit in the wake of Ronald Reagan's victory. He went serially back and forth on a balanced budget amendment, expressing fiery outrage one minute, voting for it the next. After he faced a challenge from a Republican accusing him of being soft on terror, Biden pushed the war in Iraq, before later telling a group of black columnists he opposed unilateral military action against it.\n\nIn searching for the origins surrounding the president's views on the US-Israel relationship, In These Times and Jacobin found what appears to be a similar story. Drawing on a combination of contemporary newspaper reports, largely from the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Wilmington News Journal , and records held at archives in Delaware and New York, including copies of the Jewish Voice and correspondence to and from Biden with, among others, advocacy groups and community leaders, at least some portion of the historical record suggests Biden's position developed alongside his political interests over time - but also took a sharp turn early on.\n\nIn November 1972, just a couple of days out from Election Day as twenty-nine-year-old New Castle County councilman, Joseph Robinette Biden waged a long-shot campaign for the US Senate, a story in local newspapers threatened to derail Biden's surprisingly formidable run. A Jewish campaign volunteer quit, pointing to what he alleged was the upstart politician's public dishonesty on Israel.\n\nBy not speaking out, the volunteer said, he would have been \"helping to sucker Jews out of their money.\"\n\nApart from my 2020 history of Biden's political career - Yesterday's Man (Verso) - the episode appears to have largely been forgotten or left out of reporting on the president's Gaza policy.\n\nIn an August 9 meeting, according to reports by the Wilmington News Journal and Philadelphia Inquirer , Biden told Victor Livingston, the volunteer, that he needed a firm position on the Israel-Palestine issue because his campaign was pursuing contributions from Jewish donors - and he couldn't have his personal views included because \"it would be political suicide to state my true beliefs.\"\n\nWhatever position on Israel Biden took now, Livingston recalled the candidate allegedly telling him, would be the one he would publicly take for the rest of his career.\n\n\"But if you want to know my true beliefs - I think the only solution is to have the United States and Russia negotiate a settlement in the Middle East, make Jerusalem an international city, and have Israel give back all the territory it has occupied,\" the Inquirer quoted Biden as saying, based on Livingston's recollection. Biden also allegedly said: \"I don't think the United States would be one bit weaker if Israel went under - we shouldn't get tied down to countries like this.\"\n\nBiden's campaign pushed back to the newspapers fiercely. The candidate charged Livingston was \"stupid, emotionally mixed up or a downright liar\" before later calling him \"a flat-out liar.\"\n\nBiden claimed he had merely been arguing as the devil's advocate if he had \"said something like that,\" referring to other alleged remarks that Israeli leaders were the world's biggest arm-twisters and that Jews were too emotional about the country. One campaign staffer told the Inquirer the same, adding that, \"in the confines of an office, things can always be said that can be misconstrued.\"\n\nAnother staffer first said it was simply a \"brainstorming\" session where lots of ideas were floated, before later saying he couldn't remember what was said and that Livingston was carrying out \"a vendetta.\"\n\nYet the reporter who broke the original story - Norm Lockman, the News Journal 's first full-time black reporter, who would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize at the Boston Globe - didn't appear to buy the non-denials. Two years later, writing about then senator Biden's refusal to read the transcripts of the Richard Nixon White House tapes, Lockman offered his own theory of what lay behind Biden's decision: \"He'd had a taste of being criticized for private remarks that later became public.\"\n\nIn the column, Lockman offered more details of the October 1972 incident. After Biden had commissioned the position paper, a philosophical argument followed about the wisdom of the US commitment to Israel \"with Biden generally taking the position that Israel might be expecting too much of the United States.\" Lockman noted the candidate \"immediately acknowledged that he had made some of the statements attributed to him\" and claimed he had been playing devil's advocate.\n\n\"He still reacts bitterly when he is reminded of it,\" wrote Lockman. \"Biden is a rough talker when he thinks it's private, and I suspect a lot of other politicians are, also. I doubt if there is a politician on Capitol Hill, anywhere perhaps, who could safely allow his private conversations to be made public.\"\n\nBoth of the men who reported the story at the time, Lockman and the Inquirer's Robert Schwabach, passed away years ago. Biden's senatorial papers are locked away from the public and as this article is being published, attempts to reach Livingston have been unsuccessful.\n\nBut other documents shed light on the various relationships surrounding a young Biden as he formulated his political stance on an issue that will undoubtedly play a large role in defining his presidency.\n\nNathan Barnett, who served as executive director of the Jewish Federation of Delaware (JFD - formed in 1935) - described 1967, in an interview for the Jewish Historical Society, as a key year as the JFD's leadership successfully raised some $850,000 - more than three times what they raised the year before - in the wake of the Six-Day War. It showed \"that we as a community were able to raise significant dollars,\" said Barnett, and gave \"the non-Jewish community an understanding that the Jewish community was the second-largest fundraising organization in the state.\"\n\nBiden's 1972 Senate campaign wanted the support of this activated constituency. Eight days from voting, Biden and other candidates took part in a questionnaire put out by the Jewish Voice , a local paper published by the JFD. Biden also took out a full-page ad on the back page, declaring \"America must insure Israel's existence\" by, among other things, \"ensur[ing] that Israel receives whatever weapons she needs.\"\n\nBiden already had the support of one particularly influential pro-Israel leader in Delaware: campaign donor Irving S. Shapiro, chair and CEO of DuPont, a preeminent corporate power in the state.\n\n\"Irving Shapiro, I consider a good personal friend,\" Biden said three years later, in 1975. \"I've sought out his opinion on a number of occasions.\" Shapiro had swiftly come to Biden's defense when the Livingston story broke, insisting that both Biden and his opponent \"have clearly demonstrated their commitment to the state of Israel,\" and likening any suggestion to the contrary to the \"big lie.\"\n\nShapiro was not just a local industrialist. As a former JFD president, he was deeply involved in pro-Israel advocacy at both the local and national levels. Shapiro sat on the DuPont executive committee that Biden early on requested a meeting with to discuss positions he had taken on the 1973 oil embargo and to \"exchange views on national issues\"; together, in October 1973, the two arranged a breakfast with a visiting Walter Mondale to discuss US-Israel policy with local Jewish leaders. Years later, as Shapiro led the effort to pass legislation undermining the decades-old Arab League boycott of Israel, documents show that Biden was one of the small circle of congressmen kept in the loop. (Biden ultimately voted with fifty-five other senators to make it law).\n\nIn 1975, the elected senator was asked which of the state's interest groups tried to influence him. \"The interest groups that I hear from are the Jewish interest groups concerned about Israel,\" he replied, and then went on to list a handful of other groups. \"And they've always been reasonable when they've come to me, they've never threatened me in any way. Maybe it's because I tend to vote their way.\"\n\nArchival documents provide a window into how this outreach worked. In April 1975, Barnett followed up on a personal request from Biden to put \"together a group to discuss Israel further,\" and he recorded the senator's comments. Alongside Biden's thoughts on the mood in Congress and his less-than-flattering opinion about Gerald Ford's foreign policy, Biden laid out his position on Israel and Palestine - one that had strayed far from what he allegedly told Livingston.\n\nBiden did \"not believe that Israel is intransigent,\" thought \"the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] is nothing but a murdering group of people,\" and questioned why Israel should \"move simply for a promise.\" Barnett also noted Biden \"will change his principles to support aid for Israel if necessary,\" the notes from that April 14, 1975, meeting stated, and would bend on Israel's obligation under international law to return the territory it was occupying. \"1948 is irreversible,\" Biden said, according to the notes. \"Israel does exist and the starting point is 1975, not 1948.\"\n\nIt was a starting point that came after Israel's seizure of various territories in 1967, including Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.\n\nBiden seemed to hint he would be willing to accept Israel's expansion two years prior, in 1973, when recounting his conversation with then Israeli prime minister Golda Meir in a letter to a Jewish refugee advocate. Biden met Meir in August 1973 on his first trip to the country during a congressional junket.\n\n\"In my conversations with Mrs. Meier [ sic ], I conveyed my support for the security of Israel, including retention of certain geographical points she said were necessary to assure Israel's existence,\" he wrote.\n\nIn September 1972, a month after the meeting with Livingston, Biden sent Barnett a position statement, the earlier assignment that outraged the young campaign volunteer. Among other things, the statement called for providing Israel with  \" whatever weapons it needs to maintain the military balance in the Middle East\" and for the United States to  \" support the position that the city of Jerusalem should remain under unified Israeli rule\" - the opposite of what Biden had earlier allegedly suggested was his personal view. The last measure is an inflammatory move that Biden would, two decades later, vote for , and which former president Donald Trump finally followed through with to widespread criticism in 2018 .\n\nBiden, a month later, also forwarded the same paper to the lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), enclosed with his responses to an AIPAC questionnaire on US-Israel policy.\n\n\" Please let me know your reaction to my statement,\" Biden wrote to Barnett.  \" I would like to discuss it with you personally.\"\n\nThe two appeared to forge a friendly relationship in the years ahead, archival correspondence shows, exchanging personal messages, for example, regarding the shocking death of Biden's wife and son.\n\nBut typically, the correspondence In These Times and Jacobin found was strictly business. Five months into Biden's first Senate term, Barnett delineated whom to listen to if Biden really wanted to take the temperature of Jewish opinion in Delaware, creating a short list of  \" people who can represent the Jewish community in the state,\" including several JFD personnel.\n\nJFD's president, he wrote,  \" represents the entire Jewish community.\"\n\nBiden was often proactive in seeking input. In one December 1973 letter to Barnett, Biden explained at length why he voted against aid for Soviet refugees resettling in Israel. Barnett passed the letter on to two leaders of national Jewish groups for comment, noting the senator  \" makes a very persuasive argument.\"\n\nAfter another April 1975 meeting to discuss the Middle East, several letters of gratitude informed Biden his  \" open and frank comments\" were appreciated and his  \" honesty was quite refreshing,\" and thanked him for his  \" very supportive stance\" regarding the US-Israel relationship.  \" I don't ever remember coming out of a meeting where there was total unanimity in the positive feelings that everyone had in your comments,\" Barnett wrote, thanking the senator for being willing to  \" get to know the facts and then to let us know the facts.\"\n\nBiden's pro-Israel advocacy didn't proceed in a straight line. Throughout the early 1970s, Biden cast several votes against military aid to Israel, usually when packaged with military spending more broadly, such as to Vietnam or Cambodia. Through 1975, he waged a headline-grabbing, almost one-man campaign against an Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement on the same basis he had once allegedly said was his personal view, that \"we shouldn't get tied down to countries like this.\" Biden vehemently opposed the deal's apparent requirement of sending two hundred US civilian technicians to Sinai to operate radar stations because it could \"prove to be just the beginning of an ever-expanding American presence in the Mideast,\" drag the United States into a \"moral quagmire\" and \"bind us.\"\n\nBut Biden still found himself on the list of seventy-six senators telling the president, in May 1975, that cutting back US aid for Israel would be dangerous, then the largest number to have ever signed a pro-Israel letter or resolution. That letter came only one month after Biden told local pro-Israel advocates he would \"change his principles to support aid for Israel if necessary.\"\n\nBy the latter half of the decade, Biden sounded much more like \"one of Israel's most ardent backers\" in Congress, as he was often called. Biden waged a similarly ferocious, losing campaign against Jimmy Carter's plan, opposed by Israel, to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Two weeks from his first reelection, his campaign ran an ad in the Jewish Voice - \"an open letter to the Jewish community\" urging a vote for Biden and signed by dozens of community members - touting these efforts, insisting \"that Joe Biden's support for Israel is more than an interested concern. It is a heartfelt commitment.\"\n\nThe following year, in what one senator called a \"valuable test\" of whether US support for Israel was shrinking, Biden voted with the overwhelming Senate majority against cutting $100 million from a $1 billion military aid package to Israel, as well as with the much smaller majority who narrowly beat back an attempt to cut it by 5 percent. A month earlier, he had received a standing ovation from a pro-Israel group in Pittsburgh as he called for the United States to reestablish its \"special relationship\" with Israel and commit to more military aid.\n\nBiden's public rhetoric began stressing Israel as a core part of US security. After Reagan's election, Biden would find himself consistently to the right of the famously pro-Israel Republican, fighting his 1981 arms sale to the Saudis once Israel officially came out against it - a major AIPAC priority - and pushing legislation, that Reagan opposed, stepping up US aid to Israel while alleviating its US debt. Another key example was his justification of hard-wing Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin's brutal war on Lebanon, which had so outraged the US public, even Reagan moved to end it.\n\n\"What did you do in Lebanon? You annihilated what you annihilated,\" Biden told Begin, according to Begin's recollection. \"It was great! It had to be done! If attacks were launched from Canada into the United States, everyone here would have said, 'Attack all the cities of Canada, and we don't care if all the civilians get killed.'\"\n\nLess than a week after the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon in 1982, Biden flew to a retreat held by the United Jewish Appeal Young Leadership Cabinet, where he spoke alongside AIPAC's executive director and an official at the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC, named Benjamin Netanyahu. A year later, even as other pro-Israel politicians urged Israel to withdraw from the country, Biden insisted that \"Israel's presence in Lebanon is vitally important.\"\n\nHis steadfast backing reflected only one segment of Jewish opinion. In Delaware, Jewish Voice assistant editor Bill Frank excoriated the JFD, which put out the publication, for dragging its feet on issuing an ultimately weak statement on the massacre, noting the outrage at Begin's government both in Israel and among Jewish leaders around the country that followed.\n\nBiden's closeness to the pro-Israel lobby deepened through the 1980s, speaking regularly at AIPAC conferences and other events. AIPAC was deeply embedded in Biden's 1987 presidential campaign, which members of the lobby group donated to, fundraised for and served on, with five former AIPAC staffers ending up in key posts, turning his campaign into a fundraising juggernaut. \"The candidate's all-important National Finance Committee is well stocked with AIPAC activists and regional United Jewish Appeal leaders,\" reported the Detroit Jewish News .\n\nThe relationship remained strong even after his first tilt at the presidency fizzled out. In June 1989, one year before Biden's third Senate reelection, he wrote a letter to major pro-Israel backers Stephen Lowey, an antitrust lawyer, and his wife Nita, who had then just won a congressional seat while insisting she was \"firmly opposed to an independent Palestinian state.\"\n\n\"You have helped me in the past, and I need your help again,\" read Biden's hand-signed letter to the couple. \"If I can amass a substantial warchest by June 30, I'm convinced this special fundraising effort will clearly impact on potential opposition, and do more to help my reelection than would many such contributions later.\"\n\nAs an incumbent president going into reelection (until he wasn't), Biden has relied heavily on pro-Israel fundraising. According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz , the president has benefited from a \"a deep groundswell of support\" from pro-Israel megadonors, who have given him millions of dollars.\n\nOne of those megadonors - entertainment mogul Haim Saban, who once said of himself, \"I'm a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel\" - was swift to criticism after Biden took initial tentative steps to halt arms deliveries to Israel, pausing shipments of five-hundred-pound and two-thousand-pound bombs in May over concerns about a ground invasion of Rafah, where 1.2 million Palestinians had been corralled on the premise that it was safe.\n\n\"Bad, Bad, Bad, decision, on all levels, Pls reconsider,\" Saban emailed two of Biden's top advisors. \"Let's not forget there are more Jewish voters who care about Israel than Muslim voters who care about Hamas.\"\n\nBiden ultimately did little to stop the Rafah invasion from proceeding, despite publicly calling it a \"red line,\" with disastrous human consequences. Before too long, Biden reversed his pause on the five-hundred-pound bombs.\n\nWe may never know exactly what has gone into the president's thinking on US-Israel policy. It may well be that the president's thinking exists in a different political reality, one forged all those decades ago in the crucible of an ambitious young man's unlikely Senate victory, far removed from a world where Israeli policies have lost the support of so many and voter anger over an ongoing massacre of Palestinians has become the political liability it has - and may leave the legacy it will.\n\nThis is a co-publication with In These Times .\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But he was central to the racist drive to lock people up and throw the key.\n\nFrom crime to privatization to Wall Street, the story of Joe Biden's career has been the story of the Democratic Party's forty-year-long right turn. Every step of the way, he was there urging the party to push the rightward shift even further.\n\nFor Republicans, Joe Biden has long been the ideal negotiating partner - because he's so willing to cave in on most anything Republicans want.\n\nAfter September 11, George W. Bush decided to blaze a path of death and destruction in Iraq by invading. He was given crucial assistance by Joe Biden.\n\nPundits are panicking about whether the Left will help Joe Biden defeat Trump. The former vice president probably doesn't want it, but here's some advice for him from the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\nRonald Reagan successfully dismantled the New Deal order and pulled liberals rightward. Reagan transformed the Democratic Party - and he was aided by Democrats like Joe Biden.\n\nJoe Biden just announced his candidacy for president. Of all the terrible candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, he is the worst.\n\nWhy has Joe Biden been such a die-hard defender of Benjamin Netanyahu's genocidal campaign against Gaza? The answer can be found in part through a deep dive into Biden's early political career.\n\nNo one expected Joe Biden to rein in US empire. But after 100 days, he's been terrible even on his own terms - failing to reenter the Iran nuclear deal, coddling authoritarian leaders like Mohammed bin Salman, and looking on as countries like India are pummeled by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nIt was inevitable that Biden's unsavory record would eventually get the scrutiny it deserves. Last night, it finally started to happen.\n\nJoe Biden didn't just vote to invade Iraq - he worked hard alongside George W. Bush to persuade the public to back it. Biden holds significant responsibility for the bloodshed that has engulfed Iraq and the surrounding region since the invasion.\n\nFrom immigration and foreign policy to the pandemic and climate, Joe Biden promised a break with the policies of the Donald Trump era. What we've mostly gotten, however, is a change in rhetoric and the status quo in substance.\n\nJoe Biden's string of primary victories highlights a central paradox of his career: he has secured the loyalty of African American voters while working nonstop to let them down.\n\nFor years, Joe Biden was determined to make Democrats the tough-on-crime party. The 1994 Crime Bill and its expansion of mass incarceration was his crowning achievement.\n\nA new poll reports that 20% of voters in five key swing states are less likely to vote for Joe Biden because of his support for Israel's war on Gaza. It suggests that his policy has been not just morally monstrous but maybe politically disastrous too.\n\nJoe Biden delivered the speech of the convention and maintains a large lead in what should be an unlosable election. So why does it feel like it could all suddenly fall apart?\n\nIn the latest media parlor game, the players try to convince each other that Joe Biden could actually campaign as a progressive. We already know the answer: he can't, because his record is so abysmal.\n\nJoe Biden likes to portray himself as a civil rights champion. But in the 1970s, he was a prominent opponent of one of the era's key desegregation measures: school busing.\n\nJoe Biden's obsession with bipartisanship for its own sake made him a risky bet as leader. Now, with the prospects of the Build Back Better bill seemingly waning, it may have unraveled his presidency.\n\n{{ message }}"

In a new letter, 27 Democratic senators are demanding the administration stop trying to overturn court rulings that help student debtors.\n\nDespite Joe Biden's campaign promise to allow borrowers to discharge their student debts through bankruptcy, the administration has continued to fight debtors in bankruptcy court. (Gage Skidmore / Flickr)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSenate Democrats are demanding the Joe Biden administration back off its attempts to overturn court rulings that help student debtors. The new demands were prompted by our original series showing the administration has been betraying Biden's campaign promise to allow borrowers to discharge their student debts through bankruptcy. Instead, the administration has fought debtors in bankruptcy court.\n\n\"Over the past several decades, Congress and the courts have together nearly eliminated bankruptcy as a viable path towards financial recovery for most Americans struggling with student loan debt,\" twenty-seven Democratic senators wrote in a letter to the Education Department and Justice Department on March 31, the Washington Post reported. \"The federal government's aggressive litigation challenges against students who pursue undue hardship claims further exacerbates this situation,\" the letter added.\n\nThe letter comes days before a scheduled protest at the Department of Education to press the Biden administration to cancel student debt.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a prominent advocate of initiatives that have made it difficult for Americans to reduce their student debts in bankruptcy court. Borrowers are forced to undergo a separate proceeding to handle their student loans, known as an \"adversary proceeding,\" where they must prove that the debt is causing them \"undue hardship.\"\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Biden pivoted on the issue, endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) plan to allow borrowers to discharge their student debt through the bankruptcy process like other types of consumer debt. Unfortunately, the rhetorical change from Biden hasn't translated into a policy change, and Biden officials have continued to fight student loan debtors in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIn February, we first reported that Biden administration lawyers were trying to overturn a court ruling allowing Ryan Wolfson, a thirty-five-year-old epipleptic man saddled with $100,000 of student debt, to have the loans discharged in bankruptcy court. After our story about Wolfson went viral, the Biden administration abruptly withdrew the appeal.\n\nAs we have reported , the case was no anomaly. On the contrary, the administration has been systematically pursuing much the same legal strategy against the most financially beleaguered student debtors across the country. (The Education Department withdrew an appeal in a similar case after our follow-up story.)\n\nIn response to that reporting, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer told The Lever that he \"absolutely\" supported demands by activists that the Education Department stop opposing borrowers seeking student loan relief in bankruptcy cases. \"It's outrageous that other people get to declare bankruptcy but students can't,\" he said at the time.\n\nNow, twenty-seven Senate Democrats, led by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, are echoing that declaration in a letter to the administration.\n\n\"We are pleased that [the Education Department] changed course in the Wolfson case and decided not to spend taxpayer dollars attempting to force this individual to continue shouldering crushing debt,\" the senators wrote in their letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this case has been an exception to the standard practice,\" the senators' letter said, referring to the administration dropping the Wolfson case.\n\nThe letter calls upon the Biden administration to update its guidance on how it handles federal student debt bankruptcy cases, including by identifying cases where the borrower faces \"undue hardship\" in repaying their debt as a result of disability or financial circumstances.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nJulia Rock is a reporter for the Lever .\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSeveral of President Joe Biden's most powerful appointees and advisers have had business relationships with pharmaceutical giants lobbying the administration on COVID-19 and intellectual property issues, according to documents we reviewed.\n\nThose ties - and Biden's longtime alliance with pharmaceutical industry interests - could prove particularly relevant as drug companies now try to defang any new waiver of patent rules that might reduce their profits and facilitate the wider distribution of vaccines to COVID-afflicted countries.\n\nLast summer, Biden broke with his own legislative record and pledged to support relaxing those intellectual property rules to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine, saying it \"is the only humane thing in the world to do.\" With the pandemic creating a full-fledged humanitarian crisis in India this spring, Biden's administration on Wednesday issued a statement reiterating that general promise.\n\n\"This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures,\" said United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai in a press release . \"The administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\nThe declaration was widely hailed by public interest groups, who feared the administration would follow past precedent and oppose any emergency action on patents.\n\nHowever, Tai's statement was narrow: it only mentioned COVID vaccines and avoided endorsing an existing , broad waiver proposed by India and South Africa which would cover \"diagnostic kits, vaccines, medicines, personal protective equipment and ventilators.\" Her statement also preemptively warned that the \"negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved\" - a process that could provide drugmakers an opening to try to limit a final waiver.\n\n\"This is a magnificent development,\" said Global Trade Watch's Lori Wallach of the Biden administration's general support for a waiver. \"For it to translate into ending the COVID pandemic as quickly as possible, a final waiver text must include the full set of intellectual property barriers and must cover vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nPharmaceutical stocks dipped after Tai's announcement, and the industry is already criticizing the Biden administration's support for relaxing intellectual property rules. However, the decision from the Biden administration to not immediately support the existing WTO waiver proposal may ultimately prove to be an important win for drug companies. Public health advocates are already warning that drug companies will likely intensify their efforts to narrow any new measure.\n\n\"(Biden's waiver) is on vaccines, but it's not on diagnostics or therapeutics or other things in the pandemic,\" said James Love, director of the DC-based nonprofit Knowledge Ecology International, which focuses on intellectual property issues as they pertain to health care and access to knowledge. He added that Tai's assertion that the negotiations will take time is \"not a good thing right now.\"\n\nThe granular details of the waiver will be negotiated by a Biden administration populated by individuals with significant pharmaceutical investments and whose previous employers worked for a panoply of pharmaceutical giants. That includes drugmakers currently lobbying the White House on intellectual property.\n\nAmong them are:\n\nAntony Blinken: Before he was appointed secretary of state, Blinken helped form a corporate consulting firm called WestExec Advisors. His client list included pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences, which manufactures remdesivir , the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID. Several US government agencies \"conducted or funded much of the preclinical and clinical development of remdesivir,\" according to a report from Knowledge Ecology International.\n\nBetween January and March, Gilead reported lobbying Congress and Blinken's State Department on \"international trade and protection of intellectual property; compulsory licensing and other IP issues in multiple countries.\"\n\nGilead recently made headlines announcing it would give India 450,000 vials of remdesivir and help ramp up production of its antiviral drug in the pandemic-ravaged country. On Tuesday, Gilead sued the Russian government after it allowed a domestic company to manufacture remdesivir.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield: Biden's ambassador to the United Nations previously worked for the consulting firm Albright Stonebridge Group, which has represented Pfizer.\n\nJennifer O'Malley Dillon: Biden's deputy chief of staff was a founding partner of consulting firm Precision Strategies, which has worked for both Gilead and Pfizer. O'Malley Dillon's former colleague at the firm, Stephanie Cutter, is an adviser to a new nonprofit, Building Back Together, created to support Biden's agenda. The organization listed its business address as Precision Strategies' office in DC corporate records.\n\nAnita Dunn: Dunn's job as a senior adviser in the Biden White House is only temporary , which means she doesn't have to file a public financial disclosure. But her firm, SKDK, has also worked for Pfizer.\n\nSteve Ricchetti: Currently serving as a counselor to Biden, Ricchetti used to be a lobbyist for pharmaceutical companies like Novartis as well as Eli Lilly and Sanofi. Those companies are top manufacturers of insulin, which is significantly more expensive in the United States than in many other countries.\n\nSteve's brother, Jeff Ricchetti, runs a lobbying firm, Ricchetti Inc., which has seen a boom in business since Biden won the presidency. His current clients include pharmaceutical firm Vaxart, which is working on a tablet-based COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBiden is also reportedly considering attorney Ellisen Turner for director of the US Patent and Trademark Office. Turner, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis , counts Gilead among his past clients. Turner has worked on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to prevent the development of generic drugs.\n\nOutside the administration, Biden's former legislative affairs director, Sudafi Henry, recently started lobbying for medical device company Abbott Laboratories on COVID issues , according to federal disclosures. Abbott has significant business in India and produces coronavirus tests, and could thus have an interest in whether any international trade waiver includes diagnostic tests in addition to vaccines.\n\nOn Thursday, Politico reported that Kwabena Nsiah, who served as chief of staff to former congressman and current White House senior adviser Cedric Richmond, was joining Henry's firm.\n\nBiden's decision to stock his administration with pharmaceutical industry allies tracks with his own previous record. Hailing from Delaware, the home state of the US headquarters of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, he has periodically aligned himself with drugmakers on patent issues.\n\nThroughout his career, Biden has supported trade legislation strengthening pharmaceutical patent rules. That includes voting for the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which backed the original World Trade Organization negotiating round that created the restrictive system of patents known as the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in the first place. Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies pushed hard for TRIPS, and the new agreement required member countries to enact national laws providing a minimum standard of intellectual property protection. Predictably, after its establishment, drug prices soared.\n\nIn 2000, Biden was one of eight Democratic senators to vote with Republicans against reinstating the government's ability to compel reasonable pricing for pharmaceutical products developed with federal assistance after the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under pressure from industry, surrendered its ability to do so five years earlier.\n\nYears later, as vice president, Biden once again acquiesced to the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, India's Patent Office granted a compulsory license to patents for Sorafenib, a cancer drug marketed as Nexavar by German pharmaceutical giant Bayer. The license allowed Indian manufacturers to produce generic versions for the country's market at a greatly reduced price. The Indian government was planning to do the same for dozens of expensive cancer drugs.\n\nBayer took the matter to court, and the pharmaceutical industry appealed to the Obama administration. In response, Vice President Biden visited the country and successfully pressured the Indian government not to grant any further licenses.\n\nThree years after his success in blocking affordable generic cancer drugs in India, Biden wrote a letter to Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos Calderón expressing the administration's concerns about his country's efforts to produce affordable generic cancer drugs.\n\nAs vice president, Biden was also a major proponent of the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which would have strengthened patent exclusivity and included protections against bulk purchasing by governments.\n\nAs the Sunlight Foundation noted at the time: \"At the behest of the pharmaceutical industry, the U.S. is also pushing to limit the ability of national regulatory agencies to support generic drug development.\" Speaking at the Export-Import Bank's 2013 Annual Conference, Biden called the TPP \"the most ambitious trade agreement underway in the world\" and said it would be the \"metric\" by which future trade agreements were measured.\n\nConsidering his past efforts, pharmaceutical interests were likely optimistic about Biden's support once he was elected president. Pfizer, which has manufactured one of the most widely used COVID vaccines in the United States, donated $1 million to Biden's inaugural committee.\n\nIn 2019, the Associated Press reported that drugmakers Johnson & Johnson, Amgen, GlaxoSmithKline, and Bristol Myers Squibb were \"among a host of corporate partners and other groups that work on cancer-related projects promoted by\" the Biden Cancer Initiative, a nonprofit Biden started after his time as vice president.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Biden administration's waiver announcement this week, drugmakers manufacturing vaccines and other COVID-related products had already been gearing up for battle. In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the pharmaceutical industry spent $92 million on federal lobbying efforts, much of it focused on fortifying intellectual property rules .\n\nThey were recently boosted by a letter from Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) to the Biden administration, arguing that the waiver requested by India and South Africa \"would allow for the creation of entire industries in these countries that will compete with American companies in the development of cutting-edge health care technologies.\"\n\nJudging from the posture of its major Washington lobbying organizations, the pharmaceutical industry is united against any coronavirus vaccine waiver. Even companies that do not produce COVID vaccines likely fear that any waiver could set a precedent for weakening patents on other life-saving medicines.\n\n\"This change in longstanding American policy will not save lives,\" wrote Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), one of the biggest lobbying groups in DC, with $459 million in revenue in 2019. \"It also flies in the face of President Biden's stated policy of building up American infrastructure and creating jobs by handing over American innovations to countries looking to undermine our leadership in biomedical discovery.\"\n\nBiotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), a lobbying group that represents COVID vaccine makers Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, wrote a letter threatening that the Biden administration's waiver \"decision will act as a disincentive to companies to respond to the next pandemic.\"\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry argues that companies are being generous by developing extremely lucrative medicines.\n\n\"It is not true that the U.S. government underwrites our manufacturing efforts,\" said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla during an earnings call last month. \"The orders that we had received from the U.S. government were only going to be delivered - and the U.S. government was only going to pay us - if the vaccine was successful, if the vaccine was successful in receiving regulatory approval, and if the vaccine was successful to the manufactured. The risk all was with us.\"\n\nIn truth, however, most of the leading COVID vaccines being distributed around the world, including those from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, rely on technology developed by government scientists at the NIH.\n\nThe companies also benefited from the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed program. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson received federal assistance for research and development, while the government promised to purchase nearly $2 billion worth of Pfizer doses should they prove effective.\n\nThese considerations, as well as the Biden White House's long-standing ties to the pharmaceutical industry, could all come into play as the administration hammers out the details of the vaccine waiver it has pledged to support.\n\n\"I think the most important thing is this (announcement) sort of shifts the conversation from, like, 'We can't do anything; the companies' got it under control; let's listen to Bill Gates ' - all that sort of stuff was kind of out the window,\" said Love of Knowledge Ecology International. \"Now it's a little bit like, 'We have to do something, let's talk about what needs to be done, not what we can't do.'\"\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

Antony Blinken, Biden's pick for secretary of state, has been consulting for giant companies with interests before his new department, as well.\n\nOn Friday, Politico reported that Yellen, who served as Federal Reserve chair from 2014 to 2018, had raked in millions from speeches to Wall Street firms and other corporate interests. After spending the past four years criticizing the Trump administration's corruption, some liberals are now arguing that Yellen's paid speeches aren't relevant or worth reporting - even though the payouts are sizable and germane to her prospective job in government.\n\n\"Seriously - are you kidding me?\" MSNBC host and former Wall Street executive Stephanie Ruhle said about Politico 's story. She added: \"Janet Yellen was paid market value.\" Former Foreign Policy editor David Rothkopf asked whether Politico would prefer that Yellen had \"taken a vow of poverty and spent her non-government work time sitting in a convent scribbling formulas with a quill pen?\"\n\nYellen's financial disclosure shows she made more than $7 million from speaking fees in just the three years after she left her government job. The bulk of the money, $4 million, came from companies and trade groups that have reported lobbying the Treasury Department in the past two years, according to a Daily Poster review of lobbying records.\n\nRetired politicians, former senior government officials, and prominent journalists often collect five- and six-figure checks for giving paid speeches to big corporations or trade associations that lobby for them in Washington.\n\nAs common as \"buckraking\" is, however, the practice creates obvious potential for conflicts of interest - after all, powerful people are getting paid anywhere from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars by special interests for doing very little.\n\nMany of the financial firms, banks, and industry groups paying Yellen will have business before her Treasury Department.\n\nWhile Yellen pledged in an ethics form that she will recuse from matters involving some companies for one year, she only promised to \"seek written authorization\" in order to participate in matters involving a number of financial firms that regularly lobby the Treasury Department, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Citadel. Yellen said she would do so for one year from when she last made paid speeches to the companies.\n\nInvestment bank Citigroup paid Yellen a combined $1.1 million for six speeches between March 2019 and October 2020. The company lobbied the Treasury Department this year on COVID-19 relief, \"financial reform rules, housing finance reform, cyber security legislation, and anti-money laundering legislation.\"\n\nHedge fund Citadel lobbied the Treasury and Congress on \"legislative and regulatory services relating to tax treatment of investment partnerships and financial products, including issues relating to Tax Cuts & Jobs Act,\" the GOP's 2017 tax law. Citadel paid Yellen $810,000 for three speeches.\n\nGoldman Sachs, which paid Yellen $67,500 for a speech in June, reported lobbying Congress and the Treasury this year on the implementation of Democrats' 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law and \"issues related to capital and resolution.\"\n\nDodd-Frank established capital requirements mandating big banks have certain reserves on hand to protect against future collapses and resolution authority for winding down failed financial institutions.\n\nYellen's ethics commitments form made no mention of other companies that lobby the Treasury Department, such as the Swiss bank UBS. Yellen received $112,500 from UBS for a speech in January 2019.\n\nUBS reported lobbying Congress and the Treasury this year on the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), a tax that was included as part of Trump's 2017 tax bill.\n\nBEAT was supposed to prevent multinational corporations from shifting their profits from the United States to evade taxes, but UBS and other foreign banks have successfully lobbied the Treasury to enact rules exempting them from the provision.\n\nWhile liberal pundits slammed Politico for reporting on Yellen's speaking fees, they largely ignored the story's news about two other Biden cabinet nominees.\n\nBlinken, Biden's secretary of state-designate, disclosed his clients at the secretive consulting firm WestExec Advisors. Biden's nominee for director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, reported that she was paid $180,000 by controversial data-mining company and US intelligence contractor Palantir.\n\nIt's become increasingly common in Washington for former government officials to work as strategic consultants instead of lobbyists - marketing their high-level government experience and extensive relationships while avoiding certain activities that would require them to register to lobby and publicly reveal their clients.\n\nWestExec, which Blinken cofounded , seemed to be built around that premise. Haines previously worked as a principal at WestExec, as well.\n\nAccording to a Daily Poster review, Blinken advised seven companies that have recently lobbied the State Department - including aerospace manufacturer Boeing; the Blackstone Group, the world's largest private equity firm; social media giant Facebook; and pharmaceutical company Gilead.\n\nBoeing is one of the country's largest defense contractors, relying on the US government for a substantial portion of its revenue. The State Department helps Boeing sell commercial planes overseas, and it also approves foreign arms deals by companies like Boeing.\n\nBlackstone is in the defense contractor business , too - and the company is investing in infrastructure around the world with funding from Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund.\n\nAccording to his ethics filing , Blinken plans to sell his stakes in WestExec entities, which are worth as much as $6 million, within nineties days of his confirmation. Blinken made no commitments to recuse from matters involving his former clients or WestExec clients, pledging only to seek prior authorization before participating in matters involving such businesses for a period of one year.\n\nBlinken has also served as a partner at Pine Island Capital Partners, a private equity firm that's said it's looking to invest in \"defense, government service, and aerospace businesses.\" The firm's DC partners include a number of former top national security officials, diplomats, and congressional leaders.\n\nIn September, the firm set up a new \"blank check company\" in Delaware called Pine Island Acquisition Corp. and started seeking investments.\n\nPine Island Acquisition Corp. promised investors that the company will leverage its roster of former defense and government officials to capitalize on \"increased demand in the US defense market for advanced electronics, communications, sensor and detection processing and other technologies that enhance the modernization efforts of the Department of Defense's military readiness.\"\n\nBlinken listed Pine Island Acquisition Corp. among his employment assets in his financial disclosure.\n\nAndrew Perez is a writer and researcher living in Maine.\n\nWalker Bragman is a journalist and JD whose work has been featured in Paste Magazine , the Intercept , HuffPost , the Independent , Salon , Truthout , and the Hill .\n\nJulia Rock is a contributing writer for the Daily Poster .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Monster of 2024: Joe Biden\n\nMother Jones illustration; Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty\n\nThe staff of Mother Jones is, once again, rounding up the heroes and monsters of the past year. Importantly, this is a completely non-exhaustive and subjective list, giving our reporters a chance to write about something that brought joy or discontent. Enjoy.\n\nWhen was the 2024 presidential election really lost?\n\nMaybe you'd argue (though I would not) that it was the rubber-stamp nominating process for Vice President Kamala Harris. You could point, on a symbolic level, to Trump's fist pump after surviving an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. For a time, it seemed like the clearest answer to this was the first debate , when President Joe Biden melted down on stage. But I think if you want to pinpoint when things went irreversibly downhill, you have to go back further-to the aftermath of the midterms two years ago, when a then-80-year-old Biden moved ahead with his plan to run for a second term.\n\nBiden had always insisted that he was never planning on being a one-term president. Still, he tried to allay concerns about his age that dogged him even in 2020 by referring to himself as a generational \"bridge,\" and behind the scenes, aides offered context for his public denials. \"He's going into this thinking, 'I want to find a running mate I can turn things over to after four years, but if that's not possible or doesn't happen, then I'll run for reelection,'\" an aide told Politico in 2019. \"But he's not going to publicly make a one-term pledge.\" After a strong showing in the midterms against a predicted red wave, any notion of a smooth transition to the next in line-or a competitive primary-went out the window. Democrats shuffled around their primary calendar to warn off challengers. And that was that. Biden was dead set on running, he argued, because the stakes were too high and he was the best candidate for the job.\n\nThat was, in hindsight, sort of the opposite of the case. Biden only got more and more unpopular, and it was hard to separate the general public anxiety about his advancing age from the general national malaise that was bringing him down. The line from the Democrats was that there was something ageist and unfair about all of this-if you can do the job, you can do the job. That was a bit cynical: Biden's own aides reportedly thought he could do his job best between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and internal rumblings about his stamina dated back to the early months of the administration. The disastrous debate finally put an end to the facade, even if the complaints that this was all a vast media conspiracy persisted in some corners.\n\nIt would perhaps be more forgivable if it were just denial. But Biden, who positioned himself as the defender of the nation's \" soul ,\" continued to act as though only he could win the election, when in reality, he was tanking the Democratic brand so severely that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had to stage an intervention .\n\nBy staying long past his expiration date, Biden did more than ease Trump's path to victory; he was the apotheosis of an entire gerontocracy that brought us to this point. (He came back to win the nomination in 2020 only after the party closed ranks to stop the even-older Bernie Sanders.) As Semafor 's Dave Weigel recently observed , you could tell the recent history of the party through the people who didn't quit when they should have. Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's death threatened to blow up the Affordable Care Act. Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, after she declined to retire when Democrats could still replace her, likely cemented several decades of right-wing dominance on the Supreme Court. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein's refusal to quit hampered Democrats on the judiciary committee. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin is 80; Schumer is a sprightly 74. Nancy Pelosi, 84, who led the House Democratic Caucus for nearly two decades, demonstrated her unique gifts when she adeptly nudged Biden out of the race-but she was still out there after the election, working behind the scenes to block New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from defeating Virginia's Gerry Connolly (74) for ranking member of the oversight committee.\n\nThe Biden reelection bid was, above all, uncomfortable; he was a walking reminder of our own mortality.\n\nEvery piece about Biden since the election has also included a few sentences like the ones that follow. His record, domestically, was pretty good, especially when you consider the sorts of people the rest of America sent to work with him. I can rattle off the policies that everyone of my general persuasion always does-his belief in industrial policy, his efforts to link climate change adaptation to a growing green economy, his embrace of labor unions. Biden's team dramatically reshaped the government's approach to corporate monopolies. His management of the post-Covid global economic crisis ultimately left the United States in a far better place than it might have otherwise. But it is hard to convince people things are getting better when the messenger himself kept looking worse and worse. The Biden reelection bid was, above all, uncomfortable ; he was a walking reminder of our own mortality.\n\nWhen it took the form of a halting gait or an on-camera freeze-up, that weakness could be as humanizing as it was politically damaging. There has always been an emotional heaviness about the man. When that weight took the form of foreign policy, it produced a historic moral abdication. Biden's legacy will be more than a year of virtually unchecked Israeli carnage as the so-called \"rules-based international order\" he championed dissolved into nothing. There was seemingly no line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could not cross. Not the clear \"red line\" on Rafah. Not Netanyahu's invocation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a defense of his flattening of Gaza. Not thousands of dead kids. Not a clearly stated desire to bulldoze the United States government's official preference for a two-state solution. Not the attacks on journalists and aid workers or even the death of American citizens . Biden seemed like the only person in the whole situation who didn't realize that Netanyahu, a right-winger from Philadelphia, was just dog-walking him to get to a president he likes better.\n\n\"To answer the question on everyone's minds: No, Joe Biden does not have a doctorate in foreign affairs,\" senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates wrote on X earlier this year, during a press conference on foreign policy in which the president referred to Harris as \"Vice President Trump.\" \"He's just that fucking good.\"\n\nWell, sometimes even honorary PhDs need a refresher course. The last photo I saw of Biden before I started writing this was of the president leaving a bookstore in Nantucket, clutching a copy of Rashid Khalidi's The Hundred Years' War on Palestine . It felt like a haunting epitaph for an entire era of liberalism-stopping in to do some Black Friday shopping while staying at David Rubenstein's estate and walking away with a book that the author himself said Biden should have checked out years ago. Biden stuck around past the point that he could deliver for the people who needed him to. And now the world is stuck with the consequences.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Dear Joe Biden: Here's How You Can Protect Reproductive Rights From Trump's Zealots\n\nMother Jones illustration; Michael Brochstein/Zuma; Bonnie Cash, Pool Via Cnp/CNP/Zuma\n\nTrump's reelection has been described by advocates and experts as a final blow to reproductive rights.\n\nThese fears are not unfounded. Trump appointed three of the five conservative Supreme Court justices who overruled Roe v. Wade , ending the constitutional right to abortion and unleashing a health care apocalypse . Vulnerable women found themselves in even greater danger thanks to abortion bans in more than a dozen states that have enabled abusers and left doctors fearful of prosecution if they intervene in pregnancy-related emergencies that require abortion care. ProPublica reported such bans appeared to have led to the deaths of several women in Georgia and Texas who were unable to get necessary abortion care when faced with dire medical complications. Add to this, Project 2025 -the 900-plus-page extremist guidebook to a second Trump term- recommends that various federal agencies take sweeping actions to roll back abortion access.\n\nTrump's convictions on abortion have been flexible throughout his career. During the presidential campaign, he tried to distance himself from Project 2025 and claimed he would leave abortion policy \"to the states.\" Immediately after the election, however, his acolytes admitted that \"Project 2025 is the agenda.\"\n\nGiven all this, reproductive rights experts and advocates agree that the future of abortion access is bleak. But there are several actions President Biden and his administration could take before Inauguration Day that could make it harder for the next administration to enact their absolutist anti-abortion agenda. \"Some of [the ideas] are just throwing monkey wrenches into the gears,\" says David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University whose scholarly work focuses on abortion access, \"and maybe with the chaotic Trump administration that helps delay some of the harm.\"\n\n\"Some of [the ideas] are just throwing monkey wrenches into the gears, and maybe with the chaotic Trump administration, that helps delay some of the harm.\"\n\nWhile Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned on \"restoring reproductive freedom,\" it's unclear if the Biden administration will prioritize these requests before the transition. The White House did not respond on the record to the specific proposals mentioned in this story, but pointed to the administration's record of defending and expanding reproductive rights. But some say there's more they can, and should, do. \"If the administration was hesitant or holding off, now is the time, I think, to not hesitate,\" Rachel Rebouché, reproductive rights legal scholar and dean of Temple Law School, says.\n\nHere's a look at some of what the administration could do to stymie the Trump administration's anti-abortion agenda before he's back in the White House.\n\nPreemptively Pardon Providers of Abortion Pills\n\nThe Comstock Act is a 19th-century anti-obscenity law still on the books that anti-abortion Republicans argue should be used to \"enforce federal law against providers and distributors of [abortion] pills.\" In December 2022, Biden's DOJ issued a memo arguing that the law cannot be used to prosecute abortion pill providers. Earlier this year, Democrats in Congress introduced legislation to repeal parts of the bill lawmakers say could be most relevant to abortion, but the measure has languished in House and the Senate committees.\n\nGiven that Project 2025 advises Trump's DOJ to invoke the Comstock Act to prosecute providers of abortion pills, some advocates suggest that Biden preemptively pardon anyone who could be implicated for doing so. Cohen, from Drexel, notes that a preemptive pardon \"would make it so that the people who have been mailing [abortion] pills, or mailing procedural instruments or supplies, are not at risk of being prosecuted.\"\n\nJodi Jacobson, founder and executive director of the initiative Healthcare Across Borders, described the proposal as \"a proactive thing that the Biden administration can do to automatically protect people over the five-year statute of limitations\" for federal offenses . Jacobson oversees a coalition that comprises several reproductive health advocacy organizations that plan to ask the Biden administration to issue the blanket preemptive pardon. \"This is a no-brainer-there is no reason not to do this,\" she says, adding that it would \"take off the table the immediate criminalization of folks who have been trying to save lives.\"\n\nTrump's Food and Drug Administration, though, could still revoke its approval of abortion pills, as Project 2025 recommends-but the preemptive pardon would protect providers who could otherwise face prosecution. Experts concede that while there would likely be legal challenges, \"pardon power is pretty plenary to the president,\" Cohen says. President Gerald Ford preemptively pardoned his predecessor, President Richard Nixon, for instance, which allowed Nixon to avoid Watergate-related charges (but ignited a national outcry). The Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the proposal from Mother Jones .\n\nPush to Fill V acancies in the Federal Judiciary\n\nBiden cannot shift the balance of the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority before he leaves office, but the president and Senate Democrats do have the power to attempt to fill the 47 vacancies for open seats in the federal judiciary, mostly in federal district courts.\n\n\"We know the federal courts will continue to be central in the fight for reproductive freedom; the administration and Congress must be vigilant now in safeguarding our rights as much as possible,\" Karen Stone, vice president of public policy and government relations at Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement provided to Mother Jones .\n\n\"We know the federal courts will continue to be central in the fight for reproductive freedom; the administration and Congress must be vigilant now in safeguarding our rights as much as possible.\"\n\nThe significance of these lifetime appointments for the future of reproductive rights becomes apparent when you consider Matthew Kacsmaryk. He's a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas who issued an anti-science ruling last year that paved the way for anti-abortion activists to bring a case to the Supreme Court challenging the FDA's approval of mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion. (The justices ultimately struck down the case, ruling that the anti-abortion plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit, as my colleague Nina Martin reported .)\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court sent the case on emergency abortion care back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals-a federal court in California with 10 Trump-appointed judges and jurisdiction over more than a dozen district courts in nine states. \"The power of lower court federal judges is immense,\" Cohen says, \"because the Supreme Court only deals with such a limited number of cases.\"\n\nOnce Biden makes a nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee, currently chaired by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), recommends whether to send nominees to a full floor vote, which is required for their confirmation. A spokesperson for Durbin's office said that, as of Wednesday morning, there were 16 nominees ready for a floor vote, and eight more who have had committee hearings and are waiting for a committee vote. The spokesperson added that Durbin \"aims to confirm every possible nominee before the end of this Congress.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, \"We are going to get as many done as we can.\"\n\nBut that won't necessarily be easy. Trump said in a social media post this weekend that \"no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership.\" Indeed, for Senate Democrats, time is of the essence. The next session of Congress begins January 3, just over two weeks before Trump takes office-so Biden's nominees would need to be approved by after the New Year to make it onto the bench. Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), whose vote is crucial in the tight Senate, may once again undermine Democrats' plans. He told Politico in March he would not support any Biden-nominated judge unless they have at least one Republican supporter.\n\nStill, several advocates say they hope Senate Democrats make the necessary effort to get as many Biden-nominated judges approved as possible, considering the influence they'll likely have on the future of reproductive rights. \"If [getting judges approved] means working over Thanksgiving, working over Christmas, working over New Year's-do it,\" Cohen says. \"This is not something that should be gifted to Trump.\" One way they could speed circumvent Republican opposition is by dispensing with a tradition known as \"blue slips,\" in which senators weigh in on whether or not they support the federal court nominees for their state. There is precedent for this: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), former chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, abandoned the tradition-to the ire of Democrats -to get two Trump-nominated judges confirmed despite opposition from their home states' Democratic senators. With only two months until the next Congress, Senate Democrats may not want to buck this tradition, though; they may want to keep \"blue slips\" as a weapon in their own arsenal as they anticipate Trump's nominees to the federal judiciary.\n\nFinalize Pending Reproductive Health-Related Rules for Federal Agencies\n\nThe Biden administration made headlines last month when it announced a proposed rule to allow 52 million women with private health insurance to obtain over-the-counter contraception for free under the Affordable Care Act. (Trump, on the other hand, has said he wants to \"replace\" Obamacare. And while he claims he would not restrict contraception access, it will face myriad threats in his administration, as my colleague Madison Pauly recently reported .)\n\nBut the contraception rule has yet to be finalized , and its pathway to becoming a reality is less straightforward than the optimistic White House press release suggests. After the public comment period-which has, so far, only attracted 2 people-ends on December 27, officials will analyze the comments and then write the final rule, which could then not even take effect for another 30 days.\n\nUnlike executive orders, which can be wiped out with the stroke of a pen, rules approved for federal agencies are typically harder to undo. That's thanks to the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines the process of how a proposed rule becomes a finalized regulation, and requires that federal agencies do not act in a way that is \"arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\" Rebouché, from Temple Law School, says the administration needs to aim to get the contraception rule-and any other similar ones-finalized as soon as possible. \"Any rule that's already in process, push forward,\" she says.\n\nKatie O'Connor, senior director of federal abortion policy at the National Women's Law Center, would like to see the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's promise to launch a rule focused on ensuring \"modern-day digital data brokers are not misusing or abusing our sensitive data\" come to pass. An investigation by the office of Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) earlier this year found that a data broker tracked visits by individuals to 600 Planned Parenthood locations across the country and then sold the data for an anti-abortion ad campaign. Even though the rule was promised last year, a CFPB spokesperson says they did not have any update.\n\nEven if the agency tried to ram it through, though, any rules that get finalized at this late stage of the administration are at risk of being overturned in the next session of the GOP-controlled Congress, thanks to the Congressional Review Act , notes Steven Balla, associate professor of political science at George Washington University and co-director of the school's Regulatory Studies Center. During Trump's first term, Congress used the legislation to overturn 16 rules issued at the end of the preceding Obama administration-the most of any administration, ever , Balla explains.\n\nComplete Investigations Into Hospitals A c c u s e d o f V i o l a t i n g Federal Law on Emergency Abortion Care\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court heard a case on whether hospitals must provide abortions to people whose lives or health are at risk, even in states with abortion bans, under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act , known as EMTALA. In a 6-3 decision -with Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissenting-the court sent the case back to a lower court, refusing to rule on the merits of the Biden administration's argument that EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency abortion care in states with post- Dobbs abortion bans that lack exceptions for a patient's health. Project 2025 proposes an alternative approach: The guidebook says that \"EMTALA requires no abortions\" and that HHS should stop investigating hospitals that have failed to comply with its interpretation of the law.\n\nAbortion rights advocates say Biden's HHS should complete as many investigations as possible into hospitals that may have violated their interpretation of EMTALA by not providing stabilizing abortion care when needed. Otherwise, the Trump administration would inherit them, a spokesperson for the Center for Reproductive Rights points out.\n\nThat spokesperson added that the organization has also submitted three recent complaints to HHS, focused on hospitals in Texas and Arizona that allegedly violated EMTALA by failing to provide medically necessary abortions to women in need. A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at HHS said the agency does not comment on ongoing investigations.\n\nBut even if these investigations were undertaken and completed before the transition, reports suggest they would be unlikely to face penalties from the Biden administration. Investigations recently published by the Associated Press found that more than 100 pregnant women were turned away from emergency rooms while they were in medical distress over the past two years, and that none of those hospitals were fined . Last year, HHS announced it was investigating two unnamed hospitals for allegedly violating the law by failing to offer a woman with a nonviable pregnancy the abortion care she needed. The National Women's Law Center said it filed the complaint on behalf of Mylissa Farmer and identified the hospitals as Freeman Hospital West in Joplin, Missouri, and the University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kansas. A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Mother Jones Wednesday, \"Both hospitals are back in compliance,\" but did not clarify whether they had faced monetary penalties.\n\nOne thing that both advocates and officials agree on? Elections have consequences, and there's a limit to what Biden administration can actually do to mitigate the decades-long damage the Trump administration could do to reproductive rights once he takes office. \"The electorate was confused or didn't really care about abortion,\" Cohen says, \"and we're reaping the reality of it.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Joe Biden Promised to Be a Bridge. Democrats Finally Made It to the Other Side.\n\nTim Murphy August 23, 2024\n\nMother Jones; Nate Gowdy(2)\n\nMother Jones; Nate Gowdy(2)\n\nThe operating word of the Democratic National Convention was \"vibes.\" They're good, if you haven't heard. They've shifted. For a group of people often dismissively referred to as \"bedwetters,\" Democrats are as excited as they've ever been at having a roughly 50-50 chance of disaster. There was just a feeling. Everyone from Bill Clinton to Oprah wanted to talk about the \"joy\" the new nominee brought to the race. Attendees told me it felt like 2008. \"Yes she can,\" said Barack Obama. People carried around prints of Vice President Kamala Harris that looked like Shepard Fairey had painted them. I thought I even saw Bill Ayers while walking around in his old neighborhood on Sunday.\n\nA few months ago, such a display of Democratic optimism would have felt impossible. For much of the last eight years, the Democratic Party has been defined by a simmering discontent over the administrations of the past and the primary battles that never ended. Biden, elected in an economic crisis and a global pandemic, had promised to serve as a transitional figure before yielding to a new generation of leaders. But as his reelection bid stumbled, he seemed, instead, like a bridge to nowhere.\n\nChicago offered a glimpse of what a soft-landing looks like, not just for the economy, but for a whole political party. Years of infighting and recriminations yielded to a policy consensus that sounded like an unusually appealing kind of working-class fusionism. Adding dental and vision coverage to Medicare. Stopping corporate price-gouging. Busting monopolies. Passing the PRO Act. Free school lunch and breakfast. On Wednesday, Tim Walz's small-town biography doubled as a story not just about football defensive schemes, but about the crushing weight of medical debt and the imperative for government to wipe it out.\n\nThe sorts of issues that had often festered for years on the party's left-flank were dressed up in a kind of general-interest dad plaid, and pitched to a willing audience by people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The new consensus did not just happen all at once. It happened, in part, because the current president rebuilt trust in what normie Democrats could accomplish. Biden was a bridge after all.  Democrats in Chicago finally found out what was on the other side.\n\nThe change within the party was not just a matter of positive thinking. It was reflected in the substance of the event. The spectacle in Chicago was the total inverse of what transpired at the RNC. In Milwaukee, Trump and Vance had dangled the possibility of a new conservative workers party , in the service of an increasingly monarchical donor class. To make their case, they even rolled out a prominent labor leader, Teamsters president Sean O'Brien, who argued that unions should seek friends in the Republican Party in the fight against \"economic terrorism.\" O'Brien's gimmick seemed a bit credulous at a coronation for a corrupt plutocrat who had kneecapped organized labor as president; it looks even more foolish now.\n\nWhile the RNC offered the illusion of transformation, Democrats showed off their capacity to actually change, and to elevate new leaders and ideas in the service, often enough anyway, of a politics for working people. Instead of O'Brien, the DNC gave a primetime platform to Shawn Fain, the United Auto Workers president, who took off his blazer midway through his speech on Monday to reveal a red union t-shirt that said \"Trump is a scab.\"\n\nFain, who took office in 2023, represented a new direction for an old institution. He was the product of a political revolution within the UAW, aimed at driving out stagnant and corrupt leadership, and as president, he pursued a more aggressive strategy, which culminated in a historic strike at the Big Three automakers last year. (Full disclosure, I am a member of the UAW.) His spokesman is a former organizer for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, and Fain rails frequently against \"the billionaire class.\" But his presence on stage spoke not just to a more ambitious and assertive labor movement, but also to the power of real political partnership-and the changes that Biden, of all people, had brought to politics.\n\nThe new consensus did not just happen all at once. It happened, in part, because the current president rebuilt trust in what normie Democrats could accomplish. Biden was a bridge after all.\n\nThe union's recent successes, he pointed out every chance he got in Chicago, were powered by members but eased along by the White House. In remarks to reporters this week, Fain credited Biden's revamped National Labor Relations Board, which Trump had stacked with corporate picks, for clearing the way for clean elections at notoriously difficult shops. When auto workers went on strike last year, Biden, Fain noted, became the first president to ever walk a picket line. And when workers struck in 2019, Harris, as a presidential candidate, was there too.\n\n\"Plants were closing under Donald Trump,\" Fain said. \"I didn't see Donald Trump save one of them. I didn't see Donald Trump try to save one of them.\"\n\nFain was a ubiquitous figure throughout the week in running shoes and a rotating array of red and blue UAW shirts. The union had sold thousands of \"Trump is a scab\" tees since his speech on Monday. Everywhere he went, delegates-many in red union shirts of their own-would gather around him to have a word or take a photo. (He was also multi-tasking-Fain used his speech to deliver a message to Big Three automaker Stellantis, and even took a bus trip during the week to rally outside the company's plant in Belvidere, Illinois.) On Wednesday morning, after watching Fain quote Ecclesiastes and the \"great poet...Marshall Mathers\" within the span of a few minutes at a breakfast with the Michigan delegation, I asked him about the party's trajectory.\n\n\"After the Reagan years and Bush 1, you saw a shift somewhat where, because laws changed, deregulation happened, the massive tax cuts for the wealthy, trickle-down economics...and I think the party somewhat shifted to try to appease the business class and the corporate class,\" he said, as we walked down an escalator at a Michigan Ave. Hilton. \"I think that hurt in the elections, because when people look at both sides, they see the same people serving the same master.\"\n\nThings were looking up, though. He believed that Harris and Walz, like Biden, would bring the party closer to its \"working-class roots.\"\n\n\"It's gonna take time-it's not gonna happen overnight,\" he said. \"But we're on our way.\"\n\nThe week was a passing of the torch of sorts, not just for Biden and Clinton, but for the man who lost the nomination to both of them, Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator, a more hunched but still fiery 82, is seeking a fourth and perhaps final term this fall, while still mostly talking about the same issues he's been harping on for four decades-getting money out of politics, universal health care, and tackling \"oligarchy.\" At a small confab near the United Center hosted by his longtime allies at the Progressive Democrats of America on Monday, Sanders made a forceful case that the man whom Democrats had rallied behind to stop him from winning the nomination had been a real ally once in office.\n\n\"He was prepared to really bring about structural changes in this country,\" Sanders explained, laying out a wish list from childcare to adding dental and vision coverage into Medicare. \"That was Build Back Better, and we failed with the two corporate Democrats in the Senate-but what I want you to understand is he was prepared to do that.\"\n\n\"You're not gonna hear a lot about Medicare for All\" at the convention, Sanders acknowledged. (Harris, who embraced a variation of the policy in 2019 during her presidential campaign, walked back her support this month.) But Sanders had been a leading voice calling for Biden to stay in the race, in part because of the strength of their working relationship. Although he and Harris are not as close, Sanders sounded positive when we spoke later that night about what a Harris administration might portend.\n\nHarris said the words \"we are not going back\" six times. The dig at Trump was obvious. But it describes where the party is at too.\n\n\"I think the proposals that she has brought forth so far are strong proposals,\" he said. \"I'm really glad that she is focusing on housing, because I will tell you that it's an area that has not gotten the attention that it deserves. And she's right. You got a major housing crisis in Burlington, Vermont, Los Angeles, and every place in between, 650,000 people homeless, millions unable to afford housing, so I'm glad she's focusing on that. I'm glad she's continuing the efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs, which is a huge issue. I'm glad she believes in eliminating medical debt, which is just insane that people go bankrupt because they have cancer. So that's an important issue, and extending the child tax credit that we passed in the rescue plan to lower childhood poverty by 40 percent is also enormous. So I think she's off to a good start.\"\n\nOne of the reasons he was feeling optimistic, Sanders said this week, was because of what he called \"the rebirth and revitalization of the trade union movement.\" In Biden, he had found an ally on the inside, but in Fain-whom he singled out for wearing an \"Eat the Rich\" shirt during last year's strike-Sanders saw the vanguard of a workers movement often aligned with the Democratic Party that could continue to drive change outside of it.\n\nThe gerontocracy at the top of the party has for a long time created the impression of a stultifying institution. The narrowness of the message Biden was capable of articulating-in contrast to the substance of the policies he was working to deliver-created an oppressive sort of aura. It was all harshly whispered words about \"democracy\" and the \"soul of the nation.\" Biden was standing in the way of not just Harris, but of a broader generational transition capable of saying so much more.\n\nIt wasn't just Fain. Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow insurgent once on the fringes on the party, now had roughly the same prominence in the speaker lineup as Hillary Clinton, and attacked the Republican nominee as a \"two-bit union-buster.\" Everywhere you looked, there was some new star in the coalition, or soon-to-be-star in the coalition, seizing their five to 15 minutes to make their case. Many of these figures weren't even in politics during the 2016 primaries. Their ideas and careers had been forged in the reactionary crucible in the Trump years.\n\nPerhaps no one embodied this breakthrough better than Harris herself, a politician whose 2020 presidential candidacy floundered in a party still stuck in 2016, and who wallowed as an occasional punchline as vice president for three years.\n\n\"[O]ur nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward, not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,\" she said in her remarks at the United Center. She said the words \"we are not going back\" six times. The dig at Trump was obvious. But it describes where the party is at too.\n\nGoing into the week, the grumbling, among the grumbling set, was that Harris was big on sunshine and light on specifics. But the program is simple enough: Making things easier for working-people, in easily recognizable ways-affordable housing, affordable groceries, affordable drugs, and affordable families too; the Child Tax Credit that Sanders promoted is such a popular idea that the Republicans who killed it are now running on bringing it back.\n\nDemocrats were also clear-eyed about what they were up against. Throughout the week, a procession of people-Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (first elected: 2018); Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (first elected: 2018); Saturday Night Live star Kenan Thompson-stepped up to the lectern with a comically oversized book, like something out of an old Cistercian Abbey, and announced that this was \"Project 2025.\"\n\nDuring Thompson's faux-SNL sketch, regular people took turns describing their life circumstances, and then Thompson would page through his big book and tell them how they were screwed. A woman named Nirvana happily announced that thanks to Biden and Harris, she pays just $35 a month for insulin. That was getting axed, Thompson cheerfully informed her. Another person said she was an employee at the Department of Education. She would be fired, Thompson explained. Someone else was happily married to a spouse of the same sex. Womp, womp.\n\nThe Project 2025 attacks were the sort of policy evisceration-at various points mean and fun and deeply moving-that I hadn't seen in such portions since Obama's scorched-earth campaign against Bain Capital and Paul Ryan's budget. It is hard to say anything new about Trump. But the key to the Project 2025 attacks was that they didn't just define Republicans as weird and creepy (although they did do that, in a mix of gut-wrenching and clever ways). That big oversized think-tank document gave Democrats a chance to talk about the things they consider normal. They were unafraid to talk about abortion. They went out of their way to talk about fertility treatments. They stood for the bedrock principle of doing what the doctor tells you to do. It fell to Walz, another relative unknown until Biden's exit, to sum up this new middle-ground in his characterstically blunt way: \"Mind your own damn business.\"\n\nThe vibesiest scene at the DNC's vibes-fest this week may have come at \"Hotties for Trump,\" an after-party where hundreds of zoomers picked up \"Fuck Project 2025\" condoms and posed for photos next to a couch that said \"Property of JD Vance.\" The event was bankrolled , like tens of millions of dollars worth of other Democratic operations, by the LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman.\n\nLike the entire Harris campaign itself, the Democratic coalition's kumbaya feel is fragile and potentially fleeting. There are already signs of potential crackups in this new unified front. \"There are some Democratic donors who don't like Lina Khan,\" Sanders told me. \"I happen to think that Lina Khan is the best chair of the FTC that we have seen in a very long time.\"\n\nHoffman begs to differ , and in his criticism of one of the Biden administration's most effective Big Tech trust-busters , you can see the shape of the battles to come. Those grocery stores where Harris wants to crack down on rising costs, for instance, include chains like Kroger -whose merger with Albertson's Khan has put on hold. The week's most glaring stain was the refusal to grant speaking time to a Palestinian-American Georgia state representative and Harris delegate-the sort of cynical and short-sighted move that may haunt a group of people who claim to be the party of moral clarity. And for all their positivity, Democrats are still more or less a coin flip from another catastrophe in November, and a new wave of recriminations and soul-searching.\n\nFor Democrats, the future is promising but uncertain. But they have, at least, finally left the past behind.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Joe Biden or Kamala Harris: Which Risk Is the Better Risk?\n\nWhite House/ZUMA\n\nBy now, anyone who follows presidential politics has an opinion on what President Joe Biden should do following his debate meltdown that raised questions, concerns, and fears about his mental acuity. So far, a small number of Democrats have urged him to withdraw from the 2024 race. A larger number of pundits have done the same. Major funders are fretting. And the White House and his campaign have insisted Biden is up to the job and can carry on. On social media, his diehard supporters have raged against the commentariat and the apostate Democrats, asserting that Donald Trump, his lies and multiple liabilities, and the threat he poses to American democracy ought to be more the focus than Biden's age.\n\nNo surprise, there's no consensus in the Democratic world.\n\nAfter speaking with numerous people within the Democratic cosmos, I have thoughts about this mess and possible steps forward. And I'm immodest enough to believe they might be worth sharing. Let's look at this as a decision tree. The first branch: What does Biden's debate debacle mean? Many of his supporters and his own team have dismissed it as merely one bad night, with some pointing toward President Barack Obama's disastrous first debate with Mitt Romney. But Obama's poor performance was due to his lack of preparation and his arrogant decision to not approach Romney as a worthy adversary. It said nothing about his abilities or health.\n\nBiden's debate prompted the question: Was this an one-off (due to a cold, fatigue from grueling travel, or whatever) or an indication of a worrisome condition that could-or probably would-manifest itself again. If the latter, this meant his reelection bid-and the effort to prevent Trump from returning to the White House-was in great danger. One more public appearance like this one would likely end Biden's campaign. And if such an event occurred after the convention, the Democrats would be dead ducks. Burdened with a candidate seen as in severe cognitive decline, the party could take a wallop that would include losing the Senate and failing to retake the House. The authoritarian-minded Trump would rule again, with a Republican-controlled Congress. So here is the first decision. If you're in the one-bad-night camp and still ridin' with Biden, your calculating is done. You're going to have to white-knuckle your way through the next four months. If you believe the debate revealed a potentially existential threat for the Biden effort, then you move on to other branches on the decision tree. The next question is, if not Biden, whom? Before proceeding, let's note that under Democratic rules, there is no way for the party at this point to deny Biden its presidential nomination. He holds a majority of delegates to next month's convention in Chicago, and they are pledged to vote for him. For anything else to happen, Biden would have to withdraw from the race. If he sticks with it, the rest of this what-iffing is irrelevant.\n\nAs of now, it appears pressure from Democrats on Biden to ride off into the sunset is slowly building. There could come a time when a consensus does form among the Democratic Establishment (which doesn't really exist as an organized entity) that Biden is toast. How this position is presented to Biden could affect his decision. One obvious path is to shower Biden with love: You've had a  wildly consequential and successful presidency, having passed tremendous pieces of legislation and having steered the nation out of a horrific pandemic. We can celebrate that at the convention. You saved us from Trump once by beating him. Now you can save us again from Trump by stepping aside. And, alas, if you continue as the nominee and lose, that will overshadow the wonderful legacy you have built.\n\nFor this exercise, let's assume that Biden ousts himself. We're back to what-or who-is next. The question then is: Does he anoint his successor and call on his delegates to vote for this person, or does he leave it up to the delegates at the convention to select someone else? If Biden wants to be the decider, he has no choice other than Vice President Kamala Harris. To throw her to the curb would create a serious rift in the party, alienating a loyal voting bloc: Black Americans, in particular Black women. The cleanest scenario would be for him to announce his withdrawal and simultaneously call on the delegates to back Harris.\n\nIf Biden doesn't do this, there will finally be what political journalists and junkies have long yearned for: an open convention. That means anyone could enter the race and compete for the nomination. Potential candidates include Govs. Gavin Newsom (California), Gretchen Whitmer (Michigan), J.B. Pritzker (Illinois), and others, as well as Harris. The convention could be conflict-ridden and chaotic. The party would indeed be in a degree of disarray. And if there is discord outside the convention hall due to protests over the Gaza war, the impression conveyed to the American public could be Democrats-equal-disorder. So which is better for the Democrats: a quick shift to Harris or a drawn-out fight among several or many candidates that could split the party? And, once again, if Harris loses this battle, a large segment of Democratic voters could be mightily pissed off.\n\nWhat if you prefer the open-convention scenario? The result could well be a nominee who has never run a national campaign and who has not yet built a national apparatus for a presidential run. And this person, largely unknown to voters (especially the low-information and less-engaged voters who will likely decide this race), would immediately confront hundreds of millions of dollars in negative ads as part of a smear campaign designed to define him or her in the worst way imaginable. This would be the Mother of All Swift-boating. Moreover, anyone but Harris would not be able to inherit the campaign war chest amassed by the Biden campaign. (Money from the Biden campaign probably can be transferred to a super PAC to support a new non-Harris candidate, but that could lead to a clunky operation.) This new candidate would have only about 10 weeks to pull it all together. Compare this to the Harris-anointed scenario. There would more likely be smooth-sailing at the convention-at least, inside the hall. No Democrats-in-Disarray narrative. There could be a true celebration of what Biden and Harris have accomplished in their first term and excitement about her vice presidential pick. (One out-of-the-park option could be Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.) And she'd have all that money.\n\nAt this decision branch-Harris or a free-for-all-a big factor is this: Can Harris be an effective candidate and beat Trump? Sure, subbing her in for Biden might be the easiest course of action, but does that boost the party's chances or not?\n\nHarris has been an erratic politician. She had bright moments as a senator and as a candidate in the 2020 race (including when she schooled Biden on racism). But her presidential endeavor floundered. As vice president, she has often been seen as a non-entity, perhaps because the Biden team kept her reined in or assigned her impossible missions, such as resolving the border crisis. But in the wake of the Dobbs decision ending a woman's right to an abortion, she has been a fierce and vigorous campaigner on that issue, which is an animating element of this election. She's younger than Biden (59) and more vibrant. She has been a prosecutor and could well skewer Trump in a debate and elsewhere. And she has already taken plenty of incoming from the MAGA attack machine. She's been fully vetted; she's no newbie.\n\nBack to the decision tree: a known quantity or a convention brawl that produces who-knows?\n\nWith Harris, alas, an ugly question arises: Can a Black women win enough of the key swing states that will determine the outcome: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia? For many people, the answer will depend on their view of human nature and the power of racism and sexism. The polls show that overall Harris is as competitive-or close to-as Biden in a match-up against Trump. But that could easily shift one way or the other. If she campaigns fiercely, her numbers might go up. If the right-wing noise machine finds effective lines of attack (racist, sexist, or otherwise), her standing could slide.\n\nIf you care what I think, at this point, I lean toward Harris as providing the Democrats their best shot rather than a turbulent tournament at the convention that churns out an untested candidate. Others might favor the way of chaos, hoping it produces the contender they prefer or another nominee with a different set of liabilities than Harris.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that every path available to the Democrats now carries a fair amount of risk. What's the risk of Biden zombie-ing out again? What's the risk of Harris campaigning poorly? What's the risk of a helter-skelter convention that turns into an internal civil war? And what's the risk associated with whoever emerges from that tumult? No route will be risk-free.\n\nHaving decided in favor of Harris over a let's-nominate-anyone contest, I move toward assessing the risks of the first two of those options. They are of different natures. The risk with Biden is akin to that of a titanic natural disaster. If what one fears about Biden happens to occur (after the convention), then all is lost for the Democrats. Game over. (Technically, the Democratic Party might be able to replace him following the convention, but there are plenty of logistical hurdles to that.)\n\nWith Harris, the risks are more conventional. They are related to her talents as a politician and her ability to win over voters in those crucial states. These are matters that can be addressed-though certainly there's no guarantee they can be surmounted.\n\nAt the bottom of this decision tree, we are left with two alternatives, each presenting these different risks. A Biden who is one bad moment away from a total campaign crash, or a Harris who has a set of ordinary flaws and who would have to overcome powerful forces of racism and sexism.\n\nThe Democrats do not have an easy way out of this situation that Biden and his crew have created. He has presented his party with one helluva dilemma. And, ultimately, he may resolve to stay on the horse and afford his party no agency regarding this critical decision.\n\nWhatever happens, there is no perfect or even close-to-perfect avenue for the Democrats. It ends up being a question of which risk you want to live with: Biden further showing decline; Harris poorly campaigning; or the convention becoming a circus that spits out a not-well-known candidate with his or her own faults. For me, on this particular day, the Harris option seems the better risk for Democrats to take. Still, I possibly could be talked out of it. But until Biden gives up his dream of a second term, none of these calculations matter-though considering them at this point is a good way to prepare for what might be a wild and profoundly important ride ahead.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Joe Biden Needs a Better Argument Than This\n\nBrian Cahn/ZUMA Press Wire\n\nOn Monday, after a week and a half of public and private clamoring from members of his party to reconsider his reelection bid, and perhaps even step aside from the presidency, Joe Biden sent a defiant two-page letter to Democrats in the House of Representatives vowing to do nothing of the sort.\n\n\"We had a Democratic nomination process and the voters have spoken clearly and decisively,\" Biden wrote.\n\nHe continued:\n\nI received over 14 million votes, 87% of the votes cast across the entire nominating process. I have nearly 3,900 delegates, making me the presumptive nominee of our party by a wide margin.\n\nThis was a process open to anyone who wanted to run. Only three people chose to challenge me. One fared so badly that he left the primaries to run as an independent. Another attacked me for being too old and was soundly defeated. The voters of the Democratic party have voted. They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party.\n\nThere's a case Biden can make for himself to stay in the race, but this is not it. The fact of the matter is, as he would say, that the 2024 Democratic primary was a joke.\n\nAs Biden acknowledges in the letter, Democratic voters didn't really have any serious alternatives. The Democrat who \"left the primaries to run as an independent\" was an anti-vax crank who has spent the last week fending off allegations that he ate a dog. The other two challengers were Marianne Williamson, a wellness guru who put out a lengthy statement asking people to stop calling her \" crystal lady ,\" and Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a back-bencher whose campaign devolved into a prop for billionaire investor Bill Ackman.\n\nBiden wants Democrats to view that lack of serious competition as a demonstration of his mandate. It was really just political gravity.\n\nNo president has been defeated outright in a primary since primaries became the standard way of deciding nominations, and no incumbent president has faced a truly viable primary challenge since 1980, when Sen. Ted Kennedy lost to President Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan lost to President Gerald Ford four years before that. Lyndon Johnson did drop out of the 1968 presidential race a few weeks after New Hampshire (which he nonetheless won), but before that, the last time an incumbent president wanted his party's nomination and didn't get it was Woodrow Wilson in 1920. In that case, the president's support collapsed after he was incapacitated by a stroke and his signature accomplishment, the Treaty of Versailles, failed in the Senate. Winning re-nomination is not a sign of strength; it is what has happened to just about everyone who wasn't dead or dying since the 19th century.\n\nIf you think it was a real primary, I guess I would ask: When were the debates?\n\nThat's not a minor question. Biden's inability to effectively make his case in front of 50 million people is the reason we're all talking about this right now. Nothing Robert Kennedy Jr., Marianne Williamson, or Dean Philips said or did could really have challenged Biden's standing among Democratic party primary voters-only Biden's own debate performances might have. The Democratic National Committee did not schedule any. Because its members unanimously endorsed Joe Biden. (Philips and Williamson did, separately, debate twice in January.) The same DNC also changed the primary schedule, at the request of Biden, to make the calendar as hostile as possible to any hypothetical challenger. I'm not blowing the lid off some huge conspiracy there-this was all reported at the time, and, again, party institutions generally throw their weight behind their incumbent. But that's the point. The 2024 Democratic primary had none of the trappings of a real primary. It was so not a real primary that Florida didn't even hold one at all!\n\nTo Biden, though, his success in the virtually uncontested primary was about something greater. \"How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party?\" he asked. \"I cannot do that. I will not do that.\" In case the implication wasn't clear, he returned to the subject of \"standing up for American democracy\" later on, in the context of President Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the election on January 6.\n\nMore than anything else-more than his industrial policy, more than his green energy programs, and certainly more than his support for abortion rights-Biden is running on the idea that democracy is on the brink and Trump could end it all. He talks about Charlottesville, seven years after Charlottesville, because it is a symbol of the moral urgency that, he says, compelled him to run. He talks about January 6th with genuine anger.\n\nComparing sincere and well-meaning pleadings from his allies to step aside to the anti-democratic faction that controls the Republican party is not just insulting-it cheapens the central message of his campaign.\n\nNo one is attempting to overturn the results of the election. No one is arguing that the 2024 Democratic primary, such as it was, can simply be reversed if Mike Pence has the courage . No one is plotting to send fake delegates to Chicago. While Biden, the most powerful man in the world, declares that \"elites\" are attempting to cynically drive him from power, it is, as far as I can tell, mostly a lot of people without real political power who really don't want Trump to win. They are pleading with the man who failed the biggest political test he has faced in four years, at the only debate he has participated in in four years, to reconsider his decision to accept the nomination and to elevate his own running mate.\n\nIf he stays in, the best way for Biden to get past this is to stop fighting his allies and do the thing he didn't do before: Aggressively prosecute the case against Trump. Take a question about age and pivot to Dobbs . Take a question about sleep schedules and pivot to Dobbs . Take a question about a verbal slip and pivot to Dobbs . Talk about Dobbs with the intensity of literally any state legislature candidate in a red state. Hype up near-full employment and rising wages for good measure, too. He should save his attacks on people who would overrule the democratic process for the people who are actually threatening to.\n\nThat's all easier said than done for someone who, in the most generous interpretation of recent stories and events, has far less stamina and is far less adept at articulating his message than the Biden of four years ago (let alone 12). But if this is the path he and his party's leaders have chosen, the least he can do is start.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Ceasefire Deal Makes It Obvious: Joe Biden Failed\n\nPresident Joe Biden meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office in July. Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nIn the early days of the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, President Joe Biden took some time to congratulate himself on a job well done.\n\nFor weeks, his administration had been pursuing a \" bear hug \" of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: heaping billions in aid on the US ally and insulating it from international diplomatic pressure. The idea was that massive military and public support for Israel would give America leverage over Netanyahu in private meetings. Biden believed this was working. He thought his pushes had slowed Israel's invasion of Gaza. The president-who had once been famously ridiculed by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates for being \"wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades\"-bragged by asking an aide about Gates's comment: Who is wrong now ?\n\nThe answer then, as today, is clear: Joe Biden was wrong.\n\nHis bear hug has been one the biggest foreign policy mistakes in modern American history. It did not give Biden or the US leverage in private. Again and again, Netanyahu ignored Biden's pleas to change policy. Red lines were drawn that Israel could not cross. Israel crossed them and faced no consequences.\n\nBiden's incompetence is what has allowed Trump to take a victory lap before even taking office.\n\nOver that time, tens of thousands of people have been killed. And the destruction in Gaza has been so great that many within Biden's own administration have either quit or admitted to reporters the strategy has totally failed. \"This is the human rights atrocity of our time,\" a senior US diplomat told ProPublica.\n\nEven more tragically: It was entirely predictable that Biden's strategy was all but bound to fail miserably. Both as vice president and president, Biden made it obvious that he was there to be played by Netanyahu. The bear hug-along with the near total refusal to hold Netanyahu accountable that went with it-allowed the Israeli prime minister to walk over Biden, time and again.\n\nOn Friday, the Israeli security cabinet voted to approve a ceasefire and hostage release deal. It's expected to pass the full cabinet later on Friday. Hamas supports the agreement, according to the New York Times .\n\nThere is already, and will continue to be, debate over who secured a ceasefire deal: Trump or Biden. But early reporting strongly indicates it was the incoming president who made the difference. In Haaretz , Israel's most prominent progressive newspaper, Amos Harel wrote bluntly, \"negotiations would not have reached their final lap without Trump.\" He added, \"For years, people have been saying that Netanyahu is the sum of all his fears; it turns out that Trump scares him even more, perhaps justifiably so.\"\n\nThe Washington Post shared a similar perspective from an unnamed diplomat who said the recent negotiations had been \"the first time there has been real pressure on the Israeli side to accept a deal.\" Biden seemed to push back on Wednesday by saying, \"This is the ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring.\" Yet, in doing so, he undercut his own point-underlining that it was the person pushing, not the plan, that had changed.\n\nA tracker maintained by Al-Jazeera shows that 17,492 children have been killed since October 7. It means that, on average, Israel's war has killed more than one child per hour since October 7.\n\nOne does not have to reconstrue Trump as a champion of Palestinians and their struggle for sovereignty to accept his role in securing a ceasefire. His record is clear. Trump's first administration pushed forward a range of hardline pro-Israel policies that sidelined Palestinians-notably moving the US Embassy to Israel and pursuing the Abraham Accords. (Both were continued by the Biden administration.)\n\nTrump has now picked for Ambassador to Israel former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who once said \"there's really no such thing as a Palestinian.\" There also isn't a clear sense of what Netanyahu may have gotten at Palestinians' and others' expense in exchange for agreeing to the ceasefire. And from a Palestinian perspective, there are many reasons to be skeptical about how Trump will respond if Israel violates the ceasefire, refuses to take the steps in future phases of the agreement to end the war indefinitely, or takes extreme steps like trying to formally annex parts of the West Bank .\n\nBut those caveats should not obscure the fact that it was a Democratic president who so thoroughly failed in pushing Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders to accept a ceasefire deal-and that Biden's incompetence is what has allowed Trump to take a victory lap before even taking office.\n\nThis failure had catastrophic consequences. According to the official death toll, Israel's onslaught has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza. Public health researchers estimate the actual death toll , which will only be known after buried bodies after pulled from the omnipresent rubble, is far higher.\n\nA majority of the dead are women, children, and the elderly, according to public health data from the Gaza health ministry, and most of the younger men killed likely had nothing to do with the attack on October 7. A tracker maintained by Al-Jazeera shows that 17,492 children have been killed in Gaza since October 7. It means that, on average, Israel's war has killed more than one child per hour since October 7. Gazans who have survived-the vast majority of whom are internally displaced-are missing limbs, family and friends, homes, schools, hospitals, and any semblance of a return to a pre-war reality that was itself dominated by a devastating Israeli blockade.\n\nWhen I spoke this summer with two American doctors who had recently returned from volunteering in Gaza, they had no doubt they had witnessed a genocide. They are not alone in that conclusion. Along with many genocide scholars, including some who are Israeli Jews, both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have since concluded that Israel is guilty of genocide. Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nThe atrocities that Gazans and people across the world have seen for the past 15 months could not have happened without the United States and the billions of dollars in weapons it continues to provide to Israel. If Biden had celebrated the destruction of Gaza, the steady flow of American-made bombs would have been ghoulish but legible. Instead, for the better part of a year, Biden has tried and failed to end the war while funding it.\n\nThe reason why was always the same: He refused to use America's extensive leverage over Israel. Biden reportedly said mean things about Netanyahu behind his back and maybe even sometimes said those things directly to the Israeli prime minister, but he never issued a true ultimatum. He scolded but he did not demand.\n\nThis was the worst possible combination. It allowed Netanyahu to help rebuild his domestic political standing by publicly flouting Biden, while also continuing the war with America's bombs. The overall effect was to allow Israel to flip the table and assume the role of superpower.\n\nBiden's defenders, of course, tell a different story. Theirs has always been some version of: It could have been worse . For months, they pointed to having prevented Israel from invading Lebanon. Then Israel invaded Lebanon-with the Biden administration offering perplexing tacit support that contradicted its previous position. The potentially positive changes in the region like the decapitation of Hezbollah contributing to the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria have been effectively accidental rather than the result of well-thought-out plans.\n\nLike with former President Lyndon Johnson in Vietnam , meritocrats atop America's foreign policy establishment facilitated failure. Instead of Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, there was Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and senior Middle East adviser Brett McGurk-a former William Rehnquist clerk who went to Iraq in 2004 as a legal adviser to help shape the George W. Bush's administration's post-invasion policies in the country.\n\nWhen it comes to Israel and Gaza, Sullivan is perhaps best known for writing a horrifically timed Foreign Affairs essay that hit newsstands just after October 7. \"Indeed,\" he claimed in a line excised from the online version of the article, \"although the Middle East remains beset with perennial challenges, the region is quieter than it has been for decades.\"\n\nStories like these have minimized or disregarded the many steps these men were taking to stifle dissent within their own government. As ProPublica reported , Blinken rejected the conclusion of two US government bodies that Israel was deliberately blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza. The problem was that American law blocks presidents from providing military assistance to countries that restrict access to US humanitarian assistance. Reality was ignored to keep the weapons flowing.\n\nLike Bundy, who ended up in charge of the Ford Foundation despite his role in dragging America into Vietnam, Sullivan and McGurk have been keen to rehabilitate their images. In a feature in The Atlantic, they are depicted as good men trying to secure that \"single day of success\" at the negotiating table needed to end the war-only to be stymied by obstacles big and small like McGurk leaving his passport at home on the way to one of his countless failed missions abroad.\n\nStill, it would be a mistake to blame this war primarily on Biden's staff. The most charitable thing that can be said about them is that they served their boss within the constraints he placed on them. It was Biden, in the end, who decided not to use US leverage. Netanyahu and his staff knew that. As a result, anyone negotiating on the president's behalf was all but certain to fail. As Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator who is now the president of the US/Middle East Project, said in March, \"I think many of us who had very low expectations of the US and of Biden have had a rude awakening as to how much lower the actual performance has been [compared] to even the lowest of low expectations.\"\n\nPerhaps most maddeningly, Biden should have known better than almost anyone how Netanyahu would try to manipulate him. As vice president, he had had a front-row seat as the Israeli prime minister tried to tank President Barack Obama's Iran nuclear deal-including by speaking directly to Congress. Instead of holding Netanyahu accountable during the Obama administration, Biden repeatedly tried to shield him from consequences. As he reportedly once told a Netanyahu aide earlier in the Obama administration, \"Just remember that I am your best fucking friend here.\"\n\nHis constant sidling up to Israel ignored one of the most obvious facts about US-Israeli relations: The fear of real consequences, not cajoling, is what gets Israeli leaders to respond to American presidents. That could be seen in 1982 when President Ronald Reagan stopped Israel's bombardment of West Beirut by calling Prime Minister Menachem Begin to warn that the Lebanon war was threatening the \"entire future relationship\" between the two nations. As Reagan wrote in his diary, \"I used the word holocaust deliberately & said the symbol of his war was becoming a picture of a 7 month old baby with [its] arms blown off.\" Twenty minutes later, a cowed Begin called to say he'd ordered a halt to his army's artillery fire. Biden never had his version of that call.\n\nHis actions were rooted in a deep-seated affinity for Israel and the ideals the Jewish state was more likely to espouse when he was a younger man. While he also appears to have been motivated by more crass-and increasingly outdated-domestic political calculations, he considered himself a true friend of the country and its people. In other contexts, Biden's loyalty to someone he decided was the underdog proved to be a virtue. In this one, his biases enabled atrocities. It was one of his own former officials who told me in the early months of the war, \"The President does not seem to acknowledge the humanity of all parties affected by this conflict.\"\n\nA less stubborn and more reflective president might now be reconsidering Gates' knock on him. Was he wrong again? Had he abetted one of America's first foreign policy catastrophes of the century by voting for the invasion of Iraq only to take the helm for another? What did it mean that Trump-the reality TV buffoon replacing a former Senate Foreign Relations chairman who sees himself as a master statesman-is the one who appears to have gotten what Biden could not?\n\nAnd yet, if Biden is one thing it is a believer.

      "text": "Biden Commutes Nearly 1,500 Prison Sentences in Record-Breaking Clemency\n\nPresident Biden smiles at an event in San Francisco, Tuesday, June 20, 2023. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nToday, President Joe Biden announced that he will commute the sentences of almost 1,500 Americans for non-violent offenses-the most ever granted in one day. Those affected by the commutations are people released to in-home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, whom some Republicans have pushed to send back to prison. Biden also announced that he would pardon 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes including drug offenses.\n\nAs I previously reported , there has been pressure on Joe Biden to use his clemency power more broadly in the final months of his term-which intensified after he pardoned his son, Hunter. More than 130 civil and human rights organizations have called on Biden to commute the sentences of those on federal death row before he leaves office. Biden has openly opposed the death penalty, and those commutations would prevent the execution of 40 people-who, instead of being killed, would serve out the rest of their lives in prison.\n\nGroups have also called on Biden to free more people serving time for nonviolent offenses. Drug Policy Alliance, a non-partisan advocacy group, recently asked Biden to commute the sentences lengthened by the racist disparity in sentencing between powder and crack cocaine, which has disproportionately affected the Black community; the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit working for the release of all marijuana prisoners, joined members of Congress in November on the Capital Steps to call on Biden to rectify what they called \"draconian sentences given by judges\" in an accompanying letter to the president.\n\nIn response to today's announcement, the Last Prisoner Project's executive director, Sarah Gersten, said in a public statement, \"We are heartened to see the President using his clemency power more robustly, and are eager to see more action before he leaves office. It's clear from the White House's statement that the administration sees nonviolent drug offenders, and particularly those impacted by unjust cannabis offenses, as a critical category of clemency recipients deserving relief.\"\n\nBiden's announcement implied that more clemencies should be expected, saying that he will \"continue reviewing clemency petitions to advance equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "As Biden dug in on continuing his campaign, Nancy Pelosi kept the pressure on\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nWASHINGTON - Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi stepped down from her powerful perch leading House Democrats nearly a year and a half ago. But behind the scenes, sources say, Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco, played a critical role in delicately nudging President Joe Biden to the exits .\n\nAlthough Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Pelosi's protégé, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, also told Biden about Democrats' concerns about him continuing his campaign, three sources told NBC News that any time the issue of his dropping out began to die down and lose momentum, they viewed Pelosi as the one fanning the flames.\n\nUnlike Schumer and Jeffries, Pelosi is no longer on the Democratic leadership team and could afford to be more front and center in the effort to push Biden out after his disastrous debate performance last month.\n\n\"I think Pelosi continues to show she's a master political tactician,\" a House Democratic leadership aide said Sunday.\n\nThroughout Democrats' painful three-week ordeal, Pelosi never publicly called on Biden to quit the race; neither did Schumer or Jeffries. Doing so could infuriate Biden and cause him to become intransigent and never step aside.\n\nInstead, Pelosi worked quietly and methodically, speaking to scores of rank-and-file lawmakers, members of her old leadership team and her large network of Democratic donors who had once made her the party's most prolific fundraiser.\n\nFor those vulnerable rank-and-file lawmakers who reached out to her seeking guidance, two sources said, Pelosi advised that they \"speak their conscience\" in the days leading up to Biden's stunning decision to drop out. A source close to Pelosi made it clear that she was not initiating conversations but fielding calls. On Friday, 13 congressional Democrats called on Biden to exit the race, the most defections in a single day, handing him what would be the fatal blow to his campaign.\n\n\"That groundswell on Friday of members calling for him to step down was all Nancy's doing,\" said a vulnerable House Democrat who spoke with Pelosi last week.\n\nDuring their call, the lawmaker said, Pelosi asked twice about poll numbers - both for the lawmaker and for Biden in this person's swing district - so she could write them down.\n\n\"The gist was that she felt our ability to take back the majority was at risk,\" the Democrat, a member of the party's \"Frontline\" program for vulnerable congressional incumbents, told NBC News.\n\nAsked how responsible Pelosi was for Biden's stepping down, the lawmaker replied: \"50%.\"\n\nIt was all vintage Pelosi, who made history as the first female speaker of the House and ruled House Democrats with a velvet glove for two decades: guide Democrats to where they needed to go and have them make the decision.\n\nIn this case, the key Democrat was Joe Biden. And all in the party knew that he would have to be the one to make the final call to bow out.\n\nWhen Biden dug in and declared he absolutely wouldn't drop out of the race, Pelosi appeared on his favorite show , MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" She kept the issue alive by saying Biden needs to make a decision \"because time is running short,\" even as he and his campaign insisted he had decided to stay in.\n\nIn a private phone call a week after her MSNBC appearance, Pelosi warned Biden, 81 - someone she has known in Washington for more than 30 years - about the realities of the 2024 race: He could lose so badly to their mutual political foe, Republican Donald Trump, that he could damage Democrats down ballot and possibly cost them control of the House and the Senate.\n\nAnd after last weekend's assassination attempt on Trump shocked the nation and appeared to stall momentum to push Biden out, a trio of close Pelosi allies brought the story back to the forefront.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, a vocal Trump critic who is the favorite to be California's next senator, on W ednesday became the highest-profile Democrat to call on Biden to step aside. Rep. Jared Huffman, who represents a Bay Area district next to Pelosi's, organized a successful effort to delay the Democratic National Committee from quickly coronating Biden as the party's nominee through a virtual roll call. Huffman and a third Pelosi ally, Bay Area Rep. Zoe Lofgren, were among the surge of lawmakers calling on Biden to leave the race Friday.\n\nNo other Democrat understands the stakes of a possible second Trump term better than Pelosi, Schiff and Lofgren. Pelosi, hunted by pro-Trump rioters during the Capitol attack and later targeted at home by a man who fractured her husband's skull with a hammer , appointed Schiff, Lofgren and others to the Jan. 6 select committee that concluded that Trump was to blame for the effort to overturn the 2020 election results and the deadly riot.\n\n\"It was certainly notable that so many of her longest California allies were so outspoken,\" said Rep. Katie Porter, who lost the Democratic nomination for the Senate in California to Schiff this year after Pelosi endorsed him.\n\nA Democratic lawmaker said of Pelosi's strategy to affect the outcome she desires, \"She deploys her assets.\"\n\nA former Democratic leadership aide added: \"Biden has a history of losing and winning. Pelosi doesn't make moves unless she knows she will win.\"\n\nAsked about the impetus for her statement Friday, Lofgren didn't dismiss her proximity to Pelosi - they've served together for nearly three decades - but said it was a decision she made herself. \"She is not directing anyone to do anything. This is from me,\" Lofgren said on MSNBC.\n\nBiden was angered and hurt when Pelosi, his former running mate Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders declined to support him, sources said. But when he announced his decision Sunday, Pelosi was quick with a magnanimous statement .\n\n\"President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first. His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,\" she said. \"With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden's greatness and goodness.\"\n\nShortly after he announced he wouldn't stand for re-election, Biden quickly endorsed his vice president and running mate, Kamala Harris, to replace him on the ballot. Party luminaries quickly followed his lead, including Schiff; Bill and Hillary Clinton; Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a top Biden ally and longtime member of Democratic leadership; Senate President Pro Tem Patty Murray of Washington, who is third in line to the presidency; and progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\nBut Pelosi, Schumer and Jeffries haven't yet endorsed Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney who has known Pelosi for decades. Given her track record, Pelosi could play a key role in either securing the nomination for Harris or helping a potential rival get the nod at the convention in Chicago in August, though many of Harris' potential rivals, including a fellow Californian, Gov. Gavin Newsom, have already endorsed her for president.\n\nPelosi is \"politically still our leader,\" the Frontline Democrat said. \"She and she alone can ensure Kamala's success.\"\n\nNot all Democrats believe Pelosi's efforts have put the party in a better position for November. Some worry that Republicans will follow through on threats to sue to keep Biden on the ballot, arguing that to replace him would disenfranchise 14 million primary voters who cast their votes for him.\n\n\"Pelosi pushed him and left us with no plan. Is it Harris? Who knows?\" a former House Democratic leadership aide said. \"But I do know that Republicans will definitely spend millions of dollars trying to tie this up in court. It could be worse than the 2000 election.\"\n\nI have covered Capitol Hill for the past 15 years and joined NBC News as a senior congressional reporter in 2022.

      "text": "Biden is leaving the White House with two wildly different legacies\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIn just a few weeks, Joe Biden will depart the Oval Office for the last time with a legacy featuring more highs and lows than perhaps any president in modern American history.\n\nFrom an economic policy standpoint, Biden's presidency was remarkably successful. When he took office in January 2021, he inherited an economy that was in free fall, battered and bruised from the Covid pandemic. He helped engineer a \"soft landing\" generally considered among the best in the world.\n\nIn his four years in office, 16 million new jobs were created - the most of any single presidential term, including a significant increase in manufacturing jobs . The unemployment rate fell to the lowest in 50 years. Wage growth increased, particularly among the working class, and a record 20 million applications for new businesses have been filed since Biden took office.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, Biden arguably ranks among the best one-term presidents.\n\nFrom a legislative standpoint, Biden signed into law several major bills, including a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act. The latter included nearly $400 billion to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the largest such investment any country has ever made. The IRA additionally enabled Medicare to negotiate - and subsequently reduce - drug prices. Biden also signed the CHIPS Act, which provided more than $50 billion in spending to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, and the first gun safety legislation in decades.\n\nAs for foreign policy, Biden finally ended the U.S. war in Afghanistan and assembled a global coalition to challenge the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While there are legitimate criticisms of his handling of the war in Gaza, he played a key role in preventing a larger and more deadly regional conflict.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, Biden arguably ranks among the best one-term presidents - certainly behind James Polk, who pushed  the country's westward expansion, but ahead of the likes of William Howard Taft, John Adams or George H.W. Bush. (In fairness, the lion's share of one-term presidents have been either mediocre or bad, which is one of the reasons why they didn't win re-election.)\n\nBut presidents are not judged by policy accomplishments alone. When it comes to proposing and signing legislation that transformed America, few presidents can hold a candle to Lyndon Johnson. But politically, he was a disaster who divided and arguably enfeebled the Democratic Party (at the presidential level) for a generation to come.\n\nBiden's political record may come to define his legacy - and not in a good way.\n\nWhen he took office, Biden was viewed favorably by most voters . But by the fall of 2021, after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, his approval ratings went south  - and never recovered.\n\nA major reason were the inflation woes that undermined incumbent parties around the world. But Biden doesn't get off the hook that easily. Even at his best, Biden is a mediocre communicator and, while he convinced 81 million Americans to vote for him in 2020 - he was never able to build the same type of political support as president. Though inflation began to recede in 2023 and 2024 and the economy improved, it didn't translate into better poll numbers for Biden. His supporters will blame the media, congressional Republicans or even bad luck for Biden's inability to win over the electorate or convince them that things in the country were improving. But the presidential bully pulpit is a powerful tool, and Biden failed to use it effectively.\n\nBiden's legacy is further tarnished by questions about his age and his decision to seek re-election.\n\nHis legislative accomplishments may stand the test of time.\n\nTwo years ago, one could argue that Biden's most significant accomplishment was unseating Donald Trump after four disastrous years in office that shook the very foundations of American democracy. Indeed, in the most recent edition of the Presidential Greatness Project, a poll of presidential experts , Biden placed 14th overall. The only one-term president to rank higher was Adams.\n\nBut while Biden ousted Trump from the White House in 2021, he unquestionably contributed to Trump's return in 2025. To be clear, it's impossible to know if Biden dropping out of the presidential race earlier would have led to a different electoral outcome. Globally, every incumbent party lost election share in 2024. It's quite possible that winning the presidency in 2020 was a poisoned chalice for Democrats, no matter the party's standard bearer four years later.\n\nHowever, according to Professor Justin Vaughn of Coastal Carolina University, who co-directs the Presidential Greatness Project, that is not enough of a defense. Since the project conducted its most recent survey in 2023, says Vaughn, \"Americans learned the extent to which the White House had been covering for his physical decline. He resisted dropping out of the race until he had no other option, he granted his son an exceptionally broad pardon (despite directly and explicitly promising not to), and essentially became a part-time president.\" Ultimately, Vaughn thinks Biden's \"presidential legacy will be defined by the breaking of his promise to be a bridge to a new generation and instead serving as only an intermission between the first and second acts of the Trump Administration.\"\n\nAccording to Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington, \"not enough dust has settled to render a verdict\" on Biden. \"Yes, much accomplished of likely long-term consequence a la Polk,\" she says, \"and yes, choices also made (i.e., choosing to run for re-election) with significant and potentially damaging consequences to country and party, a la James Buchanan.\" (Most historians place Buchanan, like Biden a one-term president, at the bottom of presidential rankings.)\n\nFor Joshua Zeitz, a historian and contributing editor at Politico, we might be years away from a true assessment of Biden's presidency since it's impossible to say how much of his legislative accomplishments will survive Trump's next four years in office. While Zeitz thinks Biden was an \"extremely good president,\" if Trump does fundamental or even irreversible damage to America's democratic institutions, it will cast an even more negative light on Biden's stubborn insistence on running for re-election.\n\nAs Biden prepares to leave office, he can certainly take solace in leaving the country in a better place than when he entered - and his legislative accomplishments may stand the test of time. But it's the ultimate irony that the man who coaxed Biden back into presidential politics may have the last word on the legacy of his one term in office.\n\nMichael A.

Biden, once considered too young to serve, now too old to win\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nWASHINGTON - So ends the half-century career of a flawed but resilient politician who won the White House in a razor-thin election and lost it four years later in a debate: Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.\n\nBiden, 81, now eases into a lame-duck presidency for the next six months, as the party he once commanded abandoned him in the span of a few weeks for an as-yet-unnamed candidate to carry the fight against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden's collapse began with a June 27 debate against Trump, when he turned in a disastrous performance from which he couldn't recover. An elderly president with his mouth agape, he struggled to complete a sentence or finish a thought. One by one, Democratic leaders who watched in alarm broke their polite silence and openly called on him to step aside.\n\nStunning as his fall may be, Biden may be better prepared than most to deal with repudiation. Few presidents in history have endured as much tragedy and disappointment as the 46th.\n\nBiden's life has careened between unexpected triumph and unimaginable loss. He won elections and lost them. He built a family, lost part of it, rebuilt it, and lost part of it once more.\n\nHardened by experience, Biden seems to grasp that political partnerships are transactional: They come with an expiration date.\n\nIf you want a friend in Washington, \"get a dog,\" Biden said at an NAACP convention on July 16, invoking former Democratic President Harry Truman's famous dictum.\n\nLong before he was considered too old to win, Biden was considered too young to serve.\n\nHe won a U.S. Senate seat in 1972, ousting longtime Republican incumbent Caleb Boggs. Just 29 years old, Biden did not meet the Senate's minimum age requirement of 30 at the time. He turned 30 a couple of weeks after his victory.\n\nHe was young, handsome and his political future seemed limitless. Then his world cratered.\n\nBefore he was sworn in, his wife Neilia and their 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, died in a traffic accident. A tractor-trailer struck the family's Chevy station wagon while they were out shopping for a Christmas tree. Biden's two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash.\n\nBiden was so shaken by the accident that he nearly renounced his Catholic faith. He considered giving up the Senate seat he had just won.\n\n\"The underpinnings of my life had been kicked out from under me,\" Biden wrote in his memoir, \"Promises to Keep.\" \"No words, no prayer, no sermon gave me ease. I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry. I found no comfort in the Church.\"\n\nOne of the Senate's giants, Democrat Mike Mansfield of Montana, called constantly, imploring him to fill the seat as Biden sat in the hospital room with his sons. He relented and agreed to serve, riding the Amtrak train home from Washington every day when the Senate was in session so that the boys would not be without a parent.\n\nHe rebuilt his life with the help of a devoted family. After Neilia's death, his sister Valerie and brother Jimmy stepped in to help raise his sons.\n\nIn 1977, Biden remarried. Jill Biden would become a loving partner, stepmother and community college teacher wrapped into one. She also showed political chops. When Biden mulled a presidential bid in 2004, a bikini-clad Jill walked into a room at their home as he met with advisers. On her stomach she had written the word \"No.\"\n\nNo it was.\n\nBiden spent 36 years in the Senate, gaining a national profile when he chaired the Judiciary Committee and presided over two of the most polarizing Supreme Court picks in U.S. history.\n\nIn 1987, then-President Ronald Reagan nominated Robert Bork, an appeals court judge, to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Bork's conservative approach to the law made him anathema to liberal Democrats.\n\nBiden led public hearings in which he zeroed in on Bork's criticism of previous Supreme Court rulings establishing a constitutional right to privacy, a notion that underpinned the Roe v. Wade decision enshrining abortion rights.\n\nThe Syracuse Law grad prepped mightily so that he could go head-to-head with Bork, a formidable legal mind who once taught at Yale Law School. He held mock hearings in which the respected constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe played Bork.\n\nWhen the hearings began, Biden made a point of giving Bork ample time to explain his abstruse judicial views. The strategy proved to be Bork's undoing: The more Bork spoke, the less the public liked him. The Senate voted against confirmation that fall.\n\nFour years later, then-President George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the high court. Again, Biden led the confirmation hearing from his committee perch.\n\nThis time, Biden ran afoul of the left and women voters in particular. A law professor named Anita Hill contended that Thomas had sexually harassed her when she worked for him at two federal agencies. The disclosure riveted the nation, making the Thomas hearings must-see TV.\n\nBiden and his committee did not allow other women to give in-person testimony that might have buttressed Hill's contention of mistreatment. Though Biden voted against the nomination, he described Thomas as a person of \"high character.\"\n\nThomas won confirmation and went on to anchor the high court's conservative wing for the next three decades. He was part of the 6-3 majority that ruled on July 1 that Donald Trump enjoys some level of immunity for his acts as president, hindering special counsel Jack Smith's effort to prosecute Trump on charges of interfering with the 2020 election.\n\nDuring his time in the Senate, Biden mounted two failed bids for president. The first, in 1988, ended in embarrassment. Biden dropped out of the race amid disclosures that in his campaign speeches, he had lifted passages first spoken by a British labor leader without attribution.\n\nBiden tried again in 2008 and quit the race shortly after finishing a distant fifth in the Iowa caucuses. The career pol from Delaware couldn't compete against the eloquent young senator from Illinois, Barack Obama.\n\nBiden captured the ultimate consolation prize, though, when Obama chose him to be his running mate.\n\nBiden didn't know Obama well at first, but he soon became a friend and confidant. As vice president, he pushed to be the last person in the room when Obama faced the most consequential decisions.\n\nHis old-school persona didn't always mesh well with Obama's tight-knit, disciplined operation. Aides chafed when Biden front-ran Obama by coming out in support of gay marriage in 2012.\n\nIn his memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" Hunter Biden wrote that he \"didn't hang around the [Obama] White House much; I didn't want to be in the position of walking into a barbecue on a Sunday with the president and the White House staff after reading about someone throwing my dad under the bus.\"\n\nThe final years of Biden's vice presidency were sad ones. His son Beau died in 2015 at the age of 46, cutting short a promising political career of his own. A former attorney general, Beau Biden was seen as a potential presidential aspirant. With his death, Biden lost his firstborn and possible heir apparent whom he described as his \"soul.\"\n\nGrieving over the loss, Biden opted not to run for president in 2016. It's doubtful he would have won anyway. Party leaders from Obama on down had aligned themselves with Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe won the nomination, then went on to lose to Trump.\n\nOut of power, Biden decided to mount one more campaign in 2020. A catalyst, he said, was a searing clash between right-wing extremists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 2017, white nationalists organized a rally to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who led the South in the Civil War. Heather Heyer, 32, died when an avowed neo-Nazi plowed his car into her and others who came to protest the march.\n\nIn a subsequent news conference, Trump said that between those who marched and the counterprotesters, there were \"very fine people on both sides.\"\n\nAppalled by the claim, Biden jumped into the 2020 race, saying nothing less than the \"soul of the nation\" was at stake. He floundered at first, losing badly in the Iowa and New Hampshire Democratic primary contests.\n\nHe recovered in South Carolina thanks to African American voters and the endorsement of one of the state's most influential figures, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn.\n\n\"In case you didn't notice, Jim turned it around for me in 2020,\" Biden said on July 16 while speaking at an NAACP convention.\n\nSeeing Biden as the best bet to oust Trump, Democratic candidates, party leaders and rank-and-file voters quickly coalesced behind the former vice president.\n\nAn electorate weary of Covid-19 lockdowns - and Trump as well - handed Biden the victory that had eluded him for much of the past half century.\n\nBiden engineered some surprising successes in his single term. With the slimmest of majorities in Congress, he passed substantial pieces of legislation aimed at upgrading the nation's aging roads, bridges and ports; expanding sources of clean, renewable energy; and stimulating an economy that was in a tailspin due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Presidents have been promising big infrastructure spending since I remember and no one has come through,\" said Robert Reich, a former labor secretary in Bill Clinton's administration.\n\nIn deference to his age, Biden had hinted he would serve just one term and then step aside. He called himself a \"bridge\" to a younger generation of leaders during the 2020 race.\n\nA few things happened to derail those plans. Biden's party exceeded expectations during the 2022 midterm elections, keeping the Senate and only narrowly losing the House.\n\nThe absence of a predicted \"red wave\" seemed to validate Biden's leadership. No major rival came forward to challenge him for the nomination.\n\nWhat's more, Biden seemed smitten with the job. He believed that he had accomplished more in one term than Obama and Bill Clinton had achieved in two.\n\nIndeed, in an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt, Biden proclaimed his presidency to be \"the most successful\" of any \"in modern history, maybe since Franklin Roosevelt.\"\n\n(Scholars disagree. Evaluating the nation's presidents earlier this year, political scientists and historians ranked Biden 14th, below Clinton (12) and Obama (7).)\n\nPerhaps the biggest inducement to run again was his once-and-future opponent. Having beaten Trump once, Biden saw himself as best positioned to defeat him again and quash a MAGA political movement that he sees as a mortal threat to the nation's democratic order.\n\nBiden formally announced his re-election campaign in April 2023, pledging to \"finish this job.\"\n\nHeartbreak accompanied Biden at every stage of his political ascent. Even after reaching the White House, he couldn't escape it.\n\nHis son Hunter struggled with drug addiction and legal troubles that resulted in his conviction in June on three felony gun charges. Hunter Biden faces another criminal trial in September on allegations that he failed to pay taxes. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBiden has called Hunter his \"heart.\" He kept him close throughout the term, inviting him to official state dinners even as some advisers cast Hunter as a political liability.\n\n\"He's one of the most decent people in politics,\" William Daley, a former Obama White House chief of staff, said of Biden.\n\nOne senior White House official recalls entering the Oval Office on a hot summer day to brief the president, only to see Biden missing and his jacket draped over his chair behind the Resolute Desk.\n\nA few minutes later, a sweat-soaked Biden stepped back inside and apologized for being late. He had gone out to the South Lawn to thank the gardeners working that day.\n\n\"His sleeves were rolled up and his tie was undone,\" the official recalled. \"He came in looking like s--- and sweating like a pig, but he wanted to go out there and thank those guys. That's the Joe Biden I know.\"\n\nWhen his term ends on Jan. 20, Biden will retreat home to Delaware, ceding his leadership position to a younger generation.\n\nIf given a chance, he believed he could beat Trump a second time.\n\nNow he'll never know.\n\nCORRECTION (July 22, 2024, 1 a.m. ET): A photo caption in a previous version of this article misstated William Rehnquist's position on the Supreme Court in 1986 when the Senate Judiciary Committee debated his nomination to be chief justice.

Activate your online access\n\nThe former president's unexpectedly powerful farewell address rightly condemned the very oligarchy he empowered.\n\nJoe Biden unexpectedly saved the best for last. No one ever accused the former president of being an outstanding orator. In his last two years in office, he was increasingly halting and confused in his public speeches. But on January 15, less than a week before his successor was sworn in, Biden delivered an outstanding farewell address -one that should be especially welcomed by progressives and liberals.\n\nThe first part of the speech was taken up by expressing Biden's deep commitment to American democracy and pluralism. He also outlined the achievements of his administration, with an emphasis on rebuilding the economy. This boasting was understandable: Although there is much in Biden's record to criticize, he has launched the largest public spending on social policy in generations and invested serious money in tackling climate change. With Trump returning to the White House, Biden performed a necessary service by celebrating a progressive economic vision that serves as both an alternative to Trumpism and a launching pad for future Democratic administrations.\n\nBut the real meat of Biden's speech came not from his laundry list of accomplishments but his dark foreboding about the threats to American democracy. Biden warned: \"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead. We see the consequences all across America.\"\n\nBiden compared this oligarchy to the robber barons of the 19th century. Those robber barons eventually provoked a popular reaction leading to trust busting and progressive taxation.\n\nSpecifying the nature of this oligarchy, Biden cited one of the most famous of all farewell addresses, Dwight Eisenhower's 1961 warning of \"the dangers of the military-industrial complex.\" Quoting Eisenhower, Biden raised the specter of \"the disastrous rise of misplaced power.\" The new concern, Biden advised, was \"the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country as well.\" Thanks to the tech lords, \"Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power.\"\n\nBiden also insisted that \"the existential threat of climate change has never been clearer. Just look across the country, from California to North Carolina.\"\n\nThese are all wise words-ones that Democrats should heed as they rebuild their shattered party. Yet Biden's speech was double-edged, serving not just as a preemptive strike against the coming abuses of the Trump administration but also, if we are honest, as a rebuke to Biden's own record.\n\nIn warning of oligarchy, Biden sounded as if he had suddenly shed his lifelong identity as a milquetoast centrist and been possessed by the spirit of Bernie Sanders. Indeed, the Vermont Senator himself seemed aware of this fact. The following day, Sanders grilled billionaire Scott Bessen, Trump's nominee to be treasury secretary, and quoted Biden's admonishment about oligarchy. Bessen tartly noted that Biden gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom \"to two people who would qualify as oligarchs.\"\n\nAlas, Bessen had a point. Biden did in fact give the nation's highest civilian honor to two billionaires, George Soros and David Rubenstein, both examples of the outsize power of money in American democracy. The award to Rubenstein is particularly egregious, since he is a crony capitalist who has built his fortune thanks to close ties to government officials.\n\nTo reformulate Bessen's retort: If you talk the talk, you have to walk the walk. You can't talk like Bernie Sanders if you're actually Joe Biden-the \"senator from MBNA\" who has been cozying up to plutocrats his entire life. Speaking to wealthy donors in 2019, then- candidate Biden reassured them that he planned no large tax hikes. Under his presidency, \"no one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change.\" In other words, Biden was never a threat to the oligarchy.\n\nThe same contradiction between words and actions applies to Biden's caution about a \"tech-industrial complex.\" In a speech delivered to the State Department the same day as his farewell address, Biden boasted about all the new spending on military technology undertaken by his administration as part of a program of military Keynesianism. Biden crowed:\n\nWe've increased our military power, making the most significant investments in the Defense Industrial Base in decades.\n\nWe've increased the technology power, taking the lead on artificial intelligence and other technologies of the future....\n\nWe've also significantly strengthened the defense industrial base, investing almost $1.3 trillion in procurement and research and development. In real dollars, that's more than America did in any four-year period during the Cold War.\n\nIf the \"tech-industrial complex\" is a new manifestation of the military-industrial complex, then Biden has immeasurably strengthened its grip on our economy and our politics. It is public funding that is making tech lords like Elon Musk (who has billions in government contracts) stronger. Once again, Biden is the architect of the very oligarchy he decries.\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nThere's a further contradiction in fighting the existential threat posed by climate change while pushing for renewed great-power competition with China-as Biden has done. Any real climate solution will require international cooperation, not economic nationalism.\n\nBiden's parting rebuke to oligarchy is welcome. But if Biden wants to see why plutocracy now threatens America, he needs to begin by looking in the mirror.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Other top Dems are joining.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, left, and Vice President Kamala Harris on the Truman Balcony of the White House in Washington, DC, on July 4, 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden proved Sunday afternoon that he has a sense of dramatic timing to rival writer Aaron Sorkin's*-and an imagination that beats it. Biden announced, via social media, that he is suspending his campaign to focus on his presidency. While he praised Vice President Kamala Harris for being a great \"partner,\" he notably did not endorse her in his announcement.\n\nCue the wild speculation about what that meant. Within moments, the tweets were flying: Did Biden want a so-called \"open convention\"? Was he unsold on Harris? Did he oppose a so-called \"coronation,\" a frequently used term that demeans the woman who's spent almost four years as his vice president? AP ran with this teaser: \"Biden doesn't immediately endorse VP Kamala Harris, throwing Democrats into chaos months before election against [Donald] Trump.\"\n\nMinutes after his social media announcement, however, Biden stunned again by, in fact, endorsing Harris. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" he wrote. \"And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats-it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nThat brief pause between statements packed more punch than if he'd endorsed Harris in his announcement. \"It was a great, brilliant move,\" says Black Voters Matter cofounder LaTosha Brown.\n\nExpect the vast majority of Democratic leaders to fall in behind Harris in the next few days. She was San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, making the \"prosecutor vs. felon\" narrative simply too delicious. (She was also known for vigorously prosecuting sex crimes; she will be running against an adjudicated rapist.) And Harris has been the party's single best surrogate on the issue of abortion rights and reproductive justice, which is the Democrats' winning issue.\n\nOne of the fascinating things about the intra-party debate over whether Biden should stand down following his disastrous June 27 debate performance has been that the loudest and loyalest people urging him to stay in the race have been Black leaders. The Congressional Black Caucus came out fully behind him, led by chair Representative Steven Horsford and caucus dean Representative Jim Clyburn. (Although Clyburn always said that if Biden did step aside, his top choice would be Harris.)\n\nMaybe more important to me, late last week, a group of Black women leaders released a letter , ultimately signed by 1,400, urging Biden to stay in the race and decrying the push to oust him.\n\n\"History is a great teacher and has taught us that a divided house will fail,\" the women wrote Thursday.\n\nAs Black women we are uniquely aware of the very real threat a second Trump term poses to our country and especially to our community. But this is not a moment to give in to fear. Instead, we must unify around our deep belief in our values and our ability to effectively engage voters and win up and down the ballot in 2024.\n\nSome of the same women had led the push in 2020 for Biden to pick a Black woman as his running mate, including Donna Brazile, Leah Daughtry, and LaTosha Brown.\n\nDid this contradict those who were openly calling for Biden to step aside and back Harris? Not necessarily. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also Thursday, came out for Biden staying in, explaining it, in part, by noting that she was skeptical that Harris would easily replace Biden if the president were to be ousted. \"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,\" she said, blaming \"donors\" and not voters for the anti-Biden upswell. (She has since endorsed Harris.) I heard the same thing privately from a few Black women who signed the letter.\n\nNow that Biden has stepped aside, expect those women to organize energetically behind Harris. \"We about to hit these streets,\" Brown texted me moments after the Biden endorsement. The CBC likewise quickly endorsed Harris. \"The Congressional Black Caucus PAC joins President Biden in fully supporting Kamala Harris as our party's nominee,\" Representatives Gregory Meeks and Steven Horsford, said in a statement. \"She will do an excellent job as President of the United States.\"\n\nThis is, as Biden would say, \"a big fucking deal.\" Biden made history choosing Harris as his running mate, and he's ensured his legacy in history by endorsing her immediately. (He's also been an unexpectedly progressive president.) As late as Friday, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi was calling for an \"open convention\" and repeating the tired argument about avoiding a \"coronation.\" Pelosi is known to be a close ally of California Governor Gavin Newsom, but Newsom had already said he would not run if Biden stepped aside. Another media favorite, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, has said the same thing. So far, no Democrat has declared that he or she will challenge Harris.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton and 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton quickly joined Biden in endorsing Harris, a big boost given that some suspected the Clintons of doing their big donors' bidding in the weeks following the debate. (They had urged Biden to stay in the race.) So did Clyburn, as well as one of Biden's closest allies, Delaware Senator Chris Coons. No word yet from Pelosi. Former president Barack Obama, notably, praised his former vice president but did not endorse Harris, one of his earliest surrogates in 2007, calling for a \"process\" to select the nominee. It's possible he wanted to keep the spotlight on Biden and will get behind Harris this week. A source I trust says that's the correct interpretation.\n\nSoon the focus will turn to Harris's best choice of a running mate, and I'll let others report on that. For now, I want to cosign something LaTosha Brown told me. She would love to see a two-woman ticket, and favors Whitmer. \"You have this super-sexist machismo team on one side. They can make a helluva team. It could be a game changer.\"\n\nBut first things first: At 4 pm on Sunday, Harris issued her own statement, praising Biden warmly and announcing: \"I am honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" Sources say she and Biden spoke several times before his Sunday afternoon announcement.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nGame on.\n\n* The West Wing writer Aaron Sorkin penned a ludicrous op-ed in The New York Times Sunday, urging Democrats to dump Biden and nominate Republican Senator Mitt Romney.

But even as Harris and her vice presidential running mate Tim Walz have reenergized their party with massive crowds and hefty fund-raising hauls, Donald Trump is not ready to give up on the dream of a rematch against the former president. Both in the press conference Trump gave on Thursday at Mar-a-Lago and in his rally the following day in Montana , the former president repeatedly referred to Biden in surprisingly wistful terms, becoming indignant against the supposed injustice of the Democratic Party forcing Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\nTrump even went so far as to claim in his press conference that Biden had been the victim of an unconstitutional coup. Trump said, \"I am no Biden fan but from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away. People say he lost after the debate. I don't know whether that is true. Whether he could or couldn't win, he had the right to run.\" This is absurd, since no constitutional issues were raised by Biden's withdrawal as a candidate. Political parties are self-governing entities that set their own rules.\n\nIn the Montana rally, Trump launched into an anachronistic riff where he asked the crowd which nickname is better, Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe. The assembled MAGA cultists roared when \"Crooked Joe\" was mentioned and-in a plaintive tone that suggested mourning for the campaign he wanted to run against Biden-Trump said, \"'Crooked' seems to always win. I mean, he's a crooked guy.\"\n\nIt's hard to escape the feeling that Trump would really rather be running against Biden again-or indeed against Hillary Clinton (who also recurs in his speeches with references to her e-mail scandal, an incident that is surely of remote interest in 2024). Trump's speeches increasingly feel like a nostalgia act, with the demagogue rehearsing his greatest hits (Crooked Hillary's e-mails, China caused Covid, Defund the Police, Stop the Steal) rather than engaging in the political battles of the moment. This constant regurgitation of old material has made Trump's speeches even more unfocused and digressive, lacking in strong attack lines. He's never been a disciplined speaker, but at his best, in the 2016 campaign, he was able to hammer at his foes (both establishment Republicans in the primary and Hillary Clinton in the general election, with punchy polemical jabs.\n\nTo get a taste of how meandering Trump has become, consider this extended wail from the Montana rally , taking up his now familiar complaint about Biden's withdrawal:\n\n\"After the debate [Biden] was down, way down, in the polls. They didn't even want to show the polls. They said that he's not going to win. So they said, 'We're going to take him out and we're going to put somebody new in.' This never happened to anybody before. You spend-we spent $100 million dollars fighting crooked Joe Biden and then all of sudden they've decided to take him out and put somebody else in. [Harris] never got one vote. She was the first loser in the primaries. You know she ran against Joe Biden and everyone else. I think they had like 16 people running. She never made Iowa, the first state. I love Iowa. You know why I love it? Because I win it every single time with the farmers. We win it. But he never made Iowa. She was the first one to quit. And now... and stupid. Honestly she was the nastiest to him too. And then he picked her. I couldn't believe it. She was part of the cabal that got him out. You know, they got him out. They said, 'We'll do it the nice way or we'll do it the hard way, Joe. We'll use the 25th Amendment, and we'll call you mentally incompetent and everybody will believe us.' And you know what they did is... a terrible thing, actually. They forced him out. It was a coup. We had a coup. That was the first coup in the history of our country. And it was very successful. He said, 'OK, I'll leave. If that's what you want, I'll leave.' And now he's seeing what the competition is. I hear he's going to make a comeback at the Democrat convention. He's going to walk into the room and he's going to say, 'I want my presidency back. I want another chance to debate Trump. I want another chance.'\"\n\nAs so often with Trump, much of this is phantasmagoric wishcasting disguised as political argument. It's hardly a coup if Joe Biden is still president. There is no evidence that Biden was threatened with the 25th Amendment (a move that would in fact have torn the Democratic Party apart) or that Biden has any plans to use the Democratic National Convention to regain the nomination. The underlying impulse is clearly Trump's transparent desire to have Biden, rather than Harris, as his rival in the election.\n\nThere is no mystery as to why Trump is indulging in this public daydreaming: The Kamala Harris and Tim Walz ticket has made the election, which Trump was on track to win, competitive again.\n\nAs Axios reports , the Trump campaign is worried that Harris is taking the lead in the election and their candidate lacks the focus to make her the center of his attack. This worry is grounded in the fact that Harris has taken the lead in multiple national polls, is now leading in the swing states of the Midwest (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania), and is more competitive than Biden in the swing states of the South and Southwest (Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada), where the race is now tightening. While the race remains very close, Harris has a real shot at a decisive popular and Electoral College victory.\n\nAccording to Axios , Trump's advisers are \"pleading with him to adopt a new 'hard-hitting' stump speech to define Vice President Harris as liberal and weak.... And praying he'll stop the recidivistic pull to simply improvise haphazardly.\"\n\nTrump did in fact make arguments in his press conference and speech that Harris is too liberal, in particular referencing stances she took in the 2019 presidential bid, which she has since disavowed (support for Medicare for All and opposition to fracking). But such attacks are generic and can apply to many other Democrats. In the past, Trump was able to characterize his foes in memorable ways with nicknames that had the power to stick (Little Marco, Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe). When it comes to Harris and Walz, Trump is still struggling to define them in any language beyond that of GOP boilerplate rhetoric, which may convince the base but finds little resonance with the disengaged voters Trump so successfully mobilized with his original political campaign.\n\nTrump 2024 is a very different candidate than he was in 2016, when he upturned American politics. However disgusting Trump's demagoguery and racism were, he was an electrifying presence who had a compelling message: that America was governed by a bipartisan elite with globalist values whose preferred policies (free trade, robust immigration, an internationalist foreign policy that led to numerous wars) was bad for the country. To this supposed consensus, Trump presented himself as an outsider who, because of his wealth, could challenge the status quo. This message was largely a work of fiction (Trump's wealth was vastly overstated, and he effectively governed as a conventional Republican, aside from his heterodoxy on trade), but it made for a strong sales pitch.\n\nTrump in 2024 is both an older candidate and a more tired one. His current campaign is a rerun rather than a burst of originality. Symptomatic of this tiredness is his repeated deployment of old talking points and nicknames and his nursing of grudges from his 2020 election defeat (including his insistence that the election was stolen from him and that those arrested for attacking the Capitol on January 6 are victims of legal injustice).\n\nOccasionally Trump advocates some new policy ( such as removing taxes on tips-a proposal Kamala Harris has co-opted ). But none of these policies challenge the status quo the way Trump's 2016 campaign did. Trump is running a nostalgia campaign that appeals to those who have fond memories of his presidency. While this remains a significant chunk of the electorate, it isn't one that is likely to grow his support.\n\nAnd as a nostalgia act, Trump risks being constantly upstaged by the hot new thing. In recent public appearances, he's repeatedly overstated the size of crowds at his rally , while also falsely suggesting that Kamala Harris is drawing small crowds. On Sunday, Trump falsely claimed that a photo showing a large crowd greeting Kamala Harris at a Detroit airport was an AI-generated fake. These desperate lies are signs that Trump himself is aware that on some level that he's facing a formidable rival-and is falling behind. The election is still more than 80 days away and the dynamic could quickly shift. But without a change in message, Trump's campaign runs the real danger of sputtering along into irrelevance.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nElie Mystal\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

But after Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were famously guillotined in 1793, the surviving members of the House of Bourbon and their most fervent supporters were still adamantly committed to reviving to the same arrogant autocracy that provoked the French Revolution in the first place. In 1796, the Chevalier de Panat, a moderate who had hoped that in exile the monarchist faction would learn political prudence, despaired in a letter to a friend that \"no one has forgotten anything, nor learned anything.\" In historical memory, de Panat's quip is usually distilled into a punchier formulation: \"The Bourbons have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\"\n\nAfter Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the Bourbons did in fact enjoy a brief return to power, but the new regime of Louis XVIII and Charles X vindicated de Panat's analysis. The restored Bourbons displayed no greater governing skill than before, leading to the July Revolution of 1830.\n\nI've often thought that the epitaph \"learned nothing and forgotten nothing\" applies not just to the Bourbons but to the Democratic Party establishment. In 2016, this establishment received a major historical shock when their own Hillary Clinton-the candidate they had worked overtime to make the party's presidential nominee-was defeated by a rank outsider running an anti-system campaign, Donald Trump. The rise of Trumpism did not lead to any establishment self-criticism but rather generated fantasies of an ancien régime restoration: While the party did come to accept a few populist economic policies advocated by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, these were subsumed into a larger project to counter Trumpism by restoring bipartisan comity. The goal was a centrist-led popular front that gave pride of place to putatively moderate Republicans (notably John McCain and Mitt Romney) and wealthy donors (notably the former Republican Michael Bloomberg)-a coalition that would relegate Trumpism to the fringes of the political spectrum.\n\nIn 2020, the Democratic coalition coalesced behind Joe Biden as the most natural avatar of ancien régime restoration. Within the party itself, Biden was the one candidate who could fend off the insurgent threat of Bernie Sanders. More broadly, with a Senate career dating back five decades and a history of friendship with Republicans such as Strom Thurmond , Biden was the very embodiment of the old order. Making Biden the presidential nominee was the equivalent of French monarchists using demonic magic to revive a zombie Marie Antoinette. While Biden did make some adjustments to the realities of the 21st century, notably in supporting robust social spending advocated by the left wing of the Democratic Party, on the whole his presidency was a sustained exercise in bipartisan nostalgia-especially his foreign policy, devoted to funding proxy wars in Europe and the Middle East to shore up American global hegemony.\n\nNow, with Donald Trump's second presidential victory in three election cycles, the fantasy of ancien régime restoration should have been dealt a death blow.\n\nYet over the past week Biden has been using the waning days of his failed presidency to hand out awards that show his commitment to revitalizing a failed establishment is stronger than ever.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden gave the Presidential Citizens Medal to 20 people, including Liz Cheney, a former representative who is much celebrated among centrist Democrats for being a Republican who has been forthrightly critical of Donald Trump's attempted coup of 2021. Two days later, Biden gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom-the nation's highest civilian honor-to a group that The New York Times described as \"core members of the political, financial and celebrity establishment of which he has long been a part.\" Among the recipients were Hillary Clinton, the late George Romney (onetime governor of Michigan and father of Mitt Romney), and the billionaire George Soros. The Times explained the award to Soros by observing, \"After weeks in which Mr. Trump has showcased Elon Musk, the world's richest man, as a member of his inner circle, Mr. Biden appeared to want to say: We have our billionaires, too.\"\n\nNor is Soros the only billionaire laureled by Biden: David Rubenstein, founder of the private equity fund The Carlyle Group, also joined the honor roll of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As historian Rick Perlstein recently documented in The American Prospect , Rubenstein's stock in trade is leveraging political access for private profit, pioneering the vulture capitalist tactic of buying companies on borrowed money and strip mining them for profits. Garlanding a figure like Rubenstein as \"our billionaire\" is a good way to destroy any credibility the Democratic Party might have as a champion of ordinary people.\n\nAnother decidedly elite honoree was Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue . Explaining Wintour's prize, The New York Times noted that Wintour \"put the first lady, Jill Biden, on the cover of Vogue twice in the last four years while spurning Melania Trump during her husband's presidency. Ms. Wintour is one of the leading fund-raisers in the fashion industry, having hosted events for Mr. Biden's re-election campaign in London and Paris last year.\"\n\nThe Times sees Biden's awards as making a political statement, stating that \"the 82-year-old president is sending an unmistakable message of support for a democratic order he has said is threatened by Mr. Trump's re-election.\" Biden underscored this point at the end of the ceremony by saying, \"Let's remember, our sacred effort continues, and to keep going, as my mother would say, we have to keep the faith.\"\n\nThe noble injunction to \"keep the faith\" is less inspiring when we consider the exact nature of the faith Biden is celebrating here. In truth, these award ceremonies offer dispiriting proof that Biden has forgotten nothing and learned nothing. As Trump prepares to return to the White House and wreak untold damage, Biden is handing out participation trophies to a failed establishment. He is recommitting to the delusion of a revitalized bipartisan comity and the mirage of ancien régime restoration even after this project has proven decisively to be a disaster for America and for the world.\n\nEven worse, by presenting politics as a choice between Trump and this failed establishment, Biden is doing Trump a massive favor. The incoming president is no political genius. Trump is a squalid, nasty figure who has been deeply unpopular at most times with most of the population ever since he entered national politics . The one political advantage Trump has-the trump card that rarely fails-is he has been the voice of antiestablishment rage in a time when most Americans are unhappy with the political elite.\n\nWe live, as I've repeatedly insisted , in an age of anti-system politics. This has been the dominant reality in the United States since as least 2005, when the Iraq war intensified. In both the United States and the rest of the world, anti-system politics further intensified with the global economic meltdown of 2008.\n\nConsider the group that Biden decided to honor. What do Joe Biden, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, and the Cheney family all have in common? They all supported the Iraq war (and Dick Cheney was a major instigator of that war). David Rubenstein, whose Carlyle Group enormously benefited by buying up distressed defense firms in the 1990s that flourished after the 9/11 attack, is a direct beneficiary of militarism. To his credit, George Soros opposed the Iraq war, but one can still question the wisdom of honoring a billionaire during a time of antiestablishment rage. Broadly speaking, Biden has created a pantheon of figures who are associated with the most noxious features of the current system.\n\nTo be sure, Biden did honor some progressive figures in his choice for the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but it is striking that two of them are dead: Robert F. Kennedy Sr. (who was assassinated in 1968) and the civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer (who died in 1977). Kennedy was surely picked as a way to take back the Kennedy name, long cherished by Democrats, from the slain leader's renegade son, the Trump ally Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, this seems like an exercise in nostalgia. Hamer of course deserves all honors, but there are living civil rights leaders who could have been acknowledged as well. The struggle against racism is ongoing-all the more so with Trump's returning to the White House. It should not be relegated to mere history.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nElie Mystal\n\nA Democratic politics based on nostalgia and antiquarianism was always doomed to failure. The only way to fight Trump's fraudulent anti-system politics is to organize an anti-system politics of the left grounded in economic populism. This is the urgent political task of the present moment, and it means we have to relegate Biden and his illusions of ancien régime restoration to the same dustbin of history that houses the Bourbons.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

No doubt the time between now and January 20 will be a time of reckoning and recriminations about how the Democratic Party failed to fend off a profoundly flawed authoritarian-for the second time.\n\nBut all the while, the White House will remain occupied by Joe Biden. And now the first one-term Democratic chief executive since Jimmy Carter has a few weeks to make a last-ditch effort to salvage his legacy-and shore up the governmental guardrails that Trump imperils.\n\nThere is far more good that the Biden administration could do in its waning days than can possibly be named here. (The list of worthy pardons alone would be staggering.) But in particular, President Biden has clear opportunities when it comes to reforming criminal justice, brokering global peace, protecting immigrants, taking climate action, and fending off authoritarianism.\n\nFirst, he can bring to fruition a reform he's already begun to explore: legalizing marijuana. Back in May, Biden initiated a review of cannabis's status as a Schedule I drug, a pivot away from his long-standing opposition . It's debatable exactly how much authority the president has to change marijuana's legal status. But Biden could certainly conclude his administration's needlessly lengthy review process-how long does it take to say, \"It's not a gateway drug\"?-and officially recommend de-scheduling to federal agencies. He could also pardon anyone currently languishing in federal prison for nonviolent drug offenses. Since these prospective pardon recipients are disproportionately Black , the move would advance not just criminal but also racial justice. And crucially, making such moves would deny Trump the easy victory of making any of them himself .\n\nIn another commonsense change that would undo decades of senseless policy, the president could also finally normalize relations with Cuba. That would mean the restoration of official diplomatic ties, removal of the island from the State Sponsors of Terrorism List , and honoring the 22 bilateral agreements signed during the Obama administration before being torn up by Trump. It would also mean lifting sanctions that have fueled Cuba's ongoing economic crisis , and providing robust aid to people beset by severe fuel shortages and food rationing. Closing Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and returning it to Cuba as a hospital would disassemble the starkest symbol of American domineering on the island. And though Trump will almost certainly seek to reverse any executive actions on Cuba, Biden could make that politically complicated by opening up private-sector investment there.\n\nThat's not the only unfinished diplomacy at stake. The backdoor conversations between Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu-and \"backdoor\" here means \" openly discussed \"-were dispiritingly evocative of the alleged Republican efforts in 1980 to delay the release of American hostages in Iran until after Reagan defeated Carter and took office . Now, whether the horrors escalate or a ceasefire is brokered that Trump gets undeserved credit for, this conflict is set to go down as Biden's signature foreign policy failure. But he still has time, in the twilight of his presidency, to assert some moral authority by enforcing the Leahy Law -which prevents the US from providing military aid to a country that has violated human rights -and halting, even temporarily, arms shipments to Israel.\n\nAs he makes his final efforts to curb humanitarian crises in Gaza and Cuba, Biden might also try to avert a future one along the United States' southern border. Trump has threatened to double down on the cruel immigration policies of his first term through \" the vast arsenal of federal powers .\" That could include the mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, as well as a resumption of his family separation policy at the border. President Biden can try to stymie this sadism by fast-tracking citizenship applications , reversing an executive order restricting asylum , and expanding work permits for undocumented immigrants. These compassionate reforms could profoundly change the outlook for many people who might otherwise be under threat in January and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile, with at least 3 million Americans already forced by extreme weather to become climate refugees, Biden has more than enough reason to declare a climate emergency. He claims to have \"practically\" done so , but actually doing so would enable him to circumvent a stubborn Congress to allot additional climate funding. Then, he can implement a raft of overdue executive orders, from more niche but nonetheless consequential reforms like decarbonizing the maritime industry , to sweeping (and promised) changes like banning offshore drilling . Such action would cement Biden's legacy as arguably the greenest president in modern history-and force Trump to make unfavorable headlines if he wants to undo that progress.\n\nFinally, Biden must take concrete steps to fend off the threat of authoritarianism that Trump's second term poses. American democracy may now be in its most vulnerable position since the Civil War. That's why filling all 46 judicial vacancies with judges who will uphold the rule of law is nonnegotiable. He can also reach across the aisle to address concerns about election integrity-before Trump takes that matter into his own paws-by replacing antiquated voting machines , conducting audits, and protecting poll workers and election officials.\n\nAbove all, a productive, placid lame-duck period would do much to demonstrate for the first time in eight years what a peaceful transfer of power looks like-even as Biden hands it back to the person responsible for that lapse.\n\nWeeks after he had conducted a different kind of transfer of power, on the first night of this year's Democratic National Convention, Biden summed up his hopes for his legacy: \"Let me know in my heart...that I gave my best to you.\" Between now and January, he can do his best to align that self-evaluation with history's judgment.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But it was entwined with a foreign policy that leaves his legacy drowned in blood.\n\nOn July 13, just eight days before he announced the end of his presidential reelection bid, a besieged and testy Joe Biden defended himself from critics within his own party by boasting about his mastery of foreign policy. During Biden's agitated Zoom call with moderate congressional Democrats, Colorado Representative Jason Crow-who as it happens voted with the president 100 percent of the time-cautioned him that voters were questioning his foreign policy leadership. Biden responded angrily: \"Name me a foreign leader who thinks I'm not the most effective leader in the world on foreign policy. Tell me! Tell me who the hell that is! Tell me who put NATO back together! Tell me who enlarged NATO, tell me who did the Pacific Basin!... We've got Korea and Japan working together, I put AUKUS together, anyway!... Find me a world leader who's an ally of ours who doesn't think I'm the most respected person they've ever-\"\n\n\"It's not breaking through, Mr. President, to our voters,\" Crow interjected respectfully.\n\n\"You oughta talk about it!\" Biden fired back, his bitterness intensifying. \"On national security, nobody has been a better president than I've been. Name me one. Name me one! So I don't want to hear that crap!\"\n\nThis scene distills, in brief, the nausea-inducing pathos of Biden's presidency. Fending off an uprising inside his own party, Biden sounded less like a confident leader than a raving Captain Ahab (from Moby-Dick ) or Captain Queeg (from The Caine Mutiny )-an unstable commander who needed to be removed from power immediately.\n\nBiden's self-celebratory view wasn't widely shared outside the White House: He had low approval ratings in general and particularly for his handling of foreign policy . Even among liberals and leftists who might otherwise give high marks to Biden's domestic policy, there has been widespread criticism of his militarism, especially his near-unqualified support for Israel's ferocious attacks on Palestinian civilians.\n\nFor his allies among liberals and the left, Biden is a figure not just of pathos but of genuine tragedy. It's hard to come to any easy judgment, because Biden's ambitious domestic agenda was inextricable from his foreign policy. Both sprang from the same holistic vision of fusing together military spending and domestic policy to return America to the strength it enjoyed during its Cold War peak of global dominance. Biden was not an enemy like Donald Trump who could be easily disavowed, but a more complexly dangerous figure, a semi-friend who entangled us in his folly.\n\nBut was Biden's team right in thinking that its foreign and domestic policies were inseparable? Or is there a way to build on Biden's domestic achievements while leaving behind his discredited foreign policy?\n\nBiden's conception of himself as a foreign policy giant-a modern Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger-was echoed by his staff. Just two days before the exchange with Crow, Andrew Bates, the senior deputy press secretary and deputy assistant to the president, posted on X: \"To answer the question on everyone's minds: No, Joe Biden does not have a doctorate in foreign affairs. He's just that fucking good.\"\n\nBates's exaltation of Biden was risible at the time and has become even more ludicrous in the wake of press reports documenting that Biden was mentally diminished for much (if not all) of his presidency. A devastating December 19 article in The Wall Street Journal makes clear that Biden was surrounded by a Praetorian Guard of enablers and deceivers who propped up the image of the president as still in control even as they covertly ran the Oval Office. According to the Journal , \"Senior advisers were often put into roles that some administration officials and lawmakers thought Biden should occupy, with people such as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan...frequently in the position of being go-betweens for the president.\" American foreign policy, it seems, was effectively run by a behind-the-scenes triumvirate of ultra-hawks made up of Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and adviser Brett McGurk.\n\nBiden's central belief was that his foreign policy was one of his greatest strengths, when in fact it was his Achilles' heel. In the final weeks of the race, Trump-whose internal polling showed that undecided voters didn't like the president's Middle East policy- styled himself as an anti-war candidate who would halt the Biden-Harris administration's rush to World War III. It was a cynical message, but one that resonated with voters weary of the unending wars that defined Biden's term in office.\n\nThe unpopularity of Biden's foreign policy can be seen in a Cato Institute poll done on the cusp of the election in three crucial swing states (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan), which showed that majorities of voters \"believed the US is 'too involved' in world affairs and global conflicts (WI: 53%, PA: 50%, MI: 52%); say US foreign policy does not put American interests first (WI: 62%, PA: 61%, MI: 60%); and think it's likely that the US is 'closely' approaching World War III (WI: 59%, PA: 51%, MI: 54%).\"\n\nBiden's approval numbers first took a steep dive after the botched withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, a justified policy that was marred by bad execution. As the Journal reports, \"Some legislative leaders had a hard time getting the president's ear at key moments, including ahead of the U.S.'s disastrous pullout from Afghanistan.\" Biden and his tight inner circle ignored credible analysis that the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was likely to collapse quickly in the wake of an American pullout. With few plans prepared for this contingency, the Biden White House instead nursed delusions that there would be a \"decent interval\" of months or even years between the US withdrawal and Afghanistan's unraveling.\n\nWhile Biden took pride in his support for Ukraine after the Russian invasion, there is evidence that his administration undermined crucial negotiations between the two countries in the spring of 2022-a fateful decision that extended the fighting even as the war devastated Ukraine's landscape and population. The likely deal Ukraine will negotiate with Russia under Trump will be far worse than anything Ukraine could have achieved if Washington hadn't blocked negotiations in 2022.\n\nIn the Middle East, the killing fields of Gaza will be remembered as one of the great crimes of the era. Israel's war has already been classified as a genocide by numerous scholars of war crimes as well as by mainstream institutions such as the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and Amnesty International. Israel's indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians could not have happened on the scale it has without American aid, and Amnesty International (among other human rights organizations) has convincingly argued that this military aid was in violation of both international and US law. By refusing to follow his country's own laws, Biden himself is a partner to these war crimes. Like Lady Macbeth, his hands will be forever stained with blood.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nBiden's fetishization of alliances such as NATO and AUKUS was based on the dubious idea that the United States has an overriding interest in a renewed great-power competition with both Russia and China-a shift from the approach, which prevailed from the Nixon administration through the Obama presidency, of trying to assimilate China into global capitalism. Like Lyndon Johnson, Biden was a towering domestic president undone by a hawkish foreign policy. For both LBJ and Biden, domestic and foreign policy went hand in hand: As liberal hawks, they practiced military Keynesianism, the policy (embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike) of using military spending (which enjoys a unique protection from accusations of socialism) as a de facto industrial policy and economic stimulus. In this holistic vision, the home front must be reformed to make the empire safe-and it is the strength of the empire that allows domestic life to flourish.\n\nBiden's identity as a liberal hawk has roots in both his own political history and in the response his forward-looking foreign policy advisers, notably Jake Sullivan, developed to Trumpism.\n\nAlthough Biden entered the Senate in 1973 as a critic of the Vietnam War, he drifted to the right on foreign policy because of his relationship with Washington Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson. Cold War liberalism incarnate, Jackson was a fierce hawk who fought against Richard Nixon's policy of détente with the Soviet Union and was an unwavering supporter of Israel, while at the same time backing a robust welfare state and strong labor unions. In a 1983 eulogy on the Senate floor, Biden said that \"Jackson changed a major part of my political life\" by teaching him the importance of Israel to American foreign policy.\n\nAs vice president under Barack Obama, however, Biden seemed to be aware that the time of Scoop Jackson had passed. Though he remained pro-Israel, Biden cautioned the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \"Bibi, I gotta tell you, I'm coming under a lot of pressure back here. This is not Scoop Jackson's Democratic Party.\"\n\nBut the rise of Trump in 2016 persuaded Biden-as well as staffers like Sullivan-that there might be value in returning to Jackson-style liberal hawkery. Trump had won in part because he pried away white working-class voters upset about how trade deals had moved good manufacturing jobs to countries like China. Trump's revival of protectionism-part of his genuine economic pitch to blue-collar voters-discredited the long epoch of neoliberal ascendancy in the Democratic Party that stretched from Jimmy Carter to Obama.\n\nBiden and his team saw Trump as both an authoritarian threat domestically and part of a global resurgence of autocracy seen in nations like Russia and Hungary (whose leaders Trump often praised and seemed to emulate) as well as in the growing power of China. To fight Trumpism, they thought, something like a revived Cold War liberalism was needed: a robust foreign policy that eschewed Trump's America First rhetoric and reasserted American leadership of alliances such as NATO (whose members Trump had disdained as freeloaders) and AUKUS.\n\nDuring the period of triumphant neoliberalism, from 1991 to 2016, the United States had sought to integrate China into the American-led international order. Under the new dispensation, that policy would be replaced by an open pursuit of great-power competition with both Russia and China-a hubristic vision that recalled the American bid for global supremacy during the peak of the Cold War in the 1950s and '60s. Abandoning neoliberal trade policies, the United States would treat China as a competitor to be fought with counter-alliances and tariffs. The break with neoliberalism would include large-scale infrastructure spending to create manufacturing jobs that would revive working- and middle-class prosperity, bringing back the broadly shared wealth of mid-century America. A newly thriving middle class would then dampen the polarization and alienation that fueled Trumpism. Meanwhile, new infrastructure spending would focus on the transition to clean energy-addressing the climate crisis and offering the United States a chance to modernize its economy (and compete with China). With this fusion of the warfare state and the welfare state, democracy could be saved both at home and abroad. Scoop Jackson could look down upon his former protégé and smile.\n\nThe most cogent exposition of Biden's new military Keynesianism was a speech on \"a foreign policy for the middle class\" that Jake Sullivan delivered at the Brookings Institution on April 27, 2023. In that speech, Sullivan insisted on the importance of \"President Biden's core commitment-indeed...his daily direction to us-to more deeply integrate domestic policy and foreign policy.\"\n\nSullivan crafted an impressively cohesive foreign policy vision, one that linked a host of genuine domestic and international problems and seemed to offer a few core policies to address them while building a durable political coalition that could counter Trumpism. In practice, however, these ideas led to disaster.\n\nAs progressive and left critics have repeatedly pointed out, this foreign policy vision failed not just because of faulty execution but because of fundamental contradictions. The sharpest critics of Bidenism have been left voices such as Richard Beck (writing in New Left Review ) , Adam Tooze (in the London Review of Books ) , and Grey Anderson (in Sidecar ) and progressive critics like Nancy Okail and Matt Duss (writing together in Foreign Affairs ) . Despite their differing perspectives, these critics all focused on the internally contradictory nature of Bidenism: The problem with military Keynesianism is that, over time, the militarism devours the Keynesianism. As Beck observes:\n\nThe first pillar of the Biden administration's geopolitical strategy, \"a foreign policy for the middle class,\" which amounts in practice to a protectionist green-military Keynesianism targeting China, has been meaningfully undercut by the consequences of pursuing the second pillar, democracies versus autocracies. The Russia-Ukraine war has exacerbated an inflationary surge around the world, including within the United States. Even with historically low levels of unemployment and strong wage growth (at least relative to recent history), Americans have been outraged by levels of inflation not seen in decades, and their views on Biden's stewardship of the economy are particularly negative.\n\nBeck's analysis is compelling. While the initial cause of inflation throughout the world was the supply-chain shock triggered by Covid, the Dallas Federal Reserve noted on May 17, 2022, \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dealt a blow to the global economy-weakening the postpandemic recovery and aggravating already-high inflation.\" Biden's failure to pursue a negotiated settlement to the conflict meant that this exacerbation of inflation would continue.\n\nBiden's claims that his foreign policy is essential to the global struggle between democracy and autocracy are belied by the enduring hypocrisies of American realpolitik. In light of the mass slaughter in Gaza and the intensifying brutality of the occupation in the West Bank, it's impossible for any rational person to take his claims about human rights seriously. Biden insists that he wants to refurbish and restore the liberal international order, but defending Israel at all costs has meant a constant attack on the very institutions that make up that order, such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. Not surprisingly, many in the Global South see the United States as hypocritical on international law, which has undermined Biden's efforts to create a coalition to oppose Putin's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nBiden's larger Middle Eastern policy has been one of bolstering not just the increasingly authoritarian Israeli government but also the Arab autocrats, whom the administration, following in the footsteps of the Trump administration, hoped to unite in a regional defense alliance with Israel under the compact known as the Abraham Accords (seen as a necessary move in the push toward a great-power competition with China). This policy meant that, even before the Hamas attack on October 7, Biden's administration had sidelined the Palestinians. The journalist Alexander Ward, in his book The Internationalists , a sympathetic study of Biden's foreign policy, quotes an administration official saying that they put \"not a fucking second of effort\" into pushing for a two-state solution.\n\nThe Abraham Accords meant the embrace of both the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (the blood-soaked tyrant known as MBS, whom Biden had previously promised to disavow) and Benjamin Netanyahu (the dominating spirit of an increasingly authoritarian ethnocentric state). As Ward reports, \"Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir told me that it was shameful of the United States to blame his nation for human rights abuses when Washington was responsible for atrocities around the world.\"\n\nIn addition to MBS and Netanyahu, the other autocrats whom Biden bear-hugged included South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Angolan President João Lourenço .\n\nBiden has accurately described climate change as an \"existential threat to all of us\" and \"the ultimate threat to humanity.\" Yet his pursuit of great-power competition with China suggests that climate change is not really a priority. As Beck notes:\n\nWith respect to climate change...this is not a problem that can be addressed through competition among nation states. What's required is coordination and cooperation, on a global scale, to decarbonize production as quickly as possible. Instead, the Biden Administration is wasting time trying to shore up domestic firms that are clearly inferior to their international counterparts, further delaying a decarbonization effort that is already hopelessly behind schedule.\n\nSome of Biden's ideological allies square this circle by stating frankly that defeating China is more important than saving the planet. David Shor, whose firm Blue Rose Research played a major role in vetting ads for the super PAC Future Forward, which had a budget of $950 million to support Kamala Harris's campaign, tweeted in 2021: \"I would much rather live in a world where we see a 4-degree rise in temperature than live in a world where China is a global hegemon.\" In 2024, Matthew Yglesias, whose Substack is closely followed in the White House, tweeted : \"We're just getting our butts kicked [by China] in a way that I think is bad and way more important than climate change.\" In its actions, if not in its rhetoric, the Biden White House operated according to this logic: that American global hegemony is more important than the survival of Earth as a habitable planet for humans. This is the equivalent of reacting to the iceberg hitting the Titanic by engaging in a battle to remain captain rather than helping passengers get into the lifeboats.\n\nIn the bitter aftermath of Biden's failed presidency, the broad Democratic coalition (both liberals and the left) will have to hammer out a new policy that eschews the nostalgic fantasy of permanent American hegemony. If the greatest threat to humanity is climate change, that has to be the organizing principle for foreign policy, which means abandoning military Keynesianism for true Keynesianism: large-scale spending not to bolster military power but to avert planetary catastrophe. That new foreign policy will mean the United States takes diplomacy far more seriously than Biden did: a diplomacy based not on reviving antiquated alliances like NATO and AUKUS, but rather on working with rising powers in the Global South to actually solve real problems such as pandemics, climate-induced migration, and decarbonizing the economy.\n\nBiden's nostalgia destroyed what could have been a great presidency. It belongs to a past that we have to leave behind if we want to survive.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

This was home ground for Biden, the most ostentatiously Irish figure ever to occupy the Oval Office. He should have been able to schmooze his way through it on autopilot. Yet he had to use a teleprompter for his remarks. Even in the friendliest and least stressful of public environments, he could not risk the possibility of losing track of what he was saying.\n\nIn his lively, engaging but sometimes frustrating chronicle of the 2024 presidential election campaign, Chris Whipple records the incredulity of one of those at the gathering, Barack Obama's former chief of staff Bill Daley: \"If the president needed a script for a small gathering of Irish guys, how would he survive the rigors of a campaign? 'How are they letting this thing go on?' he thought. 'This is crazy.'\" Elsewhere in Whipple's narrative, Daley expresses his anger at those around Biden in rather more earthy terms: \"Every freaking one of them had no balls.\"\n\nWhipple's previous book, \" The Fight of His Life \" (2023), is a sympathetic account of Biden's first two years in office, written with the obvious cooperation of his inner circle. It is thus unsurprising that \"Uncharted\" is most vivid when recreating the drama of the president's stubborn refusal to realize that he was in no condition to stand against Donald Trump last November. Yet this strength also underlines the book's limitations: It never quite manages to answer Daley's question. How did they let this thing go on?\n\nThe tragedy for America - and for the world - is not that the Democratic Party was deluded about what was at stake in the 2024 race. It is that it was all too cleareyed in its perception of what a triumphant return for Trump would mean for democracy in America. Admittedly, this did not require any great foresight; Trump's first term had given ample warning of the looming disaster of a second coming emboldened by absolute impunity and embittered by a thirst for vengeance.\n\nThis awareness brings to mind T.S. Eliot's line: \"After such knowledge, what forgiveness?\" For anyone who is outside the MAGA bubble, the first and best half of Whipple's book is a voyage into the unforgivable. He shows in vibrant detail that some of Biden's closest advisers were in little doubt about the heavy toll old age had taken on his capacity to perform as president in 2024, let alone to convince voters that he was in fine shape to do so until 2029. They persisted regardless in feeding his delusions until, as it turned out, it was too late to stop Trump. History will not be kind to them.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \" big F-ing deal \" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, whom we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nIs it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor who I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\n\nWe love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power, and all of the traits that made it so formidable with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "In Burisma Letter, Hunter Biden Sought Support from State Department\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nWhile Joe Biden was vice president, his son used the letterhead of a Ukrainian energy company when writing to a U.S. ambassador with ties to the family.\n\nBy Kenneth P. Vogel\n\nKenneth P. Vogel has extensively investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings.\n\nThe State Department last week released a letter that Hunter Biden wrote while his father was serving as vice president in which he sought assistance from the U.S. government for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nIn the previously unpublished June 2016 letter on Burisma letterhead to the U.S. ambassador to Italy, Mr. Biden requested \"support and guidance\" in arranging a meeting with an Italian official to resolve regulatory hurdles to geothermal energy projects Burisma was pursuing in the Tuscany region.\n\nIn a response letter also released by the State Department last week, the ambassador, John R. Phillips, indicated that he had dispatched a Commerce Department official to assist with the request.\n\nThe letters shed more light on an episode The New York Times had previously revealed .\n\nMr. Biden began his letter by referring to an interaction with the ambassador, writing, \"It was great seeing you in Rome recently.\"\n\nThe letter did not mention then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., nor did it specify when Hunter Biden saw the ambassador in Rome. He had traveled there at least twice with his father in the preceding months.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Phillips said that he did not view the letter as an effort to invoke the elder Mr. Biden in order to compel the embassy to help Burisma. Rather, Mr. Phillips said, he interpreted it as a reference to a Biden family trip to Rome over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2015, during which the younger Mr. Biden had spent time with the ambassador.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Joe Biden Says Age Is Just a Number\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy The Editorial Board Jan. 17, 2020\n\nMr. Biden interviews for The New York Times's endorsement.\n\nFormer vice president of the United States.\n\nKathleen Kingsbury: So Mr. Vice President, we're hoping to ask you a few questions that we haven't really heard you answer on the campaign trail yet.\n\nO.K.\n\nKK: We have a lot of questions to get through, so please excuse us in advance if we interrupt you. I want to start - you fought corruption in Ukraine. There is no indication that you or your son did anything wrong or were part of any corruption in Ukraine. But you still haven't really answered the question of whether or not you think it's proper for the son of a sitting vice president of the United States to serve on the board of a foreign company that's being investigated for corruption.\n\nLook, I fought corruption when I was in Ukraine. No one ever suggested I've done anything differently, including all of the president's men and women who testify. And I didn't realize he was on the board until he had been on the board for a while. You all did write, I think, in - I can't remember what month it was - but you indicated, and I think it was '15, that he shouldn't be on the board.\n\nHe's acknowledged that he thought it was a mistake. And as you pointed out, the focus here is, can't be taken off the fact who, in fact, violated the Constitution. Did the president of the United States engage in an offense that is a constitutional violation of seeking the influence of a foreign government? It's a legitimate question to ask, but seems to me that the core of it is: No one has suggested I did anything wrong. And I didn't realize he was on the board until after he had been on the board. At the same time, he has come forward and said it was a mistake on his part to be on the board.\n\nKK: Would you be in favor of a law banning the children of sitting presidents and vice presidents from serving on foreign companies' boards?\n\nThe answer is, I hadn't thought of it that way, but I don't think I would be opposed to it, except if, what happens if there's a - now it wouldn't apply to my family, but what happens if somebody's son or daughter has long been a member of a board of a major corporation that's a multinational corporation? It could be counterproductive, but I don't -\n\nLook, as I said, looking back on it, Hunter has indicated that he thought it was a mistake to do what he did, to get on the board, although no one's indicated he's done anything that was illegal or wrong. The one thing I will do as president is make sure no one in my family, while I'm president of the United States, has any involvement with any foreign government at all. That's also to make sure there's not a repetition of what's taking place in the Trump White House. No one in my family will have an office in the White House. No one in my family will be in on -\n\nKK: What about the first lady? [LAUGHTER]\n\nWell, the first lady will have an office, but it won't be in the White House probably. It'd probably be in the executive office building. But no one is, in my family, none of my children or anyone related to me, is going to be engaged in anything having to do with the conduct of foreign policy, international affairs, because I think what's - anyway.\n\nMara Gay: Mr. Vice President, why don't you support reparations for black Americans?\n\nWell, I do support reparations for black Americans. And the best way to get reparations for black Americans - end systemic segregation, and it's real, and it's genuine. I spent my whole career doing that.\n\nThe first thing I did as a young councilman and lawyer was to fight redlining, fundamentally alter the way in which we deal with, how we deal with education. I got deeply involved in the civil rights movement from the time I've been a kid. And so I think that the reparations argument and debate is worth people investigating it. But how do you make that judgment?\n\nIn the meantime, there's a lot we have to do right now to deal with the original sin of America, which is slavery. And so I think it's much more productive to move quickly on everything from access to education to loans. I mean, why in God's name is a situation where you can own a home, exact same home, on one side of the street, which is predominantly black, and you own the exact home across the street which is predominantly white, and your home will be valued less and your insurance will cost more? It's wrong. There's a whole range of things we can do legislatively now to deal with this systemic racism that still exists.\n\nMG : I'm just going to d rill down a little bit more on that. You said during the September debate, when asked about reparations, that black parents should, among other things, make sure that you have the record player on at night. How specifically should the country confront its history of slavery, discrimination and plunder of black America?\n\nWell, I think you're taking that out of context, but that's O.K.\n\nMG: Actually, it wasn't out of context.\n\nNo, well, O.K. The idea is that the responsibility rests on those who are still engaged in oppression to stop what they're doing and pay for what they've done if it's criminal. And if it's not criminal, pay for it economically and change the law. So that's the bottom line.\n\nI remember how much trouble Barack got in when he said that parents, black parents, should take responsibility. That wasn't my point. My point was to make it clear that there are a number of things we can do now to help parents who have been disadvantaged as a consequence of lack of opportunity to be able to provide more guidance and better guidance for themselves and their families. For example, we have one school psychologist for every 1,507 kids in public schools. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. We have virtually no social workers engaged anymore.\n\nWhat I found was that if, in fact, the people - if I can make an analogy to my father. My father was a well-read, high-school-educated guy, and I had an opportunity to go to different schools and offered some scholarships, some academic, some relating to playing sports. And my dad was one of those guys who said, \"You're going to be a college man, no matter what.\"\n\nI used to say to him, \"Why is that so important, Dad?\" He said, \"They can't take it from you.\" And so when I had an opportunity to visit campuses, I was surprised my father didn't want to go. I asked my mom, \"Why wouldn't Dad go on campus? He's been talking about this as long as I can remember.\" She said: \"Because he's embarrassed. He won't know what to say. He's embarrassed. What happens if someone turns to him and says, 'What about this or that or the other thing?'\"\n\nMy wife has taught for the last - my deceased wife taught grade school. My present wife of 47 years now has taught in high school and grade school, I mean, junior high, high school, and now she's a college professor, a community college professor. And the people who don't show up on the nights when there's a parent-teacher meeting are not people who in fact don't care, but folks from poor backgrounds. They don't show up because they're embarrassed. They're embarrassed the teacher's going to say - and it's hard to say, \"Well, I can't read,\" or \"I don't ...\"\n\nI'm talking about not just people of color, but poor folks. And so there's this about being able to give people a kind of help they desperately want without being embarrassed in getting the help, without being embarrassed that they're seeking the help.\n\nJesse Wegman: Or they're working a second job, right?\n\nWell, yeah. Well, that's true, but there's also a good deal of it, and check with the educators, there's a good deal is they just don't know what to say many of them. They don't show up. So that's why my wife started this mentoring program, and she, in fact, works with those families, calls them privately and says, \"Look, this is your son or your daughter, or blah, blah, blah. This is how we can be helpful this way,\" embracing people. A lot has to do with, you know, we underestimate, I think, across the board, the degree of pride people have, their pride. They just want to be treated with some dignity and a lot of it doesn't.\n\nMG: Mr. Vice President, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg has apologized for his record on stop-and-frisk and the decisions that he made in that policy. Just asking for a little bit of self-reflection here. Is there anything that you have changed your mind about, specifically related I would say to your record, or your thinking, your personal views, on race or busing or anything over the years?\n\nNo, not on race or busing because I think you've all been kind of shocked how much black support I have. Overwhelming black support in my home state. Overwhelming black support with the Black Caucus. Overwhelming black support with the black community because they know me. I've never been ashamed of anything I've done. I've fought for the African-American community and fought for them my entire career.\n\nI made a big mistake in the criminal justice side when I - it's easy to forget it now - but when, all of a sudden, crack was introduced as a great threat to the United States of America. And the guy who did it is a great guy, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, he pointed out it was coming from the Bahamas, and this was going to -\n\nAnd you had medical folks at the time saying, well, crack, because it immediately penetrates the membrane of the brain and it goes straight to the brain, it's going to have this long-term effect. So we bought on to the idea that crack somehow should be punished much more significantly than, in fact, powdered cocaine. Well, what it meant was somebody snorting powder in the party you guys go to.\n\nI don't mean you. [LAUGHTER] But wealthy neighborhoods, wealthy neighborhoods. If they were to get arrested, which they don't in the first place, but if they get arrested, they get a sentence that's 100 times less than someone is getting convicted of crack. You buy a nickel, anyway. And so from the time we passed that, two years after, I've been trying to change it and have been unable to do it. Barack and I got it down to 10 to one from a hundred to one. It should be zero.\n\nBut it's put a lot of people in jeopardy, put them in jail, and it's had a disproportionate impact on minority communities, particularly African-American communities. I sorely regret that. We've also learned a lot more about drug abuse overall. It used to be that we thought - I've spent a lot of my career in the Judiciary Committee dealing with this issue. We used to argue - and you tell me when I'm going longer than I should - we used to deal with it in terms of we thought that mental illness was a product of drug abuse. It's the reverse. Mental illness is the reason for drug abuse. It's not the reverse. And that's why, when I wrote the crime bill that everybody for a while there thought that was a massive reason for massive incarceration, which it wasn't, I might add. But what happened was I put in that bill, at the time, drug courts to try to divert anyone arrested for a drug offense to a drug court for rehab, not to go to jail.\n\nJeneen Interlandi: Just a quick follow-up on that, sorry.\n\nYeah, sure you can.\n\nJI: But one of the things I had wanted to ask you about was you've called for rescheduling marijuana so that scientists can better study its therapeutic potential. Virtually all of your opponents have gone further and actually called for full legalization at the federal level.\n\nThey have.\n\nJI: That's something that most people support in both parties and across most demographics agreed on. Can you make the case to me for why to take the more moderate approach when it seems --\n\nBecause I think science matters. I mean one of the reasons I'm running against the guy I'm running against is science matters, not fiction. Now nobody says, I'm not arguing, and Senator Booker acknowledged, I wasn't arguing that we should in fact, it was a gateway drug. What I'm arguing is there have been studies showing that it complicates other problems if you already have a problem with certain drugs. So we should just study it and decriminalize it, but study it and find out. Get the medical community to come up with a final definitive answer as to whether or not it does cause it. If it does cause other problems, then make it clear to people. So that's a place you don't not engage in the use of it.\n\nKK: But so many states have already legalized it.\n\nSure they have. I get that, but that doesn't mean the science shouldn't be looked at.\n\nJI: Couldn't you look at the science and legalize it at the federal level in tandem?\n\nNo. Why would you promote the science if the science would say it'd be a bad idea to legalize it? You've got to find out the facts first.\n\nKK: O.K., moving on.\n\nBut by the way, let's get something straight here. I've argued for some time total decriminalization. Anyone who has a record, it should be immediately expunged. So when you come to work for The New York Times, and they ask you if you have any problems, any criminal arrests, you don't have to say yes, because it will be completely expunged. And in fact, there should be anyone who is in fact, has been served any time in prison or is in prison, which a few people are these days, that they immediately be released, and the record totally expunged.\n\nAisha Harris: Mr. Vice President.\n\nYes.\n\nAH: You've expressed very little interest in entertaining millennials' concerns and complaints about the problems that they face, whether it's student debt [BIDEN LAUGHS] - well, you have said, \"I have no empathy for it. Give me a break.\" In terms of things that they've been concerned about, with the way in which the older generations have probably, older generations have made things worse for them as a generation. [BIDEN LAUGHS]\n\nSo do you think that millennials' experience have less of a burden than previous years?\n\nWhat I said I had no sympathy about - so let's get it straight, O.K.? What I said I had no sympathy about was I was asked the question about why - I made a commencement speech, I don't know which one, either Yale or Harvard, back-to-back two years - and a study came out showing that, although this was the most generous, most progressive, most involved generation in history, the best educated, which I paid tribute to, because I have three granddaughters are all part of that. My daughter is a social worker with a master's degree doing great work, et cetera.\n\nIt also said that, I forget the - don't hold me to the exact number, it was two years ago, three years ago, that something like only 16 percent of young millennials would in fact run for public office. And only 14 percent - it was a discrepancy of four points between women and men, but less than a quarter.\n\nSo I was at a university and they said, \"Well, why should we get involved? It's all dirty.\" I said, \"I don't want to hear it. Don't whine to me. I got the same lecture in 1972 when I was in the middle of a - there was a Vietnam War - where I got the same thing, or was told in 1965 when I got involved in the civil rights movement: Don't get involved, but you got to get involved.\n\nAH: But you did double down on those comments this past summer.\n\nSure I did. When they say to me, \"I'm not going to get involved.\" I said, \"No, I don't want to hear it. Get involved.\"\n\nAH: But some could argue that you're sort of painting a broad brush of the millennials. You have --\n\nNo, I'm not. I was answering questions. The question was, \"Why should I get involved?\" I said, \"Because it's your responsibility. You have a responsibility.\"\n\nAH: So do you think that this younger generation as a whole is not participating enough, and they don't have the same burdens as previous generations?\n\nNo. What's happening is it's awakened now. The point I always make is if, in fact, the generation between 18 and 30 vote in the same percentage as above 30, there would have been 5.2 million more votes cast last year, and we wouldn't have this president we have. We wouldn't have him. They sat home, didn't get involved.\n\nWhere I come from, you don't say, \"Well, that's your choice. That's O.K.\" Don't lecture me on responsibility - not you. Don't have them lecture me on responsibility, and then not participate. When I got involved, it's not a comparison, it's just a generically comparable thing. When I got involved it was, like, drop out. Go to Haight-Ashbury. Don't get involved. Literally across the board. You don't trust anybody over 30. And all of a sudden things got so damn bad, a generation said, \"Enough, enough,\" and we got involved, and we ran.\n\nI ran in 1972, a kid with no background in terms of money or influence. I'm the first senator I ever knew, and in the state that was then, we didn't call them red and blue, that was a red state.\n\nNixon got 64 percent of the vote in my state, and won by 3,200 votes. I went out, and we put together 20,000 volunteers of young people.\n\nAH: So --\n\nTwo years before we couldn't do that. But what happens is, look, there's two ways generations get engaged. One by inspirational people like the John Kennedys of the world, and other by really bad presidents, and really bad things that are happening. This guy is engaging [people] everywhere I go. Everywhere I go, there's more and more and more young people. Everywhere I go, I talk about the need for them to get engaged.\n\nAnd by the way, I do as well with those millennials as anybody else does as a percentage. Bernie does the best. The old guy like me. He does the best, and I'm the only one that has support across the spectrum of every single element of the Democratic Party. So, I mean this idea I'm anti-millennial, I mean --\n\nAH: Well, I didn't say that, but --\n\nWell, the equivalent. I didn't say you said it, but the implication is I don't care much about it. I care like the devil about them. They are the future.\n\nKK: Since you just called yourself the old guy - Jimmy Carter has said that he wouldn't be up for the job of the presidency at age 80. He's obviously experienced the job, and lived the job. How do you respond to comments like that? Are you too old to be running for president?\n\nWatch me. Watch me. All this stuff about lack of energy. Come get in the bus with me, 16 hours a day, 10 days in a row. Come see me.\n\nAH: Do you have an exercise routine?\n\nEvery morning.\n\nAH: What is it?\n\nI do three things. I bike, treadmill and I lift. I have the doctor who is the fellow - when you get to the White House, you get a medical doc who gets assigned to you and one of them was a colonel in the United States Army who, when I had a separated shoulder and I ended up having an operation - seven screws put in the shoulder to put it back together again, doing therapy. And he sends me - if I had my phone, I'd show you - he sends me every morning, every morning, an exercise routine, and I do it every morning. I'm not in bad shape.\n\nKK: Why haven't you released any health records?\n\nOh, I am. I didn't say I didn't - I've always released my health records, and I was asked when I would do it. I had a chance, by the end of the week, you'll have a detailed health record.\n\nKK: A complete set of health records?\n\nYeah.\n\nKK: O.K. By the end of this week?\n\nYes, because I got a chance to go down and see my doc and go through all the tests, and the whole deal. He's about to release a record that lays out what I've had before or what I've gone through, the state of my health, and you're going to be disappointed. I'm in really good health.\n\nKK: We will not be disappointed. So how many push-ups can you do?\n\nI can do 44, but what I'm doing is that I pulled my bicep on the right. So I'm doing these - if you exercise, I'm doing closed-hand push-ups because outside is putting too much pressure on this one.\n\nKK: Do you want to show us? No, just kidding. [LAUGHTER]\n\nIf you want me to.\n\nKK: Let's do it.\n\nMichelle Cottle: Yeah. O.K. Don't ever do that in a room.\n\nSoon as I do that, you'll write, Biden - anyway. [LAUGHTER]\n\nBS: You got some ringers in the crowd in case you can't tell.\n\nKK: In case you wanted to --\n\nMC: We've been practicing for days.\n\nJD: Ringers out here.\n\nMG: We're ready.\n\nI don't doubt it. I don't doubt it. Look, I mean, let me put it this way. I've always been a pretty good athlete. I've stayed engaged. I work out regularly. The worst thing is that, those of you women and men who are athletes, you always think you can still do what you always did, which I keep thinking to myself.\n\nI've adopted Satchel Paige's attitude toward age. He pitched a win when he was 47 years old. He was pitching for the St. Louis team, and he'd beat the Cubs, and they come in and, Satch, amazing. Nobody's ever pitched - on your birthday, 47 years old. You pitched a win. How do you feel about your age? He looked at them. He said, \"That's not how I look at age, boys.\" They said, \"How do you look?\" He said, \"Look at it this way. How old would you be if you didn't know how old you were?\" I'm 50.\n\nJW: Do you think it's legitimate for voters to be concerned about people in their later 70s running for the highest office in the world?\n\nSure, just like it's legitimate for people to ask about whether you're mature enough when you're 35. I'm not joking. I mean, I went through the same thing when I was 29 years old. Well, wait a minute, are you old enough? And so, it's totally legitimate.\n\nBinyamin Appelbaum: So we have a 35-year-old limit. Should we have one at the top end too?\n\nNo.\n\nBA: Should there be a top? Why not?\n\nBecause why would you? Show me where it's been a problem.\n\nBA: Why 35 then?\n\nThirty-five --\n\nJW: Well, President Reagan --\n\nWell, look, guys. I think you guys are engaging in ageism here. Now look, all kidding aside, I don't think they're - the voters will be able to make a judgment. You'll make a judgment whether or not you think I have all my cognitive capability, I'm physically capable, and I have the energy to do the job. And so.\n\nMC: So now your message is more you're running on experience, a restoration of sanity, invocations of the Obama era. How do you convince younger voters that you are the person to help move the party into the future? So that's a bit of a nostalgia thing.\n\nNo. By the way, just so you know, my message isn't that I'm going to return to the Obama era. My message is twofold. Number one, the next president of the United States, I think you'd all have to admit, is going to have to be able to do two things. [A PHONE PLACED BY A STAFFER TO RECORD THE INTERVIEW RINGS] What the hell is that?\n\nKK: You're getting a call.\n\nOh.\n\nBS: That's your staff.\n\nI assume I may have - they told me they wanted this to be taped. But two things. One, I think we'd all agree, is going to inherit a divided nation. And secondly, is going to inherit a world in disarray. I think it's fair to say, what's fair to say or not. I believe that my experience in both those areas better equips me than anybody running in either party to deal with both those issues.\n\nI have a record where I have gotten big things done. I've been able to work with the opposition. I've been able to work, not all the time, when I haven't been able to have them join, I've gone out and beaten them, like we did in the 2018 election. What we just did recently in the off-year election.\n\nI went into 24 states, and I went into the red states, and I went into the purple states, and we won. Some of you suggested, when I said we'll win back 41 seats, there goes Biden again. We won 41 seats because I was convinced that the American people understood finally what they didn't understand before. They didn't know what Obamacare was. They didn't know Obama did it. They didn't even know why they had it. They weren't even sure, and all of a sudden, it starts getting taken away, they're aware of it.\n\nBut this is a different world inherited - when I'm president, I'm inheriting a different world than Barack inherited. But some of the things that were left on the table are the same kind of massive things that are going to have to be dealt with. For example, we've got a world in disarray. Who's going to be able to stand on the stage the first day and command the respect of the world leaders? I think I'm the only one who has that experience. That experience matters a lot.\n\nI'll deal with different problems. My job will be not to go back to the old days, but be able to re-establish our alliances, keep the world from falling apart, keep NATO from disintegrating, etc. The same way, for example, climate change. You saw what happened this weekend? We didn't show up. In fact, we tried to raise the ante. I'm one of the guys that put that climate change deal together, but it requires someone who the rest of the world's going to respect when they ask them to come to the United States, a hundred of them, somewhere between 180 and 200 sit down and say, we have to up the ante now. The politics has changed in terms of what is actually happening in the environment.\n\nKK: You've hinted a little bit that you'd be willing to only serve one term.\n\nI never hinted that. That is simply not true.\n\nBS: Where'd that come from?\n\nKK: Yeah, where does that come from?\n\nI don't know where it came from, but it did not - it came from somebody who in fact, I guess, thinks that they know me and thinks that maybe, I don't know.\n\nKK: Who's on your short list for vice president?\n\nI'm not going to presume that because you'll eat me alive on that. [LAUGHTER] But there's a bunch of people that are qualified. I mean a whole group of people in addition to the ones that are running who aren't running. I can think of, off the top of my head, five women who hold public office who would be completely qualified, who are not running for president. I can think of at least four African-Americans, and I -\n\nJohn Broder: Can you name them?\n\nYeah, I can, but I'm not going to because what you'll do, Biden's being presumptuous. I don't have the nomination yet.\n\nBA: Would you pick a running mate over the age of 70?\n\nYeah, sure I would. No, what I'm going to have to do is to balance just like anybody balances. I'm going to make sure that whoever is picked as vice president, where I'm the nominee, everyone thinks is able to, if I drop dead tomorrow, would be able to take over. Look, the idea that somebody who is 60 can't be diagnosed with stage-four glioblastoma is no different than the idea someone at 77 won't be diagnosed with a terminal disease.\n\nBA: But you mentioned your adherence to science before. You surely know that the odds increase with age.\n\nYeah, they do. They do. But they don't increase like they did. We're in a situation where things are fundamentally different than they were 20 years ago.\n\nMC: One of the things you have to deal with in addition to just questions about basic age is as long as you've been in public life, you have baggage.\n\nThat's right.\n\nMC: And you've had in debates, a couple of times, you've had a little trouble answering for positions that you held decades ago, which I think is a bit ridiculous that that's an issue. But those questions aren't going to go away. So have you had time to figure out a strategy for just answering, kind of the basic approach to those?\n\nThe answer is yes. If you notice, they've hit me on every single thing I could be hit on so far. That's the good news. Every aspect of my record, period, has been hit. By Trump and by the people I'm running against. And I'm a big boy. My dad used to have an expression. Never complain and never explain. And so, and guess what? I'm still leading in all the polls. O.K.? That's number one.\n\nNumber two, if you take a look at what they call these debates, they're not debates. They're 30- to 45-second assertions. Because what comes to me all the time is the attack. I get to speak, but I get to speak in response to an attack.\n\nAnd one of the things that I have to admit to you, I've had difficulty accommodating, is how do you turn to someone who is attacking you on something that I know they know is not true, and do it in a way that doesn't look like you're being dismissive? Particularly if it's a person of color or if it's a woman. And so I've had to learn how to deal with that. I mean, look, you have a situation where when I was attacked on busing. It's acknowledged now the woman who attacked me had this exact same position I had. Exact. No different. None.\n\nKK : You have always been known --\n\nSo what do I say?\n\nKK : You've been known as a great retail politician, but there have been some kind of odd moments on the campaign trail in the last few months. When you called the guy fat -\n\nI didn't call him fat. That's not true. I started to say fact was, and I decided to back off it. I did not call him fat. No. I honest to God didn't.\n\nKK: We'll check the tape on that.\n\nCheck it.\n\nKK: You know what? I'd really like to move on maybe to a couple of other issues if you don't mind. Lauren, do you want to --\n\nSure! No, I'd rather continue to talk about my age.\n\nLauren Kelley: I have a different topic for you. Mr. Vice President, I'd love to ask you about reproductive rights.\n\nYes.\n\nLK: So I think it's fair to say that this is a pretty extraordinary moment for reproductive rights. They're more threatened than they probably have been since Roe v. Wade was passed.\n\nI agree.\n\nLK: There are a lot of people who question whether you will go on the offensive for reproductive rights as much as is going to be necessary with Roe v. Wade under threat, given the fact that, while you are pro-choice certainly, you switched your position on Hyde only just recently. For instance, you also originally argued for greater exemptions to the contraception mandate in Obamacare. So I think there's some concern out there --\n\nNo, I didn't, by the way.\n\nLK: You didn't?\n\nNo, I was on the opposite side of that.\n\nLK: There was a lot of reporting from the time that said that you were arguing - I think it was a political strategy, right? That it might be read as trampling on religious freedom. But that's not correct?\n\nNo. What is not correct is the idea that - the argument was what the president put out initially was different than what ended up being finally the final position on. And the question was, would I defend the president? I don't want to get into --\n\nLK: O.K., how about we focus on Hyde then?\n\nBut anyway. I can explain Hyde.\n\nLK: Please do.\n\nFirst of all, everybody's voted for Hyde. Every single person running has voted --\n\nLK : Well, because it's in the spending bill.\n\nWell, I understand. I got it. But they all, this idea, this is such a principle thing.\n\nLK: Well, it's principled. I mean, most of the party has been in favor of overturning Hyde.\n\nNo, I understand that. I understand that. Look, let me answer the question directly. I thought that when there were reasonable alternatives and funding mechanisms that did not deny women the opportunity to take advantage of their constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade, as amended by Casey, that in fact it was O.K. to not make other people who had strong views different than that pay for it. But - let me finish, please.\n\nLK: Go ahead.\n\nBut when in fact we decided that we were going to move to, which I wanted to do a long time ago and everybody has, is to have basically universal health care. That option is eliminated. It's not available if it's basically universal health care. You cannot say that the poor women are now going to be covered by Medicaid and/or, and my plan, a Medicare option in to Obamacare and then expect that there's going to be mechanisms by which they could still get the kind of help they got through private contributions and Planned Parenthood, which rated me 100 percent, by the way, during this period and the rest.\n\nLK: Sure.\n\nAnd so that's why I changed the position.\n\nLK: Mr. Vice President, though, the thing is, under the Hyde Amendment, it has been the case since 1976 that women who are on Medicaid, women who are in the armed services and other women have not had access to reproductive health care if they can't afford it. So I guess I don't understand how it is, that by changing the health care plan that --\n\nI changed the health care plan. That's the only vehicle people are actually going to have because people aren't spending the money on supporting these other alternatives available for people. That's what's changed. And look what the states have done. There's been an all-out attack. Across the board.\n\nLK: But if you're saying women should have access and they have not had access, poor women specifically, have not had access since 1976 --\n\nThey haven't had, they have had access to other means by which they could get the help, not as nearly --\n\nLK: For many women, that hasn't been the case. Women have suffered. Women have died.\n\nI don't disagree with you.\n\nKK: If you cannot afford to have the procedure, then you have to turn --\n\nBut before that, before what existed was, there was vehicles by which there were organizations that provided the procedure for free. They didn't need to pay for it. But when you make it all a federal program, that makes it impossible.\n\nHere's the deal. If in fact, and I've said this for a while, if in fact this court comes along, all these draconian laws that are being passed and what's happening now? It's all designed to go to the Supreme Court in the hope the Supreme Court will in fact, by a 5-to-4 decision rule against Roe v. Wade and/or amend it some way as it relates to Casey. And if that were to occur, I will immediately send to the United States Congress legislative - legislative - requirement legislating and codifying Roe v. Wade as amended by Casey and put it in the law. And so I strongly support that as the option. It has to be available to all women, all women.\n\nLK: Right. So I'm going to move on to another topic. You called Anita Hill when you launched your campaign this go around. And what your campaign said was that you expressed your \"regret for what she endured\" at the time of the Thomas hearings.\n\nDr. Hill said a couple of things in response to your phone call. On the one hand, she said that she did not see the way that you conducted the Thomas hearings as being disqualifying to being president. But she also, it seems, felt that it was not really adequate. What she said specifically was, \"there needs to be an apology to the other witnesses\" - the women who were not called - \"and there needs to be an apology to the American public. ... There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.\" I was just wondering if you would respond to Dr. Hill.\n\nThree things. Number one, I did apologize, and you saw the last hearing went through the same exact thing. The question is how do you deal with - and Professor Hill and I had this discussion. What would be a way to fix the hearing process whereby a senator could not ask a question that was demeaning? The question raised was, should we do it on camera? She argued strongly no, we shouldn't do that. She had thought about that. She thought we shouldn't do that. I've discussed this with a whole group of women who advise me.\n\nWhat is the way to get by what you saw again in the Blasey Ford position, with whom I met, by the way, [she] asked to meet with me, and I spent some time with. And so we got to figure out a way to in fact, in a he-said, she-said circumstance, how do you prevent a senator from asking a question that in fact would be available to be asked in court if you wanted to do that? I tried to, you remember, I got in shouting matches in that hearing, attacking people who were attacking her, her credibility. I believed her from the beginning. I was opposed to the nominee from the beginning. And when we lost by a single vote, I made a commitment that I kept that I would pass, I was in the process of writing the Violence Against Women Act, which initially women's groups did not support as you'll recall.\n\nLK: Sure.\n\nAnd secondly, I would make sure that there would be women on the Judiciary Committee, and I went out and campaigned for two women on the express commitment they would agree to go on the committee: Dianne Feinstein and Carol Moseley Braun. And they did. And, by the way, they're both supporting me.\n\nLK: Sure. I think that her response was really more about the other women who could have corroborated her story, who --\n\nBy the way, if you look at, there were one of the women we did not know about. The one we knew about, the professor from California who ended up being a judge for, I think it was an employment judge. I'm not sure exactly what her - and she was going to come and testify. At the last minute, she decided she wouldn't. She actually signed an affidavit saying, I don't want to come. I asked her, please come. And she understandably, from her perspective, didn't want to be put through the ringer nationally. I guess that's why she didn't come. And so I could've demanded I call her. Now, how much would that help me beat Thomas? If we brought in a witness who was designed to cooperate, that's why she was being called, and she didn't corroborate what she said and remained silent.\n\nLK: I mean, I think all of those three women have since said that they felt like the process wasn't being handled in a way that they would be heard fairly, but --\n\nWell, that may be, but wasn't because I didn't ask them. They were asked.\n\nLK: O.K.\n\nI actually had them sign an affidavit saying, I won't come. We sent a lawyer to their, to the hotel because I had planned on having them be there. Look, let me give you an example. Remember when I started the Violence Against Women's hearings? I had to warn every woman who - I believed if we rip the Band-Aid off, we would get progress. But it was ugly ripping the Band-Aid off. There was a young woman here in this city who was a model. And she in fact, she was - she wanted to get her, she was on the upper 50s and she lived in a nice apartment complex with a restaurant bar in the basement. She wanted to be in a position where she could in fact get back her rent because or her deposit because every time she wanted to go from utility apartment or a, you know a, not utility, you know, the, no bedroom.\n\nMG: A studio.\n\nKK: Efficiency.\n\nAnyway. To a one-bedroom apartment, the employer would hit on her. So she was doing a shoot somewhere here in the city. She got a call, come stop in the restaurant bar. I have a one-bedroom for you, and everything's O.K. She walked in, sat down, had the discussion. He hit on her again. She got up and left. And you'll remember her. Her name was Marla. She walked outside, and two thugs slashed her face. Remember that?\n\nKK: Sure.\n\nSo she said she was willing to come and testify. And I said, \"But I want to let you, I want you to testify, but I don't want you to be sandbagged here.\"\n\nI said, \"What did your mother say to you when she found out?\"\n\nShe said, \"Why were you in a bar?\" \"What did your girlfriends say to you?\" \"Were you wearing a short skirt? Were you wearing a bra?\"\n\nAnd so I wanted her to know what she was about to go through. Look, we got to change the culture. The culture is what's wrong. That's why I finished the Violence Against Women Act and that's why I started the \"It's On Us.\"\n\nJW: Mr. Vice President, can I ask you, since we're talking about Supreme Court nomination hearings, would you give us any names of people that you might consider to nominate to the court?\n\nNo, but there are at least a half a dozen I've already gone through and people I've gone through in the past and who are available now.\n\nJW: Do you think you would --\n\nThe moment I do that you, you know what will happen.\n\nJW: Well, Donald Trump did it in 2016, and it --\n\nI am not Donald Trump.\n\nJW: I know you're not.\n\nDon't ever confuse me with anything having to do with Donald Trump.\n\nJW: I know. But there's been a criticism of Democrats and people on the left in general, that they don't get the significance of the court to the country and to the policies of the country. And I think what Donald Trump understood, and it seemed to work for him, was that by signifying whom he would choose, it made a difference to a lot of voters. Would you consider doing that? At least once the --\n\nI would tell them the kind of person I would choose. I will not --\n\nJW: No names?\n\nNo names.\n\nJW: Can I ask you another --\n\nSure.\n\nNick Fox : I was kind of curious what kind of person? What are you looking for in the Supreme Court?\n\nThey have to have an expansive view of the Constitution. Recognize the right to privacy, unenumerated rights that exist in the Constitution. Not the Federalist Society view that if it's not listed, it doesn't exist. And they have to be, they acknowledge the unenumerated rights and a right to privacy in the Constitution, and the \"penumbra\" [laws] and the Ninth Amendment, then in fact that means I know they will in fact support Roe v. Wade. They'll support a woman's right to choose and a whole range of other things that relate to individual personal rights. That is critical. I've written about it extensively. I've written law review articles about it. I've presided over more judges and more Supreme Court nominees than anybody else has. Look at the people I supported.\n\nWhen I defeated Bork, I was able to provide a woman's right for a generation because had he won, it would have been over. That's what I would look at. I'd look at the philosophy of the judge, their background and their judicial temperament, whether or not they have the temperament to be on the court. And there are a number of really qualified people out there. I must tell you, my overall predilection would be to look for and put more women on the court because it's part of getting down through the cultural morass here. Because unless we have courts that look like the public, people lack confidence in them.\n\nKK: You keep saying that you want to change culture. I think - going back to young people for a moment. I think a lot of them are having trouble believing that, after as long as you've been in Washington, D.C., that you actually do want to change the culture. Because you've had a lot of time in Washington --\n\nAnd I have changed the culture. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. And none of you supported it. Not you - editorially supported it. I wrote the legislation -\n\nI'm also the guy that made sure Slobodan Milosevic got tried as a war criminal. I'm also the guy who went in and got 150,000 troops out of Iraq. I've done a lot of things that in fact are progressive, very progressive.\n\nAnd what I'm proposing - the other thing I find interesting is that we talk about whether or not my program is progressive. If I'm able to pass what I'm talking about, my administration would go down in history as one of the most progressive administrations in American history. Because we're talking about fundamental changes in the environment. Fundamental change in dealing with health care. Fundamental change in dealing with education. And it's real.\n\nKK: And if Mitch McConnell is still in charge of the Senate, how will you get those things passed?\n\nIt takes me to this next point. The next president of the United States, the nominee, has to be able to win in states that in fact are up for grabs, and we can win. I'm beating Trump in Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and all those Midwestern states, which I will win in a walk. But we have to be able - if we do not engage and nationally in the states where there's a chance to win a House member or a Senate or change the legislative body, we are not doing our job.\n\nThink about all the times when there was real change take place. The presidents have not only gotten elected, they've brought along Democratic majorities. We have to win back the Senate. We have to win, and we can. We can. And so what I think, respectfully, not you, but people are going to have to consider, is O.K., who among the candidates will enhance the prospect we can win a Senate seat in Texas? Who among the prospective candidates is going to enhance the prospect in Georgia -\n\nKK: It's very early. In 2003 in December, Wesley Clark was leading, winning the polls.\n\nOh, don't get married to that. Come on. Be fair, O.K.? Wesley Clark. I know Wes. He's a good guy. I've been consistently leading in the polls after taking all the hits. I go down, and everybody who's hit me is out. They come back. I don't mean it's guaranteed, but look at all of the data.\n\nAnd so I'm not saying that it's guaranteed I win, but name me a nominee who's taken as many hits from the beginning of them announcing, even I announced late, who has taken the hits. You all declare me, not you, editorially in a broad sense, declare me dead and guess what? I ain't dead. I'm not going to die.\n\nJW: Mr. Vice President, can I follow up on --\n\nKK: Everybody dies.\n\nI'm not going to die politically.\n\nJW: Can I follow up on Katie's question here. You're saying not that you would work with them if Mitch McConnell led the Senate, but that you would have the greatest likelihood --\n\nOh, there are certain places you can work with a Mitch McConnell. For example, look what happened in the taxes. I got him to vote to raise taxes, Republicans, $660 billion. Now, that was unusual circumstance because he had bluffed and said, \"You're going to shut down the government.\" I said, \"O.K., go ahead man.\"\n\nJW: But I think most people --\n\nNF: But you also angered a lot of Democrats by getting an extension of the Bush tax cut and cutting the estate tax.\n\nSure I did. But I also saved the damn economy. Be honest. Six hundred and sixty billion dollar increase in taxes. What they're angry is allowing to have the tax cuts stay for people making under four, when in fact they want it to stay for people under two.\n\nNF: I think what they were angry about was that we didn't try to fight, you didn't try to fight for more and that you accepted too little.\n\nI fought - fight for more? It was the day we're about to default. You remember how it all happened?\n\nNF: I do.\n\nWell, tell me. I don't mean to be argumentative here, but it happened on New Year's Eve day. I'm riding in to meet the president, and I get three phone calls from McConnell, which I didn't take, and I find out he says he'll only deal with Biden. We had 12 hours before we defaulted for the first time in our history.\n\nNF: What do you think you could accomplish now after even more years of partisanship with Mitch McConnell?\n\nWhat Mitch McConnell is finding out, and a lot of Republicans are, that they're going to have a hell of a lot of baggage to carry going in to win their own re-elections.\n\nLook what we just did in Virginia. I campaigned all through Virginia. Look what we just won in Kentucky. I campaigned in Kentucky. You all were saying we can't win that governorship in Kentucky.\n\nI'm pretty good at this, knowing where to go. My point is I can't guarantee anything, but I can guarantee that I know how to campaign to help people win. And in all of those states we're talking about, the Democrat who they most would rather have run in their state to help them raise money and get votes is me. That could change, but at the moment, think about it. Do you think that - name the other candidates. Who's going to go in North Carolina and help that candidate win? There's going to be value added. And don't tell me - I shouldn't say don't tell me. I'm being rude. The fact is if you take a look, it matters who is at the top of the ticket. It matters the resources they have.\n\nJW: Speaking of those other candidates, several of them have proposed major structural reforms to our government and to our democracy. These include abolishing the Electoral College, expanding the size of the Supreme Court, setting term limits for justices, abolishing the legislative filibuster. Which, if any of these, do you support?\n\nNone.\n\nJW: Why not?\n\nBecause that structural change requires constitutional amendments. It raises problems that are more damaging than the problem that exists. We're in a situation where the reason they gave judges lifetime tenure, you know why.\n\nJW: And you think with a legislative filibuster in place, even if you control the Senate, that you're going to move any of your agenda?\n\nYes.\n\nJW: How?\n\nBecause there's a lot of things people agree on, though you don't - there's two things. One is that there are a number of areas where you can reach consensus that relate to things like cancer and health care and a whole range of things. I think we can reach consensus on that and get it passed without changing the filibuster rule.\n\nThere are other areas where if you were to change the rule, first of all, if you couldn't get it changed, if you can't get 60 votes, the fact that you're going to amend the Constitution on judicial independence is kind of a stretch. And what I love hearing my colleagues say that I'm running with, saying, \"Well, I'm going to by executive order.\" And my mother would say, \"Who died and left them boss?\" We have three branches of government, equal.\n\nJW: Agreed. That's why I'm wondering how you're planning to do this with - you had a front-row seat to Republican opposition in the Obama administration.\n\nYeah. We still got a lot of things done. Well, I'll tell you what. I was able to get every Democrat to vote on the floor to make sure we passed Obamacare. Number two, I was able to make -\n\nKK: Which all of your opponents want to change.\n\nSure, they want to change. But they don't want to eliminate it. Who's out there saying, \"I want to get rid of it\"? The ones that want to change it, they're saying, \"Look, I know I can't get mine done for three, four, five, 10 years. In the meantime, what are you going to do? I'm going to take Biden's plan in the meantime. I'm going to expand Obamacare.\"\n\nCome on. Look, part of this is what can reasonably be done that fundamentally changes the dynamic that everybody has access to adequate health care. And the fastest, quickest and most extensive way to do that is my plan to add - take Obamacare, further subsidize it to the tune of another $750 billion over 10 years. Add a public option. Provide for that for anybody who wants it and allow the 160 million Americans who seem to like their hard-negotiated health care keep it if they want it. If they don't want it, they can buy in and/or if they don't have the money, they automatically are into the plan.\n\nMC : Now related to this, do you think that the Democratic primary, it's been a mistake that so much of it has focused on whether or not to blow up Obamacare and in what way? I mean there are a lot of issues.\n\nNo, I don't think it's a mistake because I think if you take a look at the data and just come out with me - I invite any one of you to travel with me when I do these things and watch the audiences no matter where. I mean just open forum. Watch the audiences. Tell me, do you see any support? Do you see any majority support Obamacare for all - I mean, for Medicare for all in the Democratic primary? If you do, I'd like to know what it is. I don't know where it is. I've been saying that from the beginning.\n\nNow there's a lot of people who in fact really, really support it. I get it. It's not a bad idea if you have an extra $35 trillion lying around. And you're not going to raise taxes on the middle class and you're only going to do the wealthy.\n\nLook, part of what's going on here, I think, and I'm sorry to get passionate about this, is that what I find people are most looking for is honesty, authenticity and being able to tell you exactly what they're going to do and have a chance of doing it. That's what I find. Now, how many of you in here believe there's any possibility in the next four to six years raising another $35 trillion? Do any of you think it's less than that? Do you think maybe $30 trillion in 10 years? And not raise not only taxes for everybody, for the 2 percent tax for the wealthy? That doesn't even get you even close to paying for it.\n\nSo what are you going to do? You're going to help the middle class, and you're going to go out there and you're going to provide Medicare for all. If you wave a wand, everybody sleeps, no problem. But now, you have, look what you're paying when you have 16 million people on Medicare with withholding? Now you're going to drop another 280,000 people, million people on it? And taxes aren't going to go up?\n\nJeneen Interlandi: Your public option plan has a lot of promising features, but it's still quite a heavy lift. The public option that was attached to the Affordable Care Act did not get through the Senate. What's different this time?\n\nGigantic difference.\n\nJI: And yours is much more ambitious than that earlier one.\n\nSure it is. And I'm glad you raised that. Two things. One, every Democratic president since Roosevelt tried to do what Barack got done.\n\nAnd it was a really heavy lift to get it done. It was a gigantic step forward. But even when it got done, the arguments are, I can say this now publicly, is - between Barack - and I say take a victory lap, man. We got to let people know. We've got to let people know what was done because they don't know it.\n\nI came up here on the Empire State Building when I convinced the president we should spend $100 billion on climate change issues. And we're talking about new windows and all the things we could do to save energy for public buildings. And the one of the leaders of the business community was there said, \"You know, my\" - I think he said live-in help or wherever it was - \"came up to me and thanked me for the raise.\" She said, \"The raise is what you got, reduction in the take-home pay withholding.\" No one knew it was Obama, and no one knew what he did.\n\nJI: Sorry to interrupt you. There's certainly more public support for the Affordable Care Act now. I think people came around to realize how valuable it was --\n\nWhy?\n\nJI: Because they tried to take it away.\n\nBingo.\n\nJI: But it's still a heavy lift, and industry is going to be vehemently opposed to it. You're still going to have to fight a battle, so can you talk a little bit about what your plan is for that?\n\nThat's right. I'm going to have to fight like hell. Well, my plan is for that is to do what I've always done, and that is, be able to convince people. I've been pretty good at it. I find it interesting. My opposition says, \"Yeah, it's true. Joe has put together more bipartisan agreements than anybody. Joe is - but that was the old days.\" It was three years ago.\n\nWith regard to, for example, the Cures Act, which came up after he was elected, and two weeks before I got sworn in, convincing over 200, and I think 398 folks in the House to vote for it, when initially it started with 119 as well as, what did get? Eighty-nine senators, 90 senators - don't hold me the exact number - when it started off with 48. It's called persuasion. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.\n\nAnd what's happening now is everybody - look, the carny show's gone through town once, and they found out there's no pea under any of the three shells. It's coming back again, and people are going, \"Ooh. I didn't know that. You mean to tell me they did this and did that?\"\n\nPart of it is the president, God love him, Barack, had everything land on his desk but locusts. I mean, everything. Look what's happened. We were about to go into a major, major depression. I remember getting chastised because I said, \"This is the greatest recession in the history of the nation short of a depression.\" Biden's exaggerating - it was. It was.\n\nJI: Sorry to keep interrupting you, but just one quick follow-up on this. You've said, and President Obama said, \"If you like your private insurance, you can keep your private insurance.\" In 2013 -\n\nI didn't say that, by the way, but go ahead.\n\nJI: You have been quoted as saying that in multiple places.\n\nNo, it's a long - O.K. Yeah, said we can keep your private insurance. Yep.\n\nJI: Do you say that not - are you not saying that?\n\nThe doctors. They said you can keep your doctor.\n\nJI: O.K. You can keep your doctors. What happens if employers curb their own offerings as the public option takes hold? There's a lot of incentive --\n\nBingo. They can automatically go get a public option.\n\nJI: But they would lose their --\n\nSure they would.\n\nJI: An employer could take away, if someone likes their private insurance --\n\nNo, no, here's the deal. If you like your private insurance and your employer keeps it with you, you can keep it.\n\nJI: But what happens if your employer cancels it?\n\nIf you can't, you come on the Biden plan. You provide that option. You can get a gold plan where you do have nobody - you do not have to pay more than a $1,000 deductible. We significantly reduce drug prices, which, by the way, Republicans are looking to get done, O.K.? What you do is you provide that option. But if you like your plan, if you really like it, I don't think we should come along and say, \"You must give it up.\"\n\nJI: But if your employer cancels that plan, then you don't get it, you don't have that choice.\n\nNo, you don't have the choice, but you had the choice to - that's why - I'm not saying, I said, if you like your plan, you can keep it, assuming - I should add the obvious - if your employer doesn't take it away from you. O.K.?\n\nBut the point is, that's why I set the plan up the way it is. You can automatically buy in much cheaper to get a gold plan, limit to a $1,000 deductible. Get your meds paid for in a reasonable way by setting up a system that exists that, I propose, exists in Germany. That, in fact, you have a group come in from the outside.\n\nWe put together at N.I.H. to set what the value of what you did is. When I did the moonshot, I met with 13 major drug manufacturers, in a private room, and I said, \"Tell me, what do you think you should be able to charge for your drugs?\" They said, \"Based on efficacy.\" I said, \"If you find a drug that cures a particular cancer, we should be able to charge anything you want for it.\" I said, \"No. Wrong. You should in fact, as a matter of public policy, be able to make a significant profit on what you've invested.\"\n\nThe example I gave, if it costs you $10 bucks to get to where you were, you can charge $13 bucks for it, but you can't charge a hundred for it. And that's why we're going to have this system like exists in Germany where, in fact, they set the price, because most are bio-based drugs now, they're no longer chemical-based drugs. And the problem is, it's going to end up being only one or two people who come up with that drug, and therefore to be able to charge exorbitant prices and continue - and you cannot raise the price of that drug beyond the cost of medical inflation unless you can prove you fundamentally altered the drug, or you don't have the patent. So it's a very practical thing.\n\nThis is a place where I find, whether you're Republican or Democrat, you think you're getting screwed on drug prices. And you are, in terms of everything from insulin to inhalers and a whole range of other things. So, again, can I guarantee that it gets done? No, but I can tell you what, if anybody can get it done, I can, and I think there's a consensus for it. If you take a look across the board, Democrats and Republicans, just overall polling, they think we have to do something about lowering health care costs. They think they have to do something about making it affordable and eliminating the overwhelming deductibles. They think it's really and critically important that you reduce the cost of necessary drugs across the board. So the same way they told me I couldn't get the Cures Act passed, couldn't do it.\n\nKK: Sir, we're running out of time --\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nKK: -- and I want to get to some economic questions as well as foreign policy. But before that, we have been asking every candidate the same question, which is, who's someone who has broken your heart?\n\nI can tell you what has broken my heart but it's not someone who's broken it. It broke my heart when my son died. Broke my heart when I was unable to do anything about - I left the house and I got a call saying my wife and daughter were dead.\n\nI don't know whether to be completely straight with you, and how you'll - I learned a lesson a long time ago, that, it was a friend I had, a really good friend. We were in high school, and he was a troubled guy, but I was always - lived down the block from me, and he got in an accident when he was drinking and killed the guy who was riding shotgun. Hit a tree and the fellow died. He was hospitalized a long time, and I was the only one that would go see him. After he was out and recovered, and I insisted that the guys that we hung around with before, that they bring him back, they allow him to come back into the fold. I remember we were sitting, like in the high school days when you've got five guys in a car going home after whatever we were doing and got in an argument, and he turned around and he said something really mean to me. I remember going home. It hurt me more than anything that had happened to me before. Because I thought this guy was my soul mate.\n\nI remember my dad saying to me, Joey, you're always going to be disappointed if you hold people to the same standard you hold yourself to. You're going to be disappointed. Don't expect that people are going to necessarily be prepared to appear in the second edition of \"Profiles in Courage.\" And that's the only time.\n\nFrom that point on, I never let anyone, man or woman, hurt me in terms of, you know. I get criticized, as you know, and even some serious press people who are not being negative with me say, \"Biden doesn't hold a grudge.\" You know that old saying, \"Seek revenge, you got two victims.\" You're one of them. I've never done that because it's just not worth the effort.\n\nBut I have not been hurt by a woman or a man. But what's hurt me is, look, a lot of you've been through a lot more than I've been through too. It's not just me. I have a cartoon on my desk, it's about the size of this insert. I guess I was feeling sorry for myself, and my dad was over at my home. This was 20 years after the accident. He thought I was just too down. He went up to a local Hallmark store and came back, you know they sell the things like this that have a gold frame around them in glass, and two etchings in it from the funny papers, \"Hagar the Horrible.\" There's a picture of Hagar in the one standing there and his Viking ship had crashed down to the rocks and the mast was down, and his horns and his helmet were charred. And he's leaning out, he's going, \"Why me, God?\" And the next, the same exact cartoon, and a voice from heaven says, \"Why not? Why not you?\" Why not me? What makes me so special? I still have it on my desk, and I've reprinted it for a lot of people, because it's just not. You just got to get up. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so. Anyway, there isn't anybody, that is, any woman or man, since I've been a high school kid that has really hurt me.\n\nNF: Can I kind of bring that down to a more mundane level? You've talked about your relationships with Republicans and honestly sometimes they seem crazy, you can't work with these people. And then see there's an old video going around of Lindsey Graham just saying --\n\nI'm having trouble hearing that, sorry.\n\nNF: You're the greatest. I can't remember the exact words, but saying some --\n\nLindsey Graham?\n\nNF: Yeah, that he was saying that there's got to be something wrong with you if you can't admire and like Joe Biden. You realize that the relationships that you built over the years. And then I think of these guys going after you with nothing. No evidence at all, no reason, and you know that they know it's wrong.\n\nThey're frightened. They're frightened. They lack courage. I know why Lindsey's doing this without talking to him. He'll lose his election in South Carolina.\n\nNF: He could.\n\nDid you see him? I wish he had more courage because he knows, I mean he - anyway we're on camera, I don't want to get too personal about him. But look, there's just a lot of people I don't expect.\n\nBarack always kids with me. I say to Barack, the president, I call him Mr. President, so I don't mean to be, we are close personal friends, but I don't call him, I just don't want to confuse him with the president, O.K.? When I say, Barack I should say President Obama. I don't want to confuse him with the other guy. And he always was quoting me on the things I'd repeat to him all the time. He said to his friends, \"What's it like having Joe?\" \"He's just like having an older brother. He always just tells me the truth.\"\n\nI've never, never once - we've hollered at each other, we've yelled at each other, but always in private. Because that's the role. That's one of the reasons I didn't want to be vice president to begin with, why I said no, because I know what the role is. But he's turned out to be a really close friend. But I'll say things to him. He'll ask me questions about how'd you do this, or how would you deal with that, or interpersonal relationships, or how does the Senate work, and what would you do to get this done? That's why he asked me to be vice president, along that and foreign policy. That's why he asked me to be on the ticket.\n\nKK: Speaking of foreign policy --\n\nAnd the answer to your profound question is that I always said to him, \"Barack, all politics is personal.\" It's all personal, and international relations is personal. By that I mean, you got to figure out what the other guy or woman is, and know who they are, and for them to know who they are so you don't have any extended expectations about what they'll do or not do. And how they'll respond. I know Lindsey. I think Lindsey is in a very vulnerable position. I wish - did you see when he was shaking hands with the president when he talked about Biden? He was like this. [LAUGHTER] I'm not joking.\n\nAnyway, I don't expect of people things that are going to cost them greatly, to keep a commitment. There used to be the case, where you got to the Senate, if I gave you my word or anybody gave your word, you could count on it. Now it's all situational, the last 15 years. When I give my word, I give my word, and I never yield from it. If I promised you I was going to do something, even though circumstances have changed, I keep the commitment. A lot of people used to do that. A lot of people used to do that, like Teddy and a whole, whole bunch of folks, Chris Dodd and whole bunch of people. Bob Dole. But now it's, I know I said that to you, but you know, things have changed. I didn't realize that this is going to cost me A, B, C or D. That's what I call situational ethics. It's all kind of situational these days. I factor in situations as best I can. Foreign policy, sorry.\n\nKK: Yes, if you don't mind if we move into foreign policy?\n\nSure, no.\n\nKK: Do you feel comfortable with the United States still having nuclear weapons in Turkey given Erdogan's behavior?\n\nThe answer is my comfort level is diminished a great deal. I've spent a lot of time with Erdogan. More than anybody in our administration did because Erdogan concluded that he'd only talk to me because he thought I wasn't anti-Islam. Remember when I made that speech to NATO saying, when he got elected, \"You had to reach out. This is an opportunity to bring another Muslim country.\" And you knew why they were acting the way they did in other countries in Europe, to not reach out at all for the first election. We have had -\n\nKK: You mean because of anti-Muslim bias?\n\nYeah. I've spent a lot of time with him. He is an autocrat. He's the president of Turkey and a lot more. What I think we should be doing is taking a very different approach to him now, making it clear that we support opposition leadership. Making it clear that we are in a position where we have a way which was working for a while to integrate the Kurdish population who wanted to participate in the process in their parliament, etc. Because we have to speak out about what we in fact think is wrong. He has to pay a price. He has to pay a price for whether or not we're going to continue to sell certain weapons to him. In fact, if he has the air defense system that they're flying F-15s through to see how they can try to figure out how to do it.\n\nSo I'm very concerned about it. I'm very concerned about it. But I'm still of the view that if we were to engage more directly like I was doing with them, that we can support those elements of the Turkish leadership that still exist and get more from them and embolden them to be able to take on and defeat Erdogan. Not by a coup, not by a coup, but by the electoral process. He got blown out. He got blown out in Istanbul, he got blown out in his party. So what do we do now? We just sit there, and yielded. And the last thing I would've done is yielded to him with regard to the Kurds. The absolute last thing.\n\nI had a couple of those meetings with him about the Kurds, and they did not clamp down at the time. We have to make it clear that if they're looking to, because, at the end of the day, Turkey doesn't want to have to rely on Russia. They've had a bite out of that apple a long time ago. But they got to understand that we're not going to continue to play with them the way we have. So I am very concerned. I am very concerned. I'm very concerned about our airfields and access to them as well. And I think it takes an awful lot of work for us to be able to get together with our allies in the region and deal with how we isolate his actions in the region, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean in relating to oil and a whole range of other things which take too long to go into. But the answer is yes, I'm worried.\n\nKK: O.K.\n\nJim Dao: You campaigned on your ability to handle a crisis. If China were to send troops and tanks into Hong Kong to violently crack down on peaceful protesters, how would you handle that?\n\nWell, that's a very, I'm not sure I should answer it on --\n\nJD: Why not?\n\nLet me put it this way. First of all, the first thing I'd do is go to the United Nations. I would introduce resolutions to condemn them for their actions. I would, in fact, try to re-establish the kind of a relationship, when we left, we had with Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Australia. I would move American warships into the region, like we were trying to do, to take 60 percent of our fleet and have it in Asia. To make it clear to him that he, in fact, is not going to be able to go any further, that there's a price to pay if he were to do that.\n\nI would do the same thing I did when he set up the air identification zone, and I went over to meet with him. And I said, \"You've got to just understand, we're not.\" He said, \"What do you expect me to do, take it down?\" I said, \"No, but we're going to fly through it.\" We flew a B-53 through it, F-15s through it to make it clear we're not playing that game. We are not going to do it. I would spend the time doing what we've absolutely shredded. I would get the rest of our allies in the world to join us in dealing with sanctions against China. We make up 15 percent of the world's economy. There's another 25 percent that are allies that we have dissed already. They're wondering who the hell - where we are.\n\nI would try to put back together the coalition, and I would, in fact, make it clear what I said to him in my private meetings and they've been public: We are a Pacific power. He said, \"Why do you say that?\" I said, \"Because we are a Pacific power, and you would have never had the economic stability you were able to accomplish, but for the fact we, we, the United States, kept the peace.\" I would make it very clear there are going to be a price to pay in terms of his economy and in terms of the access to other opportunities that China badly needs.\n\nLook, we always talk about China, and there's an 800-pound gorilla, and what they're doing. China has more problems than we could ever contemplate. They don't have enough water. They're talking about a close to $1 trillion project to turn rivers around. Forty percent to 45 percent of the land is filled with cadmium. They cannot produce crops. They are out now deciding that they're in a position where they have a million Uighurs in, essentially, jail and re-education camps in the West. They're in a situation where they're having trouble figuring out how do they hold on to the Tibetan area without getting into a conflict with India. They have a lot of problems, a lot of problems. We should be making it clear that we're not going to do anything to accommodate what they're doing and make it much more difficult for them to engage in how they proceed. It requires diplomacy, requires a show of our resolve that this is where it stops, and it raises a big question about what to do after that. We'll see what happens.\n\nNF: Some said that a move like that against Hong Kong would also threaten Taiwan. Do you see that?\n\nOh no, I do. I absolutely do think it could. And I think it will do the opposite in Taiwan. I think the Taiwanese government will move to try to be more combative with China than it was before, because that's all he talked to me about. I've spent more time, allegedly, with Xi Jinping than any world leader has before we left office, just because the president wanted me to get to know him. He was the vice president, I was vice president, it wasn't appropriate for the president.\n\nSo they tell me, the State Department, I had 25 hours of private dinners with him. For real. He's not a stupid fellow. But he also, there's not a democratic, small-D bone in his body. And he'd ask questions like, \"Do you really control your military? Do you?\" He didn't control the military. The president didn't, the party controlled the military. \"Do you really? Do governors have any power?\" They don't have any power. That's why they're annexing big chunks of - they have no independent authority to do anything. \"What is your national security team? What's the National Security Council do?\" I mean, these are the questions.\n\nAK: Can I ask about our own National Security Council?\n\nSure.\n\nAK: Reporting out from The Washington Post about years and years and years of generals in Afghanistan essentially lying about the conduct of the war. Eight years as vice president, you know this issue very intimately. Have the American people been lied to about what we're doing there?\n\nYes. Yeah.\n\nAK: What do we do about it? And why should they trust you again?\n\nThey should trust me because you wrote about I was the only guy who took them on in your editorials. I was the vice president of the United States of America. I was not president of the United States of America, number one.\n\nNo. 2, that's why [former Defense Secretary Robert] Gates and I have our problems. Gates talks about, \"Biden doesn't know anything about foreign policy.\" Because I convinced the president of the United States not to buy into his proposal and for sending - with the Riedel Commission talking. Anyway, thousands and thousands of troops. The problem was that there was, I look, the first thing I did when we got elected, the president asked me to go to Afghanistan before we were sworn in. So I flew to Afghanistan, and I brought along with me Chuck Hagel and John Kerry and General [David] Rodriguez was along, and I came back and I wrote a report saying, \"We have no policy.\" The idea that the Afghans can absorb training of 120,000 forces?\n\nAK: Do you have a responsibility to say that in public, though?\n\nNo, but my responsibility was to make that fight, and I did fight it. I fought it all along the way.\n\nKK: But the administration in which you were a vice president did the surge, for instance.\n\nBut it didn't do the surge they wanted to do. Remember, what happened was, the surge was - we were going to have a counterintelligence force in there that were going to go in and we were going to unify that country. I came back and wrote a detailed 54-page report laying out how that is not what we can do.\n\nWhen that helicopter went down when we were up in the Kunar Valley, I remember standing there, and we were in the wash of the helicopter. Fortunately, [we] had found a place literally not wider than this room to land on. The helicopter blades were over the edge of these pointed mountains where they told us it was 3,000 feet on one side down and 6,000 on the other. I'm looking across, and I see these people on what looked like a goat path. And I asked - they had a sharpshooter with us. I said, \"Can they get us from here?\" And he picked up, I said, \"No, no, no, no, no.\" He picked up his rifle. I said, \"No, I don't - \" He said, \"No, I'm just measuring.\" Said, \"They're nine-tenths of a mile. No, they can't, but I could.\"\n\nAnd I watched. I looked from 1:00 to 4:00, and I saw this village sitting in the middle of this hollow. You could see smoke coming out, it looked like almost an adobe hut. It was a whole village there. The idea you're going to unite them. They're only 17 clicks from Bagram Air Force Base. It would take them a year to get there, figuratively speaking. The idea is you're going to have a united - a united Afghanistan? That we are going to be able to bring into the 21st century from the 14th century, is a ridiculous assertion.\n\nKK: And yet your administration sent thousands more troops into Afghanistan.\n\nNo, we pulled those. No, by the way, they were asked to send - they sent one-third of the number of troops that were asked. The president was in a --\n\nKK: But that doesn't make it easier for the families who lost their loved ones in that conflict. If you truly were concerned, why would we have sent a single --\n\nBecause I wasn't the president of the United States of America. You will see, when you're able to look at --\n\nKK: But you're running on the idea that you have this record, that you have the ability to make these decisions in the past, and you have, and --\n\nThat's right, I made the decisions, and had I been president, it would have been right. You all acknowledged it, by the way - what you've written. I'm the guy that said we should, in fact, not - we should be just purely a counterterrorist strategy with small bases, and we had to work more with the Pakistanis, who were our biggest problem. You're never going to unite that country as long as the Haqqani Network controls those three. I've written extensively on this.\n\nThe fact is that the two things I've, the longer I'm away from it, the things that I, in fact, took issue with, I feel good about because it turns out I was right. But I wasn't able to convince and make an overwhelming case that Gates and all his folks are making the case that, well, for example, they talked about how these folks are with us. I met with the - I'm saying too much. What I can't do is be here undercutting [TAPE CUTS OUT].\n\nI had profound disagreements with Gates and the military on this. They know it. I made my case, I won half the fight because we did not put in 150,000 troops, which they wanted to do. As one former Bush administration official who I admire came by to see me, and he said, look, I said, \"Am I right about this?\" He said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"What happens? We leave. Who's going to know?\" The idea that you can unite Afghanistan as a coherent country between among China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan is bizarre. Period. That's been my view from the beginning.\n\nKK: So we're running out of time. I want to ask my colleagues --\n\nAsk me easy questions, then.\n\nKK: Yeah, we're turning to the easy stuff now. Maybe if we could do one tech question, one econ question, how's that?\n\nCharlie Warzel : Sure. Mr. Vice President, in October, your campaign sent a letter to Facebook regarding an ad that falsely claimed that you blackmailed Ukrainian officials to not investigate your son. I'm curious, did that experience, dealing with Facebook and their power, did that change the way that you see the power of tech platforms right now?\n\nNo, I've never been a fan of Facebook, as you probably know. I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan. I think he's a real problem. I think --\n\nCW: Can you elaborate?\n\nNo, I can. He knows better. And you know, from my perspective, I've been in the view that not only should we be worrying about the concentration of power, we should be worried about the lack of privacy and them being exempt, which you're not exempt. [The Times] can't write something you know to be false and be exempt from being sued. But he can. The idea that it's a tech company is that Section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked, number one. For Zuckerberg and other platforms.\n\nCW: That's a pretty foundational laws of the modern internet.\n\nThat's right. Exactly right. And it should be revoked. It should be revoked because it is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false, and we should be setting standards not unlike the Europeans are doing relative to privacy. You guys still have editors. I'm sitting with them. Not a joke. There is no editorial impact at all on Facebook. None. None whatsoever. It's irresponsible. It's totally irresponsible.\n\nCW: If there's proven harm that Facebook has done, should someone like Mark Zuckerberg be submitted to criminal penalties, perhaps?\n\nHe should be submitted to civil liability and his company to civil liability, just like you would be here at The New York Times. Whether he engaged in something and amounted to collusion that in fact caused harm that would in fact be equal to a criminal offense, that's a different issue. That's possible. That's possible it could happen. Zuckerberg finally took down those ads that Russia was running. All those bots about me. They're no longer being run. He was getting paid a lot of money to put them up. I learned three things. Number one, Putin doesn't want me to be president. Number two, Kim Jong-un thinks I should be beaten to death like a rabid dog and three, this president of the United States is spending millions of dollars to try to keep me from being the nominee. I wonder why.\n\nKK: Under the Obama administration, Silicon Valley's power actually expanded greatly. There are very few mergers blocked. Do you have any regrets about that?\n\nThe reason why I was given presidential power when I was given an assignment is because I kept the disagreements I had with the president just that, as I said at the outset, with the president. One of the reasons he said he picked me was I'd never walked in the Oval Office and be intimidated by being in the Oval Office. I'd always tell him what I thought, but at the end of the day, he gets to make the decision.\n\nThere are places where he and I have disagreed. About 30 percent of the time, I was able to convince him to my side of the equation. Seventy percent of the time I wasn't when we disagreed, when he laid something out. And you may recall, the criticism I got for meeting with the leaders in Silicon Valley, when I was trying to work out an agreement dealing with them protecting intellectual property for artists in the United States of America. And at one point, one of the little creeps sitting around that table, who was a multi- - close to a billionaire - who told me he was an artist because he was able to come up with games to teach you how to kill people, you know the --\n\nCW: Like video games.\n\nYeah, video games. And I was lectured by one of the senior leaders there that by saying if I insisted on what Leahy'd put together and we were, I thought we were going to fully support, that they would blow up the network, figuratively speaking. Have everybody contact. They get out and go out and contact the switchboard, just blow it up.\n\nAnd then one of these righteous people said to me that, you know, \"We are the economic engine of America. We are the ones.\" And fortunately I had done a little homework before I went and I said, you know, I find it fascinating. As I added up the seven outfits, everyone's there but Microsoft. I said, you have fewer people on your payroll than all the losses that General Motors just faced in the last quarter, of employees. So don't lecture me about how you've created all this employment.\n\nThe point is, there's an arrogance about it, an overwhelming arrogance that we are, we are the ones. We can do what we want to do. I disagree. Every industrial revolution, every major technological breakthrough, every single one. We're in the fourth one. The hardest speech I've ever had to make in my life, I was asked to speak at the World Economic Forum, to give an answer on, to speak to the fourth industrial revolution. Will there be a middle class? It's not so clear there will be, and I've worked on it harder than any speech I've ever worked on.\n\nThe fact is, in every other revolution that we've had technologically, it's taken somewhere between six years and a generation for a government to come in and level the playing field again. All of a sudden, remember the Luddites smashing the machinery in the Midlands? That was their answer when the culture was changing. Same thing with television. Same thing before that with radio. Same thing, but this is gigantic. And it's a responsibility of government to make sure it is not abused. Not abused. And so this is one of those areas where I think it's being abused. For example, the idea that he cooperates with knowing that Russia was engaged in dealing with using the internet, I mean using their platform, to try to undermine American elections. That's close to criminal.\n\nCW: I think he would argue that he didn't know about that at the time and --\n\nHe'd argue it and I don't believe him for a second.\n\nCW: You don't believe that?\n\nNo, I don't. Nor do you, in your heart. [LAUGHS]\n\nCW: Some of your opponents right now are in Silicon Valley raising money from these people. Has your campaign steered away from money from Silicon Valley?\n\nI haven't gone to - there are people in Silicon Valley who are decent people. I'm sure there's people from Silicon Valley have in fact --\n\nCW: I am using that as a stand-in for the tech industry, mostly though.\n\nWell the tech industry, look, not everyone in the tech industry is a bad guy, and I'm not suggesting that. What I'm suggesting is that some of the things that are going on are simply wrong and require government regulation. And it's happened every single time there's been a major technological breakthrough in humanities since the 1800s, and this requires it. For example, you have children?\n\nCW: No.\n\nWell, when you do and you'll watch them on the internet, it gets a little concerning. What in fact they can see and not see, and whether or not what they're seeing is true or not true. It matters. It matters. It's like - well, anyway.\n\nKK: Will you indulge us two more questions?\n\nSure.\n\nKK: All right. Binya?\n\nBA: You've talked about the urgency of the climate change. The new NAFTA agreement includes no measures aimed at dealing with climate change. At what point should Democrats stop voting for international agreements that fail to deal with climate change?\n\nWell, first of all, the two things that the new NAFTA agreement has, is they have enforcement mechanisms. I've not read them yet. O.K.? I'm told by staff. Enforcement mechanisms that have environmental protections, as well as, not talking for fundamental climate change, but though you cannot compete and disregard existing climate regulations that exist. So environmentalists are at the table, I've been told, and labor's been at the table and they should be. They should be.\n\nNow, if in fact what I propose is as president, I'm, by the way, I'm not joking. I did. I'm the guy that came back and said, we can embarrass Xi Jinping to join the Paris accord. And everybody looked at me like I was nuts. Well, it did. But what happened was that only works if in fact we are the aggressive leader. So number one, I would immediately rejoin the Paris accord, number one. And number two, I would do what the accord calls for. Upping the ante as circumstances change and more science becomes available that we have less time. For example, think of what we should be doing now in the biggest carbon sink in the world, the Amazon. Instead of talking about $2 billion, I'd be organizing, not a joke, organizing the world as I did in Latin America on other issues, like Colombia and so on. Anyway, to make sure that they in fact either, and we would provide, the world would provide, $20 to $30 billion for them to be able to make up for what they're going to lose by not having agriculture.\n\nBA: Those are good programs, but do you think Democrats should vote for an agreement that does not affirm the Paris accord and does not contain any binding commitments to deal with climate change?\n\nLook, it's like saying would you sign an agreement with Turkey on a base closure because it didn't have that in it? It depends on if it's related to climate. Absolutely they should be part of it.\n\nBA: But this is not a hypothetical. This is a deal that exists and is coming before the House --\n\nIt is, but the deal relates to matters of trade, that in fact, there is no circumstance where we are saying anything that we're going to do more or less relative to what we're selling back and forth across the border. Here's an example that would matter. China. China, in fact, in their \"Belt and Road\" proposal is in fact exporting more dirty coal around the world and is subsidizing more than anybody in the world. The answer is, what we should be saying to them is, you keep your agreement on the climate accord, which you signed up to. If you don't, you will pay a price for it. You will not be able to sell product here. And organize the world to make sure that no, they couldn't sell product anywhere. To make sure that they in fact have a requirement to stick to what they committed to. They've already signed it, so I don't know. It's a little bit like saying to me, should we --\n\nBA: Why wouldn't you apply that standard to Canada, which is a larger energy exporter than China?\n\nWell, no, by the way, I would. That's what we should be doing to everybody in the world. I'm basically giving you one example. That's why I oppose what China's, what Canada's doing in terms of the pipelines and the dirty crude they're sending south on us, letting it go forward. We have to do that. We have to. But we can't do a damn thing if we don't meet our responsibility. We make up 15 percent of the problem in the world. We walk away from it all and the rest of the world says, what the hell are you holding me accountable for? You're not doing anything. That's why this president's does such incredible damage, incredible damage to our effort to deal with climate change.\n\nKK: Your staff is getting a little impatient with us, so allow us our last question, if you don't mind. [LAUGHTER]\n\nBS : What are you likely to fail at as president?\n\nI never start anything thinking I'm going to fail. I really mean it. I never sat down before an exam thinking I'm going to fail it. I never had a football handed to me and think I wasn't going to score. I've never put a ball in my hand - I'm serious. Look, half of winning is believing you can. I think people communicate when they think they're going to fail.\n\nI think it's going to be incredibly difficult, incredibly difficult to deal with what is left of the Republican Party. Which is not the Republican Party. And I think the most important thing that we have to do, and I know some from the beginning suggested I was not, didn't make sense. The single most important thing we have to do is restore the soul of this country. It's been absolutely eviscerated.\n\nPresident's talking about how he's worried about anti-Semitism. This recent rule about universities . This is the same guy who watched anti-Semites, their veins bulging, coming out of fields, literally carrying torches. It was almost like a movie. Preaching anti-Semitic bile. The same exact thing that was preached and hollered in the streets of Nuremberg in the '30s and throughout Germany, carrying swastikas. Kid gets killed, a young woman. President's asked to comment, and he said there were very fine people on both sides. That's the single most important thing we have to excise. Have you heard him say a word about white supremacy? Have you heard him say a word that would lead anybody to believe he still not decided that the only way to win is divide the country? Pit race, religion --\n\nBS: Listen, man, this is our hometown guy, I know extremely well.\n\nNo, I'm sure you do, but it was more a rhetorical question, but I mean, so it really is gigantic. If I only get to do one thing, could wave a wand and say I could solve one problem, that's the first one I solve because unless we solve that one, none of the rest matters a whole lot.\n\nWe're not going to be able to unite the country. And if we can't unite the country, this is all for naught. We have a system, the Constitution, and it's like that old thing oft-quoted and sometimes inaccurately quoted about Benjamin Franklin walking out of the - \"What have you given us, Mr. Franklin?\" \"A Republic, if you can keep it.\" Our democracy is at stake. I truly believe our democracy is at stake.\n\nAnd I worry about some of the folks, I don't mean anybody around here, some of the folks on the opposite end of the scale in our party think that they should do, not preach hate, but be able to, by executive authority, do what the right thing is. The whole thing requires consensus. None of it works. You're all understandably cynical about can I bring the country together? Can I get anything done? Well, guess what? I refuse to give up on that notion. Not a joke, because if I can't, if somebody can't, say goodbye, man.\n\nEight years of this guy will fundamentally, I said this in the beginning, you thought it was hyperbole, fundamentally change who we are as a country. Fundamentally we'll not be recognized and not recognize ourselves. And it really is the, the threat.\n\nAnd what bothers me is that some bright people on the other team, our team, are buying into the same thing. Well, the way we have to do it, why don't we do what he does? Why don't we do what he does? Not on race. We're going to be the opposite. But if you don't agree on this, boom, we're just going to insist on it. Like for example, I'm the only guy who's ever beaten the N.R.A., nationally and twice. Now I hear, by the way, when I get elected, by executive order, I'm going to eliminate the right to have an assault weapon. Where does the Constitution say you have the authority to do that? You can stop the importation. Where does it say that? Or I'm going to insist that we move forward with the following health care plan. O.K. How do you do that?\n\nKK: Allow me one last question. I apologize. A lot of the reason that Trump was elected, at least one of the things that we heard a lot in the months following the 2016 election, was people being angry at or let down by government, and that anger fueled has his rise to power. How do you respond to critics who worry that, in fact, that it was something about the Obama administration that gave rise to Trump?\n\nI didn't, I didn't hear that. You got - I mean I've heard it but some of what I heard is that the Democratic Party, in the last election - and I did 84 events for Hillary, 84 - that the Democratic Party forgot our base. When's the last time we talked to those folks who are working-class white folks? I would go out all the time and the Saturday, excuse me, the Sunday or Monday before I'd go out, Robby Mook or [the former White House chief of staff John] Podesta or someone, [would] come by and ask me where they wanted me to go because some places I was stronger with the African-American community and with white working-class folks. I remember being told at one point where they're going to give up on white working-class folks because they're not making any progress.\n\nWell, look what's happened. Look what started to seep in, beginning and probably even with candidates during our administration. We stopped showing up at the Polish American club. We stopped showing up, and we all went to you, the really smart people. We had a new kind of coalition we were putting together. College-educated women and college men and boom, boom, boom and so on.\n\nTell you a story, and I'll end. We found ourselves, I think, and we would have this internal debate toward the end - why I thought, I came back after campaigning for [the former Wisconsin senator] Russ Feingold and said, we're going to lose. I have pretty good tactical political instincts. We're going to lose. Because we weren't doing the kind of retail politics we used to do. We weren't stopping in diners. We weren't going over to the Greek American club. We weren't going into the black community and sitting at the local Y that's in that community.\n\nI'm not joking. Think of the candidate, not just for president. Think across the board. And so I pointed out that over 54 percent of all the voters in Pennsylvania are white, high school educated. Sixty some - and if I remember the numbers, I don't remember exact numbers - in Michigan and Ohio and etc. I actually had the campaign come, someone come with me, not Hillary - and I think she knew - one of the political people come. I said I was going to speak at a Ford Motor plant in the Valley and in Ohio.\n\nAnd they were talking about how we had to make a distinction between progressive values and working-class values. I said I've never found a distinction. Never found them hard to sell. They told me there were 3,000 people in the plant. This is toward the end of the campaign, second week of October, something like that. And I stood up and said, we've got to elect Hillary, and it was [light clapping]. I said let me tell you why we have to elect Hillary, and there are 3,000, but there are a lot of seats - there are probably 500 seats in the front.\n\nI look down at one guy and said, because your wife deserves to make every damn penny you make, the man she's standing next to. They all cheered. Neighborhoods I come from, guess what, that means you can put four new tires on the car. That means, not a joke. You guys don't even think about it. That's what it means. It means you can replace the water heater. It means you can send your kid back to that community college. It matters about your standard of living.\n\nBut guess what? All white guys are just basically, they don't give a damn about women. They don't care about equal pay. You're damn right if they're working guys. The people that don't like equal pay are the people at the top of the heap. I don't like the idea that you're going to get paid as much as a man doing your job. That's not happening on the line.\n\nThe second thing I said, I said and, by the way, who somebody marries is none of your business, because I'm so associated with pushing for gay marriage. And they all laugh for a second. I said I'm not asking you to light your home up in rainbows, but you know it's none of your business. I got a standing ovation.\n\nThird thing I said, I said any man who raises his hand to a woman is a God-darn coward and deserves to get his ass kicked. They went nuts because they have daughters. They have wives who were victimized.\n\nAnd then I talked about economic issues, about the issues that affected labor. By the way, without labor, we're dead. If labor doesn't come back, there was no one else to keep the barbarians on the other side of the gate. It's power, power, power, power. And guess what? I come back, and I meet with a lot of their people: Well, that's because you're middle-class. Joe Biden can do that, but we can't do that.\n\nThe other thing we think about, we think that people, if they don't have a good education are ipso facto stupid. President asked me to get Detroit off its feet, back on its feet. For real. He gave me all the good assignments.\n\nOne of the things I did - now, I'm serious. Look at it. Look at specifically who handled everything relating to Detroit. Me. And the good reason, the good news about that, he gave me presidential authority. I could task anyone in the administration. For real. And so I put together a group, that in fact made up of five agencies, to go find all the money Detroit was eligible for they never knew they were eligible for. And we sat down and we put everything from lighting in and transit and so on and so forth.\n\nBut then we found out when it got out of bankruptcy, what happened? No one knew how to turn on the streetlights. Not a joke. No one knew how to turn on the water system, maintain the sewer system because black, white, anyone who had that expertise left, abandoned it.\n\nSo I had an idea. We went to this outfit that in fact, if you're looking for tech people, you go and they'll supply them to. It's called American - I can't think of the name of it now. And I said, go out and find us people that we can put through a 19-week class at the community college to teach them how to program.\n\nAnd on the floor I go around, my liberal friends are saying, you can't expect that, man. No. Well guess what? It turns out, there were 50-some women, happen to all be women, all of color but one, all African-American but one. Nineteen weeks, I went to the graduation. Every single one had a job, lowest-paying job $48,000 a year, highest paying $102,000.\n\nYou think people are stupid. Went to school with a guy in Delaware and in a little town called Claymont. Went to the same Catholic grade school. Then I went off to a local school that was academically very challenging, a Catholic prep school. It was a very challenging school. He went to the local high school where my wife ended up teaching, and I saw him. He made a lot more money than I made. He was an independent trucker. He was making somewhere between $85,000 and $110,000 bucks a year. In the last 10 years of his life, he busted his neck. I was down at the largest mall in Delaware, and it's big because no tax in Delaware, so New Jersey folks and Pennsylvanians come there. And I'm with my granddaughters three years ago, Christmas shopping. He walks up. I don't have permission to use his name so I won't mention it, but he goes or goes, \"Joey, baby!\" Grabs my cheek. I thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. I said, he's a friend.\n\nHe said, \"What you doing, Joey?\" And I remembered who he was and I said, \"How you doing, pal?\" I said, \"You still drive?\" And he said, \"Nah, Joey, only guys like you who never worked in their life can continue to work.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, how's Tony doing?\" His son was the age of my son who died. Said he's in trouble, Joe, he's in trouble. I said, can I help? I thought maybe was a drug problem or something. He said, No, no Joey. He's still driving and he knows he's not going to have a job in five years. We all think - when, in your economic pages, you guys write about automation of trucking, and it's supposed to be in five years, it's going to take more like 10 - that these guys are stupid. They don't get it.\n\nThey know it. They're not stupid. We treat them like they're stupid. They know they're in trouble, and nobody's talking to them. Nobody's talking to them. That's what we used to do. That was our base. That's who I'm talking to. There's answers. There's answers.\n\nThat's why I'm spending so much time with unions. Unions are scared to death of global warming, and they know it's a problem, but they think they're all going to be lost. We can create 10 million good-paying jobs. I just met with the I.B.W. I can put in new green infrastructure - 550,000 charging stations. And they'll do them. They'll make money. We can move to the E.V. market and own it and we can create millions of good-paying jobs.\n\nI can go down the list. Same with agriculture. Everybody's wondering why Biden's doing so good with rural, rural Iowa. Because I talk about how they can make money by becoming a carbon sink themselves, by planting deep-rooted plants, by absorbing carbon into the soil, by doing a whole range of things and get paid for it. Not just what they grow to eat, but we don't talk to them.\n\nGuys, think about it, this is complicated stuff. And I find the big argument I always have with my staff is I say, \"Speak English to me.\" Not as opposed to Spanish, as opposed to complicated. Without talking down to people, how do you explain? How do you go out and explain? Go to the local bar here with really bright people. Explain to them global warming, as much as you know about it. They don't know, from shinola, what you're talking about, but we can explain it. But we don't do it.\n\nKK : Well, we try to do that every day.\n\nNo, you do. I don't mean that, but look what we --\n\nKK : Speaking of which, we do actually have to put out a newspaper. [LAUGHTER]\n\nBut again, I don't think it's talking down to anybody when you say you write to an eighth-grade population. The thing about The Times that is so special is The Times goes well beyond that. I'm not being critical of you.\n\nI'm just saying generically, think about the people you know, go back to your own neighborhoods. Even if they have a job, they're frightened. They are frightened. But who in a political establishment is talking to them? That's even remotely realistic? And unless we figure that out, folks, we're in real trouble, man, I think.\n\nI'm probably in real trouble after this interview, but thank you very much.\n\nKK: Thank you.\n\nBS: Good to see you.\n\nGood to see you, thanks.\n\nBS: I'm from Chester, Pa., by the way. Right across the border.\n\nWell, you know, and by the way, you know we talked about Chester.\n\nBS: Two generations of truck drivers.\n\nThat's right, you understand it. I'm not joking. Am I telling the truth? And by the way, the other thing is, you know, we talk about environmental impact. Reason why that part of Pennsylvania and Delaware has the second-highest cancer rate is because when you and I got up in the morning and you turn on the first frost, you turn on your windshield wiper, there'd be an oil slick on your window.\n\nBS: Yes.\n\nNot a joke.\n\nBS: Oh. absolutely, yes.\n\nI love the lectures I get about - do you understand?\n\nKK: I do. Thank you.\n\nThank you. I'm going to beat this guy.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this annotated transcript referred to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as an executive order. It was a program created by a memo signed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, not an executive order.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Joe Biden's Last Campaign\n\n\"I'll show you where Trump sat and watched the revolution,\" Joe Biden said, stepping out from behind his desk in the Oval Office. It was noon on a Wednesday, in the doldrums of January. The Middle East was aflame, and Biden's approval rating was among the lowest of any President in history, but, for the moment, he was preoccupied with Donald Trump. As he led the way through a door toward his private chambers, he startled two Secret Service agents in the corridor. They had expected him to remain at his desk for a while; agents, referring to him by his handle, had passed word: \"Celtic is in the Oval.\" Walking by, he said, in a whispery deadpan, \"Hey, guys-it's a raid ,\" and then moved on.\n\nBiden, always a little taller than you expect, wore a navy suit and a bright-blue tie. He passed a study off the Oval, where he keeps a rack of extra shirts, an array of notes sent in by the public, and a portrait of John F. Kennedy in a contemplative pose. (It's one of his favorites, even though Bobby Kennedy thought that it evoked his brother during the Bay of Pigs debacle.) He continued to the Oval Office dining room, a small, elegant space where, in Biden's eight years as Vice-President, he often visited Barack Obama for lunch. One wall is graced by \"The Peacemakers,\" a famous painting of Lincoln and his military commanders, on the cusp of winning the Civil War. Another is dominated by a large television set, installed by Donald Trump.\n\nIt was in front of that TV that Trump spent the afternoon of January 6, 2021, after exhorting his supporters to march on the Capitol and stop Congress from certifying Biden's election. With the television remote and a Diet Coke close at hand, he watched the events live on Fox News, rewinding at times for a second look. It is a period in Presidential history that the House select committee on January 6th later called \"187 Minutes of Dereliction.\"\n\n\"This is where he sat,\" Biden said, and I braced for a bit of speechifying on democracy or character or the defiling of the Presidency. (As early as 1970, a colleague of Biden's on a Delaware county council observed that he could make a \"fifteen-minute speech on the underside of a blade of grass.\") But, in the dining room, he let the moment pass. At the age of eighty-one, in his fourth year as President, he displays less of the reflex to fill every silence. Gesturing around the room, he said, \"I don't do interviews here, because it's not so commodious.\" He gave a rueful laugh and headed back to his office.\n\nNot long ago, most Americans found it inconceivable that they might once again face the choice between Trump and Biden. In the years since Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to concede, he has been found liable for sexual assault and financial fraud, and indicted for attempting to overturn the election and refusing to return classified documents; as his legal challenges mounted, he embarked on a campaign focussed on \"retribution\" against his enemies. Yet Republicans have become steadily less likely to hold Trump responsible for the violence on January 6th-and less likely to believe that Biden actually won the White House.\n\nBack in the Oval Office, where winter sun shone through glass doors, I asked Biden if it was possible for him to reach voters who had those beliefs. He treated the question as a provocation: \"Well, first of all, remember, in 2020, you guys told me how I wasn't going to win? And then you told me in 2022 how it was going to be this red wave?\" He flashed a tense smile. \"And I told you there wasn't going to be any red wave. And in 2023 you told me we're going to get our ass kicked again? And we won every contested race out there.\" He let that sink in for an instant and said, \"In 2024, I think you're going to see the same thing.\"\n\nFor decades, there was a lightness about Joe Biden-a springy, mischievous energy that was hard not to like, even if it allowed some people to classify him as a lightweight. For better and worse, he is a more solemn figure now. His voice is thin and clotted, and his gestures have slowed, but, in our conversation, his mind seemed unchanged. He never bungled a name or a date. At one point, he pulled out a white notecard inscribed with some of Trump's most alarming comments: his threat to terminate the Constitution, his casual talk of being a dictator on \"Day One,\" his description of immigrants as \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" Biden tossed the list on his desk and gave a look of disbelief. \"What the hell! \" he said. \"If you and I had sat down ten years ago and I said a President is going to say those things, you would have looked at me like, 'Biden, you've lost your senses.' \"\n\nI last interviewed Biden in 2020, when he billed himself as a \"transition candidate\" and praised \"an incredible group of talented, newer, younger people.\" But, in office, he has presided over the passage of ambitious legislation, the end of the Covid pandemic, and an economic revival beyond anyone's expectation-and declared his intention to run for a second term. I asked Biden if there was ever a time when he doubted that he would run again. \"No,\" he said. \"But, look, if I didn't think that the policies I put in place were best for the country, I don't think I'd be doing it again. I'm running again because I think two things: No. 1, I'm really proud of my record, and I want to keep it going. I'm optimistic about the future.\" He continued, \"And, secondly, I look out there, and I say, 'O.K., we're just-most of what I've done is just kicking in now.' \"\n\nLink copied\n\nIf you spend time with Biden these days, the biggest surprise is that he betrays no doubts. The world is riven by the question of whether he is up to a second term, but he projects a defiant belief in himself and his ability to persuade Americans to join him. For as long as Biden has been in politics, he has thrived on a mercurial mix of confidence and insecurity. Now, having reached the apex of power, he gives off a conviction that borders on serenity-a bit too much serenity for Democrats who wonder if he can still beat the man with whom his legacy will be forever entwined. Given the doubts, I asked, wasn't it a risk to say, \"I'm the one to do it\"? He shook his head and said, \"No. I'm the only one who has ever beat him. And I'll beat him again.\" For Biden, the offense of the contested election was clearly personal. Trump had not just tried to steal the Presidency-he had tried to steal it from him . \"I'd ask a rhetorical question,\" Biden said. \"If you thought you were best positioned to beat someone who, if they won, would change the nature of America, what would you do?\"\n\nBy the usual measures, Biden should be cruising to reëlection. Violent crime has dropped to nearly a fifty-year low, unemployment is below four per cent, and in January the S. & P. 500 and the Dow hit record highs. More Americans than ever have health insurance, and the country is producing more energy than at any previous moment in its history. His opponent, who is facing ninety-one criminal counts, has suggested that if he is elected he will fire as many as fifty thousand civil servants and replace them with loyalists, deputize the National Guard as a mass-deportation force, and root out what he calls \"the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.\"\n\nBut the usual measures do not apply these days. Rarely in American history have two major parties had such wildly different intentions-and such similar levels of support. In 2020, seven states hinged on a difference of less than three percentage points. \"The electorate is frozen,\" Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Democratic donors, told me. \"There will be important movements on the margin-but they are only important because this thing is fucking tied.\"\n\nFor a long time, Biden had a modest but steady advantage in the polls, ahead by three or four or five points. By this February, though, Trump had taken the lead, forty-seven to forty-two per cent, according to an NBC poll. (In 2020, by contrast, Biden never trailed Trump in any major poll.) Some Democrats were already complaining publicly that Biden's campaign was complacent and behind schedule in hiring staff for battleground states. On Bill Maher's podcast, the political consultant James Carville said, \"Somebody better wake the fuck up.\" Maher wondered if Biden was in danger of staying so long in his job that he would be blamed for handing it to the opposition-becoming the \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Presidency.\" At a dinner attended by major donors in Chicago, Senator Chris Coons, a co-chair of the Biden campaign, struck a reassuring note. \"I'm given to worry on occasion,\" he told the audience. \"I've been known to wring my hands.\" But in the 2022 midterms, he reminded them, \"the American people showed up,\" giving the Democrats unexpectedly strong results. \"Folks, trust our voters,\" he said. \"They will show up again.\"\n\nAs the election year arrived, Biden's aides argued that the polls were too early to be useful; they reasoned that sitting Presidents are often a target for free-form resentment-and that, in any case, only a quarter of Americans were engaged enough to even realize that it would be a choice between Trump and Biden. His advisers present his confidence as a virtue. One told me, \"He is not diverted by politics or by bad polling or by some crazy-ass shit that Donald Trump has done.\" Bruce Reed, one of his closest aides, said, \"We live in abnormal political times, but the American people are still normal people. Given a choice between normal and crazy, they're going to choose normal.\"\n\nWhen I visited Biden in January, two days had passed since the Republican caucuses in Iowa. Trump had won all but one of the state's ninety-nine counties; the voting was so lopsided that news organizations called the race with many votes still to be cast. For all the speculation that Ron DeSantis might secure evangelical voters, Trump took even more of them than he had eight years before. In the Oval Office, I brought up the Iowa results and asked Biden to explain why Trump was still popular with a substantial portion of Americans. He disputed my framing. \"Substantial portion of the Republican MAGA party ,\" he said. \"That's who it is.\"\n\nHis objection was not just rhetorical. \"Look, a hundred thousand people voted,\" he said. \"He got fifty per cent of a hundred thousand votes.\" To be precise, it was closer to a hundred and ten thousand votes, but the point remained: Trump had generated the lowest turnout in a contested G.O.P. race in a quarter century, a drop of forty per cent from the Republican primary of 2016. It didn't help that temperatures were below zero that night, but the fact was that nearly half the Republicans who voted chose someone other than Trump. Some forty per cent of Nikki Haley supporters in Iowa told pollsters that if she fell short they would vote for Biden. \"Now, they're going to argue the weather was the reason,\" Biden told me. \"But what about this enthusiasm-this hard-baked enthusiasm?\"\n\nTrump is too familiar and too disliked to attract many new supporters. And when voters are asked in polls how they will react if he is actually convicted of a felony, Biden pulls ahead again. But the schedule of Trump's trials is in flux, and, even if he is convicted, it is difficult to predict how that unprecedented spectacle will reverberate.\n\nBy the end of January, the race was nearing the point at which history shows a correlation between approval ratings and electoral results: incumbents who trail their opponent nine months from Election Day rarely go on to win. When pollsters asked who would do better in specific areas, the gaps were stark. On immigration and border security, Trump led Biden fifty-seven to twenty-two; on the economy, fifty-five to thirty-three. On the \"required mental and physical stamina for the presidency,\" Trump was lapping Biden, forty-six to twenty-three per cent. Even seasoned analysts who tend to discount small fluctuations in polls took note. \"Let's say it's a fifty-per-cent chance that Trump could be President again,\" a prominent Biden donor told me. \"That's like a fifty-per-cent chance that the doctor is going to tell you that you have pancreatic cancer.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, who was Obama's chief campaign strategist, told me that age was the crucial issue for Biden. \"I don't question his competence as President,\" he said. \"You give me Biden's record and take fifteen years off of him, and this wouldn't be a competitive race. This is the barrier he has to overcome, and it's a hard one, because the march of time is immutable.\"\n\nThe kind of people who believe that they should be President of the United States do not generally go graciously into retirement. Alexander Hamilton, who knew his share of ex-politicians, described them as \"discontented ghosts.\" When Richard Nixon was between stints in office, he fretted, \"I'm going to be mentally dead in two years and physically dead in four.\" Calvin Coolidge, the only twentieth-century President who voluntarily passed up a reasonable chance at reëlection, said that he hoped to avoid \"grasping for office.\" (Coolidge noted that Presidents \"live in an artificial atmosphere of adulation and exaltation which sooner or later impairs their judgment.\") In Biden's case, he has been in politics so long that one of his aides told me a decade ago that he seemed \"afraid if he stops working he might just fall over.\"\n\nEarly in Biden's Presidency, his age was a fixation mostly on the right. Conservative media circulated video anytime he fell-while dismounting from his bike, or tripping over a sandbag onstage. Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the House, joked about bringing \"soft food\" to a meeting with Biden, even though McCarthy was, according to Politico, \"privately telling allies that he found the president sharp and substantive.\" Biden's doctors reported no significant trouble. (His latest medical report, released last week, lists sleep apnea; atrial fibrillation; a \"stiff\" gait, owing to arthritis and the aftermath of a fractured foot; and gastroesophageal reflux, which causes him to cough and clear his throat. Like most of his predecessors, Biden didn't undergo a cognitive test, but the report notes that an \"extremely detailed neurologic exam was again reassuring.\")\n\nFor a time, Democrats who worried that Biden's age would prevent his reëlection hesitated to speak out. \"A lot of people thought, O.K., we'll get our ass kicked in the midterms, and then we'll have this big conversation about whether Joe should run again,\" a former Democratic official told me. \"Then the midterms are this big surprise.\" For Biden, questions about his age were inextricable from feelings of being underestimated by the establishment. In 2015, during his second term as Vice-President, when he was reeling from the death of his son Beau, Obama enveloped him in personal support but was, in Biden's words, \"not encouraging\" of his running for President-a fact that some intimates recall with bitterness. (One told me that Biden was treated in a spirit of \"See you later. Emeritus. God bless. Nice guy.\") An effort to discourage him from running for reëlection in 2024 could well have had the opposite effect. Besides, Trump-just four years younger than Biden-was already so prone to signs of age that the DeSantis campaign set up a social-media account called the Trump Accident Tracker. He had confused Jeb Bush with George W. Bush, talked about Obama when he meant Biden or Hillary Clinton, and called the Hungarian Prime Minister \"the leader of Turkey.\"\n\nThe former Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-chair of Biden's campaign, urged him to embrace his age with swagger, like his fellow-octogenarians Mick Jagger and Harrison Ford. Biden tried out some jokes. Just as Ronald Reagan, in a 1984 debate, had vowed not to \"exploit the youth and inexperience of my opponent,\" Biden told an audience he had \"never been more optimistic about our country's future in the eight hundred years I've served.\" In the meme wars on social media, the campaign promoted illustrations of Biden as a political mastermind, firing lasers from his eyes.\n\nStill, Axelrod and others eventually started voicing their worries. \"I felt like Biden had the ability to say, 'I've run my race, and I've faithfully fulfilled my duties to the nation,' \" he told me. \"He's really done a hell of a job, but he is not a particularly competent performer in front of cameras now. That's mostly how people interact with the President. Bill Clinton said, 'Strong and wrong generally beats weak and right.' \" (When Axelrod expressed criticisms, Biden reportedly dismissed him as a \"prick,\" after which one of Axelrod's friends printed campaign buttons that read \"Pricks for Biden.\")\n\nThe concerns about Biden's age exploded on February 8th, with the release of a report by the special counsel Robert Hur on the handling of classified documents, which Biden's lawyers had reported after discovering them in his offices and garage. Hur, who had worked for the Justice Department under Trump, concluded that he lacked evidence to bring charges, but also described Biden, indelibly, as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur wrote that Biden \"did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThe Administration could have chosen to emphasize the fact that Biden, unlike Trump, had been exonerated, but Biden wanted to dispute Hur's comments. At a hastily called press conference, he said, \"I'm well meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing.\" He seethed at the assertion that he did not remember the date of his son's death, saying, \"I don't need anyone to remind me when he passed away.\" In his final answer of the night, after being asked about hostage negotiations, he slipped up, referring to the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, as the President of Mexico. Stories about Biden's age and memory dominated the news for days. After the Times carried several articles on the topic on a single Sunday, Margaret Sullivan, the newspaper's former public editor, criticized the response as disproportionate-calling it the \"2024 version of the media's obsession with Hillary's emails\"-and faulted the press for not focussing as much on Trump's recent threat to let Russia \"do whatever the hell they want\" against NATO allies that do not spend enough on their militaries.\n\nHur's comments and Biden's press conference spread panic among Democrats. \"If we don't get an emergency transplant, we're going to die,\" one donor told me. Ezra Klein, of the Times , argued that Biden was governing well but was no longer capable of sustaining the \"performance\" that a campaign requires: \"Whether it is true that Biden has it all under control, it is not true that he seems like he does.\" Klein proposed that Democrats hold an open convention this summer and let a \"murderers' row of political talent\" compete for the nomination. Proponents often mention Gretchen Whitmer, Raphael Warnock, and Gavin Newsom, among others. But, at the moment, none of these people poll better against Trump than Biden does, or have enough money on hand to mount a serious campaign. And holding an open convention risks fracturing the Party, as a relatively small group of insiders scramble to pick a candidate. The last time Democrats held an open convention, in 1968, a Party divided by war fought openly; the losers stayed home on Election Day, and Richard Nixon won by one per cent.\n\nUnless Biden decides to step aside, it is overwhelmingly likely that he will be the nominee in November. \"There is no group of wise men or women who compose the Party anymore, who have the assumed gravitas,\" Michael Kazin, the author of \"What It Took to Win,\" a history of the Democratic Party, told me. \"The President now runs the Party.\"\n\nLike many Democrats, Axelrod has turned his critiques to the opposition. \"Now I think the question is: how do you make the best argument for Biden in a race against Donald Trump?\" he told me. \"Both these guys are old. The difference between them is one of them is actually working on the project of building a better future-not for himself, but for the country and for our kids and grandkids. And then you have on the other side a guy who's not looking to the future but is consumed by his own past.\"\n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, voiced a position that I encountered among many high-ranking Democrats. \"He's not the only option that we had ,\" he told me. \"But, once he'd made the decision to go, he became the only option that we have .\" In the months that remain, Whitehouse said, the best way to beat Trump is a strategy that he called \"Biden plus offense.\" When people are \"frightened or angry, you need to convince them that you, too, are equally concerned and you're willing to throw punches and pick fights,\" he said. \"If you've got your sleeves rolled up and you're waist-deep fighting alligators in the swamp, then nobody's really thinking about your age.\"\n\nLast March, Trump held the first rally of his 2024 Presidential campaign in Waco, Texas-a choice with unsubtle significance. Thirty years before, federal agents in Waco confronted a cult called the Branch Davidians, whose members were stockpiling weapons and explosives in their compound. After a siege, the building caught fire, and more than seventy people died. The incident became a rallying cry for right-wing activists and militiamen, who see themselves as locked in conflict with a tyrannical regime. Trump's event embraced the full aesthetic of anti-government resistance. He stood onstage with his hand over his heart, while loudspeakers blared \"Justice for All\"-a recording in which inmates serving time for their role on January 6th sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" as Trump recites the Pledge of Allegiance. (\"Justice for All\" later reached the top of a Billboard chart.) While the song played, a huge screen showed scenes of the riot at the Capitol. Trump told the crowd, \"For seven years, you and I have been taking on the corrupt, rotten, and sinister forces trying to destroy America.\" He declared, \"2024 is the final battle.\"\n\nThe violence of January 6th has become a touchstone for Biden, too, but with a different valence. He staged his first rally of 2024 on the eve of the riot's third anniversary, near a site chosen to dramatize the stakes: Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where George Washington hunkered down in 1777 and turned a group of militias into a cohesive force for democracy.\n\nThe encampment sprawled across a grassy plateau, where Washington arrived at the head of a contingent of weary and ill-equipped soldiers. Biden arrived in Marine One, accompanied by dusty green military helicopters loaded with advisers, security staff, and the press pool. The Presidential arrival is a hoary ritual of the media, but these days it carries the added risk that any stumble will become fodder for critics. Biden descended the steps from the helicopter and turned back to extend a hand to Jill Biden, his wife. They gazed at the weathered remnants of the revolutionary camp, then ducked into a waiting limousine. After a couple of stops-laying a wreath at a memorial, visiting a stone house that Washington used as his headquarters-the motorcade headed to a community college in the nearby suburb of Blue Bell, where Biden would give a speech.\n\nBiden stepped onstage to the audience's chant of \"Four more years!\" But little of what followed bore much resemblance to a typical campaign speech. There was no ingratiation, no name-check for the local pols. He barely bothered with the requisite list of first-term achievements. \"The topic of my speech today is deadly serious,\" he began, \"and I think it needs to be made at the outset of this campaign.\" He talked of the sacrifices memorialized at Valley Forge. \"America made a vow-never again would we bow down to a king,\" he said. \"Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time.\" He turned to the memory of January 6th and ticked through the horrors of that day-the wooden gallows, the chants of \"Where's Nancy?\" Over and over, he named Trump-more than forty times in all. \"Trump lost sixty court cases- sixty ,\" Biden said. \"The legal path just took him back to the truth: that I won the election, and he was a loser .\" The crowd erupted in chuckling applause.\n\nFour years ago, Biden tried to position himself as a unifier in an age of conflict and name-calling. But there is less of a market for that this time, and in any case he finds it hard to hide his contempt. He conjured the image of Trump joking about the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, who was struck with a hammer, fracturing his skull: \"He laughed about it. What a sick-\" Biden held up his hands, as if to stop himself from going further, and clenched his fists as the crowd applauded. (In private, Biden is less decorous; among other things, he has been heard to call Trump a \"sick fuck.\") He cited Trump's threat to give the death penalty to Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his reported mockery of dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" (Trump has denied this.) \"How dare he?\" Biden asked. \"Who in God's name does he think he is?\" He was rolling now, calm and clear. Preserving America's democracy, he told the crowd, is \"the central cause of my Presidency.\"\n\nFor nearly half a century in Washington, Biden worked on many things-foreign policy, crime, domestic violence. It's only now, in the era of Trump, that he has arrived at a defining mission. In the final moments of the speech, he posed a question that will almost certainly feature in his rhetoric in the months ahead, a question that could be posed to Biden as much as to the audience. \"We all know who Donald Trump is,\" he said. \"The question we have to answer is: who are we?\"\n\nAmong the staff members backstage at the rally, none had spent more time formulating that day's message than Mike Donilon, an unassuming man in a roomy gray suit. Donilon is, as Sheldon Whitehouse puts it, the \"high priest of Bidenism.\" At sixty-five, he has short white hair, long white eyebrows, and a quiet voice, often used to deliver gnomic pronouncements. He does not tweet or go on television, and even after decades in politics he slips into restaurants in D.C. without attracting notice. He started out as a pollster before making ads and running strategy for campaigns, and has worked with Biden off and on since 1981, longer than nearly any other member of his inner circle. In the 2020 election, it was Donilon who spurred Biden on, helping to shape the campaign around the concept of a \"battle for the soul of a nation.\" He followed Biden into the White House as a senior adviser.\n\nDonilon's mild demeanor can be misleading. Like Biden, he has firm beliefs-about politics, the public, the press-and a contrarian side. In 2020, he and his campaign team had to decide whether to emphasize the economy or the more abstract idea that Trump imperilled the essence of America. \"We bet on the latter,\" Donilon said, even though \"our own pollsters told us that talking about 'the soul of the nation' was nutty.\" That experience fortified his belief that this year's campaign should center on what he calls \"the freedom agenda.\" By November, he predicted, \"the focus will become overwhelming on democracy. I think the biggest images in people's minds are going to be of January 6th.\"\n\nHe sees a parallel to the race between George W. Bush and John Kerry, in 2004. At the time, Donilon was working on television ads for Kerry. \"The Democratic Party didn't want to believe it was a 9/11 election,\" he said. Instead, the Party tried to focus on an array of issues-the war in Iraq, the economy, hostility to Bush. But, shortly before the election, a new video of Osama bin Laden was released that dredged up memories of 9/11. Bush won, and Donilon vowed not to repeat the error: \"I decided, after the election, I would never be part of a Presidential campaign that didn't figure out-with clarity-what it wanted to say and stick to it.\"\n\nIt's easy to miss how unusual a \"freedom agenda\" is for a Democratic Presidential campaign. Since the nineteen-sixties, Republicans have held fast to the language of freedom-from the backlash against civil rights to the Tea Party to the Freedom Caucus. But Democrats have been trying to convince the public that the Republican Party under Trump has transformed into the \" MAGA movement,\" an authoritarian crusade bent on dominion. Donilon said, \"At its heart, it doesn't believe in the Constitution, doesn't believe in law, embraces violence.\" He sees an opportunity for Democrats to be \"in a place where they usually aren't.\" They can lay claim to the freedom to \"choose your own health-care decisions, the freedom to vote, the freedom for your kids to be free of gun violence in school, the freedom for seniors to live in dignity.\"\n\nThe idea of wrapping the 2024 campaign around this kind of high concept is divisive in Democratic circles. \"I'm pretty certain in Scranton they're not sitting around their dinner table talking about democracy every night,\" David Axelrod told me. \"The Republican message is: The world's out of control and Biden's not in command. That's the entire message-Trump, the strongman, is the solution. I think you have to be thinking about how you counter that, and how you deal with fears about Biden's condition.\" Axelrod argues that in 2020, even as the Democrats summoned concerns about the soul of a nation, they never lost sight of more concrete issues: \"Biden as a guy who really understood and fought for the middle class, Biden as a person of faith, and Biden as someone who had a deep connection to the military. It was basically 'Biden is one of us.' \"\n\nLink copied\n\nDonilon is undeterred. He shares Biden's pride in defying predictions that Democrats would take heavy losses in the 2022 midterms, because of inflation and poor views of the economy; instead, they expanded their Senate majority and picked up two governors' seats, the best performance in decades by a party in the White House. The freedom campaign, Donilon said, is a story in three acts: \"The first act was 2020. Trump represented a threat, and Biden won. 2022 was a second round. You had these election deniers, and all these folks around the country, and they were beaten back.\" He added, \"Round three is 2024. The thing is, you got to win all the rounds.\"\n\nAs the crowd dispersed in Pennsylvania, I scanned the social-media reaction to Biden's speech. His supporters had thrilled to the flashes of anger: \"Biden almost slips up and calls Trump a sick fuck\"; \"pissed off Biden is my favorite Biden.\" His opponents were posting, too, of course, but they didn't bother with the content of his remarks. The Republican National Committee put up a clip of Biden walking stiffly beside the First Lady. Soon, it had been reposted hundreds of times, while the posts in Biden's favor had not spread as widely.\n\nThat was no accident, according to Sarah Longwell, a former Republican strategist and a founder of the Bulwark news site. \"Democrats do not build their own echo chambers the way Republicans do,\" she said. \"It's a strange communications differential. It's not rocket science: you create a narrative, you are relentless about promoting it, you have a million people all working from the same sheet of paper.\" She continued, \"I know that this is a thing with Democrats-it's like herding cats-but if Biden is not the strongest communicator, why aren't there hundreds of surrogates for him? Having spent a long time on the Republican side, I am constantly flabbergasted by the inability of Democrats to prosecute a case against Republicans relentlessly, with a knife in their teeth.\"\n\nIn Chester County, on the outskirts of Philadelphia, I stopped for dinner with three local Democratic volunteers. \"The three of us live in the swing district of the swing county of the swing state,\" Caroline Bradley, a marketing director for a fitness company, told me. \"Registration for our district is pretty much fifty-fifty, Democrats and Republicans.\" Her friend Vanessa Babinecz chimed in, \"Purple, purple, purple!\" Babinecz, who is thirty-eight years old and of mixed race, works as an administrator at a private school, and had watched the Valley Forge speech at home, with her toddler on her lap. \"I was riveted,\" she said-and that surprised her. \"He can still connect with people.\"\n\nBabinecz confessed a lack of enthusiasm for Biden. \"I wish there was someone younger, but I don't know anyone who's younger who's qualified, who could do it,\" she said. \"I thought Kamala would've been great, but for whatever reason she just can't make a compelling speech.\" Babinecz is confident, though, that women will be motivated to vote by Republican efforts to eliminate access to abortion. She said, \"Every single woman I've ever talked to about it either has had an abortion or knows someone who's had an abortion.\" She offered the President some advice: \"He needs to have a few viral TikToks and a few viral Instagrams. We need to see pictures of him in his slippers interacting with his grandkids. A more approachable side, not just him on a stage.\"\n\nSocial media could be vital. With older Americans already entrenched in partisan identity, strategists are focussed on mobilizing young urbanites. Dmitri Mehlhorn, the donor adviser, said that the numbers are potentially significant: \"How many Millennials and Gen Z-ers are in dense cities in one of the seven swing states? About five million.\"\n\nBradley, who described herself as a \"HinJew\" (\"My father's Hindu, my mother's Jewish\"), keeps a close eye on persuadable voters, monitoring the number of people who contact the local Democratic Party to switch their registration. Through her outreach, she's heard that \"people are sick of Biden now. I don't know if fear of Trump is enough this year.\" When major candidates are unpopular, third-party options prosper. Though polls show modest support for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Cornel West, and Jill Stein, protest votes can tip the results of a tight race-and they become more likely when people think that their vote won't determine the outcome.\n\nAs we talked, the volunteers returned often to the challenge of getting Biden's message to break through to an overloaded, disengaged public. Bradley looked back fondly at the simplicity of an earlier slogan: \"You want to know why Barack Obama was awesome? Hope, change. Hope, change.\" She went on, \"Biden hasn't figured out how to be clickbait. I work full time. I have two kids. How much time do people really have? Biden does all of these things and nobody knows what he's done.\" Biden has passed up major opportunities to advertise his record, including televised interviews before the Super Bowl. His advisers have embraced less conventional venues-he has appeared on podcasts with comedians and with a life-style guru.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the more people see Biden, the more they'll like him. But as Longwell, the former Republican strategist, who has spent hundreds of hours with focus groups, told me, \"Trump was in people's faces so insanely all the time for so long that actually voters got quite used to the rhythms of a President who was just front and center constantly. Let's get Biden on shop floors, in swing states, putting his arms around people. People think he is invisible.\"\n\nWhen you go to work for Biden, you'll likely hear his version of Tip O'Neill's classic political adage. In his view, all politics is not local; it's personal . Even more than most politicians, Biden refracts the world through the lens of the individual-through an accounting of people's idiosyncrasies and biographies, their talents, flaws, and blind spots. Before meeting foreign leaders for the first time, he will grill his briefer for insights into their areas of pride and vulnerability. When he talks about economics, he refers to data less often than to \"dignity,\" and he routinely conjures up the image of a laid-off father or mother, on the humiliating trip home to face their kids. Senator Whitehouse told me, \"The world is personal to him in a way that it is not to everyone.\"\n\nBiden takes the same approach to his own life, which he tends to frame in terms of obstacles overcome and respect earned-or, when necessary, seized. In his first memoir, \"Promises to Keep\" (2008), he devoted the opening chapter to his stutter, which a nun mocked by calling him \"bu-bu-bu-bu-Biden,\" and to his efforts to defeat it by practicing Irish poetry in front of the mirror. He also recalled his mother's high-minded pugilism: \"She once shipped my brother Jim off with instructions to bloody the nose of a kid who was picking on smaller kids, and she gave him a dollar when he'd done it.\"\n\nBiden's self-mythology took shape around the figure of the underdog. \"I was young for my grade and always little for my age, but I made up for it by demonstrating I had guts,\" he wrote of his early years, in Scranton. He described exploring the region's culm dumps, heaps of coal slag with fires smoldering below the crust: \"On a dare, I'd climb to the top of a burning culm dump, swing out over a construction site, race under a moving dump truck. If I could visualize myself doing it, I knew I could do it.\"\n\nThat effortful confidence carried over into politics. After scraping through the University of Delaware, he graduated from law school at Syracuse University, despite rarely attending class. In 1972, as a council member in New Castle County, with governing experience mostly related to stoplights and sewers, he decided to run for the United States Senate. His opponent, Senator Caleb Boggs, had won seven straight elections, but Biden saw a path for himself-playing up his youth, showing off his handsome family, flattering Boggs with patronizing grace. In June, while polling at three per cent, Biden rented the biggest ballroom in Delaware for what he was already calling his \"victory celebration.\" When he won-by just three thousand votes-it was one of the biggest upsets in Senate history.\n\nIn 1987, as Richard Ben Cramer started writing \"What It Takes,\" his study of the psychology of Presidential aspirants, he gravitated to Biden, then a third-term senator competing in the Democratic primary. Biden had survived a personal agony almost beyond reckoning: in 1972, a car accident had killed his wife, Neilia, and daughter, Naomi, and left his young sons, Beau and Hunter, hospitalized. But Biden had found a calling in the Senate, where he came to believe ever more deeply in his capacity to envision a way through obstacles. \"Joe called that process 'gaming it out,' \" Cramer wrote, \"and it went on continuously in his head.\"\n\nBiden, the persuasive son of a car salesman, was always gaming out ideas that others thought half crazy-like the time he bought a dilapidated mansion, full of squirrels and asbestos, for two hundred thousand dollars that he didn't have, or the time he fell in love with a crop of enormous hemlock bushes at a nursery in Pennsylvania and borrowed a truck to haul them home. \"Joe drove the thing,\" Cramer wrote, \"overloaded, rocking and pitching, with trees hanging off the tail, down the back roads, an hour and a half, back to Wilmington.\" Sometimes Biden's ambition nearly derailed his career; in 1987, his first run for President ended abruptly after he was found to have embellished his biography and used other politicians' lines in his speeches. Biden returned to the Senate, and in 2008, after another unsuccessful campaign for the Presidency, Obama asked him to join his ticket. The idea was that he would bring some foreign-policy experience, a connection to working-class white voters, and not much else. Biden was sixty-five years old; the job would be, as Obama's strategist David Plouffe later put it, \"a capstone to his storied career.\"\n\nIn the Vice-Presidency, Biden took bristly pride in defying the political wisdom of younger advisers. In 2012, he publicly embraced gay marriage while Obama was still weighing the political implications. The same year, though, he sided against progressives in a debate over requiring health-care plans to provide free contraception. When Biden argued that it risked alienating religious voters, a White House aide is said to have dismissed his concern as an artifact of the \"electoral map of 1992,\" when \"the Catholic, white, Reagan Democrat vote was decisive.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nSome of those same voters would prove decisive again, when they sided with Trump in the 2016 election. But Biden was not in that race, of course. As he entered the last year of his Vice-Presidency, his son Beau was stricken with brain cancer-the second great agony of Biden's life. He coped by returning to his \"purpose\" as a public servant-asking his chief of staff to overload the schedule with work, and telling him, about his family's car accident, \"The only way I survived, the only way I got through it, was by staying busy and keeping my mind, when it can be, focused on my job.\"\n\nWhen Biden left office, he was still in mourning, and for the first time in decades he was unsure what to do next. He started public-policy organizations, signed a reported eight-million-dollar contract for three books, advocated for veterans' issues and cancer research. Meanwhile, his son Hunter was coming apart; he had leveraged the family name into a much criticized business venture, joining the board of Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine, while his father was still overseeing relations with the country. While Hunter descended into addiction, he made a multimillion-dollar deal with a Chinese energy company that also benefitted his uncle James. (Hunter is awaiting a possible trial in California on federal tax charges.) Those ventures have become a focus of Republican-led investigations, but they have produced no evidence that Joe Biden was financially involved.\n\nIn 2017, Biden published his second book, \"Promise Me, Dad,\" framed around a moment near the end of Beau's life when he implored his father to stay engaged in public life after he was gone. In April, 2019, Biden entered the Presidential primary, but found himself beset by concerns that he was too old, too out of touch. After he lost in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, advisers told him that he was so low on cash he might be finished within weeks.\n\nIn a turnaround that Biden and his aides still often cite, he won the South Carolina primary, thanks in part to a long-standing bond with Representative James Clyburn, who delivered an endorsement that carried singular weight with Black voters: \"We know Joe. But, most importantly, Joe knows us.\" Democrats, fearing a divisive primary, rapidly coalesced around Biden, and he went on to beat Trump by more than seven million votes. It was a smaller margin than polls had predicted-but it also represented the highest turnout in a Presidential election in decades.\n\nWinning the Presidency after Trump was a mixed blessing. During the usual redecoration of the Oval Office, Biden was surprised by a proposal to put Franklin Roosevelt's portrait over the fireplace. \"I said, 'I admire Roosevelt, but why Roosevelt?' \" he told me. Citing the threat to democracy, the Presidential historian Jon Meacham told him, \"Not since Roosevelt has anyone ever inherited a circumstance of more difficulty.\"\n\nThe economy was in ruins. On Inauguration Day, unemployment was 6.3 per cent, and food banks were sustaining millions of people who had been laid off. Thousands of Americans were still dying of Covid every day. Arriving at the White House, Jeff Zients, who was assigned to take over the pandemic response, could not bear to dwell on images of hospitals. \"I remember watching CNN out of the corner of my eye, and finally turning it off,\" he said.\n\nOn both Covid and the economy, Biden had a core belief: better to respond too heavily than too lightly. \"I want to overwhelm the problem,\" he told aides. The risk of a stimulus is inflation, but Biden recalled a bitter lesson from the financial collapse during the Obama Administration, when a stimulus proved insufficient and Republicans, who took control of the House in the next year's midterms, refused to agree to more. Biden told aides working on the stimulus proposal, \"We're not going to be able to do this again.\" In March, 2021, after intense debate among members of the Administration and Congress, Biden signed a $1.9-trillion package. In July, as inflation was registering worldwide, Biden's approval rating fell substantially for the first time.\n\nThat drop in popularity was compounded in August, when Biden fulfilled a years-long desire to pull American troops from Afghanistan-despite warnings that he should disregard the timetable set by Trump. The withdrawal was ugly. The Taliban took over almost instantly, and the Administration was desperately unprepared; it airlifted out some hundred and twenty thousand people, but tens of thousands more who had worked for the U.S. government were still clamoring for evacuation. In \"The Last Politician,\" a book about Biden's first two years in the Presidency, Franklin Foer wrote that criticism of his policy \"caused him to stubbornly defend his own logic.\" According to Foer, Biden saw the scathing coverage and told an aide, \"Either the press is losing its mind, or I am.\" As people scrambled to flee, a bombing at the gates of the Kabul airport killed thirteen American troops and nearly two hundred Afghans.\n\nBiden's popularity might have recovered as the economy steadied. The stimulus was likely contributing modestly to rising prices, but it had also kept many out of poverty. Then, in February, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. Biden was lauded for his response; European leaders had wrongly predicted that Vladimir Putin was bluffing, but the Administration had released accurate intelligence in advance, which fortified Biden's bid to rally NATO allies. Nevertheless, the costs of energy and shipping spiked, and, by that June, prices in America had soared more than nine per cent in one year-the steepest rise in four decades.\n\nThe feeling of a world out of control-inflation, Afghanistan, Ukraine-contributed to a sense that Biden was floundering. Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, said that a recession was \"almost inevitable.\" Biden repeatedly disputed the idea, even as a consensus formed: in December, a Financial Times survey of economists found that eighty-five per cent predicted a recession within a year. Bloomberg Economics calculated the odds at a hundred per cent.\n\nThose predictions proved resoundingly wrong. By 2024, the country had gained more than three million jobs, unemployment was at historic lows, consumer confidence was steadily rising, and the United States was in stronger shape than all other advanced economies. (Germany, by contrast, declared a recession in early 2023.) The economist Tyler Cowen concluded, in a postmortem on the forecasts, \"The problem is that the real world is not as consistent as model builders might like.\"\n\nBiden takes evident pride in having been right. He asked me, \"How many times did you and your colleagues write, 'The recession is coming next month'?\" In pursuing a larger stimulus, Biden was challenging what he often calls \"the orthodoxy of trickle-down economics.\" That view, he said, held that \"the only way we're going to get inflation down is to get unemployment up to ten per cent. Come on. That's how it worked in the past, because we'd want to make sure the wealthy don't get hurt. But who pays for that?\" The goal was rebuilding the economy from \"the middle out and the bottom up,\" he said. \"When that happens, everybody does well, including- including -the wealthy.\"\n\nIn January, when the S. & P. 500 and the Dow hit their highest points in history, Biden posted a video from 2020 of Trump predicting that a Biden win would lead to \"a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\" More recently, Trump had said that he was hoping for a crash. \"He'd like to see a recession or a depression,\" Biden said, aghast. \"He doesn't want to be the next Herbert Hoover? He's already Herbert Hoover. He's the only President that ever lost jobs in a four-year period-other than Hoover.\"\n\nRoger Altman, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton Administration, told me, \"The data is so good you have to rub your eyes.\" But feelings about the economy have become, in part, a proxy for partisan identity. In December, more than three-quarters of respondents in a poll for Axios acknowledged reports of the recovery but said they were \"not feeling it where I live.\" Those most likely to report financial distress were Republicans and rural Americans. Biden, Altman said, needs to hammer home the idea: \" 'We're getting key prices back down for you.' Talk about it every half hour, because this grocery-price anger is a real problem.\"\n\nThree days after the Valley Forge speech, Biden was back on the road-this time to Charleston, South Carolina, where he could counter talk that he was losing ground with an important demographic. Four years earlier, Black voters had resuscitated his campaign. Now, according to an NBC News survey, their approval of Biden had dropped nearly twenty points in a year.\n\nThe Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church occupies a creaky nineteenth-century sanctuary-and a singular position in the history of the Black freedom struggle. Founded near what was once one of the country's busiest slave ports, it became known as Mother Emanuel, because it spawned so many churches across the Lowcountry of South Carolina. In 2015, it gained international notice, in horrific fashion, when a white supremacist, welcomed at a Bible study, pulled out a gun and murdered the pastor and eight parishioners.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe horror at Mother Emanuel would come to be understood as an opening shot in an age of far-right violence, and of radicalization in the Republican Party. Joseph Darby, a reverend and an influential political voice in Charleston, told me, \"It was a dog whistle in the Nixon days. It's a bullhorn now. You've got Nikki Haley running around with amnesia about slavery. You've got DeSantis trying to ban books and saying that slaves might've learned to make a buck while they were being beaten, raped, and maimed.\"\n\nOn the dais at Mother Emanuel, backed by a towering stained-glass mosaic, Biden faced an audience of about seven hundred parishioners and guests. He was introduced by Clyburn, the dean of South Carolina's congressional delegation, who ticked through the Administration's programs and repeated his crucial imprimatur: \"As I told you four years ago, we know Joe. But, more importantly, Joe knows us.\"\n\nBiden rose from his seat, embraced Clyburn, and stepped forward. Before he spoke much of politics, he spoke of loss. After the massacre, Biden and Hunter had visited the church. The trip was meant \"to show our solidarity,\" Biden recalled, but Beau had died only three weeks earlier, and \"my family also needed to be healed.\" Now, he said, seeing family members of some of those killed \"reminds me that, through our pain, each of us-each of us-must find purpose.\"\n\nBiden didn't restrain himself from politics for long. In the minutes that followed, he drew his opponent into a blistering analogy to the aftermath of the Civil War, when, he said, \"defeated Confederates couldn't accept the verdict of the war.\" They took refuge in \"a self-serving lie that the Civil War was not about slavery but about states' rights.\" That lie, in turn, gave rise to Jim Crow. \"Once again, there are some in this country trying to turn a loss into a lie,\" Biden said. \"This time, the lie is about the 2020 election, the election in which you made your voices heard and your power known.\" He never mentioned Trump's name, but the point was clear. \"In our time, there's still the old ghost in new garments,\" he told the crowd. \"And we all need to rise to meet the moment.\"\n\nSeated in the second row was Deon Tedder, the son of a custodian and a secretary, who was elected last year to the state senate. He knows that some young voters are unimpressed with Biden. \"They're saying, 'Well, what has he done? We don't see anything,' \" Tedder told me. Trump put his name on people's stimulus checks-and they still talk about them. But the effects of Biden's policy agenda will take years to manifest. Tedder went on, \"Democrats, even here, we are horrible with messaging. Talk about student-loan forgiveness. Talk about the push to decriminalize nonviolent offenses. You have to break it down so that people can connect.\"\n\nAfter leaving the church, Biden stopped at Hannibal's, a venerable soul-food spot that draws Democrats on the stump. A President's entourage is the size of a small army, but as Biden moved from booth to booth he seemed relaxed for the first time all day. A half century of glad-handing shone through. Approaching the owner, who was standing with his daughters, he asked, with mock concern, \"Do you know these women?\" The man beamed and said, \"They're the next generation. I'm the old patriarch-like you.\"\n\nBiden's victory in the South Carolina primary, on February 3rd, was never in question, but the returns would be studied for indications of his campaign's momentum. The results were encouraging for Democrats. Turnout in Orangeburg County, home to two historically Black universities, was the second-highest in the state-and it was higher still in the county's predominantly African American precincts.\n\nReverend Darby told me that he has always thought Biden's standing among Black voters was better than press accounts suggested. \"Donald Trump is not exactly the picture of health, but if Joe Biden wears sneakers there's a great national concern. There's something wrong with that balance,\" he said. He believes that as the year moves on voters will recognize practical improvements from some Biden-era policies. He said, \"My late wife was diabetic. The first time I found out how much insulin costs, I asked, 'How much is it with insurance?' And the pharmacist said, 'That is with insurance.' \" (Under the Inflation Reduction Act, a month of insulin, which used to cost Darby about two hundred dollars, is now capped for Medicare recipients at thirty-five dollars.) He continued, \"I have two sons. Neither of them are exceptionally enthused. But both of them say, 'I will be at the polls. Can't have Trump.' \"\n\nThe Trump White House confronted Americans with a parade of emergencies, pratfalls, and defenestrations. The Biden Administration, by contrast, has a culture of almost ostentatious calm. Biden's public statements are \"actively sedative,\" as one commentator put it, and Cabinet members seem to go out of their way to avoid generating excitement. In a list of their personal New Year's resolutions published by Politico, Gina Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, declared, \"I'm hoping to drink less diet soda.\"\n\nTurnover has been rare in the top ranks of the Administration. Biden has long retained a core group of advisers, and, unlike in the previous Administration, top aides don't regularly disparage each other to reporters. Anita Dunn, a senior adviser who specializes in communications, considers that a by-product of age. \"You don't have a lot of the jockeying around being close to him, or 'Who is he listening to?' \" she said. \"We're closer to the end of our careers than the middles or the beginnings.\"\n\nBut the culture of calm also relies on a capacity for setting aside concerns. A series of senior aides told me that they doubt Biden is trailing Trump as much as some polls have suggested. \"Polling is broken,\" one of them said. \"You can't figure out how to get someone on the phone.\" Pollsters partly concede the point; few people these days are willing to be candid with a stranger about politics, and fewer still have landlines. \"I think the only person who calls me on my landline is Joe Biden,\" the aide added. Campaigns that are trailing in the polls often impugn them, of course, but Biden aides cite reasons for their skepticism. When I raised the issue with Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, a top adviser who recently moved from the White House to the campaign, she made a distinction between \"favorability\" (a line of inquiry in opinion polls) and \"vote choice\" (the outcome of recent elections, notably the recent ones in which Democrats did well). \"Historically, favorability and vote choice have been correlated,\" she said. \"I actually think that that's no longer the case.\"\n\nOutside the White House, though, concerned Democrats note that Biden was not on the ballot in 2022 or 2023, so voters did not have a chance to signal their feelings about him. They worry that aides are relying too much on Biden's self-image as the underdog who disproves the doubters. In any Administration, there is a tendency to amplify the good news and obscure the bad. \"Every White House does it to some degree,\" the former Democratic official told me. He said he believes that Biden's polls show \"flashing red warning signs,\" but that the President \"can just choose to hear the positive reinforcement.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Biden's aides reject the idea that the White House is insular or dismissive of reality. Zients, who succeeded Ron Klain as chief of staff last year, pointed to Biden's reputation for soliciting opinions from critics. \"Just the other day, he picked up the phone and called Larry Summers,\" Zients said. As outreach goes, it was relatively safe; Summers, despite his critical comments, is a longtime adviser to Presidents. Biden's other occasional calls range from the columnist Thomas Friedman to the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. \"That's how you pressure-test decisions,\" Zients said.\n\nAt bottom, Biden has oriented his Presidency around an unfashionable faith in compromise, experience, and relationships. As Dunn put it, \"The biggest bet of all is that good governing actually can get you reëlected in 2024, when all of the forces seem to be arrayed against it.\" But there is little agreement-even among Biden's supporters-on what good governing looks like. Perhaps the greatest test of Biden's belief in the old ways of Washington came from abroad, and outraged some of the voters he needs most.\n\nAt 12:06 a . m . on October 7th, the Situation Room at the White House sent an urgent message to national-security officials: \"Heavy rocket barrage launched from Gaza.\" By 12:48, new details had confirmed that something far more devastating was afoot: \"Hamas militants have infiltrated Israel from Gaza via land, air, and sea.\" Michael Herzog, Israel's Ambassador to Washington, had sent the message, \"This is war.\"\n\nLike many Presidents before, Biden had come to office hoping to avoid engulfing dramas in the Middle East. \"No new projects,\" as one aide put it. But, after Hamas slaughtered some twelve hundred Israelis, Biden expanded arms shipments to Israel, dispatched ships, and spoke furiously about the rampage of killings, rapes, and kidnappings-what he called \"an act of sheer evil.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn Biden's view, the attack was part of a challenge that defines his Presidency: the assault on free societies. \"Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common-they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,\" he said, in an Oval Office address last October. Although Biden has a half century of sometimes tense dealings with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's right-wing Prime Minister, he feels a deep kinship with the country, which he first visited in 1973, just before it fought off a surprise attack from its neighbors. \"In his gut, he sees Israel as besieged by enemies,\" Senator Coons told me. \"The tension is that my kids' college-ish generation doesn't see Israel as surrounded by enemies, at risk of not surviving.\"\n\nAs Israel's retaliation generated horrific images of Palestinians suffering in Gaza, Biden's tone slowly shifted. He publicly warned Israel against \"indiscriminate\" attacks and privately intervened to avoid counterstrikes based on bad information; by mid-January, the number of Gazans killed each day had fallen by nearly half, according to a tally by the Times . But Biden continued to resist calls for an immediate ceasefire or a reduction in military aid. When I visited the White House, protesters near an entrance used by visitors and staff were dousing the pavement with blood-red liquid and lying across the walkway. The potential political impact was obvious: In 2020, Biden won resoundingly among Arab and Muslim voters-an especially consequential bloc in Michigan, where he won by just a hundred and fifty-four thousand votes. Now some of the same voters in Michigan were promoting a campaign called Abandon Biden, and a national poll showed that his support among Arab and Muslim Americans had dropped by forty per cent.\n\nI asked Biden if he intended to apply more pressure on Israel's leaders, and, for the first time that day, he did not jab back at the question. \"I understand the anger and the rage\" sparked by October 7th, he said. \"But you can't let the rage consume you to the point where you lose the moral high ground.\" Biden didn't hide his frustration with Netanyahu's government. He told me that, when he preached caution to members of Israel's war cabinet, they replied that America had carpet-bombed Germany in the Second World War. Biden said that he responded, \"That's why we ended up with the United Nations and all these rules about not doing that again.\"\n\nBiden holds out hope for the most elusive of grand bargains: getting Israelis to accept the creation of a Palestinian state, in exchange for normalized relations with Saudi Arabia-which many Israelis see as a vital step toward long-term security. He described it as a way for Israel to fight off its attackers without causing undue suffering: \"We could put in place a circumstance that ends up where they continue to move-as we did with bin Laden-against the leaders of Hamas, but not assume that every Palestinian is a supporter of Hamas.\" He added, \"I've been pushing very hard for the Israeli government to come down hard on these out-of-control settlers.\" (In February, Biden imposed financial penalties and visa bans on four Israeli settlers in the West Bank who were accused of attacking Palestinians and Israeli peace activists.)\n\nI brought up the disdain that Biden's handling of the war has engendered among Arab Americans and young Democrats. \"I don't want to see any Palestinians killed-I think that it's contrary to what we believe as Americans,\" he said. But he urged his critics to wait. \"I think they have to give this just a little bit of time, understanding what would happen if they came into their state or their neighborhood and saw what happened with Hamas,\" he said. \"The pressure on the leadership to move with every ounce of capacity against Hamas is real. But it doesn't mean it should be continued. It doesn't mean it's right. And so, I think you're going to see-I'm praying you're going to see-a significant downturn in the use of force.\"\n\nThat posture was echt Biden: asking for patience to continue private negotiations, criticizing Netanyahu's government without renouncing him. It would satisfy almost nobody in the short term. (The day after we spoke, Netanyahu dismissed Biden's idea of a Palestinian state as an \"attempt to impose a reality that would harm Israel's security.\") As with many issues, Biden is both weighed down and blessed by his experience. He is not counting on an epiphany from Netanyahu. Without saying so explicitly, he is betting that an offer of Saudi normalization would be so popular with Israeli leaders that Netanyahu would have no choice but to engage it. Since the war began, Israel has rejected many American requests-to allow humanitarian assistance, to let out the severely wounded and foreign-passport holders, to pause the fighting while hostages are released-before ultimately agreeing. The Administration treats each no from Israel as an \"initial answer,\" a national-security official told me, adding, \"Other people would like us to take an approach that is much more publicly confrontational. But would it actually lead to better outcomes in the war?\"\n\nNot long after I visited Biden, I called Mohammad Qazzaz, a Palestinian American who lives in Dearborn, Michigan, and owns a coffee business. We met in 2020, when he was a strong Biden supporter. Now he was furious. \"There are people who bleed Democratic here, but they will never vote for Biden again,\" he said. \"Some of them are actually saying they will vote for Trump because they just want to screw up the whole system. Screw this country if it thinks we're dogs.\"\n\nQazzaz can't bring himself to vote for Trump, but he plans to write in \"Free Palestine\" on the ballot this November. It's not yet clear how much this kind of sentiment will hurt Biden. During the Michigan primary, a hundred thousand people-about thirteen per cent of the total-wrote in \"uncommitted,\" as a protest vote. When I asked one of Biden's political advisers how much disillusionment over the war will matter, he said, \"The single biggest thing is whether it's a three- or four-month thing-or does it go on longer?\"\n\nOn a crisp afternoon in late January, Biden and the First Lady boarded Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, for a short hop to Manassas, Virginia, where George Mason University has a campus. There, they would meet up with Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, to mark the fifty-first anniversary of Roe v. Wade-which the Supreme Court overturned in 2022, starting a national furor. Onstage for Biden's speech, a backdrop of white letters spelled out \"Restore Roe.\"\n\nFor decades, the politics of abortion were notoriously awkward for Biden. As a devoted Catholic and a liberal Democrat, he was torn between two creeds. Even after he became a vocal supporter of same-sex marriage and transgender protections, he remained, as he put it, \"not big\" on abortion. \"It's always been a hard issue for him,\" an aide told me. \"But it became a very easy issue for him because of the Supreme Court.\" O'Malley Dillon recalled that when the decision came, in a case called Dobbs v. Jackson, Biden's immediate response was \"How is it that we are rolling back fifty years of rights?\"\n\nI asked Biden what he would do in a second term to protect abortion access at the federal level. \"Pass Roe v. Wade as the law of the land,\" he said. Democrats would need to win control of the House of Representatives and gain seats in the Senate, but Biden expressed confidence. \"A few more elections like we've seen taking place in the states\" would suffice, he said. \"You're seeing the country changing.\" Then, reiterating his position on Roe, he said, \"I've never been supportive of, you know, 'It's my body, I can do what I want with it.' But I have been supportive of the notion that this is probably the most rational allocation of responsibility that all the major religions have signed on and debated over the last thousand years.\"\n\nIt's a framing that irritates advocates. (In February, after he told attendees at a New York fund-raiser, \"I don't want abortion on demand, but I thought Roe v. Wade was right,\" Slate ran a story titled \"Biden's Latest Abortion Fumble Is Particularly Distressing.\") But, so far, they have chosen to avoid a fight with a Democratic President whose opponent crows that he was able to \"terminate\" Roe. After the midterms in 2022, researchers found that abortion restrictions had disproportionately motivated first-time and younger voters, and women under fifty.\n\nSince Dobbs, twenty-one states have tightened restrictions on abortion. The prospect of a further rollback looms. In a concurring opinion on Dobbs, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the legal rationale for overturning Roe could be applied to \"correct the error\" in cases on same-sex marriage, the decriminalization of homosexuality, and access to contraception. I asked Biden if he thought that the Justices would undo those protections. \"I don't think there's a majority to go there,\" he said, but added, \"I think that a couple on the Court would go considerably further\"-specifically \"the guy who likes to spend a lot of time on yachts.\"\n\n\"Thomas?\" I asked.\n\nBiden grinned.\n\nAt the event in Manassas, it became clear that two of the most important issues for young people are colliding. As Biden began cranking up his speech, a man in the auditorium yelled, \"Genocide Joe, how many kids have you killed in Gaza?\" The audience drowned him out with chants of \"Four more years,\" and Biden returned to his lines, but moments later another call came from across the room: \"Israel kills two mothers every hour!\"\n\nWhile the protesters were removed, Biden looked out calmly, knitting his fingers on the lectern. He seemed determined to project the mien of a parish priest, saying of the protesters, \"They feel deeply.\" But he barely made it through the next sentence of his speech before there was another shout. \"This is going to go on for a while,\" he told the crowd. Eventually, he gave up bothering to pause with each interruption-his supporters shouted, \"Keep going!\"-and by the end there had been at least a dozen removals. Biden wound up the speech to thundering applause. Still, it was hard to see how the impassioned young people who had been ejected, or who had stayed away that day, would change their minds between now and November.\n\nA few hours after I met Biden in the Oval Office, he was due to sit down with members of Congress to discuss an ungainly jumble of issues, including military aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, as well as the humanitarian crisis at America's border with Mexico. They had been conjoined in a single bill after Republicans vowed to block funding for Ukraine unless Biden did something about immigration.\n\nAt the West Wing, more than a dozen Republicans and Democrats filed into the Cabinet Room, where the fireplace was roaring. The Republicans were led by the unlikely Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, a previously obscure lawmaker from Louisiana: a staunchly religious lawyer, with a rigid shell of salt-and-pepper hair and round schoolboy glasses, who had been installed only after a chaotic internal revolt pushed out his predecessor.\n\nBiden's aides worried that the meeting would devolve into grandstanding. In December, House Republicans had approved an impeachment inquiry into Biden, in the hope of finding evidence of corruption by him and his family. And immigration was a growing political nightmare for Democrats. For nearly three years, the Administration, beset by internal tensions, had tacked between looser and stricter policies. By the end of 2023, the number of migrants coming to the border had risen tenfold in five years, driven by calamities in Central America, the Middle East, and beyond. Some in the White House spoke glumly of the border with the mantra \"All options are bad.\"\n\nThe Ukraine problem was no less of an emergency, and no simpler to solve. Military analysts estimated that, without more American arms and ammunition, Ukraine would start to succumb to Russia's attacks by the summer. The Republican Party once defined itself by its opposition to Russian aggression, but the current House of Representatives is often sympathetic to Putin-and nearly always unsympathetic to Biden's requests for funding. Still, Biden liked his chances. \"Bring them here,\" he told aides. \"I want to meet with them.\"\n\nBiden's seemingly inexhaustible appetite for negotiating with Congress can make him seem like a political misfit, a conciliator in an age of absolutes. But, in one of the more perceptive observations I've heard about Biden, his longtime aide Bruce Reed told me that he \"proceeds as if things are on the level and tries to force them to be so.\" He still believes in the old legislative-favor trade. In 2021, even though Mitch McConnell directed his members not to vote for the stimulus package, Biden made a point of approving a measure that the Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski requested, providing relief for the cruise-ship industry. Biden told aides, \"She can't vote with me now, but that doesn't mean she won't later, and she'll remember this.\"\n\nAt times, Biden's deference to lawmakers has infuriated progressive members of his own party. In 2021, some pushed him to publicly criticize Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat who had scuttled the centerpiece of the Administration's agenda, a bill known as Build Back Better. But Biden refused to \"kick the shit\" out of Manchin, an aide said. Instead, Steve Ricchetti, Biden's counsellor, who oversees legislative affairs, privately stayed in touch. They were an easy mix: two genial Italian American pols from industrial flyover states-Manchin from West Virginia, Ricchetti from Ohio. Manchin is a Democrat in a deep-red state, and Biden, betting that he might coöperate after the initial pressure passed, encouraged a strategy to \"keep the door open.\" Manchin ended up siding with the Administration on a series of pivotal votes. Ricchetti told me, \"Had we listened to that advice\"-to name and shame Manchin-\"we don't get the Inflation Reduction Act, we probably don't get the CHIPS Act, and we don't get the veterans'-health bill, or Ketanji Brown Jackson on the Supreme Court.\"\n\nLast fall, once Republicans made it clear that they would not agree to aid for Ukraine without an immigration deal, a group of senators started meeting to negotiate across the aisle. By January, they were nearing a compromise that no one in Congress would have predicted a decade ago. To the chagrin of immigration advocates, Democrats were prepared to drop the requirement for a pathway to legalization for undocumented immigrants already in the country, and to accept Republican demands for expanded detention capacity and higher standards for asylum. During the meeting at the White House, Biden told the assembled group, \"I will do a big deal on the border.\" Speaker Johnson said on television that night that the meeting was productive.\n\nNone of that sat well with Trump, who had built his campaign on the politics of a permanent border crisis; if conditions improved, he would have nothing to blame on Biden. On January 25th, even before the text of the bill was available, Trump posted on social media, \"A Border Deal now would be another Gift to the Radical Left Democrats.\" Republicans rapidly fell in line, without bothering to conceal the rationale. Representative Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican, asked a reporter, \"Why would I help Joe Biden?\" On February 4th, just hours after the bill was released, Johnson pronounced it \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nTrump had thwarted a bipartisan effort to address two of Washington's most urgent problems. Yet this act of cynicism was also, perhaps, a political gift to Biden. For the next nine months, he could blame Republicans for being feckless and destructive. In an apparent preview of how he will talk about the topic during the campaign, Biden told me, \"I'm watching television this morning while I'm shaving.\" A Republican was trashing him onscreen, he recalled, saying, \"Well, Biden won't support more funding for the border!\" Biden laughed. \"I mean, what the hell?\" he said. \"I've been pushing so damn hard for reform of the border.\"\n\nBiden's opportunity is akin to the one that Harry Truman had in his 1948 campaign for reëlection. Trailing in the polls, Truman railed against what he called a \"Do Nothing Congress,\" which had failed to stop spiking prices and ameliorate a housing crisis. Much as Biden talks about the threat to freedoms worldwide, Truman spoke of a gathering Cold War, a grand mission that served to unify a fractious Democratic Party. He ultimately prevailed.\n\n\"It was a matter of pulling together a coalition that was in even worse fragmentation,\" Sean Wilentz, a Princeton historian, told me. \"Truman did it by going to the American people, running against Congress, standing up on both the Cold War and civil rights. It's possible that '48 will prove a precursor to what we have now-if the Democrats take heed.\" Sarah Longwell said, drawing on her experience in focus groups, \"Nothing papers over the fractures in the Democratic coalition like Donald Trump. He is a walking turnout mechanism. I've just spent so much time listening to how much voters viscerally dislike him.\" She added, \"You're not building a pro-Joe Biden coalition-you're building an anti-Donald Trump coalition.\"\n\nNear the end of my conversation with Biden, he said, \"There's only one reason, I think, to be involved in elective office, and that's to be able to do what you think is the right thing.\" The sentiment is noble but incomplete. In this election, the right thing is to win. If Biden succeeds, his critics will say that their alarms nudged him to victory. If he loses, they will say that he was captive to hubris. History will be harsh.\n\nBiden believes that he is doing the most essential work of his life. To some, this is a dangerous rationalization. He is at peace with that. In the election, he is betting that Americans will reward him for his achievements: ejecting Trump from the White House, getting the nation out of the pandemic, rescuing the economy, reviving NATO -not to mention passing significant legislation on climate change, gun control, drug prices, manufacturing, and infrastructure. But achievement is not the same as inspiration, and Americans are not in a mood of gratitude toward our leaders.\n\nHaving entered the Senate at the age of thirty, one of the youngest members in its history, Biden formed an idea of himself as a wunderkind, and he has never quite shed it. He often says, \"I feel so much younger than my age.\" In the early years of his Presidency, when people asked him about his age, his stock response was \"Watch me.\" He doesn't say that as much anymore. Grudgingly, painfully, he may be coming to terms with the reality that people don't see him the way he hopes they will.\n\nIn 1960, when John F. Kennedy ran for President, discrimination against Catholics was widespread, and he faced the persistent slur that he would be controlled by the Vatican. In a speech that fall, Kennedy told an audience of Protestant ministers, \"The real issues in this campaign have been obscured-perhaps deliberately.\" Without posturing, he asked Americans to join him in rejecting \"disdain and division\" by promoting \"instead the American ideal of brotherhood.\" The speech was a success, and the fixation on Kennedy's faith receded.\n\nBiden has not addressed the matter of age as forthrightly, even though it is a topic that might resonate with Americans, especially those who have suffered the condescension and dismissal that rankle him. Yes, he might stumble at the microphone, but he might also convince skeptics of the power in his patience, institutional memory, and experience. His campaign, at least, has evidently decided that the issue can't be avoided entirely. Last week, Biden made an appearance on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" and the first question was about his age. Biden replied, as he often does, with a joke: \"You got to take a look at the other guy. He's about as old as I am, but he can't remember his wife's name.\"\n\nBiden likes to say, \"Don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.\" But, unlike his opponent, he is in office, and liable to be judged for the condition of the country. It is a measure of the interlocking crises in the world today that the course of the next eight months depends on circumstances that are unfathomable in advance. Could Houthi militants, firing rockets over the Red Sea, disrupt enough shipping to revive inflation? Could Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., ride a wave of nostalgia onto the ballot in Arizona or Michigan? Could a last-minute deepfake deter a decisive few thousand voters in a swing state? The real world of politics, like economics, is not as consistent as model builders might like.\n\nOne of the few points of certainty is a chilling one. Half the respondents to a CBS poll in January said they believed that the losing side of the coming election will resort to violence. Biden has an uneasy relationship to such knowledge. He is convinced that Americans will reject the Trumpist view of politics. \"How can we, as a democracy, elect anyone President who says violence is appropriate?\" he asked me. And he thinks that the press has failed to take full stock of Trump's menace. \"It's like you've all become numbed by it.\"\n\nBut he must also prepare for the prospect that this race will get very ugly. When I asked whether he thinks that Trump will concede if he loses in 2024, Biden said no. \"Losers who are losers are never graceful,\" he said. \"I just think that he'll do anything to try to win. If-and when -I win, I think he'll contest it. No matter what the result is.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Joe Biden's Act of Selflessness\n\nIn a life of nearly unimaginable turns, Joe Biden made yet one more. On Sunday afternoon, after weeks of defying calls to withdraw from his bid for a second term as President, he abruptly abandoned his pursuit . He announced his decision in a brief missive that revealed little of the turmoil roiling beneath: \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\" He threw his support to Vice-President Kamala Harris, who quickly issued a statement , announcing her intention to \"earn and win\" the Democratic nomination.\n\nAt the age of eighty-one, after a half century in politics, Biden came to his decision at a moment of acute vulnerability-far from the White House, sick with COVID , at his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Even after days of speculation and increasingly widespread reporting that the President was beginning to come to grips with political reality, many in the White House were stunned. Before he sent out the letter, he convened his senior staff in a Zoom call. The mood was sombre. Biden read the letter word for word. There was no pep talk. \"You could tell he'd been wrestling with it,\" an official on the call told me. Biden had concluded that he would drag down Democrats in an election of grave consequence. \"He said he'd been thinking it over for the past forty-eight hours and continuing to work it, and that was his conclusion, that the strongest way forward was to get out and get behind the Vice-President,\" the official said, acknowledging that it left as many questions as it answered. \"It wasn't a scenario where you could be working a bunch of Plan Bs.\"\n\nMore than three weeks had passed since a disastrous debate performance left an indelible impression of infirmity; then came the assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. Biden's grappling with his decision has been a spectacle of psychological and political complexity that will take its place alongside the other momentous passages of modern Presidential history: Gerald Ford's decision to pardon Richard Nixon; Bill Clinton's embattled Presidency after a sexual affair with an intern; George W. Bush taking office after the Supreme Court awarded him the election over Al Gore.\n\nFor Biden, the decision about whether to stay in the race carried a daunting range of political questions: Would Harris be able to gain the kind of broad-based support that had previously eluded her? Would others in the Party challenge her for the nomination? Would the Party Convention descend into chaos? But it also carried the heavy burden of history. As the weeks dragged on, and influential Democrats deserted him, Biden was risking a grave verdict of history, a creeping reputation for selfish resistance that would forever adorn his life story and overshadow his political career. He had waved off the suggestion that he was risking his place in history. \"I'm not in this for my legacy,\" he told reporters, less than two weeks before he exited the race. \"I'm in this to complete the job I started.\"\n\nAlmost instantly after Biden announced his withdrawal, he was enveloped by praise from members of his party who had been widely understood to be pressing him to step aside. In a statement, the former President Barack Obama, who had shared the White House with him for eight years, and who'd maintained a tense, often competitive relationship with him, said , of Biden, \"Today, we've also been reminded - again - that he's a patriot of the highest order.\" In a sign of the uncertainties ahead, Obama did not add his name to the endorsement of Harris, but expressed \"extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\" Harris's prospects and her conceivable running mates were a subject of immediate, intense debate. Some of the most plausible other contenders for the Democratic nomination, such as Governors Gavin Newsom, of California, and Josh Shapiro, of Pennsylvania, rapidly endorsed Harris, as did Bill and Hillary Clinton. Senator Tammy Baldwin, facing a tight race in Wisconsin, let it be known that she was \"proud to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States.\" On Sunday evening, it remained to be seen how many other Democrats in difficult races would do the same.\n\nBiden's decision to yield to the outcry from senior members of his party was a colossal relief for some Democrats, a bitter defeat for others, and a supreme gamble for all. The Party will have to scramble to fashion a ticket strong enough to beat Trump in less than four months. The practical and political challenges facing the transformed campaign are daunting: How will Democrats introduce their candidates to an electorate that has been told, for more than a year, that Biden's most powerful credential was that he is the only person who has beaten Trump in an election? What will happen to the campaign's structure and leadership? Will the donors who had abandoned Biden coalesce around his chosen successor? Will Harris, who made her name in California and Washington, D.C., be competitive in Midwestern and Sun Belt states? The bitterness among Biden loyalists was unmistakable. Ron Klain , his former chief of staff, wrote, in a social-media post , \"Now that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it's time to end the political fantasy games.\" He urged them to support Harris.\n\nEven amid the immediate political calculations, it was impossible not to reflect on the sheer drama of Biden's about-face this weekend, just as Republicans wrapped their Convention . He has made the rarest of choices in the desiccated, demoralized politics of our time: he has sacrificed his own ambition for the sake of the country. He will have another six months in the Presidency, a period in which he will seek to insure the durability of his record-a thriving economy, a revived NATO , and legislative achievements on climate change, gun control, drug prices, manufacturing, and infrastructure.\n\nIt seems likely that Biden will fall back on a recurring motif in his own long history of endurance. Decades ago, when he confronted the first agony of his life, the car crash that killed his wife and daughter, he landed on a strategy for survival: find a way, any way, to turn his pain into purpose. An aide remembered him once saying, \"I've seen a lot of the worst that life can throw at you, and I'm telling you-you can get through it, but you need to find purpose.\" Initially, that mission was raising his sons, Beau and Hunter, and defying the skeptics who wondered if the blustery young man from Delaware, elected to the Senate at twenty-nine years old, was really bright and capable enough for the job.\n\nIn 1987, having established himself during fifteen years in the Senate, he announced a run for the Presidency, a dream he had nursed since his college days, after John F. Kennedy became the first Irish Catholic President. But that Presidential bid led to humiliation; he was accused of plagiarism, and his insecurities roared to the surface; on the campaign trail, he boasted to a questioner, \"I probably have a much higher I.Q. than you do.\" In 2008, after another bid for the Presidency ended unsuccessfully, he returned to the Senate-and the prospect of a long, dull slide into the doldrums of elder statesmanship. Instead, Obama asked Biden to help him make history as the first Black President, shoring up support especially among white, Rust Belt voters. Biden, initially, resisted the idea of being vice anything, but came to see it as a chance to do more for civil rights than he had achieved as a young man. In 2013, during a visit to Selma, Alabama, where law-enforcement officers had attacked men and women on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, he expressed his regret that he had not played a larger part in the cause: \"It took me forty-eight years to get here. I should've been here.\"\n\nAfter his son Beau died, in 2015, of a brain tumor, Biden once again cast about for purpose. In 2016, he resented that he was discouraged from running for the Presidency. Afterward, he stated his belief that he could have beaten Trump when Hillary Clinton had not. In 2020, he succeeded in driving Trump from office. Now, facing the prospect of Trump's return to the Presidency, Biden has decided that his purpose is not to resist the reality of his limitations; it is to insure the defeat of an aging authoritarian and convicted felon .\n\nIn his letter to the nation, Biden included a short passage on his record. \"We've protected and preserved our Democracy,\" he wrote. In fact, that matter is decidedly unsettled. But, in stepping out of the race, he took one more step to protect the system to which he has devoted his life. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Reckoning of Joe Biden\n\nThere is an immense bounty of bunk about the wisdom of age available to all of us who require it from time to time, but, as the pitiless Mark Twain put it in his autobiography, \"It is sad to go to pieces like this, but we all have to do it.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, it was Joe Biden's turn. But, unlike the rest of us, he went to pieces on CNN, in front of tens of millions of his compatriots. At some level, Biden's supporters were hoping that he would defy the realities of time, the better to puncture the vanities and malevolence of his felonious opponent. And so there was a distinct cruelty to it all, the spectacle of a man of eighty-one, struggling terribly with memory, syntax, nerves, and fragility, his visage slack with the dawning sense that his mind was letting him down and that, as a result, he was letting the country down. It must be said, with fellow-feeling, but it must be said: This was an event that, if unremedied, could bring the country closer to another Trump Presidency and with it a diminishment of liberal democracy.\n\nThe question is: What will Joe Biden do about it?\n\nWe have long known that Biden, no matter what issue you might take with one policy or another, is no longer a fluid or effective communicator of those policies. Asked about his decline, the Biden communications team and his understandably protective surrogates and advisers would deliver responses to journalists that sounded an awful lot like what we all, sooner or later, tell acquaintances when asked about aging parents: they have good days and bad days. Accurate, perhaps, but discreet and stinting in the details. In Biden's case, there certainly were times where he could pull off a decent interview or an even better State of the Union. If he worked a shorter day, well, that was forgivable; if he stumbled up the stairs or shuffled from the limo to the plane, a little neuropathy in the feet was nothing compared to F.D.R. in a wheelchair. The prospect of Donald Trump's return permitted, or demanded, a measure of cognitive dissonance. And wasn't Trump's own rhetorical insanity even worse? To say nothing of thirty-four felony convictions , a set of dangerous policy goals, and an undeniably authoritarian personality?\n\nBut watching Thursday's debate, observing Biden wander into senselessness onstage, was an agonizing experience, and it is bound to obliterate forever all those vague and qualified descriptions from White House insiders about good days and bad days. You watched it, and, on the most basic human level, you could only feel pity for the man and, more, fear for the country.\n\nIn the aftermath, Jill Biden, who had led her husband off the stage, dismissed the night as an aberration, as did Barack Obama, and a cluster of loyalists. He'd had a \"bad debate.\" He was sure to get better, grow more agile. Such loyalty can be excused, at least momentarily. They did what they felt they had to do to fend off an immediate implosion of Biden's campaign, a potentially irreversible cratering of his poll numbers, an evaporation of his fund-raising, and the looming threat of Trump Redux.\n\nBut meanwhile the tide is roaring at Biden's feet. He is increasingly unsteady. It is not just the political class or the commentariat who were unnerved by the debate. Most people with eyes to see were unnerved. At this point, for the Bidens to insist on defying biology , to think that a decent performance at one rally or speech can offset the indelible images of Thursday night, is folly.\n\nBiden has rightly asserted that the voters regard this election not only as a debate about global affairs, the environment, civil rights, women's rights, and other matters of policy but as a referendum on democracy itself. For him to remain the Democratic candidate, the central actor in that referendum, would be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment. It is entirely possible that the debate will not much change the polls; it is entirely possible that Biden could have a much stronger debate in September; it is not impossible to imagine that Trump will find a way to lose. But, at this point, should Biden engage the country in that level of jeopardy? To step aside and unleash the admittedly complicated process of locating and nominating a more robust and promising ticket seems the more rational course and would be an act of patriotism. To refuse to do so, to go on contending that his good days are more plentiful than the bad, to ignore the inevitability of time and aging, doesn't merely risk his legacy-it risks the election and, most important, puts in peril the very issues and principles that Biden has framed as central to his Presidency and essential to the future.\n\nTrump went into the debate with one distinct advantage. No matter how cynical and deceitful he might be, no one expected anything else. His qualities are well known. In contrast, Biden's voters and potential voters might disagree with him on particular issues-on immigration, on the Middle East, you name it-but they are, at minimum, adamant that he not be a figure of concealment or cynicism. To stay in the race would be pure vanity, uncharacteristic of someone whom most have come to view as decent and devoted to public service. To stay in the race, at this post-debate point, would also suggest that it is impossible to imagine a more vital ticket. In fact, Gretchen Whitmer , Raphael Warnock, Josh Shapiro, and Wes Moore are just a few of the office-holders in the Party who could energize Democrats and independents, inspire more younger voters, and beat Trump.\n\nSo much-perhaps too much-now depends on one man, his family, and his very small inner circle coming to a painful and selfless conclusion. And yet Joe Biden always wanted to be thought of as human, vulnerable, someone like you and me. All of us are like him in at least one way. It is sad to go to pieces like this, but we all have to do it. There is no shame in growing old. There is honor in recognizing the hard demands of the moment. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Joe Biden Is Fighting Back-but Not Against Trump, Really\n\nSeveral days ago, Axios reported that President Joe Biden is \"dependably engaged\" in his Presidential duties only between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. , but on Monday he seemed determined to own the morning. At the crack of 9 a.m. , Biden published a public letter to congressional Democrats, arguing that the questions over his fitness -following his performance in the first Presidential debate -had been \"well-aired\" for over a week, but that it was \"time for it to end.\" He had been picked by fourteen million voters in the Democratic primary, he said, and why should their support be thrown aside? Half an hour later, calling in to MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Biden worked to bolster the case that the people were with him, and only weak-kneed insiders were against: \"I'm getting so frustrated by the élites in the Party-'Oh, they know so much more.' Any of these guys that don't think I should run-run against me. Announce for President, challenge me at the convention.\" Of his critics, Biden said, \"They're big names, but I don't care what those big names think.\" (Notwithstanding the fact that Joe Scarborough-Morning Joe himself-has called into question whether Biden should run again.)\n\nThere was something faintly but indelibly Trumpian about this maneuver, in that the presumptive Republican nominee has also fought concerns about his age with displays of machine-gun pugnacity. If you are attacking, voters might intuit, you are probably not actively dying. (In this spirit, the President told donors on Monday afternoon that his plan was \"Attack, attack, attack.\") But Biden was also seizing on something more specific. As much as the political news cycle since the debate has been suffused with concerns about Biden's cogency and his viability as a candidate, only a handful of congresspeople have publicly called for him to withdraw from the race. This past weekend, some of the momentum among Democrats to replace Biden on the ticket seemed to stall, at least temporarily. A meeting that the Virginia senator Mark Warner had reportedly arranged with other senators to sound one another out about Biden alternatives didn't happen; a rumor circulated that leaders of the large and influential Congressional Progressive Caucus would call for Biden to exit the race, but they didn't. No challenger has stepped forward. That has left open a narrow window during which Biden can still claim that it's just the pundits and élites-such as the editorial boards of the New York Times , the Boston Globe, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution ; Thomas Friedman ; and two of three Emanuel brothers-that are against him, as opposed to elected Democrats themselves.\n\nIs this enough for him to hold the nomination? That question will define the summer, and could determine the election. Over the weekend, Biden campaigned in the swing states of Michigan and Pennsylvania; on Sunday morning, he was greeted in Philadelphia by the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, and its two senators, Bob Casey and John Fetterman . \"It was, like, 'Hey, welcome back to the real world,' \" Fetterman told me on Monday. The President, he went on, \"was getting out of the bubble and the beatdown he's getting from places like the New York Times , and Democrats in Pennsylvania are thrilled to be getting their picture taken with you.\" If the past ten years have made the political class amateur polling experts, then the past ten days have turned them into amateur neurologists. Fetterman, who has struggled with health issues of his own, passed along his up-close assessment of Biden: \"His eyes were clear and bright.\"\n\nThe news coverage, Fetterman groused, was slanted against the President: \"It's almost, like, when does journalism become advocacy? It's almost like the New York Times has been behaving like an organ of the Trump campaign.\" What was going on in Washington, the senator said, was a mirrored version of the fight (candidate versus party élites) that had preoccupied Republicans last year: \"Remember, Fox didn't want Trump. They wanted someone else, and everyone thought that DeSantis was that guy, and Trump wrecked his shit.\" Since the debate, Fetterman has distinguished himself as perhaps the President's sharpest-tongued defender. (\"Chill the fuck out,\" he tweeted afterward.) He told me that one error Democrats were making when they looked at public polls that show Biden badly behind was in thinking that Trump was fundamentally weak, and that another candidate would do far better than Biden. Fetterman said, \"This idea that there's some kind of mythical Democrat that would wipe the floor with Trump-it just doesn't exist.\" He said that he loved Kamala Harris , but didn't think that the Vice-President would significantly outperform Biden: \"I want to meet the voter that is, like, 'I won't vote for a Biden-Harris ticket, but I would be enthusiastic about a Harris-Someone Else ticket.' I'm, like, 'Why?' \"\n\nOn \"Morning Joe,\" the President seemed decidedly more energetic, speaking with the forcefulness one would need to effectively take on former President Trump. What he did not do was effectively take on former President Trump. (As the former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau put it , \"Energy is great! Sounds great! Love that part. Message absolutely sucks.\") In Monday's public letter, Biden had argued against Trump's intimations that he might pass a huge tax cut for the wealthy, cut social security and Medicare, and repeal Obamacare-all good campaign issues. But, on \"Morning Joe,\" Biden didn't mention any of that. When he addressed Trump, it was almost in passing: \"This is a guy who-we talk about debates, look at his performance at debates? He lied. . . . I mean, this is a guy who says ten per cent of-ah, I don't want to get into all that. He's just a liar.\" Any Democrat watching must have wanted to pause Biden right there, just as he was skipping past the evidence of Trump's radicalism and mistruths by saying, \"I don't want to get into all that.\" The job of the campaign, and the candidate, is to get into all that.\n\nIn his efforts to demonstrate vigor, is Biden finding his voice or losing his way? Ro Khanna , the progressive California congressman, has served as a surrogate for the Biden campaign, and, when I spoke with him on Monday, he sounded as if he thought that Biden was missing an opportunity to press a more important contrast: that Biden stands, as Khanna sees it, for policies that would improve the well-being of the working class, and that Trump \"wants to continue the Reagan trickle-down economics on steroids. I think that should be the case, and that needs to be the case every day.\" Khanna said, \"If I were advising the President, I'd say, 'Why aren't you out there on \"Morning Joe\" talking about the fact that the communities that have been de-industrialized, they had record economic growth and job creation under your Presidency, and then under Donald Trump they went backwards . . . get passionate about that instead of getting riled up about Democratic donors and pundits.' \"\n\nThe President's limitations, Khanna went on, were obvious enough that it isn't serving him well to insist that he isn't losing by as much as the public polls suggest, or that his capacities are undiminished. Khanna said, \"The President's not very articulate anymore. I mean, that's true! Don't pretend to be something you're not. I think, when George Stephanopoulos asked, 'Are you the same person you were four years ago?,' he should have said, 'Of course not.' \" Khanna went on, \"I think there's got to be a beginning of honesty, and I think vulnerability, and I think that can get people open to hearing the affirmative case. But you can't just look like you're denying what's obvious.\"\n\nOn Monday evening, the Democrats upon whom Biden's electoral viability depends were meeting in various groups, ahead of a meeting of all House Democrats on Tuesday morning. The sense I got, even from those most insistent that Biden must go, was that, if the President had not exactly convinced the critics, he might at least be successfully running out the clock. Earlier that day, the Times reported that a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders, of which Parkinson's disease is one, had visited the White House eight times in eight months, and Biden's press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, refused to answer questions about the reasons for the visits at her daily briefing. That same day, Governor Gretchen Whitmer , of Michigan, often put forward as a potential alternative candidate, said that she would not run even if Biden were to step down. The progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \"Joe Biden is our nominee. He is not leaving this race. He is in this race and I support him.\" Representative Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts, was even more pointed. \"We are losing the plot,\" she said. \"Joe Biden is the nominee.\"\n\nAround dinnertime on Monday, I spoke with the Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton , as he was walking to the House floor for a vote. Last week, he became one of the first elected Democrats to call for Biden to leave the ticket. Moulton told me that the President, in his latest media appearances, had looked \"more vibrant and energetic than he did in the debate,\" but that didn't change Moulton's basic calculation. What he heard most from Democratic colleagues, Moulton said, was a worry that \"it isn't going to get better; it's going to get worse.\" Nearly half of all Democratic voters say that Biden should step aside as the nominee, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday. Moulton said that initially he'd tried to make his case to Party leaders privately for Biden to drop out, but \"that didn't work.\" Going public might not make a difference, either, but Moulton seemed to think that the situation was grave enough to merit such a move on his part. \"This time in 2012, President Obama was doing four events a day-unscripted interviews, town halls, meeting with a ton of constituents,\" he said. \"That's what you need to do to win, and we're not ahead right now. We're behind, we're behind against a convicted criminal. So we need a big change, not a little change.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Donald Trump's Second Term Is Joe Biden's Real Legacy\n\n\"Victory has a hundred fathers,\" John F. Kennedy remarked, after the Bay of Pigs invasion, \"and defeat is an orphan.\" The failure of the Democratic Party to prevent Donald Trump's reëlection is a catastrophe of yet to be known proportions, and Kennedy's remark is a reminder that everyone involved will try to shirk the blame when confronted with the wreckage. Morally, that blame must of course begin with the estimated eighty million people who voted for Trump. They have chosen to return to office a man who has already tried to throw out the votes of their fellow-citizens once, and who would surely have tried to throw them out again if he had lost on Tuesday. Kamala Harris must take a certain amount of responsibility for her truncated, insufficient campaign. But, among Democrats, the blame for Trump's victory overwhelmingly lies with one person: Joe Biden. Indeed, Trump's triumph will be Biden's real Presidential legacy. Little of the rest of what he accomplished is likely to survive another Trump term.\n\nThe single biggest reason this defeat should fall on Biden's shoulders is that his stubbornness in refusing to step aside as the Democratic nominee until July short-circuited the possibility of staging a primary, and left Harris as the only real choice to replace him. Enough has been written about Biden wheezing through campaign appearances before eventually dragging out his farewell for weeks after the calamitous summer debate . But Biden's arrogance remains astonishing to behold: well before 2024, he was quite simply too old to ask people, in good faith, to keep him in office through 2028. He did so anyway, insuring that his age became the biggest political story of the first half of the year. The result depressed Democrats across the country and allowed the Trump campaign to attack its opponent in a manner it hadn't been able to since 2016.\n\nHarris began her campaign with a burst of excitement-she raised almost half a billion dollars in the first month-which suggested that Democratic voters were desperate for any candidate who was not Biden, or perhaps just any candidate born after D Day. As her race against Trump got under way, Harris had some fine moments, such as her debate performance . She evinced an ability to feed off the energy at large, boisterous rallies, and she spoke about the best two issues the Democrats had this cycle-abortion and January 6th-with real passion.\n\nStill, this was far from a perfectly executed campaign, and she was far from an ideal candidate. Her unwillingness, or inability, to give coherent interview answers-which led to her staff keeping her in bubble wrap until the final month-led to some embarrassing moments, such as her strange decision to refuse to distance herself from Biden on \"The View\" and elsewhere. Though the campaign released a series of policy proposals about the \" care economy ,\" Harris never developed an economic vision that registered with a sufficient number of Americans. It's hard to think of a Democratic Presidential campaign in the postwar era that felt more constrained in its messaging, or more reactionary in its focus on the (admittedly myriad) flaws of its opponent. When the subject turned to foreign policy-whether in Ukraine or Gaza-Harris could do little better than mumble platitudes.\n\nImagine, then, Kamala Harris in a contested primary: someone who is not good in interview settings, who has few well-communicated policy ideas (something that appears to matter more these days to Democratic primary voters than to the general electorate), and who is unlikely to be seen as electable because she is tethered to-indeed part of-an unpopular incumbent Administration. Harris would have had certain advantages in terms of name recognition, and perhaps fund-raising, but very little of what we saw during these past few months should make anyone think a primary campaign would have gone better for her than it did in 2020, when she flamed out months before the first primary votes were even cast.\n\nOne could argue that a bruising primary this year might have left the Democrats with a nominee even weaker than Harris. That was always possible, but the Party is relatively stacked with popular swing-state governors and senators, many of whom ran ahead of Harris last night. (Why Harris did not choose one of them as her Vice-Presidential running mate is another question.) At the very least, a non-Harris nominee would likely have been someone without her baggage from the 2020 primary-her brief support for Medicare for All and for looser immigration restrictions were a centerpiece of the Trump campaign's attack ads-and someone who had shown an ability to win an election in a battleground state.\n\nBut the most crucial attribute that another candidate would have had? Not being the sitting Vice-President of the most unpopular Administration since George W. Bush's second term. It's perfectly reasonable to argue that the Democrats' central weakness was having presided over a worldwide inflationary period that has already wounded incumbent political parties of varying ideologies, from the United Kingdom to Japan-in a word, that this was the Republicans' election to win, no matter the candidates. Yet this should have been another reason to pick a nominee with at least some distance from the current Administration.\n\nMeanwhile, the entirely unhelpful role that Biden played after Harris became the nominee, with his fumbles and missteps on the stump, only served to remind people how much they disliked the incumbent. (The most infamous of these was Biden seeming to call Trump supporters \"garbage,\" recalling Hilary Clinton's \"deplorables\" comments from 2016.) We may never know why Harris did not break more fully with Biden, and why, in the course of multiple interviews, she declined to throw him under the metaphorical bus, but given the President's touchiness and self-regard it's possible that at a personal level this was a hard thing for Harris to do. Perhaps this is a point in her favor as a colleague and as a friend, but it certainly hurt her campaign.\n\nMany of Biden's defenders will argue that, however gruesome these months have been-capped off by this week's disaster-he leaves behind a legacy of policy achievements that rivals Lyndon Johnson's and Franklin Roosevelt's. Biden oversaw an economic recovery that was remarkable by international standards, and passed an enormous climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act . He embarked on a new era of antitrust enforcement and closeness to the labor movement, and started the process of bringing important manufacturing sectors back to the United States. He has made numerous strong appointments, from the federal judiciary to the Federal Reserve. And he has helped to keep Ukraine from being fully annexed by Russia.\n\nBut Trump is expected to try to roll back or repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, and to overturn all of the Biden Administration's actions to regulate climate change. There is no reason to think he will have trouble doing so, especially with Republicans confident about holding the House after already capturing the Senate. As for Ukraine, and whether it will even exist in several months or a year, the less said the better. The one area of continuity-other than aspects of China policy, the wisdom of which remains to be seen-is probably going to be with regard to Israel and Gaza, where Biden's policies have been alternately inert and disgraceful. The legacy Biden \"leaves behind,\" then, is now quite likely to be paltry.\n\nPerhaps it's best to judge Biden by the standard he set for himself. Five years ago, he announced that the impetus for his 2020 campaign was to defeat Donald Trump, and all that he represented, which in Biden's mind was (understandably) captured by Trump's handling of the 2017 white-supremacist march in Charlottesville. \"In that moment,\" Biden said, in the video that kicked off his campaign, referencing Trump's infamous \"both sides\" remark, \"I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I'd ever seen in my lifetime.\" He continued by insisting that we were \"in a battle for the soul of this nation,\" and that, if Trump could be kept to only four years in office, history would look back on those years as \"aberrant.\" But, Biden continued, \"if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.\" It's in no small measure thanks to Joe Biden that all we can do now is hope he was wrong. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Proud and Impassioned, Joe Biden Passes the Torch at the D.N.C.\n\nFor years, Joe Biden has told fellow-politicians, with rueful wisdom, \"You're either on the way up or you're on the way down.\" But after making the rarest choice in politics, he fits neither description; he is, for the moment, helping someone else on the way up, and gingerly managing his own way down.\n\nOn Monday night, in Chicago, Biden stepped onto the stage in front of thousands of delegates at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, an event that was to be a coronation for the final election of his life, another race against Donald Trump. Instead, with seventy-eight days to go, he was there to hand off the prize he once coveted, the nomination now about to be bestowed on his Vice-President, Kamala Harris . As a matter of history, it was a scene no living American has ever witnessed. The last President to be denied his party's nomination for reëlection was Chester Arthur-and he left office in 1885. (President Lyndon Johnson withdrew from contention in 1968 long before the convention.)\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nOnstage, Biden insisted that his speech was not a goodbye. \"I've got five months left in my Presidency,\" he said. \"I've got a lot to do.\" But as a personal and political matter it signified the end of Biden's quest, reaching back more than five decades. In 2020, as a candidate, Biden talked of being a \"bridge\" to the next generation. But, by the time he entered the White House, in 2021, he had put aside the idea of relinquishing power any sooner than the Constitution required. \"I intend to run,\" he told an interviewer the following year, \"but it's much too early to make that kind of decision. I'm a great respecter of fate.\"\n\nThe mysteries of fate-the cruelties and gifts and curious turns-have always permeated Biden's life and thoughts. As a young man, he adopted his father's flinty belief that nobody is so lucky as to be spared the worst of life. (Biden has long kept a cartoon near his desk of Hägar the Horrible asking the heavens, \"Why me?\" To which a celestial voice responds, \"Why not?\") For decades, his political and personal fates have been entwined in his imagination. In 2015, while Biden's son Beau was stricken with brain cancer, Barack Obama gently urged him to consider a satisfied retirement instead of another run for President. It \"wasn't that simple for me,\" Biden later wrote, in his memoir, \" Promise Me, Dad ,\" because \"the question of running for president was all tangled up in Beau, and purpose, and hope.\" Giving up on one felt like giving up on another. \"The mere possibility of a presidential campaign, which Beau wanted, gave us purpose and hope-a way to defy the fates,\" he wrote. (Beau died later that year.)\n\nBiden sometimes invoked his father's belief in a kind of \"zero balance\" in the cosmic ledger of good fortune and bad, a tension between the downward pressure of tragedy and the upward thrust of will. Biden savored a line written by his friend John McCain, in a memoir called \" The Restless Wave ,\" published while McCain was succumbing to brain cancer. \"I have lived with a will,\" McCain wrote. \"I served a purpose greater than my own pleasure or advantage.\" Stepping away, in Biden's imagination, was an admission that will power could take him only so far, a defeat when the things he considered most precious-democracy, his contributions to public service, the future of the liberal project-were most at risk.\n\nA mood of giddy, guarded optimism dominated the convention hall. Conversations revolved around how rapidly the Party's prospects seemed to have changed, and the arena echoed with chants of \"U.S.A.!\" At an event on the sidelines, Chauncey McLean, the president of Future Forward, the main outside-spending group backing Harris's Presidential bid, warned against complacency. The group's in-house opinion surveys, McLean said, were \"much less rosy\" than the public polls, and he cautioned that Democrats face very close races in critical states. But McLean left little doubt that the outlook had improved, noting that, before Biden dropped out, the group had concluded that his chance of winning was in the single digits.\n\nFor Biden, the recent, sudden surge of enthusiasm among Democrats has been a barbed blessing; victory now seems far more likely, but there's little doubt how desperate Democrats were for him to step aside. Over and over, the crowd rewarded him with ovations and chants of \"Thank you, Joe!\" In the hours before Biden went on, one speaker after another seemed to be competing for who could praise him most lavishly. The acclaim occasionally bordered on patronizing, and Biden, one suspects, knows it; his nerve endings are especially attuned to the personal gestures and slights of politics. But, most of all, the sentiment was one of relief and gratitude.\n\nThroughout the night, there was plenty of red meat for the faithful. The delegates watched a video of a man named Rich Logis, a former Trump voter, who said, \"I finally stepped outside the MAGA echo chamber. I stopped listening to what Trump said, and looked around with my own eyes.\" He went on, \"I made a grave mistake. But it's never too late to change your mind.\" Another video called \"Two Lies and a Lie\" lampooned Trump as someone who \"talked a big game but actually lost a hundred and seventy-eight thousand manufacturing jobs.\" Joyce Beatty, an Ohio congresswoman, spoke of J. D. Vance , the senator from her state. \"As soon as he could, he ran away to Yale and Silicon Valley,\" she said, \"cozying up with billionaires.\" Hillary Clinton, with a look of relish, said, \"Donald Trump fell asleep at his own trial!\" The crowd erupted in chants of \"Lock him up,\" which Harris makes a point to tamp down at her rallies. But Clinton is not running for anything; smiling, she let the chants continue.\n\nFor much of the night, Biden was a quiet presence in the programming. A video about the Administration's response to the pandemic cut from Trump talking about putting disinfectant in people's bodies to a clip of Harris declaring, \"Help is on the way.\" The schedule called for more than fifty speakers, performers, and videos. By the time Biden appeared, it was long past eleven o'clock on the East Coast.\n\nFrom the earliest moments, his speech shifted the tone in the arena. Introduced by his daughter Ashley, he emerged from backstage wiping tears from his eyes, embraced her, and turned to the crowd, basking for a long moment in chants of gratitude. \"I love you!\" he said. The speech that followed was a valedictory, mapping the arc that he hopes will form the center of his legacy, the story of America passing from a moment of national peril to one of possibility. He conjured the depths of the pandemic, and the horror of January 6th: \"I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed.\" He spoke of legislative gains-on drug prices, climate change, gun control, infrastructure-that will endure beyond the careers of the politicians who achieved them. He repeatedly introduced his Administration's wins with the phrase \"I'm proud\"-a small reminder of how hard it had been for him to walk away. Biden sometimes seemed to slip into the oratory of the address that some piece of him still hoped to give-the acceptance of the nomination!-before catching himself and veering back to celebrate Harris, by adding the phrase \"Kamala and I.\" He spoke only obliquely of the decision not to seek the Presidency again, saying, in a line that contrasts well with the Republican nominee, \"I love the job, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden stumbled, at times, over a word or a phrase. But those slips no longer carried the significance they did a month ago; they no longer left listeners in a white-knuckled panic. He seemed, to borrow a phrase, a bit unburdened by what has been. In a gentle way, the hiccups even served as proof of concept, a reminder that, had the Democrats not changed course, the liabilities of his candidacy would still be there. Now that he'd been removed from the perilous context of the Presidential race, it was possible to see him differently for the first time in years, not as a man struggling to stay at the top but as a man whose career describes a half century of American history-a politician who awoke to politics when Martin Luther King, Jr., was alive, who worked with segregationist senators, and went on to join the ticket of the first Black President. Later, he put the child of biracial parents on his own ticket. In office, they put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, and carried out legislative goals that had been on Democrats' wish list for as long as he had been in politics.\n\nNobody wants to be seen giving a farewell speech until they are truly saying farewell-least of all with five months to go-but this was a chance for Biden to leave Americans with a more dignified impression than the one they had after the debacle on the debate stage in June. As he neared the end of his remarks, it was impossible not to take note of how truly unusual his withdrawal is in a profession that can seem hopelessly hobbled by ego and self-enrichment. It was tempting to wonder how many of his peers might have held on to the end, come what may.\n\nIn this final lap, Biden asked to be remembered as a man who pulled the country from the maw of tragedy-from the perils of COVID , of Trump, of total paralysis in Washington. For a while-a long, nerve-racking while-it seemed that he might mar the end of his career in public service with an unwillingness to accept reality. It won't be clear if he succeeded until the votes are cast in November. Until then, his is an unfinished story-not quite a tragedy, not yet a redemption. But, on this evening, he wound down his speech with a favorite lyric, by Gene Scheer: \"America, I gave my best to you,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was done, Jill Biden stepped out from backstage, followed by Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff. Above their heads, the balloons remained pinned to the ceiling, a reminder that the nominee has yet to speak. Later this week, Harris will deliver a version of the speech that Biden thought he would be giving. But Biden won't be there to see it. He will be, his aides say, on vacation with his family, near Santa Barbara, California, watching the proceedings, like other Americans, on television. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Joe Biden Leaves the Stage\n\nThe painful but essential self-removal of Joe Biden from the race for President-one that he has run so hard and, in many ways, in so distinguished a manner-holds some of the shape of a Shakespearean tragedy. So obvious is the seeming connection that it was already a pregnant comparison before there was even a likelihood, much less a certainty, that Biden would cede the stage. The Times has been full of talk of \"Shakespearean\" falls, its pages touched by leavenings of Julius Caesar and mutterings of King Lear. Indeed, a few weeks ago at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the paper's own Bard-obsessive columnist, Maureen Dowd, asked two eminent Shakespeareans, Stephen Greenblatt and Simon Schama, just whom in the canon Trump and Biden reminded them of. Neither, tellingly, at that moment, had a strong analogue for the President-though, for Trump, Schama chose Dogberry, the clownish sheriff with the incompetent posse, in \" Much Ado About Nothing ,\" albeit a Dogberry with a darker heart.\n\nAn analogue that immediately comes to mind for Biden at this dramatic moment in his and the nation's life is John of Gaunt, in \" Richard II ,\" the deeply patriotic, yet superannuated and out-of-touch grand old man, who, on his deathbed, delivers a matchlessly beautiful speech in praise of the England he has known and of the values he fears are passing. \"This earth, this realm, this England,\" he chants, warning with desperate alarm that his opponents' \"rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last\"-meaning, of course, that he thinks it might. Gaunt resonates because of the depth of Biden's patriotism and the self-evidence, post-debate, of his own superannuation-of the pathos of his devotion to his country and of the increasing impotence of his rhetoric, however deeply felt and however right the warnings that he offered were. Anyone who admires Biden's accomplishments as President-real, far-reaching, and always well intended even when arguably wrong-had to respond with pain to the past few weeks' pitiful, and often infuriating, show of bafflement. What is wrong with you? he kept demanding, in effect. I've kept my promises. I've achieved my ends. I have been a good and honest king! Turn on me and stab me in the back because I lost my way in a duel where one man lied as he breathed-and all anyone talked about was how unsteady was my gait (F.D.R. couldn't walk at all) and how husky was my voice (Reagan's was husky, too) .\n\nBut, of course, it was apparent to all who admired Biden, if not soon enough to the court circle around him, that his fall was irrecoverable. The man we saw in the debate last month on CNN was not simply an aging politician having \"a bad night\"; Biden was lost and wandering on a heath of his own devising, and the attempts by his supporters and his friends to rally around him recalled not so much a character out of Shakespeare as the medieval epic hero El Cid, who is mounted on his horse in the desperate hope that the memory of his courage might still be enough to frighten the enemy.\n\nSo, yes, let us go there: of all the Shakespearean figures whom Biden's fall recalls, it is Lear. Lear in his sense of self-loss; Lear in his inability to understand, at least at first, the nature of his precipitous descent; and, yes, Lear in the wild rage, as people sometimes forget, that he directs at his circumstances. \"Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain / Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters. . . . Then let fall / Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave, / A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.\" This was all too evidently Biden's emotional tone in these past weeks. When he announced to George Stephanopoulos, in an interview meant to recover his position, that he's \"not only campaigning\" but \"running the world,\" the forced grandiosity of the wounded King was all too apparent. (For his daughters, read passim, his onetime supporters, with Nancy Pelosi cast as Goneril, and Barack Obama as an improbable Regan, a double betrayal by those whom he had trusted.)\n\nBut the President stands, or sits, in relation to Lear with this significant addendum. Until his decision to stand aside for a new Democratic Party nominee, Biden seemed to be solving an ancient literary question: What would have happened if the King had not given up the throne? And that answer was plain; it would have been even worse than what happened when he did. Lear, let us recall, begins the play by giving up his office in exchange for the gratification of the praise of his children, all of whom ostentatiously flatter him-except for Cordelia, the only one who genuinely loves him, who fears seeming insincere. The loss of office and the betrayal of his daughters leaves him soon alone and friendless, save for his loyal fool, out in a wild storm.\n\nWith Biden, though, unlike Lear on the heath, raging in the company of only his fool, we were out there on the heath with him, being rained on and blown about, too. The final chapter of the Biden campaign was not pleasant or pretty, with the rage of the President lacking the dignity of age and the instinctive patriotism of service that he had shown for so long, replacing it with sheer frustration and echoes of another, forgotten Joe Biden. That was the Biden whom chroniclers had long seen as profoundly ambitious, easily frustrated, and in his way already unduly embittered by the neglect of the élite for whom so much, including political elevation, seemed so much easier. The Biden whom Richard Ben Cramer portrayed in \" What It Takes ,\" a chronicle of the 1988 Presidential race-awkward, amiable, and angry-seemed uncomfortably reanimated. On a daily basis, we were watching a man who might well have mulishly pushed aside the evidence of his cratering support. For weeks, there was the very real chance of civic catastrophe, with the fierce blaze of riot likely to set the whole country on fire.\n\nToday, Biden, just as Lear does at the end, seems to have made his peace with the necessity of accepting the sheer injustice of his condition and his predicament, while seeking comfort in the saner corners of his life. Now, with the knowledge that he has finally made the right call for the general good, we can look back in sympathy with his personal predicament. It is unjust; he did a good job. The injustice extends to the reality that, while Biden is old and frail, his opponent is, and sounds, old and nuts. To reflect on Trump's speech to the Republican National Convention is to see true madness: a disjointed sequence of grievance, self-reference, and unmoored stream of consciousness, offered in a disturbing flow of disjointed imagery, bleeding ears backing into Hannibal Lecter. The whole sounded less like poor Lear and more like poor Tom, the lunatic on the heath whom the disguised Edgar impersonates. Who gives anything to poor Trump?, the ex-President said, in effect. Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and through ford and whirlipool, o'er bog and quagmire . . . to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Trump's a-cold !\n\nBiden, by comparison, deserves to be ennobled, not ejected. But if there is one theme that runs through Shakespeare it is that the search for justice is almost always doomed, and that the best we can hope for is self-insight and compassion. And so, unjust or not, Biden's act is also essential-the good job he had done was over. He has, unlike Lear, who ends his life in the midst of a civil war, the gratitude of his country, too, or at least that of part of it not already despairing.\n\nThe great lesson of \"King Lear\" is not that it is wise, or unwise, to give up power but that power is always insufficient balm to the human condition. Shakespeare's point is that we should seek comfort neither in empty flattery nor in the exercise of office but in the presence of those who genuinely care for us. Biden has all that which, as poor Macbeth, who has none of it, says, \"should accompany old age, / As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends.\"\n\nBiden has known terrible loss. But he also has the love of his family and the gratitude of so many citizens who thank him not only for his achievements but also for having found wisdom enough at the end. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Joe Biden's Cynical Turn Against the Press\n\nLast weekend, the Biden Administration sent out an e-mail that sounded a touch Trumpian. Addressing the immense scrutiny that the press has placed on the President's cognitive abilities after his disastrous debate , the e-mail, written in Joe Biden 's voice, read, \"I want you to ask yourself, what have these people been right about lately? Seriously. Think about it.\" The e-mail then went on to list what the Biden Administration apparently thinks \"these people\" have got wrong, including Biden's chances in the 2020 primary and the general election, the \" red wave \" that was supposed to materialize during the 2022 midterms, and a host of uphill policy issues, including gun control and climate-change legislation. \"Folks, listen. Forget the pundits,\" the e-mail went on, distancing the Biden Administration from the wrongheaded press and its gallery of pundits, and casting the defenders of democracy as \"me and you,\" which, presumably also means not them.\n\nBiden's move against the press was probably inevitable given the volume of criticism he has received since the debate, the seemingly endless stories that have been filed featuring anonymous aides and allies, and the near-unanimity with which the press has called for him to step down . There's also the problem of the polls , which, despite not showing the dramatic cratering that some had predicted, still have him as a clear underdog to Donald Trump . As I wrote after the debate, if Biden wants to hang on and try to beat Trump, he needs to hope that both the polls and the pundits are wrong. Defiance is his only option at this point, not only with regard to the press but also with the dissenters and grumblers in his own party.\n\nAll of this brings to mind a contradiction that I think about constantly, because it calls into question the value of writing a column, which, for better or worse, is what I do for a living. The media has never been more discussed, dissected, and maligned, but its actual power seems to be on a steep decline. Those of us in the press are currently being blamed both for protecting Biden and for harming him, for not focussing enough on Trump-a charge that comes after nine years of allegedly paying too much attention to him-and whatever else.\n\nBut it's clear to me that the news media doesn't have anywhere near the level of influence that much of this criticism implies. The messaging power that we might have once wielded has been diluted by the proliferation of various social-media platforms and online channels, and by a broader loss of faith in major institutions, including the press. This diminishment of power has been worsened by two decades of real economic instability across the media industry. The reason that so many politicians-not to mention athletes, business leaders, and movie stars-blame the media for everything nowadays, as though journalists can change the course of history and the hearts of every person in the country with a few headlines, is precisely because we can't do any of that. You don't fight the media and call the press a bunch of fake-news losers when the media is strong, and can shape opinion in a meaningful or threatening way. You attack when it's weak.\n\nFor the past nine years, many on the center-left side of the weak news media have tasked themselves with opposing Trump and establishing themselves as the vanguards of democracy. As I've noted several times in the past, this stance, and the fairly partisan moves it has prompted-MSNBC's decision not to air some of Trump's big speeches, for instance, and the glaring absence of pro-Trump opinion journalists on the staffs of major newspapers-reflects a fundamental hubris that journalists know what's best for the country. The problem with this is that all media outlets, regardless of their political valence, sometimes get big things wrong, and the press has occasionally shown an unfortunate tendency to abruptly change course, and to ignore past mistakes.\n\nThis tendency has helped to create a sense of resentment that I don't think is fully captured by opinion polls or surveys about attitudes toward the press. Those numbers are dire-recently, Gallup has shown near-record-low trust in the media. But many people don't only lack trust in what's being reported; they have lost faith in the entire apparatus of the press. This has happened in part because of a seismic shift in the role that traditional news outlets play in our lives. People once relied on newspapers for all sorts of things, and though much of that information-sports scores, movie and TV listings, classifieds-weren't exactly vital, they helped to build a trusting relationship. That's gone, and it's not coming back. Baseball games update by the pitch, politicians make statements on social media, and attention, which used to be meted out by the media, is now under the watch of algorithms . This has effectively shrunk the duties of old-fashioned media and taken away much of its leverage over society.\n\nOn the political beat, the news that does get broken by dedicated reporters tends to be the sorts of scoops that people will only tell reporters anonymously, which is why so many of today's big political stories involve unnamed sources and officials. This makes those stories particularly vulnerable to attack. The past decade or so has seen the rise of a shambolic and democratic but ultimately cloistered form of media criticism that feeds off screenshots of headlines, the pathologizing of reporters, and constant accusations of corruption. The intense scrutiny that the social-media commentariat places upon every headline and paragraph of every story, combined with the shrinking and increasingly compromised leverage that journalists can place upon people in power, has turned the media into a convenient whipping boy for anyone getting bad press. In an emergency, just say some version of \"fake news,\" point out that all the sources are unnamed and therefore probably made up-or, at the very least, feckless and self-interested-and cite the litany of things that the media has got wrong in the past.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Biden has now adopted this tactic, or that many of his supporters, especially on social media, have taken up the call. The attacks on the media's coverage of Biden's age have come even from inside the walls of the Fourth Estate. In response to a Times editorial headlined \"The Democratic Party Must Speak the Plain Truth to the President,\" Jeff Jarvis, a professor of journalism at CUNY , wrote , \"Joe Biden isn't defiant. He's running. I'll tell you who is defiant: The New York Times, which is in denial about the waves of criticism it is receiving for its anti-democratic (lower-case intentional) campaign against Joe Biden.\" In a viral thread on X (formerly Twitter), another journalist, David Roberts, a climate reporter who has amassed a large following on social media, wrote that he was \"overwhelmed by disgust & contempt toward this country's media & commentariat\" and argued that journalists, as a whole, would help to doom any Democratic candidate, whether it was Biden or Kamala Harris , because they had become poisoned by the belief that \"shitting on Dems\" was an easy and professionally approved way to demonstrate their seriousness.\n\nThis line of argument can be traced back to the coverage of Hillary Clinton's e-mail scandal, which both the Clinton campaign and many of its loyalists blame for Trump's victory. The idea is that the unprincipled media will fixate on every tiny negative story about Democrats while ignoring the grave sins of the convicted felon and serial liar on the Republican side of the race. The media is calling on Biden to step down from the ticket after one ninety-minute debate but has never linked arms to shout for Trump to take himself off the ballot. On one level, this critique is ridiculous, of course-it is delusional to think that the news media, which is overwhelmingly staffed by liberals and justifiably ran nine years of harshly critical stories about Trump, has somehow turned into a shadow operative for the Republican Party. But it's true that, after the 2016 election, many of these news outlets positioned themselves as the guardians of democracy, with the clear implication that they were a line of defense against what Trump was doing to the country. We had a dishonest and dangerous President, and the press-with its fact checks and its investigations into Russia, Mar-a-Lago, Trump's businesses, and whatever else-would be his most formidable opponent. Those years were good business for the news media, and it's hard to fault the audience for believing what they were sold. Now Biden and many of his supporters seem to be telling the press, essentially, \"We bought all that defending-democracy stuff, and, now that the enemy has returned, we expect you to be on the front lines with us. We subscribed to your papers and watched your shows. You owe us.\"\n\nIf Biden stays in the race, I am certain he will lean into these attacks on the weak press and will ask his supporters why the media evidently wants Trump to win. This is a disingenuous question-if the press cannot investigate and examine the mental fitness of the President of the United States and offer up alternatives to his candidacy, it might as well not exist-but it fits in with a theory I laid out a few months ago about the ideology of the Internet . Online, everyone, even the most powerful man in the world, eventually tries to identify with \"the people\" in a supposed fight against the \"élites,\" which is really just conspiratorial shorthand for the press and the shadowy powerful figures it supposedly serves. This may very well be the right strategic move for a candidate who will need to ward off leaks and endure close analyses of every video clip he appears in going forward, though it should be said that the Democratic electorate will likely be more resistant to this style of populism than the right. But it's also deeply cynical and erodes confidence in a free press that keeps powerful people in check. If Biden believes he is the last chance for democracy in America, perhaps he should start acting like it. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Joe Biden's Big Month\n\nIn politics, August is sometimes known as the \"silly season,\" when elected leaders and voters alike go on vacation, and trivial stories tend to dominate the news. Not this year, and especially not for Joe Biden . As the seventy-nine-year-old President prepares to give a prime-time speech in Philadelphia, on Thursday, he is arguably enjoying the best month of his Presidency. Since the end of July, he's signed into law three significant pieces of legislation, his party has won a closely fought special election in a bellwether New York State congressional district, and his nemesis Donald Trump has got himself into yet another legal jam -one which prompted Biden to mock him. \"I've declassified everything in the world,\" Biden joked to reporters, as he departed the White House last week. \"I'm President, I can do it.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden travelled to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he promoted his Safer America Plan, which would provide new federal funding to help localities hire an additional hundred thousand police officers nationwide for community policing, and invest in crime-prevention and mental-health strategies. After enduring a terrible twelve months politically, Biden finally has reasons to smile. Between July 21, 2021, and July 21, 2022, according to the FiveThirtyEight poll average, his approval rating plummeted from 52.1 per cent to 37.5 per cent, a drastic slump that led some of his critics to write him off. But, since Biden's over-rall rating reached its nadir, last month, it has risen by five points. On Tuesday afternoon, it stood at 42.4 per cent. To be sure, that's far from great. But, for a President and a Democratic Party preparing for the midterms, the directional shift is an encouraging sign.\n\nAt least three factors explain this partial rebound: inflation has improved somewhat , the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill have finally got their legislative act together, and Trump and the Supreme Court have reminded voters that the likely alternative to Democratic rule is very dark-a message that Biden will certainly seek to amplify in his address on Thursday night. (The White House has said that the theme of his speech will be \"the continued battle for the soul of the nation.\")\n\nIn ranking these factors, inflation should probably be at the top of the list. A recent poll from USA Today /Ipsos confirmed that many voters regard rising prices as the main problem facing the country. Biden's nightmarish twelve months in the polls coincided with a dramatic spike in inflation, especially of energy prices. Since the middle of June, however, the average nationwide cost of gasoline has fallen from more than five dollars a gallon to $3.85, according to A.A.A. And inflation in July was down a bit from the previous month, as well, despite remaining at an extremely elevated level of 8.5 per cent.\n\nBiden isn't responsible for the recent fall in gas prices, just as he wasn't responsible for their rise; the downturn primarily reflects lower-than-expected worldwide demand. But, by ordering large releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, calling for a suspension of the federal gas tax-a call that Congress ignored-and expressing support for the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring down inflation, the President signalled to the American public that he got it. Now he will be anxiously watching what happens to gas prices after Labor Day.\n\nOn the political front, August also gave Democratic voters and activists, many of whom had entered their own deep malaise, something to cheer. A new CBS News poll shows that the percentage of Democrats who strongly approve of Biden's job performance has climbed eight points since July. August began with Senate Democrats passing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 , the package that Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin cobbled together from elements of Biden's Build Back Better plan, which was presumed to be dead. In the days after that breakthrough, Biden signed into law two bipartisan bills: the CHIPS and Science Act, which is designed to encourage the manufacture of semiconductors in the United States, and the \"burn pits\" act, which expands medical benefits for veterans exposed to toxic fumes at military bases. Finally, last week, Biden invoked his executive authority to announce a sweeping student-loan-relief plan, which would cancel up to twenty thousand dollars in debt for some borrowers.\n\nAlthough the individual and relative merits of these policies can be debated, the political message conveyed by this flurry of action is indisputable: the Biden Administration is finally getting more stuff done. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. government will make its largest-ever investment in slowing climate change and use its market heft, through Medicare, to challenge the monopoly-pricing power of the big drug companies. The CHIPS and Science Act is an effort to promote American technological leadership. And, if Biden's student-debt plan survives a legal challenge, which is far from certain, it will establish the principle of sweeping debt writeoffs. Even if the list of accomplishments doesn't quite justify some of the historical comparisons made by Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff , in a recent interview with Politico, it certainly justifies Klain's statement that Biden now has \"a record to take to the American people.\"\n\nAnd a threat to highlight. Last month, I noted that the January 6th hearings hadn't done much to dent Trump's core support . The same is true of the revelations about the highly classified materials that he was hoarding at Mar-a-Lago and refusing to turn over. In the RealClearPolitics poll average, his favorability rating is 40.8 per cent-within the same range it's been hovering at for the past eighteen months. But Trump isn't just a powerful attractor. Virtually all the polling, and the outcome of the 2020 election, indicate that he's an even more powerful repellant, which explains why Biden and the Democrats will be so keen to keep the focus on him between now and Tuesday, November 8th.\n\nLast week, during a campaign speech in Maryland, Biden described \" MAGA Republicans\" as \"a threat to our very democracy.\" It isn't a questionable claim, given how many of them have signed onto Trump's Big Lie, which Trump repeated, yet again, on Monday. We can expect to hear more of this argument on Thursday from Biden, who seems to have rekindled his spirit, and recentered his message, by reaffirming that his historic role is to defeat Trump and Trumpism. When he steps to the dais at Philadelphia's Independence Hall, the calendar will have clicked over into September. He will certainly be hoping for another month like August. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "There Has Been Nothing Like This in American History\n\nIn the end it came as no surprise, but it delivered a shock all the same: Joe Biden issued a letter on Sunday afternoon, declaring that he will not run for reelection .\n\nThere has been nothing like this in American history. Other presidents have decided not to seek a second term, but under very different circumstances.\n\nIn March 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson , at the end of a 40-minute televised address, said, in an unexpected stunner, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\" But LBJ took this step in March, at the start, not the end, of the nominating season. Only one primary had taken place, and Johnson won it. The blow was that his main challenger, Sen. Eugene McCarthy, came in a close second-with 42 percent of the vote, to LBJ's 50 percent.\n\nBut Johnson, though not quite 60 years old, was exhausted by the Vietnam War, the massive protests, and poor health; he'd talked with his wife and with aides about dropping out for some time. He died five years later of a heart attack-his fifth.\n\nIn 1952, Harry Truman decided not to run for a second term. Crushed by a stagnant economy and a stalemate war in Korea, Truman's approval rating had sunk to 22 percent in a Gallup poll at the start of the year. Sen. Estes Kefauver challenged him in the New Hampshire primary that March and won -with 55 percent of the vote, over Truman's 44. (Truman's bowing out opened up the Democratic contest. Sen. Adlai Stevenson won the nomination at a multiballot convention; he was defeated by Gen. Dwight Eisenhower-who had been courted by Truman as a possible Democratic successor-in the general election.)\n\nThe biggest difference between now and these previous two elections is that Biden had the nomination wrapped up. He had won all the primaries, with no serious challenge. The vast majority of delegates set to attend next month's Democratic National Convention were committed to the Biden-Harris slate. He dropped out, reluctantly, after insisting repeatedly that he was staying in the race, because of pressure from party leaders, owing to steadily declining showings in polls, a disapproval rating that had risen to 57 percent , and clear evidence of physical and cognitive decline-beginning with the disastrous debate, which subsequent public appearances, meant to mollify concerns, only intensified.\n\nOther cases of presidential dropouts differ from Biden's case more vastly still.\n\nCalvin Coolidge was very popular when he decided not to run for reelection in 1928. After rising from vice president as a midterm replacement to Warren Harding, who died of a heart attack amid a corruption scandal, Coolidge easily won in 1924. But he decided, even then, not to run again, writing in his autobiography that another term would have put him in the White House for 10 years, longer than anyone else and longer than anyone should spend there. He had also been in a state of depression ever since his son, Calvin Jr., died, not long after the '24 election.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt didn't run for reelection in 1908 because he had already served nearly two terms-as vice president, he replaced William McKinley, who was shot just months into his second term-and he promised the American public that he would not run for what would have been, in effect, a third term.* (The 22 nd Amendment, which barred third terms, wasn't passed until 1951, but George Washington's decision to leave after two terms set a tradition that all presidents until Franklin Roosevelt followed.) Teddy Roosevelt came to regret his restraint, running in 1912 on the independent Bull Moose Party , but, like most third-party candidates, he lost.\n\nRutherford Hayes pledged not to run for a second term in 1880, mainly because he had won his first term amid enormous controversy. The election could not be settled the usual way owing to splits among several states' electors, so it was decided by the House after Hayes agreed to a compromise that pulled federal troops out of the South, thus ending the era of Reconstruction. His term was marked by reforms; some Republicans urged him to run again, but he stuck by his pledge.\n\nJames Buchanan decided not to run for a second term in 1860, mainly because the Democratic Party was splintering over the issue of slavery, the country was on the eve of Civil War, and he had done little but exacerbate the conflicts. (Two other candidates slugged it out at the convention, with Stephen Douglas winning on the 57 th ballot.)\n\nFinally, there is James Polk. He emerged as the Democratic candidate at the deadlocked convention of 1844 by pledging to serve only one term, if elected, so the other aspirants would get another chance in just four years instead of having to wait for eight. He kept his promise.\n\nThe interesting thing about Polk-a thought that Biden might find reassuring on what might be an otherwise frustrating day-is that he was a remarkably successful president. He set out three goals: reduce tariffs, create an independent treasury; take federal control of California and most of the Oregon territory. He accomplished all of them.\n\nPolk was the first president to step down voluntarily after just one term. Yet, as Politico noted a few years ago, his presidency \"left an enduring influence. It's impossible to imagine an alternate reality in which the map of the United States stood frozen in 1844.\" Yet, the article went on, \"at the same time, his territorial conquests led in no small way to the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden's one term will also be seen as consequential. In what way, we have no way yet of knowing.\n\nCorrection, July 23, 2024: This piece originally misstated that McKinley was shot during his first term.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "This Is Joe Biden's George Washington Moment\n\n\"I'm going to say something outrageous,\" Joe Biden said at his first press conference as president in March 2021. \"I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you-if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to-anyway-we're going to get a lot done.\" From that starting point, despite his many successes, there has been a steady pileup of scatterbrained gaffes and mix-ups. He can still function as a human being, sure, but no longer as a president. Now he has COVID (again) and has removed himself from consideration as the Democrats' presidential nominee.\n\nBiden's deterioration has a sense of curdling to it-not just of demise but also of spoil. There's no going back. It is, to borrow his phrase, a big fucking deal .\n\nThe existential crisis of his now-terminated reelection campaign has so afflicted the national psyche that his urgent task ahead is not just to restore his party's confidence and trust, or even to score election victories. He needs to do more. In the national address he plans to give later this week, he needs to remind himself and the American public just how miraculous and sacred the presidency is as an office of service over leadership. He needs to pivot from resigning his position to a rallying cry of civic duty and political purpose. There is even a blueprint for spinning such straw into gold: George Washington's celebrated Farewell Address , when he decided in 1796 that two terms in office were enough, and more importantly, that no president should ever pretend that America depends on their charms or insights or talents.\n\nThat 1796 essay was first read in newspapers, over the intimacy of kitchen tables or in candlelit bedrooms. It was famously reread on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1862, after 1,000 Philadelphians petitioned it as a Civil War salve. It has been read in either the House or Senate-or both- every year since 1888 .\n\nThe essay's endurance is born out of the way Washington transformed his farewell into a reminder of civility, dignity, humility, and polity.\n\nFor all its celebrated splendor and might, Washington's America needed that support; it carried a deeply resonant sense of frailty. The freedoms were hard-won, but so was stability: America's capital city changed eight times before settling on Washington, D.C. Washington also saw America's governing framework of supreme law change from the clumsy Articles of Confederation to the less clumsy Constitution, a do-over with a 235-year track record, but still a do-over capable of being done over itself.\n\nWashington's farewell address captured this precarity by embracing his own vulnerability and inevitable death (incidentally, not unlike Jesus did at the Last Supper). Washington acceded to his \"very fallible judgment\" that kept him \"not unconscious at the outset of the inferiority of [his] qualifications.\" With that selflessness at the core of public service, he wrote: \"I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal.\"\n\nWashington opposed the \"baneful effects\" of party politics and so knew that his farewell had to unite the nation, had to appeal to a consensus shared equally among artists and bankers, farmers and tradesfolk, soldiers and schoolteachers, even pastors and prisoners. \"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism,\" Washington wrote.\n\nBut this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual, and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\n\nOK, founder. But what does it matter to Biden?\n\nIn his address later this week, the president could frame Washington's patriotism as warning against Trumpists' increasingly authoritarian ambitions. The first president stepped away as a warning against \"despots\"; Trump aims to be one, wrapped in the American flag. But that's an easy takeaway. Too easy. The tougher truth Biden should tell is more complicated.\n\nBiden needs to do more than reassure the country that he is out of the running because he is no longer capable of doing the job. He needs to do more than tell us he's stepping aside because the threat of despotism is here, and he is no longer able to stop it. He needs to make Americans believe in democracy again. And that includes accounting for some of his own term, as well as Trump's.\n\nWith Biden as their president-elect, Americans watched their compatriots ravage the Capitol in insurrection and threaten to lynch the vice president. Under Biden, they have seen more of their neighbors die of COVID than under the preceding presidency of Donald Trump, who implored people to inject bleach. They have seen their family's lives, jobs, and classrooms simultaneously upended by a pandemic, from lockdown to the lingering work-from-home limbo. They saw affirmative action and abortion rights overturned. They even feared the apocalypse when the sun briefly was blotted out of sight. Overall, they have watched Trump become a convicted felon and watched Biden himself slowly lose both his mind and, arguably, his soul.\n\nThere has been an ironic Trumpian flair to Biden's downfall: in his golf brags during the presidential debate, his bubble of family cheerleaders and idolizing sycophants, his vain fury that he is not universally recognized as both the world's \" most respected person \" and the only American capable of delivering the White House to the Democrats this fall, and the creeping conservatism of his policies on immigration, oil production, and transgender rights, among others. Sad.\n\nAsked if Biden will drop out of the race, even Trump had the awareness to reply: \"He's got an ego, and he doesn't want to quit.\"\n\nHe overcame that. But Biden also needs to remember that America's power is not born of the caucuses, donors, or swing states that convinced him to go. \"To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a Government for the whole is indispensable,\" Washington wrote. \"No alliances, however strict, between the parts can be an adequate substitute.\" Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, sounded similar in his 2004 debut on the national stage: \"There's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America. ... There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\" Biden himself grazed this sentiment in the letter he posted to social media over the weekend: \"There is nothing America can't do-when we do it together.\" His address this week needs to carry on this message.\n\nIn these divisive times, Biden can remind Americans of the power of connection, solidarity, and unity. He can contextualize his departure with the truth that this election is-as all elections are-not about the power of the candidates or the parties but about the power of the people, with voting as an act of trust and not one of competition or zero-sum games.\n\nConsider the way America realized Civil Rights, voting rights, and even the moon landing to honor JFK's legacy. Biden can use this extraordinary moment of a dream deferred to channel similar national goodwill toward, say, curing cancer, closing Guantanamo Bay, paying slavery reparations, or passing a constitutional amendment for the first time since 1992. He could transform America not by managing it, but by inspiring it.\n\nA page of Washington's humility would help. \"I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors,\" Washington wrote, adding that he hoped that \"the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion.\"\n\nIf Biden wants to clarify the difference between himself and Trump, between what the two presidents stand for, he could do the one thing Trump can't-or won't: He could ask the American public for forgiveness as he relinquishes power.\n\nAmericans already know such intimate prostration in smaller everyday events: between loved ones in the moments before a major surgery, before a wedding, or after a graduation. We know how to center our respect and trust in loved ones. Biden should do that for the country and its people who he loves so dearly, as Washington did. He can restore that everyday instinct to make amends in big moments to political scheming.\n\nHe could ask women for forgiveness that America remains alone in its apathy over mandating paid maternity leave . He could ask forgiveness from American parents for their sudden uptick in infant deaths after Roe v. Wade was overturned. He could ask forgiveness of Black Americans for not rushing to the financial rescue of HBCUs as if they were banks or Ukrainian soldiers. He could apologize to American immigrants for dispatching his vice president to the Mexican border to say \" Do not come .\" He could ask forgiveness of Arab Americans for sending aid to Palestine while also sending weapons to Israel. He could ask Washingtonians and Puerto Ricans for forgiveness over not righting their untenable political purgatories. He could ask forgiveness of children that America led the world in oil production every year he was president despite the climate crisis. And he could ask forgiveness from Trump that he was unable to ban AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles .\n\nWhatever weighs on his heart when he thinks of all the work yet to be done by President Kamala Harris and all who come after her, Biden could use his farewell as Washington did: to make his dying wishes known-everything he wanted even more than another run at the White House.\n\nSpoiler alert: Biden is going to die . Maybe next week (COVID, after all, kills 37.7 percent of octogenarians who are hospitalized for it) or maybe next decade.* Death comes for us all. Not even the leader of the free world can veto it. For what it's worth, Washington died in 1799 of epiglottitus and acute laryngitis. (He literally talked until he was blue in the face.) Thankfully America didn't die with him-with great debt to his Farewell Address. Biden can bring the founders' energy to the 21 st century. Or not. The beauty of America is how it rolls along regardless of circumstance. That's in large part thanks to Washington's farewell. The beauty of Biden's farewell is that it can still be rewritten.\n\nCorrection, July 23, 2024: This piece originally misstated that COVID kills 37.7 percent of octogenarians.

      "text": "The Democratic Party's Double Standard\n\nGreat lives are defined by only a few moments. Woodrow Wilson spent two decades occupying positions of extraordinary power, but his place in history will always belong to the months he spent in Paris negotiating the end of the First World War. More than a million people celebrated Wilson's arrival in the French capital, raining flowers from windows and balconies to exalt his vision of a future in which reason and diplomacy might replace the inanity of imperial war. The photographs of that parade retain their power more than a century later-images of a public and president overcome by their belief in a better world. But these portraits of Wilson the hero persist chiefly for the contrast they provide against subsequent reports of the broken man who labored through the peace conference behind closed doors.\n\n\"If ever the action of a single individual matters, the collapse of the President has been one of the decisive moral events of history,\" the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote after witnessing Wilson's performance in person. It turned out that Wilson \"was not a hero or a prophet\"-merely \"a generously intentioned man,\" one sadly \"lacking that dominating intellectual equipment\" demanded by the world stage, a \"blind and deaf Don Quixote\" easily \"bamboozled\" by more cynical operators.\n\nKeynes did not know the details of Wilson's condition, but historians now generally believe that the president had suffered a series of strokes that would continue to visit him over the months to come, eventually leaving him thoroughly incapacitated. Wilson's wife Edith and his closest advisers desperately concealed his impairment from the public for the remainder of his presidency, though a delusional Wilson still wanted to run for a third term in 1920. That he did not proved an ambiguous mercy. He survived long enough to witness the destruction of everything he had hoped to achieve. The United States rejected the Treaty of Versailles and never joined the League of Nations that Wilson hoped would serve as a peaceful forum to resolve international conflict. The free world's faith in Wilson had been misplaced.\n\nWilson's handlers committed a crime against democracy by hiding his decline, but what President Joe Biden and the leaders of today's Democratic Party are doing is worse. Wilson's mental collapse was confusing to the medical professionals of the day and unprecedented in American politics. Biden's cognitive decline, by contrast, has been slow and predictable, while the consequences of his failure as either candidate or president could not be clearer. Democrats have accurately described Donald Trump as a threat to American democracy and global stability. Gambling on a 2024 candidate who is past his cognitive prime invites chaos into an already violent world.\n\nQuestions about Biden's acuity emerged during the 2020 campaign, and report after report over the past four years has indicated that his age affects his presidential duties. Biden has held fewer press conferences than any president since Ronald Reagan and has become notorious among editors for refusing to be interviewed . But for months, Biden's allies have insisted that the president remains sharp behind the scenes. His press team has raged against critical reporting on his age, while Democratic Party talking heads have been telling the party faithful that such concerns are a big right-wing disinformation plot.\n\nAfter Thursday night's mortifying debate, there can be no question that the White House has been trying to hide Biden's cognitive condition from the public. This was not so much a bad debate as a devastating revelation. Barack Obama had a bad debate against Mitt Romney in 2012, but Democrats didn't seriously doubt his ability to do his job. According to a CBS News poll conducted over the weekend, an astonishing 72 percent of the country does not believe that Biden has \"the mental and cognitive health to serve as president.\" The most demoralized are Democratic Party loyalists -people like Dermot Delude-Dix, a member of the Democratic Committee in South Philadelphia, who told the New York Times the debate was an \"unqualified disaster.\"\n\n\"I feel like his insistence on running for re-election just makes our job, honestly, harder in terms of winning the election, getting out the vote in Philadelphia, and winning Pennsylvania,\" Delude-Dix said.\n\nThese people have a right to feel betrayed, and party leaders shouldn't expect the benefit of the doubt from them on anything else going forward. Who wants to knock on doors or donate their money to people who won't level with them about their own candidate? And Democratic leaders are still not being straight with the public. After the debate, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York), former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California), and Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-South Carolina) all issued public statements supporting Biden, while privately expressing \"concerns about his viability,\" according to NBC News .\n\nFor eight years, Democrats have demanded that Republicans stand up to a leader who is patently unfit for the presidency, calling on the press to denounce Trump's lies and detail his derangement. After Thursday night's debate, it is clear that many of those same Democrats are incapable of applying that very standard to themselves.\n\nThe Biden family itself, meanwhile, appears to have descended into comprehensive delusion. Jill Biden graces the latest cover of Vogue magazine in a $4,990 Ralph Lauren dress , credited with the imperious splash quote \"We will decide our future.\" On Sunday, the Bidens gathered for a glitzy photo shoot with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz at Camp David, where they blamed his bad night on advisers and urged their patriarch to see the campaign through.\n\nGlossy photos and finger-pointing won't win back the political press. The editorial board of the New York Times and what seems like every liberal columnist on its payroll are calling for Biden to drop out of the race . So is the editor of the New Yorker and top names at the Atlantic , the New Republic , and the American Prospect . Trump and Republicans can make do without the mainstream press because the American right subsists on a diet of lies and conspiracy theories. Democratic politicians have to engage their supporters through the reality-based media, where the coverage will get worse, because the facts are genuinely troubling and Biden's defenders have foreclosed generous interpretations of new developments by making everyone feel duped. Axios is already reporting that Biden is only \"dependably engaged\" between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nAt a campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina, over the weekend, Jill Biden celebrated her husband as \"a president with integrity and character.\" But a leader's virtue is defined by their most important decisions. A man who deceives the public and wagers the planet's future in pursuit of personal power is not, in fact, a man of great moral fortitude. Thursday night served as a frightening reminder that Trump is not the only person on earth who cannot be trusted with power.\n\nBiden has been trailing in the presidential polls for months. No sitting president since Harry Truman has polled so badly with such consistency. Biden faced an uphill reelection battle before the debate; almost any candidate would be stronger in its aftermath. Even if he somehow squeaks out a victory in November-what then? Biden's mental state will invite aggression from bad actors and generate confusion at the highest levels of American government. Do the president's words have the force of law after 4 p.m.? Who can be trusted to make what decisions when? Asking the public to vote for a man who cannot, in fact, serve as its leader requires real contempt for democracy.\n\nWoodrow Wilson likely did not recognize the early stages of his impairment and almost certainly could not comprehend the full weight of its consequences. Biden and today's Democratic Party are better situated. They can still salvage his legacy. The images from the debate will not be forgotten, but they do not have to define Biden's life. By leaving the presidential race and passing the torch to the next generation of Democratic leaders, Biden can give democracy a fighting chance. If he continues with his campaign, he will be remembered as a man who was too proud to protect American democracy when it most needed defending, while the enablers in his party will have demonstrated that moral cowardice is a bipartisan American tradition.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It's the State of the Union. Biden Should Consider a Reset.\n\nThis is Totally Normal Quote of the Day , a feature highlighting a statement from the news that exemplifies just how extremely normal everything has become.\n\n\"President Joe Biden's team is increasingly taking extraordinary steps to minimize disruptions from pro-Palestinian protests at his events by making them smaller, withholding their precise locations from the media and the public until he arrives, avoiding college campuses and, in at least one instance, considering hiring a private company to vet attendees.\" -An NBC News report describing the nature of one of Biden's recent campaign pivots .\n\nPresident Joe Biden is about to give his third State of the Union address, and he doesn't seem too concerned about the prospect that it could be his last.* Just look to the crazy-making calm of his inner circle , which seems content to dismiss current polling and bet that the electorate will \"choose normal\" at the ballot box this fall. (Remind me how 2016 turned out , again?)\n\nEveryone else who cares about the state of our union, however, has been especially alarmed as of late.\n\nBiden is still tied with or trailing Donald Trump in the polls, and his overall approval rating remains troublingly low . A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found that a \"majority\" of Biden's 2020 coalition now perceives him as \" too old to lead the country effectively .\" The electorate at large remains largely unaware of the genuinely historic accomplishments Biden has achieved on popular issues like economic recovery, infrastructure protection, climate change, and gun control. Super Tuesday saw more important states for Biden-North Carolina and Minnesota-rack up impressive voting margins for \"uncommitted\" in the Democratic primary, adding tangible numbers to the national disaffection over Biden's stance on the Israel-Hamas war (something that was already expressed quite clearly by a significant share of Michiganders in last week's primary). Israel's indiscriminate bombing of the Gaza Strip has now killed more than 30,000 Palestinian Arabs, the majority of them \"women and children,\" as even Biden's administration officials have admitted -a fact that's inflaming important swaths of the Democratic voting base.\n\nAnd all the while, the Supreme Court is slowing the momentum of Trump's federal trials and allowing him to seriously argue that he could be immune from his many alleged crimes, simply because he was the president while he was doing them. So the current president is losing any advantages there.\n\nBiden clearly needs to make some big changes and repair his broken relationship with much-needed voters. His vice president-who called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza-says so. His congressional allies-from progressives like Ro Khanna to pro-Israel moderates like Haley Stevens-say so. The majority of all voters-Jewish or Muslim, left-wing or centrist-say so. So, is Biden actually shifting his tack to win voters back?\n\nDepends on how you classify the act of hiding from the very constituencies he needs to court!\n\nAccording to an NBC News report published last week, Biden and his campaign team have been so rattled by the ubiquitous presence of pro-Palestine supporters at their rallies that they're all but running for cover. Biden's reelection effort has \"postponed\" plans to hit more college campuses, and is instead keeping rally locations secretive, increasing the prices of fundraising dinners, and \"discussing whether to hire a private company to vet attendees,\" per the network. (Surely a great use of funds as small-dollar donations remain low .)\n\nTo take it from NBC's sources, Biden's new protester-avoiding accommodations \"have resulted in zero disruptions\" over the past few weeks. However, this has also \"meant that Biden is appearing in front of fewer voters and not personally engaging with some of the key constituencies whose support he is struggling to gain, such as young voters.\" Look, Jack: I've never managed a campaign but ... that seems bad!\n\nIt's not just Biden who's facing down Israel protests; even Gaza-sympathetic Dems like Raphael Warnock , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , and Maxwell Frost have tangled with morally outraged constituencies this year. But here's the thing: It's Biden who, more than anyone else, needs to assure the American people that he's 1) physically up to snuff and 2) willing to engage with the critical voters he's been losing. And it has to go beyond mere words: A senior adviser to Biden (anonymously) told NBC News' Mike Memoli last week that \"President Biden shares the goal of many of the folks who voted 'uncommitted,' which is an end to the violence and a just and lasting peace. ... They want a President who listens and delivers. That's Joe Biden.\"\n\nIs it, though? Because it sure as heck sounds like he's not doing much listening on this issue, much less delivering.\n\nSome pundits or Biden aides will point out the fact that older voters turn out more in presidential contests anyway, which is true, and that younger voters are generally a low-turnout bloc , which is also true. But young voters have consistently been an important part of the Democratic coalition over the past few years. As the Democratic polling firm Catalist has measured , Biden's ability to beat Trump where Hillary Clinton couldn't depended a lot on improved youth numbers, with those voters making for 31 percent of the 2020 voting electorate, versus 23 percent in 2016. Biden simply can't afford to cast aside the people who have supported him and are now begging him to take action. So if, per a \"Biden ally\" quoted by NBC News, \"the point is to reach as many voters as you can, and those small events don't,\" then what in the Sam Hill are we doing here?\n\nThe State of the Union offers Biden some ways to turn things around. The already media-shy president needs to take the moment to speak to those voters who, he well knows, are upset with him and pleading for something better . He should harness his famed empathy to show he understands why they are upset, instead of just throwing out stock lines. Biden's reported plan to list out wonky bits of his legislative agenda won't cut it-that's not what the voters are looking for right now. The president can demonstrate, in a substantive way, that he gets it. Or he can continue to duck things and see how that works out for the country.\n\nCorrection, March 8, 2024: This piece originally misstated that Biden was about to give his fourth State of the Union address.

      "text": "Kamala Harris Replacing Joe Biden Is Not Antidemocratic\n\nWith news of President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, some Republicans are claiming he cannot be removed from the presidential ballot in November and that in any case it is undemocratic to do so. The first claim is legally unsupported and the second one is ludicrous. I fully expect the Democrats' legitimate nominees for president and vice president to be listed on the ballot in November.\n\nLet's start with the legal issue. The premise of the argument that Biden cannot be \"removed\" from the ballot is that he's already \"on\" the ballot for president. He's not.\n\nWhen it comes to which candidates are listed on the general election ballot for president, states set their own rules. Typically, the rules provide that after each recognized political party has had its convention or otherwise gone through its process of choosing a nominee, the party must transmit that information to the states by a certain date so that ballots and other election materials can be prepared.\n\nJoe Biden has not yet been nominated to be president even though he had racked up enough delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention to have had an easy time getting the official nomination had he stayed in the race. He was only the presumptive nominee, not the official nominee-nobody is, until there's a vote. So Biden need not be replaced, because he was never the official candidate.\n\nTo the extent that there's even the hint of a legal issue, it's not over whether it's Biden or someone else who is the Democrats' nominee, but about the timing of choosing the official nominee. The key is that nomination happens in time to get the candidate on the ballot in each state. For instance, Ohio originally had a ballot deadline that was before the Democratic National Convention, leading to a risk that no Democratic nominee would be listed on the ballot in that state. Ohio changed its law to a later deadline to accommodate the late convention. As I explained at Election Law Blog, there's a hypertechnical argument that Ohio could still contend that a nomination coming from Democrats after their convention would be too late. This was the purported reason Democrats were going to do an early virtual roll-call vote to choose Biden. (I think the real reason for an early roll call was for partisans to lock Biden in, not to avoid litigation.)\n\nAny litigation to keep Biden off the Ohio ballot would be extremely unlikely to succeed because Ohio has committed to the later date and transmitted that later date to local election officials. Everyone is relying on that and so Ohio would not be able to just change its mind, any more than any other Republican state could try to retroactively change the ballot access rules. Further, courts generally hold that states can't make it too hard for serious candidates to get a place on the ballot, and that rule would easily apply to the eventual Democratic Party nominee.\n\nIn a handful of other states, including Washington state, there is a different ballot access timing issue that could trigger a lawsuit. (The issue is even more technical and has to do with an election administrator's power to extend a legislative deadline in a presidential election.) For this reason, Democrats would be smart to still do that virtual roll call by Aug. 7 if they've coalesced around Vice President Kamala Harris or another candidate. That would avoid even the small risk of a serious lawsuit.\n\nBut even if the DNC holds an open convention and the nomination comes during the convention, I am confident that the Democrats' nominee will be on the ballot in all 50 states, either because legislatures will change the rules to grant ballot access to the Democrats' nominee or courts will require it.\n\nAnd then this brings us to the complaints that there's something antidemocratic about this whole process, that it is somehow overturning the will of the Biden voters in choosing a new nominee. This is a crazy complaint. Until the 1960s, it was not uncommon for party nominees to be chosen by party insiders. We even have the clichéd \"smoke-filled room\" where this used to happen. The undemocratic nature of that process led to the party reform we have today where most delegates are chosen by the people and vote at the convention.\n\nIf Biden wanted to remain in the race and delegates who were chosen for Biden in the primary process decided to vote for someone else, there would be something to this small-d democracy argument; voters wanted Biden and the delegates didn't listen.\n\nBut Biden has withdrawn. He's voluntarily decided he can't go forward. The party has democratic procedures in place for such an eventuality, just as if a candidate dies before being nominated. The whole point of doing a convention is to have a safety valve for something like this. (And I always fear what would happen if a candidate dies after nomination and listing on the ballot, when things could get very dicey.)\n\nDemocrats coming together with a fair vote and choosing another nominee after the leading candidate has withdrawn is an example of the process working, not failing.\n\nIf it's Harris, the democracy argument against choosing someone other than Biden is even weaker, given that Harris is already on the ticket and got voter support in the primaries-with many voters knowing that if something had happened to Biden, Harris was to be the replacement.\n\nThe Republican complaints about the Democrats' replacement of Biden serve two real purposes. First, prior to Sunday, they were bluster to try to deter Democrats from replacing Biden out of fear of having to run against a candidate potentially stronger than him. Second, they are a chance to cast aspersions on the legitimacy of the election and of Democrats themselves. No one should take these complaints seriously.\n\nIt takes a special kind of chutzpah for Trump supporters to say it's a \"coup\" when Democrats conduct a fair and democratic process for replacing a withdrawn candidate. Trumpists could learn a lot about the democratic process in watching what's happening on the other side of the aisle.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The DNC's Thanks for Joe Biden Were Laid on Very Thick. One Wonders if He Minded.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election, Teresa Saavedra Woorman, a Maryland state legislator and a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, got a call from the Biden campaign asking if she was still on board with his candidacy. When the alerts came in 20 minutes later that Biden had dropped out, she thought, \"Whoa, OK. That was quick.\"\n\nNumerous delegates I spoke to Monday, on the first day of the DNC, similarly had their temperature taken in the last weeks of the Biden campaign. Tim Allison, the executive director of a teachers union in California, said it happened \"multiple times.\" Megan Kerr, who serves on the Long Beach City Council, also had gotten \"some calls\" about what her intentions were.\n\nThey all said they would support Biden. These were, after all, Biden delegates that the president had won through the primary process, and their support was pledged to him.\n\n\"I told them straight up,\" Allison said, \"the decision is the president's. He has earned the nomination of the party, and the decision is his. I was elected as a delegate to Joe Biden . So I was with Joe Biden until he said he was no longer in the race.\"\n\nMany delegates remember vividly where they were when Biden said-or rather, submitted a letter announcing-that he was quitting from the race. Kerr was on a bike ride with a group, which they stopped for a few minutes to sit down and check their phones. Cindy Yoe, a Maryland county party chair, heard the news as she was getting on a plane home from Montana, so missed the next several hours of rapid-fire developments. Larry Olsen, the South Dakota state party treasurer-whose camo \"WALZ\" hat earned him a compliment from Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar while we were speaking-said he was \"probably doing some kind of work on the farm.\"\n\nWhile some of them first had panicked thoughts-what's going to happen next? Is there going to be an open convention free-for-all?-Biden's ensuing endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris soon cleared up any confusion. Within the next few days, most state party delegations would officially endorse and then formally vote to nominate Harris to replace Biden atop the ticket. Allison proudly noted that in the California delegation's virtual meeting, he seconded Nancy Pelosi's motion to pledge support to Harris. Once Biden threw his support behind Harris, Biden delegates did too, without a second thought.\n\nIf you think of Harris' delegates, then, as Biden delegates first-people chosen for their roles because of presumed loyalty to Joe Biden-it's almost surprising that there isn't more resentment within the DNC toward the way he was shown the door. I didn't pick up much of it. Yoe, from Maryland, said she \"had a little problem with the ageism thing,\" saying that as she's \"getting older, it hits home a little closer.\" But there wasn't any appetite for Donald Trump's fantasy scenario, in which Biden emerges at the convention wanting to \"take the convention back.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a night for nostalgia,\" Allison told me. \"He's been a strong president who's done remarkable things for the country, and I think he did one last remarkable thing for the country by deciding it was time to hand off the baton.\"\n\n\"Nobody's perfect,\" Olsen, of South Dakota, said. \"But do I think he was a competent leader? Yes. Do I think he got a tremendous amount of things accomplished? Yes. Do I think he could have continued? Yes. But I think he made the right choice for himself, made definitely the right choice for the country. Unselfish sacrifice.\"\n\nSimilar homages were made through the first evening's programming.\n\n\"Thank you, Joe, for your lifetime of service and leadership,\" Hillary Clinton said.\n\n\"President Biden, America is so much better because of you-a true patriot who has always put the people first,\" Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said. \"Thank you, Joe!\"\n\n\"Mr. President, thank you- thank you -for elevating a great leader in Kamala Harris,\" Biden's top ally in the Senate, Chris Coons, said in his speech introducing the Biden family segment of the evening.\n\nI've wondered how well Biden-the candidate on whom the party has just turned out the lights-takes it when it's laid on this thick. It's not like he was left with a much of a choice on the matter by the time he dropped out. The party had abandoned him and had the ability to keep ratcheting the heat up further. And Monday, while speakers were feting him with their deepest thanks for hour after hour, they were also delaying his speaking window until after prime time on the East Coast. But they did so from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nBiden took the stage at 10:26 p.m. Central Time to a minuteslong standing ovation. Every delegate was holding up a \"WE <3 JOE\" sign-notably including a member of the California delegation sitting in the front row, Nancy Pelosi. Members of the Delaware delegation put on aviators.\n\nMost of Biden's speech could've been taken-and likely was-from a draft of a renomination speech. He reiterated the stakes of the race, ran through his legislative record, and made the case against Trump. There were calls to put Harris and Tim Walz in office. But not really much, ultimately about as much as the sum total of the unscripted \"not a joke,\" \"not hyperbole,\" and \"I mean that literally\" asides scattered throughout. After about 50 minutes, speakers and delegates didn't need to thank him. They just needed to let him finish.\n\n\"I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected a 29-year-old United States senator,\" he said toward the end of his speech as it stretched into the one-hour mark.\n\n\"I was too young to be in the Senate,\" he then ad-libbed in a joke, \"and too old to be the president.\" Biden had come out firing in his speech but had been beginning to sag a bit as things went on. But he delivered that joke well. Perhaps because it was no joke at all, and he meant that literally.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Democrats Were Hoping for One of Two Things Thursday Night. Joe Biden Didn't Give Them Either.\n\nPresident Joe Biden did pretty well at his press conference Thursday night, and that may have disappointed a lot of Democrats. They were probably hoping for one of two outcomes: either that he would do badly, making it easier to persuade him to drop out of the race, or that he would knock it out of the park, allaying their concerns, making them believe that maybe he can stay in and win the election after all.\n\nInstead, he did ... fine . Had the catastrophic debate two weeks ago not happened, this press conference would not have made a dent. It might not even have been broadcast in prime time; certainly, the cable news panels wouldn't have spent hours afterward scrutinizing every line.\n\nA little before the press conference, as the three-day NATO summit came to an end, Biden introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"President Putin\" (though he recovered and corrected himself in seconds). During the press conference, he referred to Vice President Harris as \"Vice President Trump.\" A reporter asked him afterward if this didn't prove that he isn't in great cognitive condition.\n\nC'mon. These are the sorts of mental hiccups that everyone lets out now and then. It doesn't necessarily mean squat. But because of the debate, every Biden speech, press conference, debate, or random conversation will be placed under a microscope, every stumble or stutter underlined, blown up to a large-font headline.\n\nThe NATO summit, which Biden hosted and which his press conference was meant to highlight, seemed to go quite well-for the alliance and for Biden. Dozens, even hundreds, of reporters must have canvassed every foreign official, high and low, in attendance to see how they thought Biden came off: Did he have a Parkinson's moment? Did he ever mumble incoherently?\n\nAt least so far, I've seen no reports of any sources shaking their heads or clucking in regret about the American president's declining state. Which isn't to say no such moments occurred, or that Biden is not in decline. It's just that this summit and this press conference-which were touted as pivotal to Biden's political career and to the fate of democracy-moved the story along not one bit.\n\nAnd so the media will wait in suspense for the next pivotal moment. Is it possible Biden will suffer no \"bad nights\" between now and the election? When he has one, what conclusions will be reached? (In the background, I'm right now hearing one cable-news commentator moaning, \"We can't live like this forever.\")\n\nCertainly the news shows are covering nothing else-not even Trump, whose media advisers have shrewdly persuaded him to stay relatively (and uncharacteristically) quiet. As every consultant knows, when your opponent is digging himself into a big hole, make yourself scarce.\n\nStories about the NATO summit itself were seen as secondary to the Biden psychodrama, even though the event was quite successful. The allies reaffirmed their commitment to spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, upped their support for Ukraine, laid out a path for Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO (though not right now).\n\nAt a press gathering earlier in the day, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that at a roundtable of NATO members, each head of state expressed thanks to the United States and to the president personally for making all this progress possible. Biden repeated the point at the press conference. Those leaders were probably sincere. Biden has been largely responsible, and almost every head of state is terrified at the prospect of another term of Trump, who has disdain for alliances in general and has talked about leaving NATO in particular .\n\nThere were substantive questions at the press conference-about the summit, about Ukraine, about the Middle East war-and Biden answered them at length and with deep knowledge. This is his specialization-it has been since he became a senator more than 50 years ago-and it showed. Aside from the two already noted, he committed no gaffes, no stumbles over leaders' names, no errors of fact; it was all clear.\n\nAnd it was in these moments that Biden made his case for staying in the race. A reporter asked at one point about his remark, early on in his term, that he considered himself a \"bridge\"-a one-term transition to younger leadership. What had changed, the reporter asked, meaning: Why are you running again? He replied, \"What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited,\" in economics, foreign policy, and the country.\n\nHe added, \"I'm not in this for my legacy. I'm in this to complete the job.\" The only legitimate question, he insisted, is \"Am I getting the job done? Can you name me someone who's gotten more major legislation passed in three years?\"\n\nBiden seems still to be hoping that this becomes the only serious question among the voters as well. For the moment, for good or ill, he genuinely seems to be staying in the race.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Full Employment Is Joe Biden's True Legacy\n\nJoe Biden restored full employment as the bedrock economic commitment of the Democratic Party. It is a simple legacy of great consequence.\n\nUntil Biden's presidency, American full employment-the economic situation when everyone who wants a job actually has a job-was essentially a historical phenomenon confined to the 30 years between the opening of World War II and the close of the 1960s, with fleeting spells of caveated grace under Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Biden not only presided over a rare level of American economic prosperity; he demonstrated that the ability to secure and share economic abundance is not merely a fortunate confluence of market forces, but a public policy choice made by elected officials-one that American leaders are almost always free to select if they are willing to be creative.\n\nBiden had terrible economic luck, after all. He entered office with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing and spent 12 months rolling out vaccines as the delta and omicron variants claimed hundreds of thousands of lives-all before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent global energy and commodity prices through the roof. And yet after three and a half years, Biden's economic record is not merely good considering the challenges he faced, but one of the best domestic policy showings in decades. Straitlaced economists literally call it a \" holy grail \" economy.\n\nNowhere is this more evident than in the labor market. Across the 50 years preceding Biden's tenure in office, the U.S. economy enjoyed only 25 total months with an unemployment rate below 4 percent. Biden did it for 27 consecutive months-a streak broken only in May of this year, as an expanding labor force pushed the rate over 4 percent even as the economy actually added more jobs. As that statistical quirk suggests, Biden's labor market looks even better when you peek under the hood. Consider the prime-age employment-to-population ratio , which measures the job rate for people between the ages of 25 and 54. Only five presidents have ever breached the 80 percent threshold on PAEPOP for any period of time at all, and among that rarefied set, only Clinton secured a longer spell in the '80s than Biden's 23 months. But the fruits of Biden's boom have been more inclusive than Clinton's. Black unemployment bottomed out at 7 percent during the Roaring Nineties-but it hasn't been that high under Biden since January 2022, falling below 5 percent for the first time on record in April 2023. Similar stories can be told of other demographics frequently excluded from the boom-cycle bounty, with Biden stewarding the lowest-ever unemployment rate for people with disabilities (5 percent, December 2022) and Latinos (3.9 percent, September 2022).\n\nThe strength of Biden's labor market has more than compensated for the household strains produced by pandemic-induced inflation. Wage gains under Biden have outpaced price hikes , particularly among low- and middle-income households, which are earning not only more than they did before the pandemic, but more than economists believe they would be taking home if there had never been a pandemic. Even accounting for inflation, Americans today have more money in the bank than they did in 2019, while wage and income inequality have declined.\n\nBy any historical standard, Biden's economic record is excellent. But his economic legacy may end up being more important. Biden spent a good chunk of 2023 pitching voters on the virtues of \"Bidenomics,\" distilled most cogently by national security adviser Jake Sullivan into a consistent, coherent vision in which the administration broke from recent Washington precedent by expanding the state's set of tools to manage the vicissitudes of the market.\n\nSullivan gives a good speech, but in practice the Biden program has been more art than science. Biden developed his economic agenda piece by piece in response to multiple international crises-political, economic, epidemiological, and environmental-as he attempted to stabilize a fractious party coalition still seething from the 2016 primary. He did so by carefully doling out major policymaking appointments across different Democratic factions and subfactions, and by making enormous amounts of money available to everyone concerned-money unleashed through years of negotiations with Senate Republicans and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nBiden spent a lot of money early in his presidency on direct aid to households, things like $1,400 stimulus checks and an expanded child tax credit. Over time, however, his spending shifted toward corporations that were willing to create the types of jobs Biden wanted-particularly those building roads, bridges, semiconductors, and electric vehicles. Biden's regulatory apparatus, meanwhile, moved to curb corporate abuse and guarantee workers a piece of the action. Lina Khan's Federal Trade Commission has used antitrust law to inaugurate a new era of economic oversight, banning predatory noncompete agreements against workers, cracking down on megamergers, and targeting various outrages from Silicon Valley as violations of privacy and fair play. Biden's National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, has revived union organizing and helped level the playing field between workers and employers.\n\nTaken together, this ideologically polyglot effort added up to something quite effective. Crucially, Biden was not obsessing over dot plots and projections, but making sure he delivered for different constituencies while addressing pressing issues of the day-war and climate change-taking what he could get from Republicans, and improvising when the numbers started looking shaky. Some of this work was of genuinely noble intent, some of it was the gritty, transactional stuff people often deride politicians for doing, and some of it was just quick thinking that happened to work out. His decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the summer of 2022, for instance, may well have saved the midterms for Democrats by helping to bring down gas prices in the months leading up to the election.\n\nSeen in this light, Biden's economic program looks less like a deliberate attempt to move beyond neoliberalism and more like an ongoing commitment to political pragmatism over any particular economic ideology. That it worked is a testament not to Biden's profound economic foresight, but to the limits of economic analysis. Economists often disagree with one another over important issues, which means that on any given question, a lot of them are just wrong. The Federal Reserve, for instance, spent the past two years trying to generate mass layoffs in order to cure inflation. Those layoffs never materialized-economists aren't really sure why-and inflation came down anyway, because the Fed had misdiagnosed its cause. The country had been suffering not from an excess of household wealth, but from a pandemic-induced supply crunch.\n\nIn one sense, Biden was lucky that conventional interest-rate policy failed to produce the layoffs that his own Fed appointee was pursuing. But in another sense, Biden's luck was the product of other good policy choices. By the time the Fed raised interest rates, he had already locked in trillions of dollars in support for the labor market, blunting the potential damage from higher rates.\n\nBiden is fond of saying , \"Don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative.\" He means Donald Trump. But the more appropriate historical comparison is Barack Obama, who also inherited an economy in crisis, and who ultimately delivered much less for both his party and the country than Biden did, despite being a more formidable intellectual and a more charismatic politician.\n\nObama believed deeply in his responsibility to do the \"hard\" things his economic advisers told him to do, things that were often hard precisely because they were unpopular. As Obama argued in his 2020 speech before the Democratic National Convention: \"Democracy was never meant to be transactional-you give me your vote, I make everything better.\" He famously undershot his 2009 stimulus on the advice of his National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers. Obama then compounded this miscalculation by abandoning his campaign promises to aid struggling homeowners and by seeking an Austerian Grand Bargain with House Republicans while unemployment was at 9 percent and middle-class incomes were falling. Only Paul Ryan's maniacal intransigence on behalf of the capital gains class prevented Obama from raising taxes and cutting Social Security during the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n\nWhen he moved into the White House, Biden placed a portrait of his hero Franklin Delano Roosevelt above the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office-an act chiefly of chutzpah. Much of Biden's political legacy will depend on the outcome of this year's election, but even in the most Biden-friendly future currently available, he will not ascend to FDR's lofty standard as savior of global democracy and founder of the American administrative state.\n\nAnd yet there are clear harmonies between the two presidencies. Biden's coalitional savvy, his policy creativity, and his willingness to discard economic orthodoxy in pursuit of pressing public needs are all descendants of FDR's governing style. In a single crisis-ridden term, Biden demonstrated that full employment doesn't have to be an ephemeral holy grail. If Biden could conjure prosperity from the devastation of the pandemic, just imagine what his successor might achieve.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIn an Oval Office speech, Biden said his farewells. But his job isn't done yet.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday night in the culmination of a pivotal few weeks that saw him relinquish the Democratic presidential nomination - an act that may one day be the defining moment of his political career.\n\nThe speech was an attempt to exit political life gracefully, but it also served as a reminder that only days after the president announced his unprecedented decision, the nation has already moved on.\n\nDemocratic delegates quickly consolidated behind Biden's chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, and nearly 90 percent of Democratic voters surveyed said he made the right choice in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS . The media limelight has shifted to Harris, the new presumptive Democratic nominee, and what her presidency would look like . And Democrats have been able to refocus with renewed enthusiasm on their task at hand, which is beating former President Donald Trump.\n\nThat's left Biden suddenly in the role of elder statesman. Under extraordinary circumstances just months before the 2024 election, he's unexpectedly fulfilled his 2020 promise to become a \" bridge \" to the next generation of leadership.\n\n\"I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said in his speech. \"It is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nNow that he's done so, the question arises: What, if anything, is left for an outgoing president to do?\n\nBiden himself insists that his work is not done, and made it clear Wednesday night that he wants to tie up loose ends on policy. For instance, he promised to continue his efforts to protect democracy, at home and abroad. And he's vowed to deliver a ceasefire in Gaza before he leaves office.\n\nBut beyond Biden's legacy - and the needs of the country - there's still a campaign going on. So what role can he play in both?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.\n\nStrategists and pollsters agree: Biden can be useful to Harris on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden clearly thinks so too. On Monday, he said at a campaign event in Delaware via teleconference, \"I'm going to be on the road, and I'm not going anywhere.\" He reiterated his support for Harris Wednesday night: \"She's tough; she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\"\n\nChuck Rocha, a former senior adviser for Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign, said that Biden has an opportunity to help Harris with union members and white working-class voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan - groups that helped power his 2020 victory .\n\nEvan Roth Smith, lead pollster for Blueprint, said that Biden also needs to speak to the voters who have been most loyal to him, even over the course of the last month, and tell them that it's important that they not just turn out to vote for Harris, but knock on doors on her behalf.\n\nFernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster, said that Biden can reassert the successes of his administration as a \"political wind behind the sails of the Kamala campaign,\" emphasizing her role in getting things done.\n\nBut Harris also has the unusual opportunity to get a second chance at a first impression and to define herself outside of being Biden's vice president. Voters don't associate her as much with the issues on which they rated the administration poorly, like inflation and immigration, Roth Smith said.\n\n\"So she has this important opportunity to distance herself a little bit,\" he said. \"It's important to not squander that and not overly tie her to Biden.\"\n\nBiden also risks generating further questions about whether or not he should continue as president until the end of his term if he participates in the kinds of campaign events in which he has proven more likely to commit verbal flubs, Amandi said. Though Amandi added that he believes Biden wouldn't complete his term if the president and his doctors didn't think him capable, Republicans have recently argued that Biden is not fit for office and should step down now .\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure on Biden to get out there, particularly following the debate performance, and do the kinds of events that he was less comfortable doing,\" Roth Smith said. \"He doesn't need to do those kinds of events anymore ... We don't necessarily need him all over the campaign trail.\"\n\nThat's especially the case given that, soon, Harris will have another major surrogate on her team in the form of her vice presidential candidate. Once she chooses a running mate, \"there will literally be three people who can help bring this thing home for November for the Democrats,\" two of which - Harris and her vice presidential pick - can provide \"a fresh-faced contrast to Donald Trump,\" Rocha said.\n\nEssentially, the move for Biden experts say, is for him to help out Harris where he can, but not overexpose himself. Biden seemed to recognize Wednesday that it was time for him to take something of a step back. \"I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,\" he said. \"There is also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. That time and place is now.\"\n\nStrategists and pollsters told me that Biden should focus on being president for the remainder of his time in office, and as he noted in his speech, that's what he intends to do.\n\n\"An important role for the president is to be this statesman, to show that Democrats can govern,\" Roth Smith said.\n\nBeing competent, while finding opportunities to remind voters of the accomplishments of his administration - from the Inflation Reduction Act to the bipartisan infrastructure law - is one of the best ways he can support Harris.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration has a fantastic story to tell,\" Amandi said. \"It was a story that had been undermined by the legitimate concerns about whether or not the president could continue another four years.\"\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that \"Biden's ability to do anything truly substantive is muted\" given that he faces a divided Congress and election season is in full swing. But there are certain things that the president can do unilaterally.\n\nFor one, Americans are depending on his vast foreign policy experience at a tenuous moment for the Middle East and Europe. In his speech, he said he would seek to \"bring peace and security to the Middle East\" and keep rallying a coalition of nations to stop the Russian takeover of Ukraine, bolstering NATO and US allies in the Pacific. All that may not be achievable in five months, but he can work on making visible progress.\n\nBiden may also look for domestic policy wins on issues that had dogged his candidacy, including immigration and inflation, which seems to be improving in time for the Federal Reserve to likely cut interest rates later this year. He can also highlight accomplishments on lesser-known, but still incredibly popular policies such as negotiating decreases in drug prices for Americans on Medicare. On Wednesday, he highlighted proposed Supreme Court reforms and his cancer \"moonshot\" among his priorities.\n\nAnd as the administration makes progress, Biden needs to make sure he is \"sharing the stage,\" Roth Smith said.\n\n\"If there is going to be a great inflation report or a consumer confidence report, [Harris] needs to get credit for that,\" he added.\n\nThat also serves the dual purpose of solidifying Biden's legacy and increasing his approval rating, which Kondik said is also helpful to Harris.\n\n\"I think President Biden will leave office in January with significantly higher approval ratings because the one obstacle to judging him in the context of his success has now been removed, which is the concern that he would seek reelection at an age where his physical limitations wouldn't allow him to continue,\" Amandi said.\n\nThe stakes are still high for Democrats. Biden's remaining time in office has the potential to lay the groundwork for a smooth transition to another Democratic administration that could protect the policies he set in motion.

      "text": "Joe Biden's enormous, contradictory, and fragile climate legacy\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIf elected, Trump could slow down Biden's progress, but the shift to clean energy is unstoppable.\n\nby Umair Irfan\n\nThe day after President Joe Biden said he would not seek reelection , his White House announced more than $4.3 billion in grants from the Environmental Protection Agency to communities to curb climate change, cut pollution, and seek environmental justice.\n\nIt's a big announcement, but easily lost amid the thunderous presidential campaign news.\n\nThe grants will fund projects across the country that include decarbonizing freight, installing geothermal systems, and capturing fugitive methane emissions. According to the EPA, these grantees will cut US greenhouse gas emissions up to 971 million metric tons by 2050. That's equal to the emissions of five million average homes over 25 years.\n\nAmid all the political pandemonium, it's remarkable that the administration is continuing to pump out new environmental initiatives. Climate has consistently been a high priority for the Biden administration, and this announcement proves a genuine commitment. Biden has the distinction of introducing the earliest bill in the Senate to address climate change, the 1986 Global Climate Protection Act . Humanity, though, has more than doubled its greenhouse gas pollution since then. As president, Biden has made dealing with global warming an even higher priority than it was during his last turn in the White House as vice president .\n\nThe United States is the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gasses and is currently second in annual output, behind China and ahead of India. So on the world stage, the US has a significant role, and activists say a responsibility, to nudge the global warming trajectory downward.\n\nWhen he leaves office in January 2025, Biden will be able to credibly claim that he has done more on climate change than any other president and has been one of the most consequential decision-makers in the world for the future of the planet.\n\nBut while he's done the most, it's still not enough to get the US in line with Biden's own climate change goals . Many of Biden's environmental initiatives are still struggling to get rolling, and some activist groups are not satisfied with what he's done.\n\nAnd if Donald Trump wins in November, that progress will stall.\n\nWhen Biden was one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for the top job in 2019, he proposed an extensive climate plan released in two installments that emphasized cutting greenhouse gas emissions by building up a robust US clean energy sector with $2 trillion in investment. He also laid out a legislative strategy and a list of executive actions he would take on his own, such as imposing tough methane leak restrictions on new oil and gas facilities, requiring federal government operations to procure clean energy, and imposing new efficiency regulations on appliances. At the same time, Biden's plan was seen as less ambitious than those of his competitors - Bernie Sanders called for $16.3 trillion in total - and he was criticized for declining to support a ban on fracking and for attending a fundraiser hosted by a natural gas company founder.\n\nBut since taking office in January 2021, Biden has demonstrated that at least part of his plan was realistic: He managed to tick many of the items on his to-do list that are directly under the president's purview or from cabinet agencies.\n\nHe brought the US back into the 2015 Paris climate agreement , personally attended international climate talks , and committed the country to a more ambitious goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions in half from 2005 levels by 2030 while achieving net-zero emissions across the economy by 2050. His administration enacted new fuel economy regulations for cars and trucks to encourage electrification. It set stringent caps on air pollution and carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power plants . It raised efficiency standards for stoves, refrigerators, and shower heads. It set zero-emissions targets for federal buildings, energy suppliers, and vehicle fleets , including placing orders for at least 45,000 electric mail trucks . It vastly expanded federal protections for public lands and established a Civilian Climate Corps to train workers to maintain them.\n\nPerhaps Biden's single most impactful climate action was signing the Kigali Amendment , an international treaty to phase out some of the most powerful greenhouse gasses. On its own, the Kigali Amendment would avert almost 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming by the end of the century. On September 21, 2022, it cleared the Senate with bipartisan support , including 21 Republicans.\n\nWith Congress, Biden signed the trio of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , the CHIPS and Science Act , and the Inflation Reduction Act . While climate change isn't in their names, these laws mobilized billions of dollars in investments in clean energy, infrastructure, battery manufacturing, and building up supply chains. Together, they're some of the largest investments in climate change mitigation in the world. Additionally, they're structured as incentives, with no explicit penalties for carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nGetting these laws passed was a bruising fight. Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act in its final form - with $370 billion for clean energy deployment - was a fraction of the size of the $1.75 trillion version that passed the House in 2021 . The Democrats' narrow majority in the Senate gave holdouts like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin leverage to chip away at its scope while securing more pot sweeteners for his own state. That in turn drew the ire of environmental activists who were anticipating a much more robust law.\n\nMuch of the IRA's costs come in the form of tax breaks rather than new spending. \"The IRA's projected costs to the U.S. federal budget are mostly reductions in taxes owed by U.S. taxpayers or increases in federal payments to those taxpayers,\" according to a Treasury Department analysis .\n\nStill, the IRA remains the largest investment to deal with climate change in US history.\n\nBiden has also had to navigate political rapids over the past four years and has ended up getting turned around on occasion.\n\nFor instance, Biden campaigned on banning new oil and gas development on public lands (on a page since deleted from his website), but in 2022, the Interior Department opened the door to new drilling lease sales . One example is the Willow project in northern Alaska , which the Biden administration greenlit last year, that could extract more than 600 million barrels of oil over 30 years.\n\nFossil fuel projects like this have led to some of Biden's biggest climate contradictions .\n\nOn Biden's watch, the US has become the largest oil and gas producer in history . US exports of natural gas hit a record high, especially after the administration stepped up deliveries to allies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Even though the US is aiming to slash its domestic emissions, the country is on track to double liquid natural gas (LNG) exports by 2030. But Biden also imposed a pause on new liquefied natural gas export terminals pending a review of their environmental and national security bona fides.\n\nWhen desperate to tamp down inflation and smooth over supply chain disruptions stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, the White House tapped the strategic petroleum reserve to help bring gasoline prices down. Biden has bragged about lowering gasoline prices . These lower prices tend to spur more driving, which in turn increases greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAmerica's fossil fuel bounties have put the Biden White House in the awkward position of taking credit for facilitating their production while simultaneously trying to curb their use.\n\nBiden's policies have also created friction within his climate goals.\n\nHis signature legislation, the IRA, has provisions mandating that cleantech companies build their products and supply chains in the US if they want to tap the money in the law. The provision has angered allies in places like Europe that want to sell products like solar panels and efficient appliances to US customers. Biden has also retained many of former President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign goods and is imposing new ones on cheap electric vehicles made in China by companies like BYD, currently vying with Tesla to be the largest pure EV maker in the world .\n\nThis protectionism for US companies raises prices for American buyers and means that the shift to clean energy is more expensive and slower than it needs to be. On the other hand, if cheaper cars and solar panels did enter the US market, they could get more Americans off of coal, oil, and natural gas at a faster pace.\n\nThe question now is whether US climate policies will continue to gain momentum, stall, or reverse. The main hinge point is who wins the next election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, has her own history with tackling climate change as California's attorney general. And with Biden's endorsement, the Venn diagram of their climate policies will have a lot of overlap.\n\nHowever, there are some big obstacles. Few Americans grasp how they can benefit from the programs in the IRA , and the money in the law has been slow to trickle out to build things like EV charging stations . Shortages of specialized labor and permitting issues have delayed big clean energy manufacturing projects . Energy demand is poised to grow as well, driven by population growth and technologies like artificial intelligence , and already fossil fuels are feeding some of that new appetite .\n\nBiden's policies are facing legal setbacks too. Republican state attorneys general are suing the White House to block new fuel efficiency regulations for cars and trucks. The Republican-led Supreme Court has also eroded the federal government's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions , and with the recent reversal of the Chevron doctrine , agencies like the EPA will have much less leeway to craft environmental rules.\n\nIt's also not clear voters will reward the effort. A majority of Americans support addressing climate change and deploying more clean energy , but it ranks as a much lower priority behind issues like crime and inflation . According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication in a survey conducted in April 2024, 37 percent of US voters consider climate change to be \"very important.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Trump, the Republican nominee, is openly disdainful of action on climate change. A key focus of his first turn in office was systematically undoing or blocking environmental regulations and promoting fossil fuels , going as far as removing the words \"climate change\" from government websites . Many of these rollbacks were stalled because they were poorly structured, blocked by courts , or undermined by bad staffing choices .\n\nConservative activists are working to ensure they don't squander another opportunity in the White House to achieve their goals. The Heritage Foundation laid out a strategy for this in Project 2025 , which aims to staff federal agencies with people who will reduce regulations and increase fossil fuel development. Though Trump has sought to distance himself from the plan, many alumni from his administration and campaign personnel were among the authors.\n\nAnd there's always the chance of another shock - a war, a pandemic, a depression - that could take the wind out of the sails of curbing climate change.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, it's increasingly clear that the turn toward cleaner energy is likely to endure. Worldwide, wind and solar are the cheapest sources of new electricity, and in some cases more cost-effective than existing fossil fuel sources. Market forces and climate policies are starting to have an effect, and according to some estimates, the world may be close to reaching peak greenhouse gas emissions , if it hasn't already crossed this line.\n\nEven with so many potential setbacks, some of the big changes Biden set in motion are likely to stick, as the cleaner, more efficient technologies become cheaper and more polluting sources of energy enter their final days. Even if Trump were to retake the White House, it's likely that US emissions will continue to decline , albeit not as quickly as they would under a Democrat.\n\nChanging this course took decades of persistent effort from scientists, engineers, leaders, and activists.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe recent reports about the president's age and health, explained.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nAs President Joe Biden struggles to survive the political crisis that has engulfed his campaign, he's faced two worsening trends in recent days.\n\nFirst, major media outlets have published several new stories raising tough questions about Biden's age and governing capacity. The floodgates for leaks have opened, reporters are intensely scrutinizing the issue, and the president is no longer getting the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSecond, a few Democratic elected officials have finally begun to openly discuss the prospect that Biden could leave the ticket - and some have outright called on him to do so.\n\nThe bulk of the Democratic Party, for now, is still behind Biden, and he maintained Wednesday that he's staying in the race. But anxious deliberations within the party about what to do are continuing, particularly in the wake of new polling showing Donald Trump expanding his lead.\n\nBefore the debate, major media outlets like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal would intermittently report on the question of Biden's age and health, collecting accounts of what the president is like behind closed doors from aides and others who met with him in private.\n\nOften, such reports turned up a mixed picture, finding that Biden sometimes had mix-ups and verbal flubs and sometimes appeared fully up to the job. Always, Democrats responded to these reports with intense criticism.\n\nSince the debate, though, coverage of this issue has risen to a new level of intensity - and leaks have been coming fast and furious.\n\nA brutal New York Times story released Tuesday dug into what the paper called Biden's \"lapses\" - which their sources claimed have recently grown \"more frequent, more pronounced and more worrisome.\"\n\nIn such lapses, the Times reporters' sources claim, Biden would sometimes appear \"listless,\" \"lose the thread of conversations,\" or react with \"blank-stared confusion.\" At other points, they say, Biden would appear \"perfectly on top of his game.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has come under mounting pressure from Democrats to reconsider his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nAxios's Alex Thompson reported that aides believed Biden was \"dependably engaged\" between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm - but that outside those hours, Biden was \"more likely to have verbal miscues and become fatigued.\" (Thompson added that aides \"usually\" see Biden \"engaged,\" and have brushed off \"flashes\" of absent-mindedness as \"ordinary brain farts.\")\n\nLegendary reporter Carl Bernstein said on CNN that, over the past year and a half, \"there have been 15 to 20 occasions\" on which Biden has appeared as unfocused as he was during the debate. He characterized such instances as Biden losing his train of thought and being unable to \"pick it up again.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that some senior European diplomats have said \"they had tracked a noticeable deterioration in the president's faculties in meetings since last summer.\" And the Financial Times reported that, during a meeting between Biden and an EU leader earlier this year, the president began and ended the meeting by telling the same anecdote.\n\nSuch incidents appear juicy when they come from anonymous leaks. But the reality is that many Biden incidents like this have at various points occurred in public and been reported on before .\n\nWhat's changed is that many Biden-sympathetic observers tended to view them as uncharacteristic or unrepresentative. A common reaction was: So what if he mixes up a name or forgets something? It's not putting his governance at risk.\n\nNow, the debate has changed the narrative around incidents like this - reasonably so, given the risks Biden's poor performance there posed to his reelection. What could be waved away as harmless blips now look like a devastating chronic weakness.\n\nThough left-of-center commentators have overwhelmingly called for Biden to step aside after the debate, his support among elected Democratic officials has mostly held up so far.\n\nBut a few cracks in that support started to appear Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nReps. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) and Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) called on Biden to drop out. Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA), who represent conservative districts, both opined that Biden can't win.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Rep. Mike Quigley (D-IL) all said Biden needed to do more to assuage concerns over his performance. Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT) characterized Biden's campaign as being far too dismissive of legitimate concerns.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) was close to disavowing Biden over the weekend, but was talked out of it for now - and reported that former President Barack Obama had privately spoken skeptically of Biden's chances going forward.\n\nReps. James Clyburn (D-SC) and Summer Lee (D-PA) both said they'd support Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee if Biden quit the race. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said that discussions on the best path forward to beat Trump were \"happening very quickly.\" Clyburn also said that there could be a \"mini-primary\" in the weeks leading up to the late-August Democratic convention to determine a replacement for Biden, though he emphasized this was a hypothetical scenario.\n\nInto this swirl of discontent comes a New York Times/Siena poll released Wednesday, showing Biden trailing Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters and by 8 points among registered voters.\n\nBiden has done little to quiet these concerns so far, having avoided unscripted public settings since the debate. But he plans to sit for an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Friday.

      "text": "The best thing that Joe Biden did\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe administration's biggest achievement is something that almost no one has heard about.\n\nby Dylan Matthews\n\nJoe Biden has had a rough go of things. He leaves the presidency with the worst end-of-first-term approval rating of any president since Jimmy Carter ; 55.8 percent of Americans disapprove of his job performance and only 37.1 percent approve, as of Friday.\n\nBiden's legacy will take years to sort out, and I certainly think he made serious mistakes . But one of the greatest triumphs of his presidency has gotten far too little attention, including from journalists like myself. That triumph is the reevaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP).\n\nThe phrase \"reevaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan\" feels like it was concocted by an AI instructed to design the most boring string of words in the English language, but bear with me. This action, taken by Biden's Department of Agriculture in 2021, resulted in a 21 percent increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or \"food stamps\" colloquially) benefits. The safety net program that is most precisely targeted at America's poorest and most vulnerable people got a substantial, ongoing increase.\n\nThat last part is notable, because so much of Biden's presidency was spent on temporary measures, with a spree of short-lived programs unleashed in 2021 to tackle the Covid pandemic and help the economy recover from its aftereffects. The TFP hike stands out because it's still going - indeed, it's meant to be permanent - and it's something that the Biden administration did on its own, in accordance with a law that Congress passed in 2018.\n\nAs a fan of the food stamps program , I think this was an outstanding measure by Biden, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, and USDA nutrition leaders Stacy Dean and Cindy Long. Critics of food stamps , in particular among House Republicans, have long sought to roll back the measure, and it is a possible target for cuts in the Trump years . But whatever you think of the food stamp expansion, it's an important part of Biden's legacy, one that will reverberate longer than a burst of inflation or a temporary stimulus bill.\n\nA shocking amount of US government policy is based on the eating habits of people in the 1950s.\n\nThe best known case of this is the construction of the official poverty measure , the most frequently invoked statistic for measuring the extent of poverty in the US. It was devised in 1963 by Mollie Orshansky , an economist at the Social Security Administration, and based on the US Department of Agriculture's 1962 \"Economy Food Plan.\" That plan was itself based on 1955 data, and meant to determine how much money a family of four would need for food, if they were really pinching pennies.\n\nThe USDA had been putting together plans like this for decades; the 1962 report gives a short history, which goes back to \"pioneer nutrition investigator\" Wilbur Olin Atwater , who worked at the department in the 1890s. The point of the plans was instructional, similar to the food pyramid of more recent decades : to demonstrate for average families how they could purchase food that met their caloric and nutritional needs at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe Economy Food Plan was the result of an attempt to find the cheapest possible diet that could still provide basic nutrition. The report clarifies that this means it assumes households will buy less fruit, vegetables, or meat, and focus on cheap and lasting items like dry beans and potatoes. \"It is essentially for emergency use,\" the report concludes.\n\nOrshansky tripled the cost of this emergency diet to arrive at a level of income below which a family would be in poverty, since families of three more typically spent a third of their income on food at the time. (For all the complaints about grocery inflation , Americans now spend only about 10 percent of their income on food .)\n\nThat was the poverty line, and it has not changed since, with the exception of annual adjustments for inflation, according to the consumer price index. It serves to determine eligibility for programs like Medicaid, health insurance credits, and food stamps, and it's all based on 1950s eating habits.\n\nFor food stamps, though, \"food plans\" take on additional significance. Eligibility is based on the poverty line (which is in turn based on the 1962 Economy Food Plan), but the benefit amount received under SNAP is determined by something called the Thrifty Food Plan, which succeeded the Economy Food Plan starting in 1975 .\n\nThe maximum SNAP benefit for a given family is set as equal to the cost of a diet for a family of that size under the Thrifty Food Plan; benefits are then steadily reduced as the family's income increases. For instance, a four-person household this year has a maximum monthly benefit of $975 , because that is the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan for a family of four. Food stamps assumes that a family can afford to pay 30 percent of their income on food, so a four-person household with $1,000 in monthly earnings would receive $975 minus (30 percent times $1,000) = $675 a month.\n\nWhen the Thrifty Food Plan was first established in 1975, it was set at the same level as the 1962 plan , only adjusted for inflation. It was the same approach used when setting the poverty line. The plan was then updated repeatedly, in 1983, 1999, and 2006, but each time the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan only grew according to inflation.\n\nThis was required: The updates were, as a matter of policy, meant to be cost-neutral. The plans' allocation of the budget between different types of foods changed quite a bit over this period, but the overall cost could not.\n\nThis was inadequate on a number of grounds. For one thing, food price inflation and overall inflation are not the same, and there have been key moments, like the mid-1970s and the aftermath of the pandemic, when food inflation was notably higher than overall inflation . But more importantly, the requirement to not increase prices meant that the Thrifty Food Plan came to involve a diet that assumed families had far more time to cook and meal prep than they actually did, and that they would subsist on bizarre diets that no one actually eats anymore.\n\nMy favorite example is that the 2006 Thrifty Food Plan, to produce a cheap diet that provides adequate protein, suggested that a family of four should eat 40 pounds of low-fat milk and yogurt a week . That's 18.1 kilograms, and since a Chobani cup of yogurt is 150 grams, that implies that the household is eating the equivalent of 120 yogurt cups a week. No one actually eats like this.\n\nThe TFP also assumed that households had 2 hours and 18 minutes free , every day, to prepare food; the actual amount for households on SNAP was more like 50 minutes. As such, the plan prescribed bulk purchases of goods that took time to chop, process, soak, etc., that many households just did not have. It also did not budget for people to buy convenient items that might be slightly more expensive, like canned beans instead of dry ones.\n\nStacy Dean, who served as deputy undersecretary for USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services from 2021 to 2024, explained to me that her team's efforts to reform the Thrifty Food Plan were authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill, passed by a Republican Congress and signed by Donald Trump. Section 4002 of the law stated that the Department of Agriculture should \"by 2022 and at 5-year intervals thereafter ... reevaluate and publish the market baskets of the thrifty food plan based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.\"\n\nThe team was thus instructed that the Thrifty Food Plan had to reflect how people actually ate (\"consumption patterns\") and the foods they actually chose (\"food composition data\"), rather than assuming that poor Americans subsist largely on giant tubs of yogurt, or oatmeal and beans.\n\nThe administration concluded that complying with that instruction meant the total cost of the Thrifty Food Plan could not stay the same. It was not possible to accurately reflect the actual cost of food and not increase the cost of the plan.\n\nYou can see this in the long report the USDA put out in 2021 outlining the changes . (They beat the 2022 deadline by a year.) \"For the first time in more than 45 years, maintaining cost neutrality did not drive the process,\" the report states. \"Instead, the Thrifty Food Plan reevaluation process started first with assessing the foods and beverages that make up a healthy, practical diet, then determining a cost at which they could be purchased by resource-constrained households.\"\n\nDean said that by far the most important factor driving the 21 percent increase in the cost of the plan was that the department had better data on food prices with which to work. \"In the past, they were using people's recollection of what they paid for food. Do you remember what you spent on food last week?\" she asked me. \"You might remember in aggregate, but not for individual items.\" Instead of that survey data, Dean and her team used data directly from retailers that the USDA was already collecting for other purposes. This provided a much more accurate and up-to-date sense of what people were paying for food - which led to a conclusion that food costs were greater than the old Thrifty Food Plan reflected.\n\nDean emphasized to me that the goal was to get an accurate sense of what a thrifty household was actually paying for food, rather than an attempt to change SNAP per se. To that point, USDA has actually been revising downward the Thrifty Food Plan for Hawaii (which, along with Alaska, gets its own estimate separate from the mainland) because it believed the earlier estimate of the plan's cost was too high.\n\nBut the overall effect of the TFP reevaluation was to substantially increase food stamp benefits for the more than 41 million people who use it. While the resulting SNAP program is still quite modest (it went from offering $4.80 per person per day to $6.20 per person per day ), that had significant budgetary implications. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the TFP change would cost $250 billion to $300 billion over 10 years .\n\nWhile the Biden team saw the Thrifty Food Plan update as merely following the law Congress wrote, Republicans unsurprisingly saw the matter differently. Conservative think tanks like the Foundation for Government Accountability made attacking the change a major priority, and Republican members of Congress railed against it in hearings.\n\n\"Some will cynically point to provisions to update the Thrifty Food Plan in the 2018 Farm Bill as the basis for USDA's action, but Congress never agreed to permit a quarter of a trillion-dollar spending increase,\" Sen. John Boozman (R-AZ), the incoming chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, argued in 2023 .\n\nThe 2018 Farm Bill itself expired on September 30, 2023 , and has been continually extended as-is since then by Congress. But that means we're overdue for a new farm bill, and Republicans like House agriculture chair GT Thompson (R-PA) have signaled they want to use the bill to roll back the TFP boost . Donald Trump proposed sweeping cuts to food stamps in each of his budgets as president, and lists of \"spending options\" being circulated by congressional Republicans give reversing the Thrifty Food Plan changes a prominent place, alongside cuts to Medicaid.\n\nAll that suggests that Republicans will probably try to cut food stamps this year. But there's reason to be optimistic they'll fail. Food stamps have always survived based on an unusual coalition between farm-state members of Congress and urban members, where the latter support farm subsidies that don't help their constituents in exchange for food stamps that do, and vice versa.\n\nFarm bills pass through regular order, meaning they need 60 Senate votes, and no Senate Democrat is going to vote for a bill that substantially cuts food stamps. Even if Republicans try to use budget reconciliation to avoid needing 60 Senate votes, their thin House majority means only a few defections would be needed to kill food stamp cuts. There's a reason Trump merely proposed cuts last time, while signing a farm bill that didn't cut the program at all.\n\nIf the Thrifty Food Plan changes endure, they stand as an unambiguously positive part of the legacy of Dean, Vilsack, and Biden himself. It's tempting to view the 2021-2025 period as an interregnum in an era mostly defined by Donald Trump and the ways in which he's reshaped American politics. But interregna can leave lasting marks too. And this could be an immensely positive one.\n\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\n\nHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you - threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.\n\nOur mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDemocrats are taking a leap into the unknown.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nAfter weeks of pressure, conjecture, and handwringing at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, President Joe Biden has decided to step aside from the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe president issued a written statement Sunday afternoon , saying he believes it is in the country's best interest for him to step down, adding that he will address the nation later in the week about his decision. Biden's decision comes after weeks of public and private entreaties from Democrats who have concluded that he is unlikely to defeat former President Donald Trump.\n\nMoments later, Biden released another statement endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to take his spot atop the ticket. Some other leading Democrats - Bill and Hillary Clinton , the Congressional Black Caucus , Sens. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) - quickly endorsed Harris, too, revealing a desire in the party to quickly unite behind her.\n\nSuch endorsements do not make Harris the presidential nominee - the new nominee will be officially chosen by the thousands of delegates attending the Democratic National Convention beginning August 19. But if such endorsements keep piling up, they may deter any other prominent Democrats from challenging Harris and make her nomination all-but-assured.\n\nAlternatively, other Democrats could put their names in contention. What would happen after that is unclear. Some in the party have spoken of a \" blitz primary \" or a truly \" open convention \" where delegates are freed up to support whomever they like. Others view this as chaotic folly. Whether this is at all likely will first depend on whether anyone else jumps in, though.\n\nWhat is clear is that the presidential contest is entering uncharted territory for the modern era. Since the rise of the modern nomination process in the 1970s, no winner of the primaries has quit the race before the convention. And no major-party nominee has entered the race so close to November.\n\nIt's worth pausing to appreciate just what a dramatic turn of events this has been. It was just a few short months ago that President Biden sailed through the primary season with barely any opposition. But now, his party support has collapsed under him to the point where he effectively can't continue his campaign.\n\nPresident Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.\n\nThe catalyst for this collapse was Biden's June 27 debate performance , which will surely now go down as the most catastrophic general election debate in US presidential history. But what the debate actually did was supercharge concerns about Biden's electoral prospects, stamina, health, and capacity that have long simmered below the surface of Democratic politics.\n\nThe doubts about Biden did not begin with the debate, but the debate suddenly made them impossible to ignore - and spurred the party to take action.\n\nWhat will happen next, though, is far from clear. Some Democrats profess to believe that Biden was a uniquely flawed nominee because of his age, and that a different nominee could perform much better against the unpopular Trump . But others are more pessimistic, suspecting that the party faces deeper electoral problems and that any replacement nominee is going to have a very tough road ahead.\n\nAt the start of Biden's first term, many in the political world questioned whether he would run for a second term, for two reasons: One is his age, since he's already the oldest US president ever and would be 82 by Inauguration Day. The other is his bad polling numbers; his job approval has been dismal since late 2021 .\n\nBut Biden doesn't ever appear to have seriously considered not running. He said from the start of his term that he intended to run again, and when Democrats' midterm election performance was better than many expected, it seemed to bolster his case that he could. So he made his reelection campaign official in April 2023 .\n\nAll the party's rising stars opted against launching a risky primary challenge to an incumbent president - doing otherwise would have earned them intense criticism in the party for dividing Democrats and damaging Biden's chances in the general election. So Biden easily fended off challenges from the likes of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) and author Marianne Williamson.\n\nBut doubts remained. Biden skeptics raised eyebrows at his skipping the president's traditional pre-Super Bowl interview, at his reluctance to do press conferences, and at a special counsel report's claims that he seemed to have a poor memory. In February, New York Times columnist (and Vox co-founder) Ezra Klein caused a stir by writing that Democrats should choose a different nominee at the convention, because Biden did not seem up for the rigors of the campaign.\n\nThen, Biden gave a reasonably spirited performance at his State of the Union address in March, temporarily putting those concerns to rest. But it did not improve his polls - by then, he'd consistently trailed Trump nationally and in almost every swing state for months . He looked on track for defeat.\n\nThat's reportedly why Biden's team made the surprising proposal to debate Trump so early, a very unusual move. The hope was that Biden could, with a vigorous performance, reset the race, refocus attention on Trump, and address concerns about his age again.\n\nThe opposite happened: Biden's halting performance put a spotlight on his capacity to campaign (and serve another four years) that never went away.\n\nHe lost the media first. In the hours after the debate, various liberal commentators called on him to quit the race. Mainstream journalists, sensing scandal and a cover-up, intensely focused on reporting out Biden's true condition .\n\nStill, Biden hoped that he could keep the party on board by doing a flurry of interviews and public events, showing the debate was a one-off. Some of these went reasonably well , others less so . But his fundraising plummeted , and the public and private pressure from Democrats urging him to step aside just kept increasing - until Biden finally saw the writing on the wall.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nObviously, much will depend on who the nominee is. Clearly, Vice President Harris is the top contender at the moment. If the party simply falls in line behind her, there may not be much suspense by the time the Democratic convention kicks off on August 19. If there is a serious contest, though, strap in for a roller coaster ride over the next month.\n\nBut there's another big underlying question that we don't yet know the answer to. Namely, how much are Democrats' electoral woes about Joe Biden himself - and how much reflect deeper problems for the party as a whole?\n\nSome argue that Democrats are doing fine, and that it's only Biden that's been the problem; that voters have soured on the president because of his age or perceived incapacity to serve another four years, and because Trump remains flawed and unpopular, and another Democratic nominee would likely beat him. For instance, Democratic Senate incumbents are polling significantly better than Biden. That implies to some that with a different name at the top of the ticket, the party would be in great shape.\n\nOthers argue that Democrats' problems will likely outlast Biden. Unhappiness with inflation under Biden, as well as unfolding foreign tumult , may have convinced voters that Trump wasn't so bad after all. Public opinion on key issues has moved right. And there isn't much polling showing any possible Democratic alternative beating Trump.\n\nSome of these pessimists still believe it was worth pushing out Biden since he had little prospect of turning things around, but they emphasize that any replacement would be the underdog and face a very tough road ahead.\n\nAll we know for sure now is that Democrats have decided to roll the dice, ditching their unpopular nominee in hopes of improving their odds in a contest they were on track to lose.\n\nUpdate, July 21, 3:50 pm: This piece was originally published earlier on July 21 and has been updated to include more information about the Democratic National Convention's options going forward.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAsleep at the wheel? Complicit in a cover-up? The real story is far more complicated - and more interesting.\n\nby Brian Stelter\n\nClueless or complicit.\n\nThat's Ted Cruz's take on the media's coverage of Joe Biden's age and mental acuity, which came under scrutiny after the president publicly unraveled in last week's debate.\n\nOn Monday, the Republican senator from Texas tweeted to me : \"There are only two options: (1) the Dems & their media shills were so clueless that they had no idea that Biden is mentally incompetent, or (2) they KNEW & they deliberately LIED about it. Both are damning. I vote #2.\"\n\nCruz isn't the only one taking aim at the media after the debate.\n\nRight-wing commentators are imagining that news outlets covered up Biden's frailty for years. Some on the left are asserting that the White House press corps should have probed Biden's health more closely, which could have prompted a fuller primary process. Journalists (including the one writing this column) are doing some reassessing of their own, asking if the clearly aging 81-year-old president was given the benefit of the doubt too many times.\n\nBut I'm sorry, Ted Cruz, there are more than two options.\n\nAnd after talking to top reporters on the White House beat, what emerges is a far more nuanced picture.\n\nThe national media wasn't dodging the story: The biggest newspapers in the country published lengthy stories about Biden's mental fitness. The public wasn't in the dark about Biden's age: Most voters (67 percent in a June Gallup poll ) thought he was too old to be president even before the debate. But questions about Biden's fitness for office were not emphasized as much as they should have been.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has come under mounting pressure from Democrats to reconsider his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nThat's the third option: The stories should have been tougher, the volume should have been louder.\n\n\"The hard thing about 'Biden is old' as a story is that it had a dead-end quality to it,\" said Charlotte Alter, senior correspondent for Time magazine. \"Biden is old. We know. So now what? You can't turn back time. You can't make him younger.\"\n\nBut the story is no longer a dead end. Key members of Biden's party, spooked by the debate, are wondering whether he should remain in the race. Some are pushing for him to step aside. One of the correspondents I interviewed, who spoke on condition of anonymity because their employer prohibits outside interviews, said, \"Sources are coming out of the woodwork now.\" Journalists who were previously stymied by uncooperative aides are now probing whether the White House did, to some degree, cover up Biden's condition.\n\nUntil now, the coverage has largely consisted of questions; hopefully soon there will be answers.\n\n\"Some consider it taboo to ask whether a candidate is too old to serve as president. Not the press,\" Politico's acclaimed media critic Jack Shafer wrote in 2019. Shafer's column - titled \"Is Joe Biden Too Old?\" - observed that nearly every major media outlet was zeroing in on the candidate's age, then 76, making \"his state of mental and physical fitness the primary lens through which it views his candidacy.\"\n\nThe scrutiny never really subsided. The New York Times's chief White House correspondent Peter Baker told me that his first Page One story about Biden's age was published in July 2022. \"The age question is catching up to Joe Biden,\" a CNN columnist wrote that same month. \"Biden, turning 80, faces renewed age questions as he weighs reelection,\" the Washington Post wrote in November 2022.\n\nThis was critical coverage. Journalists aren't doctors, and shouldn't pretend to be. But they are observers, and Baker, like others on the Biden beat, reported what he observed over the years. Biden \"often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire,\" Baker wrote in 2022. \"He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.\"\n\nBack then, it was unclear whether Biden would run for a second term. Baker quoted S. Jay Olshansky, a longevity specialist at the University of Illinois Chicago, saying it was fair to ask if Biden would still be fit for office in 2028, when he would be 86 years old. \"You can't sugarcoat aging,\" Olshansky said.\n\nStill, despite the scrutiny, some reporters are looking back and wondering what they could have done differently, particularly after Biden's April 2023 announcement of his reelection bid raised the stakes. \"That's when the coverage should have gotten a lot tougher,\" one of the beat reporters remarked to me.\n\nTo assess the quality of the media's coverage of Biden's age, it helps to understand what made it such a difficult story to begin with. Because it certainly is difficult.\n\n\"It has been a challenge for the media to find the best way to tell this story,\" Baker said. \"It's a hard topic, right? It's subjective. It depends in part on people in the room with him telling you in a candid way what they see. And it's certainly true that this White House is not a particularly transparent White House.\"\n\nBaker's sentiment on the White House is widely shared. In conversations about this topic with a dozen White House correspondents and other Washington reporters, I heard harsh criticism of the Biden administration for \"gaslighting\" and \"bullying\" people who pursued stories about the president's health - and praise for the journalists who did so anyway.\n\n\"They really hate us over these stories,\" Baker said. The administration's \"pushback is pretty strong and their resentment of the coverage is pretty deep, to the point that they've complained to our editors.\"\n\nBiden's press aides were inordinately sensitive, you might say defensive, about the topic. \"When reporters raise age questions, they lose their minds,\" one reporter said. \"They go ballistic,\" a second reporter said. \"Every time you write about Biden's age, they gaslight you and tell you that you'll be responsible for the downfall of the American republic,\" a third reporter said, exaggerating just a touch.\n\nThe Atlantic's Mark Leibovich penned a column in June 2022 saying that Biden was \"too old for the next election.\" In a February 2023 follow-up , he quipped that \"the White House did not like that story.\"\n\nSome left-leaning readers didn't like it, either.\n\nIn my talks with reporters, I also heard complaints about how stories on Biden's age were received. Many Trump supporters treated it as a given that Biden was senile, and any report that didn't outright agree was seen as part of the alleged media cover-up.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden supporters accused journalists of abetting Trump by \"both-sidesing\" an election that features an aspiring authoritarian who tried to steal the last presidential election.\n\nProminent journalists who were outspoken about voters' age concerns, like New York Times podcasters Ezra Klein and Astead Herndon, were pummeled by partisans in social media comment threads. (\"Americans have said consistently that they wanted someone else to be the nominee,\" Herndon pointed out again on CNN after the debate last week .)\n\nThe tensions are still palpable this week: Every time I appear on CNN (my old home) or the BBC to discuss the Democratic Party's post-debate state of crisis, I get messages from liberal viewers who believe I'm helping hand the election to Trump. The former president looms over every story and TV segment about Biden, and some Washington reporters have privately griped that Biden got a bit of a free pass because Trump was so aberrant and so dishonest.\n\nBut the White House reporters I know weren't slacking off or going soft on Biden because they wanted to help the Democratic Party defeat Trump. That's just Infowars-style conspiracy thinking. Reporters live for scoops, and a scoop about Biden being debilitated would be a blockbuster. It's just not that simple.\n\nWitness the Wall Street Journal's prescient story in early June - \"Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping\" - which was widely criticized for leaning too heavily on Republican sources with partisan agendas. The Biden press shop went into attack mode and the Journal reporters felt rather lonely as media commentators derided the story.\n\nThe reality was that the Journal had lots of solid reporting, but too many people gave the Biden White House the benefit of the doubt. I was part of the problem; I appeared on MSNBC and said that Biden's age could decide the election \"if the media obsesses over it and ignores Trump's faults.\"\n\nBiden's fitness for office merited more \"obsessing.\" His relative lack of in-depth interviews and news conferences was, in hindsight, a tell. His decision to turn down a prime spot on CBS on Super Bowl Sunday, bucking with presidential tradition, probably should have been scrutinized even more emphatically.\n\nThe awkward reality is that there are \"two Joe Bidens,\" as Baker and several New York Times colleagues put it in a Page One piece about \"America's oldest president\" in June 2023.\n\nTo borrow a meme, that article has aged well. The notion of Biden having good days and bad days has become conventional wisdom. Perhaps the debate was his worst day yet - although reporters don't have enough access to Biden to confidently say so.\n\n\"That was the worst I've ever seen him,\" one White House correspondent told me afterward, a sentiment affirmed by three other Biden beat reporters.\n\nOn the other hand, down-the-middle media outlets may not have placed enough significance on the string of embarrassing video clips and other episodes. Several reporters told me that, in retrospect, apparent signs of Biden's advancing age were treated as one-offs when they might have been something more. \"Did we miss some chances to connect some dots? I think that's a fair question,\" a veteran correspondent told me.\n\nOn one memorable occasion, in September 2022, Biden scanned a crowd and looked for Rep. Jackie Walorski, Republican of Indiana, asking , \"Jackie, are you here? Where's Jackie?\" Walorski had been killed in a car crash the previous month.\n\nOne \"senior moment\" after another led to frequent corrections of White House transcripts and thorough fact-checks by news outlets. I was particularly galled when Biden said, in remarks to service members and first responders on the anniversary of September 11, that he remembered \"standing there the next day\" and looking at Ground Zero. He didn't visit the site until nine days after the attack. I wish I had made more of that. At the time, I chalked it up to Biden being Biden.\n\nThat's also how the White House tried to minimize special counsel Robert K. Hur's embarrassing assessment of Biden as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" When Biden delivered an angry rebuttal to Hur's report, he mixed up the presidents of Egypt and Mexico - yet another one of those dots that could have been connected more assertively. Several beat reporters told me they thought the White House largely succeeded in framing Hur as a Republican smear artist.\n\nIf Biden had a \"bad day\" with Hur, he also had lots of \"good days,\" and members of the media dutifully described those, in quotes that have come under newfound scrutiny. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a personal friend of Biden's, said in March that he'd recently \"spent a couple of hours with Joe Biden\" and found him to be \"better than he's ever been intellectually.\"\n\nAnti-Biden media outlets have ridiculed Scarborough for praising Biden's intellect, but the assessment is entirely in line with the experience many people have with elderly relatives: sharp one day, slow the next day.\n\nSimilarly, Biden biographer Evan Osnos wrote in the New Yorker that when he last interviewed Biden, in January, \"his mind seemed unchanged. He never bungled a name or a date.\"\n\nImmediately after the debate, Osnos said Biden was clearly diminished. He told me, of the article he published in March, \"The piece was about Biden's defiant belief that he could and should win. His job was to persuade Americans to agree with him, and that has failed.\"\n\nUntil the debate, Biden's highest-profile television appearance of the year was his State of the Union address in March. He won high marks for a commanding, even feisty speech; he was so high-energy that Fox types claimed he was \"jacked up\" on stimulants or illicit substances. But he was using a teleprompter and speaking in front of a crowd, two features that last week's CNN debate lacked.\n\nThe triumphant nature of Biden's State of the Union address enabled White House aides, and Biden-friendly media outlets, to dismiss his mental misfires and physical deterioration. For a long time, \"they did an incredibly effective job of bubble wrapping him,\" a DC anchor told me. It worked, sometimes, with some audiences.\n\nIt's not working anymore. The bubble wrap is off.\n\nI know many readers would love an easy answer here, and I know many pundits are eager to provide one. But it's just not that simple.\n\nFor starters, there's no such thing as \"the media\" anymore. We live in a time of such complete and utter mass-media fragmentation that we each live in a media bubble of our own making. In mine, Biden might be a wise leader who is making America sane again after four years of Trump insanity; in yours, he might be a doddering old fool or a victim of \"elder abuse,\" as Fox hosts are now openly saying.\n\nAnd even if you narrow the media-criticism conversation down to a handful of high-profile, down-the-middle national outlets, the record of how effectively Biden's health was covered is complicated, just as aging is a complicated process. Baker, who co-bylined a new story on Tuesday titled \"Biden's Lapses Are Said to Be Increasingly Common and Worrisome,\" told me, \"It's very likely that things have progressed in recent weeks and months that make this a more acute story now.\"\n\nThroughout Biden's years in office, reporters sought to avoid ageist stereotypes and respect the fact that Biden has a history of stuttering while also reporting on what they were observing. They also weighed his verbal gaffes and viral video blunders against his political victories. Baker and several other reporters wrote in the June 2023 \"America's Oldest President\" story that Biden was, in truth, \"somewhere between the partisan cartoon of an addled and easily manipulated fogy promoted by Republicans and the image spread by his staff of a president in aviator shades commanding the world stage and governing with vigor.\"\n\nSo, about those Republicans. Fox News stars have been taking a victory lap this week, having spent years and countless segments portraying Biden as incompetent and incapacitated. They feel like they deserve credit for being early to the story that's now consuming Washington.\n\nBut Fox supplied precious little actual reporting on the subject of Biden's health. Instead, hosts like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham queued up video clips of Biden looking helpless and played those clips on a loop, devoid of any context or balance. When Biden would deliver a forceful speech, as on State of the Union night, Fox's commentators seemed caught off guard.\n\nConsider the recent controversies over so-called \"cheapfake\" videos of Biden. He really has, at times, appeared to wander off and freeze up in front of cameras. But some of the videos hyped by Biden critics were misleading, even maliciously so.\n\nPro-Trump media outlets took a clip of Biden pausing before sitting down in a chair and claimed that there was no chair there at all. Online meme makers imagined that he was defecating during a D-Day ceremony.\n\nThose types of lies caused at least a little bit of hesitation among good-faith reporters. As one said to me, \"I didn't want to feed into a bad-faith caricature.\"\n\nBut the answer to bad-faith attacks can't be a supine press, and journalists have a chance now to prove they're up to the task of reporting this story. The public deserves to know more about Biden's health, and it is owed more insight into how the president is functioning in the White House.\n\nWe live in the era of a gerontocracy. Were Trump to win, he'd be 82 at the end of his second term - older than Biden is now. \"The Biden-is-old story is a small piece of a bigger story, which is that our entire government is really old, across all branches,\" said Alter, who wrote the 2020 book The Ones We've Been Waiting For: How a New Generation of Leaders Will Transform America .\n\nThat new generation is still waiting for its turn. So questions of age will come up over and over again. Reporters who push past hostile press offices and recalcitrant readers to get to the facts will have met the moment - and delivered to the public what it deserves.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe party was (belatedly) trying to listen to voters.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nNot long after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside from the presidential race Sunday, pro-Trump social media influencers had settled on one line of attack: that Democrats had carried out a coup against their own president.\n\nBiden \"has now been deposed in a coup,\" Trump-backing venture capitalist David Sacks wrote . \"Undermining Democracy should never be condoned,\" Trump ally Richard Grenell posted. \"The coup is complete,\" wrote Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ).\n\n\"What you just witnessed is proof positive that when the most powerful Democrat institutions and oligarchs unite to topple an American regime, they expect to succeed,\" conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote .\n\nFrom people who support Donald Trump, the man who tried to steal the 2020 election, this is obviously a ridiculous and absurd thing to say. Yet it echoes a self-interested argument made by Biden himself just two weeks ago, when he argued that him dropping out would be tantamount to ignoring democracy.\n\n\"The voters - and the voters alone - decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,\" Biden wrote in a July 8 letter . \"Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned.\"\n\nWhat's unfolded in the two weeks since has been a steadily intensifying pressure campaign from various members of the press, pundits, donors, and current and former elected officials aimed at making Biden quit. Some of these entreaties were made in private - and, when Biden didn't appear to be listening, more spilled out into public view. They argued that he couldn't win and, eventually, he listened.\n\nThere may arguably be something a bit uncomfortable about the role of Democratic power brokers and donors in pushing Biden aside after his primary win. But while they're doing this without voters' explicit say, they're doing so in an attempt to (belatedly) respond to voters' beliefs that Biden is too old to serve another term.\n\nSo it may be undemocratic in practice, but in a sense it's democratic in intention. Because the party isn't avoiding an election, they're trying to win one, by picking a nominee who (they hope) can win more people's votes.\n\nDemocratic Party elites didn't just fall out of a coconut tree after the debate. Up until that disaster, they'd been fully behind Biden, and their support of him was one major reason Democratic voters were presented with no credible alternatives in this year's primaries.\n\nBecause in reality, Biden won the primaries well before the people got to vote. Back in 2022 and 2023, some polls showed a majority of Democratic voters saying he shouldn't run again. The president never seems to have seriously considered bowing out, though. He ran again and (as is normal for an incumbent) solidly locked down support from Democratic elites. As a result, Democratic rising stars were deterred from challenging Biden, believing they likely would have lost, and then been blamed if Trump won in the general.\n\nPresident Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.\n\nSo, yes, 15 million people did indeed end up voting in those primaries. But how democratic was that process? Biden won the primaries because he won the inside game. It was party elites who determined the (few) options available to voters. Polls showed the voters would in theory have preferred someone else, but they weren't offered a realistic opposing candidate.\n\nFurthermore, asserting that the primary result is all that matters, and that taking anything else into account is \"undemocratic,\" is a very limited and blinkered definition of democracy. After all, those 15 million people are a paltry sum compared to the 150 million people who may vote in the general election - people who, according to polls, overwhelmingly think Biden is too old to serve another term. Many of those people wanted another candidate - shouldn't their views matter?\n\nAnother issue is that primary voters did not have the information that Biden would perform so poorly in the debate when they cast their votes.\n\nAnd though what key Democratic Party figures just did to Biden is in some ways unprecedented, in other ways it's very familiar. That is: it's the standard playbook for how to force out a suddenly scandal-plagued elected official who is believed to be hurting the party.\n\nThis playbook involves a ratcheting up of pressure and condemnations as co-partisans gradually condemn or abandon that official, making sure they know that the battering will continue unless they quit - basically what we've seen over the past few weeks.\n\nNew York Democrats successfully employed it against Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2021, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in 2018, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer in 2008. Senate Democrats did it against Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) in 2017. (Though it doesn't always work, as shown in the cases of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam , and 2016 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump .)\n\nYour mileage may vary in how much you view Biden's bad debate performance as a full-on scandal. But it was certainly new information that wasn't clear during the primaries. Back then, Biden refused to participate in any debates and skipped some high-profile interview opportunities, leaving it ambiguous how he might perform in a high-stakes setting.\n\nBut the truth is that party elites didn't just casually abandon the choice of the voters right after they made that choice. They defected later, because of new information - information that those primary voters did not have.\n\nFinally, it is also worth noting that party elites didn't push Biden off the ticket in an effort to steal the power of the presidency from him. They abandoned him because they fear he is hurting the party's electoral chances - that is, because he's lost support from voters.\n\nParty loyalty is a two-way street - it is not, or at least should not be, a blood oath or a cult of personality. Leading Democrats backed Biden when they thought he could win, and they ditched him when they thought he couldn't.\n\nNow, they're trying to substitute a nominee they hope the American public will like a lot better. And there's something very democratic about that. They are (finally, belatedly) trying to listen to the voters, who, according to polls at least, keep saying they don't want to support Biden again.\n\nSo maybe it would have been nice if Democrats had had an actual presidential primary process rather than this mess. But that didn't happen - and, considering the options, party officials abandoning Biden to try and nudge him aside in favor of someone who can win was a reasonable response.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

      "text": "Biden, in farewell address, warns about dangers of unchecked power in ultra-wealthy\n\nHe spoke from the Oval Office for a final time as president.\n\nPresident Joe Biden , in his farewell address, reflected on a decadeslong political career but also issued a stark warning to the nation as he prepares to cede power to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Biden said he was proud of what his administration accomplished as the country climbed out of the coronavirus pandemic and made investments in the economy, infrastructure, gun safety, climate change and more.\n\n\"In the past four years, our democracy has held strong and every day I've kept my commitment to be president for all Americans for one of the toughest periods in our nation's history,\" Biden said.\n\nHe commended Vice President Kamala Harris as a \"great partner\" as she sat nearby alongside second gentleman Doug Emhoff, first lady Jill Biden and Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden listed several of his key legislative wins, including lowering prescription drug prices, expanding benefits for military veterans exposed to burn pits, investing in domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips and more. The impact of those policies, he noted, may not be fully realized for years to come.\n\nHe also briefly highlighted the ceasefire and hostage release deal reached by Israel and Hamas earlier Wednesday, a foreign policy goal of Biden's for more than a year that became reality just days before his departure.\n\nHe touted working with the incoming Trump administration to see through its implementation. \"That's how it should be, working together,\" Biden said.\n\nBut Biden spent the majority of his remarks on something he said caused him great concern -- what he said was the concentration of power in the hands of a few wealthy individuals.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" he said.\n\nHe spoke about the threat he said the wealthy posed to efforts to fight the dangers of climate change.\n\n\"Powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence, to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit,\" he said. \"We must not be bullied into sacrificing the future, the future of our children and our grandchildren, must keep pushing forward and push faster. There's no time to waste.\"\n\nBiden also raised concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence, and the possibilities and dangers advancing technologies posed. He lamented the rise in misinformation online and what he described as a \"crumbling\" free press that he said were enabling abuses of power.\n\n\"In his farewell address, President Eisenhower spoke of the dangers of the military industrial complex,\" he said. \"He warned us then about, and I quote, 'the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power' ... six decades later, I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country as well.\"\n\nBiden pushed for reforming the tax code so that billionaires pay their \"fair share\" and for amending the Constitution to make clear that no president is immune from criminal liability -- an apparent slight at Trump, who was previously under federal indictment for his behavior after the 2020 election and is set to be sworn into office in five days.\n\n\"A president's powers is not unlimited. It's not absolute and it shouldn't be,\" Biden said. \"And in a democracy, there's another danger to the concentration of power and wealth. It erodes the sense of unity and common purpose. It causes distrust and division.\"\n\n\"Participating in our democracy becomes exhausting and even disillusioning,\" he continued. \"And people don't feel like they have a fair shot. We have to stay engaged in the process.\"\n\nIn closing, Biden reflected on his own rise as a kid from Scranton plagued by a stutter to the nation's highest office -- one that he sought repeatedly during his five decades in politics and is leaving reluctantly after withdrawing from the 2024 campaign amid Democrats' doubts.\n\nHe described America's promise as a \"constant struggle.\"\n\n\"A short distance between peril and possibility,\" he said. \"But what I believe is the America of our dreams is always closer than we think. And it's up to us to make our dreams come true.\"\n\nUltimately, Biden asserted, it will be up to the president, Congress, the courts and the American people to stand up to those with ill-intent.\n\n\"Now, it's your turn to stand guard,\" Biden said. \"May you all be the keeper of the flame. May you keep the faith. I love America, you love it, too.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Following pardon, Hunter Biden is mired in debt and without a permanent home, court filing says\n\nHe was pardoned by his father just weeks before Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nHunter Biden may have his freedom , but the son of former President Joe Biden now finds himself mired in debt, without a permanent home, and the target of ongoing attacks from the current president, Donald Trump, and his allies on Capitol Hill, according to a court filing.\n\nIn court papers filed Wednesday, Hunter Biden asked a federal judge to dismiss his lawsuit against online provocateur Garrett Ziegler because he \"does not have the financial resources to continue litigating this case.\"\n\nAmid lagging sales of his art and his memoir, the younger Biden remains \"several million dollars\" in debt after fighting multiple federal criminal cases, claiming in an affidavit that he only sold one painting for $36,000 since late 2023, after selling 27 paintings in the previous couple of years at an average price of nearly $55,000.\n\n\"Given the positive feedback and reviews of my artwork and memoir, I was expecting to obtain paid speaking engagements and paid appearances, but that has not happened,\" Hunter Biden wrote Wednesday.\n\nHe said that his \"lack of financial resources has been exacerbated by the fires in the Pacific Palisades in early January, which has rendered my rental house unlivable for an extended period of time and, like many others in that situation, I am having difficulty in finding a new permanent place to live.\"\n\nA person close to Hunter Biden told ABC News that his rental did not burn down, but that immense damage to the surrounding properties had limited his access to his residence.\n\nThe affidavit chronicles a series of hardships since his father's departure from office. Weeks before Trump's inauguration, then-President Biden pardoned his son shortly before two federal judges were scheduled to sentence him for a pair of criminal convictions in Delaware and California, for which he faced the possibility of substantial prison time.\n\nHunter Biden has acknowledged taking out millions of dollars in loans from Kevin Morris, a Hollywood attorney who largely bankrolled Hunter Biden's legal defense over the past five years. In congressional testimony last year, Morris said he expected Hunter Biden to repay those loans beginning in 2025, though it was not clear from the affidavit whether those loan repayments have begun.\n\nHunter Biden and his legal team are evaluating whether to continue litigating a handful of other lawsuits he filed in recent years against purveyors of his infamous laptop on a \"case by case basis,\" Hunter Biden wrote in Wednesday's filing. Ziegler did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nOne of those suits targets Patrick Byrne, the founder of Overstock.com and an avid supporter of President Trump. Hunter Biden sued Byrne in late 2023 for defamation for falsely accused Hunter Biden of trying to bribe Iran while his father was president -- a claim that Hunter Biden said has subjected him to \"harassment, intimidation, and harm.\" Byrne has fought the defamation claim in court.\n\nThe trial in the case has been repeatedly delayed amid a protracted dispute over depositions from Byrne and an FBI agent that has thrown a wrench into the proceedings.\n\nByrne's attorneys claim in court papers that Byrne fled to Dubai after he was told by U.S. officials \"that the Venezuelan government has a $25,000,000 bounty on his head,\" and said he preferred a deposition over Zoom \"out of concern for his personal safety.\" The parties ultimately agreed to a remote deposition in December that was expected to span seven hours over the course of three days, though it was unclear from the court docket when exactly the deposition occurred.\n\nIn court filings as part of that case, Hunter Biden has echoed his claims of financial hardship. He claimed that because of Byrne's defamatory statements, he has suffered \"lost economic opportunities\" to the tune of nearly half a million dollars, citing lost memoir sales, lost art sales, and lost speaking opportunities.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team has also subpoenaed the FBI, demanding testimony and documents from an agent whom Byrne claimed on social media could corroborate Byrne's allegations against the younger Biden. But the FBI has so far rebuffed those efforts, and on Monday the Justice Department filed a motion in federal court in Washington, D.C., urging a federal judge there to quash the subpoena.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden remains squarely on the minds of Trump and his loyalists in Congress. As one of his first acts in office, Trump signed an executive order revoking security clearances for 51 former intelligence officials who signed a letter asserting that the emergence of data from Hunter Biden's laptop in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election bore similarities to prior Russian misinformation operations.\n\nDuring a heated Oval Office confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week, Trump repeatedly invoked Hunter Biden's name as part of a lengthy diatribe about the Russia investigation led by Robert Mueller.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, two top Republican lawmakers invited IRS whistleblowers who revealed details of Hunter Biden's tax filings as guests at Trump's Joint Address to Congress.\n\nThe person close to Hunter Biden told ABC News that the former president's son will continue pursuing his art career and plans to devote himself to initiatives meant to help people struggling with addiction. And despite the sentiments in his affidavit, Hunter Biden remains in \"a good place to rebuild his life,\" the person said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

He also marked Jan. 9, 2025, as a National Day of Mourning.\n\nEarlier in the evening, he made a televised appearance from St. Croix, a part of the U.S. Virgin Islands where he and his family were spending the holidays, to remember the accomplished man both politically and personally, noting, \"Jill and I lost a dear friend.\"\n\nHowever, he added, what he found most extraordinary about Carter was the fact that millions of people around the world currently shared that feeling -- whether they'd met him or not.\n\n\"Cancer was a common bond between our two families,\" Biden confided, and he said that they had shared the belief that America has \"the talent and the resources to one day end cancer as we know it if we make the investments.\"\n\nBiden praised the renowned humanitarian for being a man of both word and deed, suggesting, \"We should all do well to be a bit more like Jimmy Carter.\"\n\nOn behalf of the nation, to Carter's family, he said, \"We send our whole heartfelt sympathies, in gratitude\" for that life of service -- both in the Oval Office and in the decades beyond.\n\nIn closing, Biden noted, of Carter being laid to rest: \"I think he's happy, and he's happy with Rosie\" -- referencing Carter's beloved late wife Rosalynn Carter, who died one year prior in November 2023.\n\nHe had previously released a statement calling Carter \"a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism.\"\n\n\"With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us,\" Biden's statement said. \"He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris mourned Carter's passing on Sunday, saying in a statement that the former president, \"was guided by a deep and abiding faith -- in God, in America, and in humanity.\"\n\n\"I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me - and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter,\" Harris added.\n\nIn a statement posted to X , Secretary of State Antony Blinken remembered former President Jimmy Carter for demonstrating \"what could be achieved through tireless diplomacy and dedication to the pursuit of peace, democracy, and human rights.\"\n\nListing Carter's foreign policy achievements, Blinken included \"negotiating the return of the Panama Canal to its host nation\" and \"developing arms control agreements with the Soviet Union.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin wrote in a statement that \"Americans will remember President Carter for his leadership in office and his distinguished post-presidency, but the Department also honors his sterling service in uniform.\"\n\nAustin said, \"We also honor President Carter for his contributions to global security. The Carter Doctrine still helps undergird our commitment to stability and security in the Gulf.\"\n\nHe added, on a personal note, \"Charlene and I send our deepest condolences to the Carter family.\"\n\nAs Biden mentioned in his televised tribute, many political leaders had close personal ties and friendships with the former president, and their remembrances were often heartfelt -- even as they recognized Carter's many efforts to decentralize himself and put other people and good work first.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton said in a statement on X that he and his wife Hillary Clinton \"mourn the passing of President Jimmy Carter and give thanks for his long, good life.\" He also wrote, \"Guided by his faith, President Carter lived to serve others-until the very end.\"\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump wrote of Carter on Truth Social , \"The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\"\n\nIn his statement , former President Barack Obama paid tribute to the former president's honesty, especially in the wake of Watergate saying in a statement that Carter \"promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did - advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection - things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God's image.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi also recognized the times in which Carter was elected to the White House, in a statement to ABC News:\n\n\"As President, his work to restore integrity to the political arena during a difficult chapter in our history was a testament to his firm faith in the sanctity of the public good, which he always placed above his own,\" she said in a statement. \"After leaving the White House, he carried on his service - leading perhaps the most impactful post-presidency in history.\"\n\nFormer President George W. Bush posted on X , calling Carter \"a man of deeply held convictions. He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn't end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's statement said, \"President Carter lived a truly American dream. A devoutly religious peanut farmer from small-town Georgia volunteered to serve his country in uniform. He found himself manning cutting-edge submarines hundreds of feet beneath the ocean. He returned home and saved the family farm before feeling drawn to a different sort of public service. And less than 15 years after his first campaign for the state Senate, his fellow Americans elected him leader of the free world.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer released a statement calling Carter \"one of our most humble and devoted public servants.\"\n\n\"President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called him a \"great man, role model and humanitarian\" and said in a statement that \"his incredible life, legacy and leadership are a testament to the power of the American dream.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a statement that Carter \"set the standard for post-presidential service through his work with Habitat for Humanity.\"\n\nThe Clintons' statement summarized Carter's impact:\n\n\"From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace, combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn's devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity--he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore said on Sunday that Carter had \"lived a life full of purpose, humility, and kindness\" and that \"he led with heart, faith in God, and courage.\"\n\n\"He had an unyielding commitment to building a more peaceful, safer, and more just world and a cleaner environment,\" Gore said in a statement posted on social media. \"He is also remembered around the world for the work he did over the 42 years after he left office.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement that Carter was a \"good and decent man\" who \"represented the heart of this country.\" And Former Attorney General Eric Holder said Carter \"consistently showed that he was the best of us.\"\n\n\"History will look fondly on his many achievements, from the creation of the Department of Education to the Camp David Accords to his prescient focus on climate concerns,\" Holder said in a statement posted on X. \"He is a President whose accomplishments will be seen for their true significance and lasting value in the years to come.\"\n\nJaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, praised Carter for \"leading by example\" during his presidency and during his time as governor of Georgia, where he enacted environmental policies \"and stood up for civil rights and desegregation\" in the state.\n\n\"Throughout his presidency, he was guided by his faith, his selfless commitment to others, and his empathy,\" Harrison said in a statement. \"President Carter aspired to build a government grounded in competence and compassion and leave behind a country where dreams are achievable, and hope is more than an aspiration.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,\" he continued. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\"\n\nThe five preemptive pardons were issued to James Biden, Joe's younger brother; Sara Jones Biden, James' wife; Valerie Biden Owens, Joe's younger sister; John T. Owens', Valerie's husband; and Francis W. Biden, Joe's younger brother.\n\nWhile he was sitting in the Capitol Rotunda attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, Biden announced the preemptive pardons for his siblings and in-laws.\n\n\"I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics. But baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finance,\" Biden said.\n\n\"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,\" Biden said.\n\nThis comes after Biden issued a controversial pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, in early December over tax evasion and federal gun charges. Biden had repeatedly said he did not plan to pardon Hunter.\n\nJames Biden, 75, has especially come under fire from Republicans.\n\nCongressional Republicans have pressed the incoming Justice Department to bring charges against James Biden for allegedly lying to Congress as part of its impeachment inquiry into the outgoing president and his family.\n\nPaul Fishman, an attorney who represents James and Sara Biden, said in a statement to ABC News, \"Jim and Sara Biden did not seek this pardon because they have never committed any crimes. But for the reasons the President described, they have accepted it.\"\n\nJames Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, wrote to incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday seeking to hold James Biden accountable for \"having misled Congress regarding Joe Biden's participation in his family's influence peddling and deserving of prosecution under federal law.\"\n\nComer and his Republican colleagues had already issued a criminal referral for James Biden to the Justice Department. Comer reacted to the preemptive pardons of Biden's family, saying they serve as \"a confession of their corruption.\"\n\nThe pardon warrant, signed Jan. 19, excuses James Biden and the other family members of \"ANY NONVIOLENT OFFENSES against the United States which they may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014, through the date of this pardon.\"\n\nThese were the second preemptive pardons issued by the outgoing president on Monday, not an unusual act for departing leaders. He also issued pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 committee.\n\n\"Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.\"\n\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team.\n\n\"I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice, because that's what American presidents do,\" Biden said.\n\nBut as he walked away, Biden appeared to brush off the role Trump played when asked by a reporter who should get credit for the deal five days before he would leave office and Trump takes over.\n\n\"Is that a joke?\" Biden responded.\n\nBiden administration officials walked through the long timeline of negotiations, starting with Biden's framework last May that prompted a summer of \"intensive negotiations.\" Those talks, however, came to a halt on Aug. 31 when Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages were found dead in Rafah.\n\nOne of the key issues had been how many hostages Hamas had, which the official said they did not want to share for much of the past few months.\n\nSince Jan. 5, an official said, negotiators have been in the region nailing down specifics including the complex details like \"redeployment of Israeli forces, what Hamas must do, humanitarian provisions and the sequence of releasing hostages and releasing a number of Palestinian prisoners.\"\n\nThe official added this phase of talks has been \"very intense\" and came together over the past 96 or so hours.\n\nPresident Biden held a series of calls over the last few days with key brokers in the region, the official stressed, including Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar and President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt.\n\n\"You know, there was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal, and I'm deeply satisfied this day has come, finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony,\" Biden said.\n\n\"And for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war,\" he continued. \"The Palestinian people have gone through hell. Too many innocent people have died. Too many communities have been destroyed. And this deal, the people of Gaza can finally recover and rebuild.

      "text": "Biden promised but failed to end federal use of private prisons. That's left the industry ready to cash in big under Trump\n\nFollow:\n\nJust over four years ago on the campaign trail, Joe Biden made a bold pledge to voters that as president he would end the federal use of private prisons - facilities where inmates have long complained of abusive treatment.\n\nBut as he left office last month, his record on that matter fell short: While Biden ended the Bureau of Prison's contracts with private prisons, he allowed their use by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand.\n\nToday, because of ICE detainees, the federal government has more people in private prisons than when Biden took office, according to data obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union through a Freedom of Information request and provided to CNN.\n\nAnd Biden's choice to exempt ICE from his private prison policies did something more: It paved the way for President Donald Trump to quickly expand their use to hold undocumented immigrants.\n\nAmong the flurry of inauguration day executive orders Trump signed was one overturning Biden's executive order on private prisons. But long before then, in the waning months of the Biden administration, ICE asked private-prison companies such as Geo Group and CoreCivic, among others, for proposals to expand private-prison capacity this year in at least seven states: California, Kansas, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington. That move came despite ongoing allegations of poor conditions and improper treatment of detainees in many private prisons.\n\nShareholders in those companies expect a huge payday under Trump. Between Election Day in November and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Geo Group shares rose 133% in price, while CoreCivic shares jumped nearly 60%, far outpacing the broader stock market.\n\n\"They will essentially profit off every step of this process: the detention, the monitoring, the deportation,\" said Bianca Tylek, founder and executive director of Worth Rises, an advocacy nonprofit opposed to private prisons. \"This is the windfall they were waiting for.\"\n\nIn recent decades, the fortunes of private prison companies have tended to rise under Republican administrations and stall under Democrats.\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama ordered the Department of Justice to phase out and eventually end the use of private prisons, after an inspector general report found private prisons were more violent than publicly run facilities. Trump rescinded that order in his first term. In 2021, Biden again ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to stop contracting with private prisons, because of concerns similar to those behind Obama's order five years earlier. Biden's order also extended to the US Marshals Service, which mostly holds pre-trial detainees.\n\nHowever, private prison companies effectively found ways to shift federal contracting to immigration detention.\n\nOver Biden's term, as the number of federal inmates in private prisons under Bureau of Prisons contracts fell to zero from more than 14,000, the number of immigrants detained in private prisons under ICE contracts rose by roughly 24,000, to more than 35,000. By the end of Biden's term, private prisons held nearly 90 percent of immigrant detainees, nearly identical to the percent at the end of Trump's first term, according to an ACLU analysis. And overall, private prisons housed nearly 9,000 more federal detainees than at the start of Biden's term.\n\nThat rise took place amid continuing charges of abuse and mistreatment in private facilities. Geo Group is currently fighting a lawsuit from current and former detainees alleging it exposed them to hazardous chemicals at a California detention center. Another Geo Group facility in Tacoma, Washington, has repeatedly faced detainee hunger strikes to protest alleged poor food and medical care, among other issues .\n\nAnd the Department of Justice's civil rights division is investigating a CoreCivic correctional facility in Tennessee over allegations that staffing shortages exposed inmates to violence and sexual assault. The fate of that case is unclear after the Justice Department recently ordered the division to freeze any ongoing litigation left over from the Biden administration.\n\nA spokesperson for CoreCivic told CNN that the company's facilities \"operate with a significant amount of oversight and accountability,\" and said they \"adhere to all ICE standards and are monitored by ICE officials on a daily basis.\"\n\nThe company also rejected claims of mistreatment of detainees at one of its immigration detention facilities in New Mexico, where it is currently fighting a wrongful death lawsuit. \"We continue to hear claims about our immigration facilities that simply don't reflect the quality of the services provided or the professionalism of our team,\" said CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin.\n\nSimilar issues have surfaced for years. Heavily redacted documents obtained by CNN through public-records requests show that during Trump's first term, scores of inmates in contracted ICE facilities around the country engaged in hunger strikes to protest their treatment - including at facilities in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington. Many of these hunger strikes have not been previously reported. The reasons behind the hunger strikes aren't detailed; but groups that have worked with hunger strikers said they see common threads across facilities: denial of medical care, poor conditions, and complaints about physical and sexual assault of detainees, among other issues.\n\nIn a statement responding to CNN queries, Geo Group said all their facilities \"are closely monitored in accordance with government contract standards\" and that the company works with government agencies \"to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.\" It added, \"We believe that many instances of hunger strikes at GEO-Contracted ICE Processing Centers are instigated and coordinated by politically motivated outside groups.\"\n\nOn Jan. 16, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling against Geo Group, saying it must pay past detainees at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, and the state of Washington, $23.2 million in back pay for making detainees work for only $1 a day or less rather than the state minimum wage. The order also said detained workers must be paid the state minimum wage, currently $16.66 an hour.\n\nIn a statement, Geo Group noted that the Department of Justice had agreed with the company that applying state minimum wage laws would violate principles of intergovernmental immunity. The company said it \"strongly disagrees with this decision and will continue to vigorously pursue all available appeals.\"\n\nGeo Group, which is ICE's biggest detention contractor, has worked hard to cement ties with the new administration and with ICE. It was the first corporation of any kind to have its PAC max out on donations to a Trump super PAC during the 2024 campaign, according to one watchdog group's analysis.\n\nIn recent years, at least nine senior officials have moved to Geo Group after leaving ICE, CNN found.\n\nJust days after Trump's election, Geo Group CEO Brian Evans gushed about the company's prospects on its corporate earnings call , projecting that its revenue could grow by $400 million annually. The following month, the company announced a $70 million investment to expand capacity to serve ICE immigration detention needs in preparation for \"potentially unprecedented future growth opportunities\" under Trump.\n\n\"We have assured ICE of our capability to rapidly scale up our capabilities to monitor and oversee several hundreds of thousands or even several millions of individuals,\" Geo Group President Wayne Calabrese said on the earnings call. Geo Group's subsidiaries include companies that transport immigrant detainees and provide ankle monitors and other devices to track them.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Trump repeated his campaign promise of mass deportations. \"We will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,\" he said.\n\nThe White House issued sweeping executive orders intended to lay the groundwork for mass deportations, to seek an end to birthright citizenship, and to end many asylum and refugee protections. The Trump administration carried out highly publicized immigration sweeps in its first week, including in Chicago where former TV talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw \"embedded\" with an ICE team.\n\nMany pieces of Trump's plans - including using the US military on domestic soil to aid in immigration enforcement and oversee planned detention camps - already face legal and logistical challenges. That's one reason why expanding the use of private prisons by ICE matters so much: It's comparatively easy - albeit expensive.\n\nAn ICE memo sent to Congress before the inauguration said that expanding the detention of migrants charged with or arrested for possible criminal offenses could cost more than $3.2 billion a year. It noted that the agency currently is funded for more than 41,000 detention beds but would need to contract for at least 110,000 beds to meet a GOP-led immigrant detention bill that Trump signed last week.\n\n\"A lot of what Trump and [Homeland Security advisor Stephen] Miller want to get people excited about would be very expensive. It would be a question of how fast they can shovel the money out to the private prison companies, CoreCivic, Geo, etc. - the companies where ICE senior leaders go to work when they leave the government,\" Scott Shuchart, a former ICE assistant director for regulatory affairs and policy, told CNN.\n\nBut much will depend on Congressional willingness to loosen the purse-strings. \"Is Congress going to double ICE's budget? To do what they are promising would be ramping it up by a factor of 10 or 20,\" Shuchart said.\n\nICE did not respond to CNN queries about its plans to expand detention capacity through new contracts.\n\nIt isn't clear yet how quickly or to what degree immigrant detention will ramp up under the new administration, but enforcement actions may already be broadening. Trump scrapped a policy that kept ICE agents from going into churches and schools. And his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said that agents also will detain other undocumented immigrants they come across while seeking out those with criminal records, nationwide.\n\nOn Jan. 29, Trump signed into the law the Laken Riley Act, which would significantly expand the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or who have admitted, to various criminal offenses.\n\nThe act would require a huge surge in federal detention capacity that doesn't currently exist, offering the private prison industry a potential windfall, says Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice who has written a book on the industry.\n\n\"The federal government needs to rely on the private sector to help build that capacity,\" said Eisen. \"It paves the way for these companies to see significant profits.\"\n\nCorrection: This story was corrected to reflect that a CoreCivic facility in Tennessee is a correctional center.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Biden will not seek reelection; endorses Harris\n\nFollow:\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him on Sunday.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden wrote in a letter posted to his official account on X. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nBiden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail.\n\nRelated article Harris will seek Democratic nomination and could be the first Black woman and Asian American to lead a major party ticket\n\nIn a follow-up post, Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" Biden wrote . \"And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.\"\n\nHarris, who was informed of Biden's decision Sunday, said in a statement that she was \"honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" She is spending the day reaching out to lawmakers, outside organizations and donors, and was slated to make up to 200 calls on Sunday alone, a top Democratic source close to her told CNN.\n\nMany prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, quickly came out in support of Harris, although some who released statements reacting to Biden's decision did not mention the vice president, including former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" Obama said in a statement that kept the focus on Biden.\n\nAn adviser said Obama is taking the same approach as he did in the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to help unify the party when a nominee is chosen - whether it is Harris or someone else.\n\nOthers explicitly called for an open process to determine who should replace Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nLater Sunday, the Biden-Harris campaign formally amended its filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee \"Harris for President.\" But Harris' ascension to the top of the ticket isn't a certainty. The nominee will now be determined by the delegates to the Democratic National Convention. While Biden won an overwhelming majority of the delegates during the primary process earlier this year, they are now free to choose a candidate of their choice and he cannot simply transfer them to Harris.\n\nRelated article Inside Biden's unprecedented exit from the presidential race\n\nBiden's departure capped off weeks of concern about the 81-year-old president's stamina and mental capabilities and skepticism of his ability to effectively campaign against former President Donald Trump and govern the country for another four years. While Biden said he is committed to serving out the remainder of his term, his decision sparked immediate calls from Republicans for him to step down as president. Trump said Biden \"is not fit to serve\" in a post on Truth Social.\n\nIn a phone call with CNN after Biden's announcement, Trump said Biden would go down \"as the single worst president by far in the history of our country\" and said he thought Harris would be easier to defeat than Biden.\n\nOther leading Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson , called on Biden to \"resign the office immediately.\"\n\n\"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,\" Johnson said in a statement.\n\nIt's the first time a one-term US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades and recalls President Lyndon Johnson's decision not to seek a second full term in 1968 - though Biden's decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson's. It's also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump's life.\n\nBut not even the attempted assassination on Trump and its tumultuous effect on the race would pause the drain of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well.\n\nBiden's final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone. He did not have a final in-person meeting with his top campaign or White House advisers as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.\n\nAs his decision neared its end, first lady Jill Biden remained her husband's most ardent supporter. \"Down to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,\" Jill Biden's communications director Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe president's exit from the race sets the stage for the conclusion to a political career that has spanned a half-century, one that saw Biden enter as one of the youngest senators in US history and exit as its oldest president.\n\nAge and questions about the president's mental faculties had been Biden's biggest political liability since he first ran against Trump in 2020. Biden's disastrous performance at a June 27 CNN debate - during which the president spoke softly, had a glazed-over look and, at one point, appeared to lose his train of thought mid-sentence while his opponent delivered an animated, while mainly fact-free performance - brought those concerns to the forefront of the political conversation and ultimately doomed his reelection push.\n\nBiden's campaign had asked for the June debate in the hopes that it would force voters to tune into the race - and what Biden had said was at stake - earlier than usual. But that strategy appeared to backfire as the president solidified what had been the most persistent concern about his candidacy.\n\nThe president's performance shocked his donors, closest allies and the 50 million Americans who saw Biden stumble throughout the 90-minute debate - the most extensive exposure to an unscripted Biden since the last round of general-election debates four years ago. It left the White House and Biden campaign in a frenzied scramble to explain away his condition - at first, blaming it on a cold, before days later saying the president had been jet lagged by his international travel that wrapped up about 12 days prior to the debate.\n\nThe president's surrogates and campaign officials sought to soothe Democratic anxieties, hurriedly calling meetings with donors and top supporters to assure them that Biden's performance was the product of one bad night and ask them to consider it in the context of his three-and-a-half-year presidency.\n\nRelated article What happens in the Democratic nomination now that Biden has left the race\n\nThe president himself recognized how poorly the night had gone almost immediately; at a campaign rally the next day, he sought to promote an animated and energized image that had largely been absent from the debate stage.\n\n\"I don't walk as easy as I used to,\" Biden said. \"I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.\"\n\nBut the damage had already been done.\n\nBy the Monday after the debate, murmurs about replacing Biden on the ticket had grown into a full public conversation. The mood in the White House and at Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington had turned sour. Biden, seeking to assert his control over his campaign and the presidency, delivered brief remarks that evening on the Supreme Court's immunity decision earlier that day, asking voters to \"dissent\" in a rare political overture from the White House.\n\nThe next day, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first member of Congress from Biden's own party to ask him to drop out. The fractures in Biden's support have grown steadily wider every day since. By the time Biden exited the race, dozens of lawmakers had asked him to bow out.\n\nSo had major donors. Actor George Clooney, who has known Biden for years and was one of Hollywood's biggest boosters of the president, said in a July 10 New York Times opinion piece that Democrats \"are not going to win in November with this president\" and called for the party to pick a new nominee.\n\nBiden was initially defiant that he would remain in the race. But as the defections in his base of support continued, and leading Democrats in Congress continued to have difficult conversations with the president about his odds against Trump and the damaging effect he might have on down-ballot Democrats in competitive races, Biden opened himself up more to the idea of dropping out of the race.\n\nIn an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on July 5, Biden laughed off questions about his political future and said only the \"Lord Almighty\" could convince him to drop from the race.\n\nDays later, Stephanopoulos candidly told a passerby that he also didn't think Biden could serve another four years.\n\nBiden told reporters at a NATO news conference he would drop out if polls showed he could not win. About a week later, he said he would reevaluate whether to stay in if he had \"some medical condition that emerged\" and doctors told him that would be an issue. The next day, the White House announced that Biden had Covid-19.\n\nThe attempt on Trump's life on July 13 briefly stemmed the flow of congressional Democrats calling for Biden to drop out and pulled the national attention away from his faltering presidential campaign. But the reprieve didn't last long. California Rep. Adam Schiff on July 17 became the first House Democrat to call on Biden to step down since the assassination attempt, and more followed in the ensuing days.\n\nBiden's evolution on his future as the party's nominee tracked closely with efforts among his biggest allies to convince him the path to victory was narrow. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Biden weeks after his debate that polls showed he could not win.\n\nA senior Democratic adviser told CNN the president was becoming \"receptive\" to conversations about him stepping aside: \"He's gone from saying, 'Kamala can't win,' to 'Do you think Kamala can win?\"\n\nThose conversation accelerated as Biden isolated at his beach home with Covid over the last few days. Saturday night, Biden asked two of his closest advisers to start drafting the letter, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nMany rank-and-file staff found out about Biden's decision when the post came out.\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny, Betsy Klein, Ethan Cohen, Abby Phillip and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Inside Biden's unprecedented exit from the presidential race\n\nFollow:\n\nIn the end, President Joe Biden exited the political stage in isolation.\n\nAfter weeks of fighting for his political life - insisting he wasn't going anywhere following a disastrous debate performance - the president's about-face did not come in an Oval Office address or a speech on the campaign trail. Instead, it came in letter posted to social media as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware.\n\nIt was a low-key way to reveal one of the most historic decisions in modern American politics, but time was not on Biden's side to reach a decision or make an announcement. Never before has a president left a reelection race this close to Election Day - and for 24 days it seemed as if he were stubbornly planning to ride out the storm that followed the June 27 CNN debate in Atlanta.\n\nHe spent the three weeks after the debate repeating that he was staying in the race against former President Donald Trump . The president dug in. He insisted he could beat Trump. His inner circle shrank to his closest aides and family. He was forced to retreat to Delaware, where he reached a decision in the last day and a half, finally conceding that a man loyal to the Democratic Party for more than half a century was seen as a drag on the ticket.\n\nRelated article What are your questions about the presidential election now that Biden is out?\n\nBut in the end, the pressure on Biden from party leaders, rank-and-file lawmakers and donors - and the polling showing the perilous and potentially insurmountable path Biden faced amid a growing deficit with Trump - ultimately proved too much. Described as being more isolated than he had ever been , Biden could not withstand the push behind the scenes and in public. The blunt reality became a chorus of voices calling for the president to exit the race, like a boulder rolling down a mountain that only picked up momentum with each passing day.\n\nThe president's team wanted the June CNN debate with Trump - months earlier than typical presidential debates - to shake up a race that Biden was trailing. They succeeded, but not in the way they had intended.\n\nInstead, Biden's campaign unraveled over the course of the next 24 days. Everything the president and his team tried to do to calm Democrats' fears simply failed to shed the perception that Biden's age was too advanced, and his health too fragile, for him to stay in the race.\n\nWith two posts on X Sunday afternoon, Biden bowed out of the race and threw his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, in the hopes of quickly coalescing their party and moving past the chaos that had engulfed Democrats since the debate.\n\nIt's a high-risk, high-reward gamble for Democrats, resetting a campaign Biden was losing with a new nominee just 107 days before the election. It comes as Trump is at his strongest point in the campaign, coming out of a completely unified Republican National Convention with a base rallying around him after the attempt on his life .\n\nBiden's final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone while recovering from Covid. A source familiar with the matter said the plans to exit the race began Saturday night and were finalized Sunday.\n\nThe adviser said the president \"was not dug in\" but was studying the data coming in and became convinced he would \"weigh down\" the ticket and be a complication to defeating Trump.\n\nBiden's decision did not have to do with any medical issues, a senior White House official told CNN.\n\nWhen Biden huddled with his two closest advisers Saturday, the information they provided on polling and where top Democratic officials stood underscored that a path to victory was \"basically nonexistent,\" according to another person familiar with the matter.\n\nThere wasn't any single poll number, wavering Democratic official or fundraiser presented in the meeting with longtime aides Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti that pushed Biden toward his decision, the person said.\n\nInstead, the information highlighted that the path back to a viable campaign had been severely damaged by declining national and swing-state poll numbers, along with party defections that were likely to rapidly accelerate. The information included polling and details gathered from outreach outside Biden's inner circle.\n\nUnlike 2015, when Biden wrote in his book \"Promise me, Dad\" that Donilon told the then-vice president he shouldn't launch a 2016 bid for president as he grieved the death of his son Beau, neither aide explicitly told Biden he should get out of the race, according to the person.\n\nRelated article What happens in the Democratic nomination now that Biden has left the race\n\nBiden made clear before the end of the meeting that he was planning to pull out of the race and asked his aides to start drafting the letter he posted Sunday afternoon and preparing the plans for the rollout.\n\nStill recovering from a Covid diagnosis, Biden remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend with his wife, first lady Jill Biden.\n\nBiden did what he always planned to do before any crucial decision: He held a family meeting Saturday night. He has spoken to all of his family since making his decision to drop out of the race, and his daughter Ashley and son-in-law Howard drove to Rehoboth earlier Sunday, according to a source.\n\nHe confirmed that decision Sunday morning and, with Ricchetti by his side, started making calls to key players outside of his close-knit group of senior-most aides and family members, the other person familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden consulted only a very small number of close aides on the decision. Some members of his inner circle were left in the dark until minutes before he posted his announcement on social media, including one of his closest communications advisers, Anita Dunn.\n\nMultiple sources told CNN that Dunn and a small group of senior aides became aware of Biden's announcement in the minutes before the post. Many rank-and-file staff found out when the post came out. Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, were among Biden's debate prep team and had faced the ire of the president's family in the aftermath of the performance. A Biden aide disputed that her exclusion had anything to do with the debate, telling CNN that she, along with other top aides, was not in Rehoboth Beach, and that \"the president told his aides that neither he or his family blame them for debate performance.\"\n\nBiden and Harris spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of his announcement, according to a source familiar with the matter. Biden also held separate calls with chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign co-chair Jen O'Malley Dillon informing each of his decision.\n\nIn Washington on Sunday, Zients led a White House senior staff call with all assistants to the president in the midafternoon, as well as a call with members of Biden's Cabinet. Zients is expected to hold an all-White House staff call Monday morning and to speak with political appointees across the executive branch.\n\nBut even his vice president, and pick to succeed him, didn't find out until the day he announced his decision.\n\nIn the end, Biden was confronting an untenable path forward: More than three dozen Democrats had publicly called for him to exit the race. Party leaders had told him he couldn't win. And the money was drying up from donors who said they felt betrayed by the lack of disclosure around the condition of Biden's health.\n\n\"I don't know one big donor who is going to write a check for $100,000 or more. And I know a lot of those guys,\" one major Democratic donor told CNN before Biden dropped out.\n\nBiden and his team tried to play off the debate performance as a \"bad night.\" He and his aides blamed the president's overseas trip. He said he would debate again and do better. And he returned immediately to the campaign trail, traveling to North Carolina the following day and delivering an energetic speech while acknowledging his debate shortcomings.\n\n\"I know I'm not a young man. I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden huddled with his family at Camp David the weekend after the debate for a previously scheduled get-together, during which they encouraged him to stay in the race.\n\nBut in Democratic circles, panic had already set in. The issue problem was plain as day: Biden's biggest problem with voters was they didn't feel he was up to the job for the next four years. The debate had confirmed their fears and brought Biden's biggest political weakness to the forefront. No policy or statement or criticism of Trump could change that.\n\nEven as Biden insisted there was nothing that could convince him to get out of the race, Democrats began laying the groundwork and keeping the door open to a change. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on MSNBC, saying: \"I think it's a legitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition?\"\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas on July 2 became the first elected Democrat to call for Biden to withdraw. The following day, Biden met with a group of Democratic governors, telling them he needed more sleep and should stop scheduling events after 8 p.m.\n\nOn July 5, Biden sat down for an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, in an attempt to demonstrate he was able to keep campaigning. In the interview, Biden said only the \"Lord Almighty\" could convince him to leave the race, a comment that angered many Democrats.\n\nIt was the first of several attempts from Biden's team to put the president in the public eye and quell the growing discontent. All failed to do so.\n\nAfter July 4, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, quietly tried to gather a group of Democrats who would hold a meeting with Biden, potentially urging him to exit the race. The idea died, however, when the effort leaked.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a call with House Democrats over that weekend, during which several lawmakers said that Biden needed to step aside.\n\nOn July 8, Biden fired off defiant a letter to congressional Democrats saying he would continue his reelection bid. \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" he wrote.\n\nThe calls for Biden to leave soon started coming from outside Washington. On July 10, George Clooney, penned a New York Times op-ed calling for Biden to step aside. Even more devastating for the president, Clooney said the Biden he saw at a June fundraiser was the same Biden the world saw at the June debate and that the president had declined since taking the Oval Office.\n\nPelosi also continued to raise questions about Biden, declining to endorse him in an MSNBC interview the same day as Clooney's op-ed. \"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run,\" she said, even if that was a decision Biden had already seemed to have made.\n\nRelated article The delegates will decide the next Democratic nominee as a groundswell forms for Harris\n\nSeveral news outlets, including CNN, reported that Pelosi and former President Barack Obama had privately expressed concerns about the future of Biden's campaign.\n\nOn July 11, Biden held a solo news conference on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington. He opened the door a bit further to the possibility he could drop out, saying he would consider doing so if data showed he cannot win.\n\nBiden also made several small verbal slip-ups, including calling Harris \"Vice President Trump.\" Earlier in the day, he had referred Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"President Putin,\" before correcting himself.\n\nAfter Biden's news conference, a handful more congressional Democrats called for him to drop out, growing the number to 15. The list included Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he deliberately waited until after the NATO meeting.\n\nThat weekend, Biden met and held calls with various Democratic caucuses, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the moderate New Democrat Coalition. The call with moderate Democrats was tense, as Biden got into it with Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who bluntly told him that voters are concerned about his vigor and strength, especially as it is perceived on the world stage.\n\nThe president responded to Crow - an Army Ranger who served two tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq - that he knows Crow is a Bronze Star recipient like his late son Beau, but that \"he didn't rebuild NATO.\"\n\nAt one point, Biden told Crow, \"I don't want to hear that crap\" in addressing the lawmaker's concerns.\n\nMore Democrats had been expected to publicly call for Biden's exit that weekend, but the chatter came to a halt in an instant when an attempted assassin's bullet came within millimeters of killing Trump at his Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.\n\nThe assassination attempt turned the political world on its head, draining the public focus on Biden's ability to govern for a second term and turning it squarely onto the bullet that grazed Trump's ear, raising a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to shoot at the Republican nominee for president five days before he was to accept the nomination.\n\nThe pause would not last.\n\nBehind the scenes, Democratic pollsters circulated memos showing Biden was on track to lose the election, and - importantly to congressional Democrats - damage candidates in ballot races, too. Some polling showed other Democrats outpacing Biden in battleground states.\n\n\"Lose everything,\" was how one Democrat described a polling memo Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg had sent to Biden's inner circle.\n\nThe dam reopened on Wednesday when California Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic Senate candidate and leader of Trump's first impeachment, became the first lawmaker to join the public calls for Biden to withdraw from the campaign after the assassination attempt.\n\nSchiff's place in the party - as a potential soon-to-be senator and close ally to Pelosi - made his voice among the most significant to that point.\n\n\"While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nMore voices soon followed. And arguably more importantly, the private pleas for Biden to leave the race became part of a public cacophony of voices urging his withdrawal.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland House Democrat who led Trump's second impeachment, confirmed that he had written a letter to Biden on July 6 encouraging the president that there was \"no shame in taking a well-deserved bow\" out of the 2024 presidential election - and making his argument with comparisons to George Washington and Red Sox pitching great Pedro Martinez.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that Pelosi privately told Biden that polling showed he could not defeat Trump and that he could destroy Democrats' chances of winning the House in November. Biden pushed back, saying he had seen polls indicating he could win. At one point, Pelosi asked Donilon, Biden's longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data.\n\nThat same day, ABC News reported that Schumer told Biden in their Saturday meeting that it would be best if he bowed out of the presidential race. And a person briefed on the meeting between Biden and Jeffries said that the Democratic House leader stopped short of calling on him to step aside - instead pinning the suggestion on his members.\n\nThe White House and congressional officers tried to tamp down the reports, issuing statements of denial. But the stories about the party leaders delivering Biden a message had their effect. On Friday, a dozen new Democrats released statements saying Biden should exit the race.\n\nAmong them: Another close Pelosi ally, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. A source with direct knowledge described Biden on Friday as \"seething\" at Pelosi, a sentiment that only grew in light of Lofgren's letter.\n\nThe public statements from Democrats illustrated one element of Biden's challenge to stay in the race - but just as important were the defections from his donors that would have dried up fundraising in the home stretch of the campaign.\n\nMajor Democratic donors were skeptical of Biden's viability, and multiple said their concerns had received an icy reception from Biden campaign officials.\n\n\"How do you think we feel?\" a Democratic donor close to the Democratic National Committee and the White House told CNN before Biden dropped out, explaining the mood among donors. \"We all feel betrayed that they were not honest with us about his health.\"\n\nTwo sources told CNN on Thursday that furious donors were also telling House and Senate Democratic campaign committees they would freeze contributions unless and until party leaders took stronger steps to get Biden to step aside.\n\n\"Yes, that card has been played,\" a senior House Democrat told CNN on Thursday night.\n\n\"They believe if Joe is at the top of the ticket, the House and Senate are gone, too,\" said a Democratic strategist intimately involved in big-dollar fundraising. \"They don't want to throw good money after bad.\"\n\nMoments after Biden's announcement, donors abruptly began reaching out to advisers, pouring in money, according to sources involved in the discussions. In the lead-up to Biden's decision to exit the 2024 race, multiple donors had reached out to Harris' team proactively to signal they would be willing to support her if she ran at the top of the ticket, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nUp until the moment he dropped out, Biden and his team insisted he was staying in.\n\nBiden's team created a public schedule for the president over the past week that was intended to show his ability to stay in the race.\n\nOn Monday, he held another television interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, where he acknowledged his subpar debate performance while criticizing the media for focusing on his gaffes instead of Trump's falsehoods. Biden again said he had no intention of stepping aside.\n\nBiden then traveled to Las Vegas for campaign stops, speeches planned at the NAACP National Convention and the UnidosUS annual conference, and interviews with BET and Univision. Biden told BET News' Ed Gordon that the only thing that would push him to reconsider his reelection bid would be a \"medical condition.\"\n\nThe president spoke at the NAACP conference, but before he could make his speech Wednesday at UnidosUS, he was dealt another blow: the positive Covid-19 diagnosis.\n\nThe president returned to his Rehoboth Beach home that day to isolate, his public schedule shuttered indefinitely while he recovered.\n\nRelated article Here's what happened the last time a president chose not to run for a second term\n\nOn Friday, Biden issued a statement that he would be back on the campaign trail the following week, while Biden campaign chair O'Malley Dillon went on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" to say Biden was \"absolutely\" staying in the race.\n\nThe campaign also put out a memo saying there was \"no plan for an alternative nominee.\"\n\nBiden called some Democrats over the weekend who were out on TV on his behalf. Two told CNN that the president voiced his gratitude and then his anger at those who were trying to push him out. \"There was some hurt in his voice but mostly anger,\" one of the Biden loyalists said.\n\nEven on Sunday, Biden's team continued to publicly maintain he wasn't going anywhere. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a key Biden ally, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that Biden and Harris \"have received over 14 million votes to be our standard bearers. That's where we are,\" Clyburn. The congressman's 2020 endorsement of Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary was widely seen as instrumental in Biden's victory.\n\nBiden spoke to Harris on Sunday before announcing his decision, which came in two messages: The first saying he was dropping out, and the second endorsing his vice president to be the Democratic nominee.\n\nBiden told his senior-most team he was getting out around 1:45 p.m., and the public letter went out right around then, a source familiar with the timing told CNN.\n\n\"Before that, it was all steam ahead that he's running,\" the same source said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Kayla Tausche, Dana Bash, John King, Jamie Gangel, Betsy Klein, Sam Fossum, Manu Raju, Samantha Waldenberg, Donald Judd and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Biden defeats Trump in an election he made about character of the nation and the President\n\nAmerica has chosen Democrat Joe Biden as its 46th president, CNN projects, turning at a time of national crisis to a man whose character was forged by aching personal tragedy and who is pledging to restore calm and truth after Donald Trump 's exhausting and manic single term.\n\nIn a victory speech Saturday night in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, Biden said he was humbled by the trust America had placed in him and reached out to those Americans who did not vote for him.\n\n\"I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now, let's give each other a chance,\" Biden said. \"This is the time to heal in America.\"\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, his running mate, who will make history as the first woman, the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to become vice president, noted the significance of her place on the stage Saturday night.\n\n\"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities,\" Harris said.\n\nEarlier in the day, the vice president-elect posted a video on Twitter of her victory call with Biden: \"We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next  President of the United States.\"\n\nTrump, who was on the golf course when CNN and other networks called the race for the former vice president, has shown no indication that he intends to concede. While en route to his course in Virginia, he tweeted: \"I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!\"\n\nBut Biden supporters - whose face masks reflected the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic-era election poured into the streets across the country in a moment of catharsis to celebrate the President-elect's victory.\n\nAfter four years of Trump's incessant lies, bullying and vilification of his political opponents, the former vice president said he was running to restore the character of the nation and bring dignity back to the White House. Biden, who turns 78 at the end of this month, will become the oldest president when he is inaugurated in January amid the worst public health emergency in 100 years, the deepest economic slump since the 1930s and a national reckoning on racism and police brutality that is still unresolved.\n\nHis election will end Trump's tumultuous hold on Washington and condemn the Republican, who has had a lifelong obsession with winning, to the ranks of chief executives who lost after a single term.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama released a statement that served as testimonial to the character of his former vice president and asked Americans to set aside their political differences and give him a chance.\n\n\"When he walks into the White House in January, he'll face a series of extraordinary challenges no incoming President ever has - a raging pandemic, an unequal economy and justice system, a democracy at risk, and a climate in peril,\" Obama wrote. \"I know he'll do the job with the best interests of every American at heart, whether or not he had their vote.\"\n\nThe former President asked every American to \"give him a chance and lend him your support.\"\n\n\"The election results at every level show that the country remains deeply and bitterly divided,\" Obama said. \"It will be up to not just Joe and Kamala, but each of us, to do our part - to reach out beyond our comfort zone, to listen to others, to lower the temperature and find some common ground from which to move forward, all of us remembering that we are one nation, under God.\"\n\nIn a cinematic twist, it was Biden's boyhood state of Pennsylvania that put him over the 270 electoral vote threshold and delivered the White House. Trump had held a wide lead over Biden on the night of the election, but as election officials counted hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots, the race shifted dramatically in Biden's favor, infuriating Trump and his allies, who knew the President's path to the White House was over without the commonwealth.\n\nThat the Keystone State was the last hurdle in Biden's path to the White House was a fitting end to a hard-fought race given that the former vice president has long cultivated his image as \"middle-class Joe\" from Scranton. In a visit that now seems almost prophetic, he had made a final trip to his childhood home in the city on Election Day after spending much of the campaign promising to prioritize the livelihoods of the many working-class voters whom Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in her 2016 bid.\n\nOn one of the living room walls in the house where he grew up, he wrote: \"From this House to the White House with the Grace of God,\" signing his name and the date,\"11.3.2020.\"\n\nIn the final days of the race, Biden's team redoubled their efforts to rebuild the Democrats' \"blue wall\" - and that gambit paid off with Biden winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, according to CNN projections, while holding Minnesota, which the President made a priority in his reelection push.\n\nBiden will also win Nevada, CNN projects, widening his Electoral College lead as ballots continue to be counted around the country. Georgia could head to a recount and votes were still trickling in from Arizona, where Biden is maintaining an edge.\n\nBiden currently holds a 279-214 margin in the Electoral College.\n\nAs he watched his hopes of reelection being strangled with each tranche of votes in Pennsylvania, Trump lashed out on Twitter during the tense vote count, attempting to undermine democratic institutions with demands like \"STOP THE COUNT.\"\n\nThe President falsely claimed the election was being stolen from him as many mail-in ballots, which were often counted after Election Day votes, landed in the column of his opponent.\n\nFacing a deeply polarized country, Biden had tried to project comity and patience, and his desire to unite America.\n\n\"There will not be blue states and red states when we win. Just the United States of America,\" Biden said Wednesday afternoon. \"We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger than anything that can tear us apart.\"\n\nPart of Trump's frustration stemmed from the fact that his campaign's finely tuned ground game did in fact succeed in turning out many more of the so-called \"hidden Trump voters\" than expected, making the race a much tighter contest than pre-election polls suggested.\n\nTrump continued to cast aspersions on the electoral process - wrongly suggesting that there was something nefarious about the fact that the vote count in key states continued well after Tuesday night, as is customary in US elections.\n\nMeanwhile, his team mounted a series of lawsuits in several states, including Pennsylvania, looking to stop vote counting in some areas while challenging how closely observers can monitor officials counting the votes in others. The Trump campaign also said it would demand a recount in Wisconsin, where Biden led Trump by some 20,000 votes, even though historically a margin of that magnitude is unlikely to be reversed.\n\nThe victory of Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., who forged a 50-year career as senator and vice president from his Delaware homestead, is a full circle moment that comes more than 30 years after his first presidential campaign.\n\nBiden's life of tragedy - he buried his first wife and his first daughter, and his adult son Beau, who died in 2015, survived two brain aneurysms and stayed in politics after two failed White House campaigns - shaped his image as a man of resilience and decency. Those qualities made him America's choice as a president who could shoulder the grief of a nation traumatized by the loss of more than 234,000 citizens to Covid-19, with millions unemployed in an environment of intense economic uncertainty.\n\nBiden's victory means that Trump's rage-filled presidency - powered by his nationalism, toxic racial appeals, incessant lying and assault on democratic institutions - may come to be seen as a historical aberration rather than a new normal.\n\nBut Biden faces a huge task in uniting the country and addressing America's disillusionment with establishment figures like him, which led to the current President's political rise as an outsider who was elected on a wave of populism in 2016.\n\nBiden is pledging to restore America's \"soul,\" which he says was compromised by Trump's divisive approach, and to purge the President's \"America First\" foreign policy and rebuild Washington's traditional position of global leadership.\n\nBut Democrats dreaming of a \"New Deal\" style era of reform on health care, the economy, climate change, race and possibly even expanding the Supreme Court will see their ambitions tempered by their lack of gains in the balance of power in Congress.\n\nThe Democrats will maintain control of the House of Representatives , CNN projected Saturday, but Republicans fared far better than expected in many House races around the country.\n\nWithin a divided government, much of Biden's energy will have to be focused on halting a pandemic that is getting worse. Health experts at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation project say the virus could claim nearly 400,000 Americans lives by the time Biden is sworn in.\n\nA country weary of nearly a year of lockdowns, separation from family and friends, and economic deprivation will need to be mobilized to adopt aggressive new steps to conquer a pandemic that Biden argued the Trump administration essentially gave up fighting.\n\nThe much-anticipated arrival of a vaccine that experts hope would be widely available in 2021 is a potential ray of hope, though it will be many months before life is back to normal. That means that Biden's first year - the time when a new President's power is maximized - will be dominated by the coronavirus.\n\nAnd it remains uncertain whether Biden's pragmatic instincts, his lonely belief that a new era of cooperation is possible with Republicans, and his desire to preserve a winning coalition that included moderates and Never Trumpers could lead to early clashes with Democratic progressives.\n\nBiden's task is complicated by inheriting a political climate intensely polarized by Trump's presidency. After months of predictions by the President that the election will be \"rigged,\" Trump's supporters see the Democrat's victory as illegitimate, confounding his hopes of forging national unity.\n\nA battle for the future ideological direction of the Republican Party between the President's partisans and more traditional conservatives in the post-Trump era could sow further discord in Washington. And the chances that Trump will simply fade into history seem minimal given the real estate mogul's history of controlling the news cycle as he weaponizes his Twitter feed to settle political grievances.\n\nBiden's international aspirations also face challenges. The world has moved on during four years of American distraction. China has accelerated its power plays in Asia and around the world, and a new Cold War looms. US allies wonder whether America can be trusted anymore and how long the internationalist restoration in Washington will last. Confrontations with North Korea, Iran and Russia are even more acute than when President Barack Obama left office.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect Kamala Harris' South Asian ancestry.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Biden finally seems comfortable talking about his age\n\nAfter months of having to defend his age, President Joe Biden seems willing to discuss it - and its limitations - openly. Sitting for an interview on \"The View\" on Wednesday, he subtly acknowledged how age factored into his decision to drop out of the election .\n\nWhen the show's five co-hosts asked the 81-year-old Biden about his decision to end his reelection campaign, he first responded by pushing back against the idea that a Democratic coup forced him out .\n\n\"I never fully believed the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance of my running again. I didn't sense that,\" Biden said. He said that his polling remained within reasonable ranges, though in reality, his numbers dipped significantly after his June debate against former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the president soon switched to a different topic - while maintaining a humorous tone, Biden seemed to recognize that being history's oldest presidential candidate posed legitimate challenges.\n\n\"There were some folks who liked to see me step aside so they had a chance to move on. I get that. That's just human nature,\" he said, nothing that wasn't the reason he stepped down.\n\nBiden said it's hard for him to think about or vocalize how old he has gotten.\n\n\"I stepped down because I started thinking about it,\" he said.\n\n\"It's hard for me to even say how old I am,\" he added.\n\nThe hosts laughed, but Biden pressed on his earnestness: \"No, I'm serious!\"\n\nHe then moved into a more lighthearted cadence, joking with one of the hosts about their shared age. While Biden stopped short of pinning his decision on his age alone, he openly hinted at the toll being an 86-year-old president would have taken. In the past, he's said that he chose to step down to prevent damaging down-ballot Democrats' chances of winning their races.\n\nBiden started defending his age well before his disastrous debate performance against Trump, who, at 78, is now the oldest candidate to run for president. Questions began to plague him in February after special counsel Robert Hur called him \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\" in a report.\n\nAt his State of the Union speech in March , Biden simultaneously joked about and worked hard to justify his age. Voters repeatedly expressed he was too old to seek reelection despite reports from his doctor that he is in good health.\n\nBeyond his tacit recognition of his limitations, Biden yet again insisted he is \"confident\" he could have beat Trump.\n\nBiden's disdain for his longtime opponent was on full display. When Whoopi Goldberg, one of the hosts , compared Trump to a bug, Biden slapped the table, miming killing the insect to raucous applause.\n\nHe also expressed his confidence in Vice President Kamala Harris, calling her \"tough\" and \"honorable.\"\n\nHe said that as his number two, she takes on a range of responsibilities, dealing with foreign and domestic policy alike.\n\nUltimately, Biden said he is \"at peace\" with his decision. Now unburdened by the task of defending his health on the campaign trail, he may be more at peace with his age, too.\n\nJump to"

They became close friends, bonding over their shared Roman Catholic faith, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 .\n\nIn Washington, the two have worked together on a variety of domestic issues, including the Violence Against Women Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. When Biden served as vice president, he consulted with Pelosi on legislation, leaning on his 36 years of experience as a senator representing Delaware. And once Biden became president himself, the two collaborated on a bold Democratic policy agenda.\n\nThe pair's mutual respect and partnership have generally been strong throughout his tenure as president.\n\nUp until just a few months ago, Pelosi was considered one of his most adept and consistent advocates. And during the earlier part of Biden's presidency, she was critical in shepherding many of his priorities through the House.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "What we do - and don't - know about Biden and Trump's health\n\nMuch has been made of President Joe Biden's health recently, with top Democrats and donors wondering whether the 81 year old is fit to serve another term. Though Donald Trump has escaped much of the age-related spotlight recently, he is 78 and the second-oldest person to ever seek the presidency.\n\nIn his defiant responses to questions about his debate performance, Biden continues to insist that he is in tip-top shape. He maintains that his fumbling answers stemmed from jet-lag, a cold, and exhaustion, not an underlying health concern .\n\n\"Look, I have a cognitive test every day,\" he said in an interview on Friday with ABC News.\n\nPresidents and presidential candidates choose what to test and share about their health, leaving much up for speculation. Even before last month's debate, a professor of neurology at Harvard said that both Trump and Biden should take a \"full-blown neuropsychological exam,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nAs age threatens to upend the entire election, what do we actually know about the candidates' health?\n\nJoe Biden\n\nCompared to Trump, Biden has released far more comprehensive medical information, with the most recent update coming in February of 2024 . Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the White House physician, published a six-page report detailing Biden's conditions, test results, medications, and vitals.\n\nAccording to O'Connor, the president suffers from sleep apnea, gastric reflux, and a stiffened gait, among other conditions. A neurological exam related to his gait \"was again reassuring,\" the report specified, and did not indicate a stroke, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis. The president exercises five days a week, weighs 178 pounds, and has a blood pressure of 132/78.\n\nDespite the detail, though, O'Connor has not sat for interviews, as is traditional, according to The Times. Furthermore, his report included no supporting documentation. In February, O'Connor concluded that Biden did not need to take the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery, a slate of 33 tests that looks for dementia and other brain abnormalities.\n\nOne cognitive test is not sufficient to detect issues, doctors told the Wall Street Journal . While basic tests measure memory, executive functioning, language, and judgment, only PET scans and other more comprehensive exams help doctors make diagnoses about conditions like Alzheimer's.\n\nVisitor logs indicate that an expert on Parkinson's disease visited the White House eight times between July 2023 and March of this year, meeting at least once with O'Connor. It's not yet clear if the specialist visited the White House to discuss Biden in particular or other matters, The Times reported.\n\nBiden doesn't seem poised to undergo comprehensive neurological examinations anytime soon, despite the chorus calling on him to do so.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTrump boasts about his vitality often and even said he \"aced\" two cognitive tests during the recent debate. The public, however, knows shockingly little about the former president's health.\n\nIn November, 2023, Trump's personal physician blasted out a glowing, vague, three-paragraph summary about his cognitive and physical abilities. In it, Dr. Bruce Aronwald said that he has conducted \"several comprehensive examinations\" and called Trump's cognitive exams \"exceptional.\" His physical results, the brief report continues, were all within the normal range. Aronwald's report did not include any details about Trump's medications, blood pressure, or cholesterol levels.\n\nSome have drawn attention to Trump's weight in the past, but Aronwald noted that he has shed some pounds, though didn't specify how many. Trump was weighed the Fulton County Jail during one of his criminal trials in August, 2023. According to that reading, he weighed 215 pounds, though some question the measurement.\n\nIn 2018, Trump asked to take the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, which screens for dementia, and boasted about his perfect score. Like Biden, though, Trump has made significant public gaffes, such as when he called the president of Egypt the \"president of Mexico.\"\n\nDoctors note that the test does not measure intelligence and say anyone without dementia should score perfectly. Trump's father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in his mid-80s , putting the former president at higher risk for the disease.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "New York Times editorial board says Biden has 'put the country at risk' by remaining in the presidential race\n\nPresident Joe Biden has emphatically said in recent days that he's not abandoning his reelection bid, a decision that continues to divide Democrats eager to stave off former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden's poor debate performance against Trump has set off major alarm bells with many Democratic voters, lawmakers, and donors - a scenario that they didn't envision in the lead-up to the party's August convention in Chicago.\n\nFor more than a year, The New York Times has extensively covered issues tied to voter concerns about Biden's age, often pointing to polling which showed that a majority of the 81-year-old president's 2020 supporters felt as though he was too old to seek reelection.\n\nAfter last month's debate, The Times' editorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom, called on Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee.\n\nAnd this week, the board once again urged Biden to leave the race, arguing that the president was seeking to \"defy reality\" by remaining the Democratic Party's standard-bearer.\n\n\"For more than a year, voters have made it unquestionably clear in surveys and interviews that they harbor significant doubts about Mr. Biden's physical and mental fitness for office,\" the board wrote. \"Mr. Biden has disregarded the concerns of those voters - his fellow citizens - and put the country at significant risk by continuing to insist that he is the best Democrat to defeat Mr. Trump.\"\n\nThe board criticized Biden's dismissal of poll numbers showing him trailing Trump in most national surveys and holding no major advantage in critical swing states, writing that the president has \"adopted a favorite theme of the floundering politician\" by doing so.\n\nAnd the board also pleaded with Democrats - from grassroots organizers and top leaders within the party - to have heart-to-heart conversations with Biden about his candidacy.\n\n\"They need to tell him that he is embarrassing himself and endangering his legacy,\" the board wrote. \"He needs to hear, plain and clear, that he is no longer an effective spokesman for his own priorities.\"\n\nWhen Biden won in 2020, many Democrats assumed that he would only serve for one term and would be a \"bridge\" to younger leaders within the party. But as Biden defended his reelection bid , he leaned into his age as an important part of his life experience.\n\nThe president in recent days has sought to squelch any idea that he'll forgo his reelection bid. However, several House Democrats have asked him to step aside, and if there's a noticeable slide in his swing-state numbers in the coming days, there will likely be more vocal pressure on the White House as lawmakers eye their political futures.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Biden played key role in pushing US to take hardline stances on crime in 1990s, and now he's apologizing as 2020 looms\n\nAs former Vice President Joe Biden mulls a potential 2020 presidential run, he's apologizing for his past stances on criminal-justice issues.\n\nIn a speech on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in Washington, the former vice president acknowledged the detrimental impact of his approach to crime in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n\"You know I've been in this fight for a long time. It goes not just to voting rights. It goes to the criminal justice system,\" Biden said at the National Action Network's Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast. \"I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried.\"\n\nBiden helped write an infamous 1994 crime bill - the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. That bill is widely pointed to as one of the driving factors of mass incarceration in the US , as well as the disproportionate number of people of color who've ended up behind bars for drug-related crimes.\n\nSome experts contend the impact of the bill, which was signed into the law by former President Bill Clinton, i s overblown. But Biden's involvement on criminal justice issues goes well beyond the bill, which already represents an easy point of attack if he runs for president.\n\nHere's the national 1989 speech Sen. Joe Biden gave where he attacked President Bush 41 for being soft on crime and drugs, & demanded more prosecutions & prison for drug dealers & *users*: led not only to the 1994 Crime Bill but major escalation of the Drug War & Penal State: pic.twitter.com/sg36rV30Zz\n\nWithout specifically naming the 1994 bill on Monday, Biden said the decisions that were made in that era \"trapped an entire generation.\"\n\n\"It was a big mistake when it was made,\" Biden said.\n\nIn an apparent reference to sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine, he added, \"We were told by the experts that 'crack, you never go back,' that the two were somehow fundamentally different. It's not. But it's trapped an entire generation.\"\n\nThe vice president went on to say that \"white America\" needs to do more to address and recognize systemic racism.\n\n\"There's something we have to admit - not you - we, white America, has to admit, there's still a systematic racism and it goes almost unnoticed by so many of us,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden was less conciliatory about the 1994 crime bill in his 2017 memoir, \"Promise Me, Dad,\" in which the former vice president contended the legislation helped put 100,000 police officers out on the streets and drove down escalating rates of violent crime across the country.\n\nSimilarly, in a 2016 interview with CNBC, Biden said he was \"not at all\" ashamed of his role in supporting the bill and said it \"restored American cities.\"\n\n\"In fact, I drafted the bill,\" Biden said at the time. \"And by the way, we talk about this mostly in terms of Black Lives Matter. Black lives really do matter, but the problem is institutionalized racism in America.\"\n\n\"There are things I would change,\" he added on the 1994 bill. \"But, by and large, what it really did: It restored American cities.\"\n\nDespite his efforts and involvement in criminal justice reform with the Obama administration, Biden's past statements on this bill and his overall record on criminal justice could haunt him if he ends up running in 2020.\n\nAs a senator, Biden spearheaded the Democratic Party's war on crime and drugs. He drafted or co-sponsored legislation that created the federal \"drug czar,\" mandatory minimum sentencing for marijuana, and the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Time , Biden said, \"I am not only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar, but I'm also the guy who spent years when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of [the Senate Foreign Relations Committee] trying to change drug policy relative to cocaine, for example, crack and powder.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's husband's record on crime as president was damaging to her 2016 campaign for president, despite efforts to apologize. Biden, if he runs, is poised to face just as much criticism if not more so on this issue.\n\nJump to"

Democrats find themselves adrift, casting about for a compelling messenger.\n\nWhoever that is, it's not Biden, many party activists and donors contend. He's tethered to the 2024 defeat and, at 82, is a symbol more of the party's past than its future, they argue.\n\n\"Who's going to want Joe Biden back in the game?\" said a major Biden supporter, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about him.\n\nA spokesperson for the DNC didn't provide a comment or make Martin available for an interview.\n\nA new NBC News poll shows that the Democratic Party's popularity has dropped to a record low. Only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party - the lowest figure in the network's polling dating to 1990.\n\nAsked about the prospect of Biden re-entering the political sphere, President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday, \"I hope so.\"\n\nFormer first lady Jill Biden is also prepared to campaign and raise money for fellow Democrats as she and her husband settle into life back home in Delaware, a person close to her said.\n\n\"She recognizes that serving in the capacities that she served is an honor and it comes with responsibilities to the party. And she's prepared to help in any way she can,\" the person said.\n\nBoth Bidens are carving out post-presidential lives aside from the partisan political work they've volunteered to take on.\n\nEach plans to write a book. As Biden develops a theme for his memoir, he has been consulting former senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior White House advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti.\n\nHe has been splitting his time between Delaware and Washington for meetings in office space supplied by the federal government. As was his habit as a U.S. senator, he often commutes via Amtrak.\n\nThe onetime first couple were shocked when Trump abruptly announced this week that he was ending Secret Service protection for their two adult children, Hunter and Ashley, the person close to Jill Biden said. They'd gotten no warning, another person familiar with the matter said. Their first question was whether their two children would be safe.\n\nThe Bidens have been out of office for only two months. After Trump's first term ended in 2021, then-President Biden extended protection for Trump's adult children for six months.\n\nThough Biden is willing to help, Democrats aren't unanimous in wanting them to. Some party activists believe Biden is an admired figure who remains a draw inside a grateful party.\n\nJane Kleeb, a vice chair of the DNC, said in an interview: \"If you were to call any state party chair and ask them if they wanted Joe Biden to be a keynote speaker for their annual dinner, the answer would be yes. He is beloved by the party and beloved by the voters.\"\n\nOthers argue that reminding voters of a 2024 campaign that went sour isn't the best strategy for a party that is grasping for a message and searching for new, younger leaders. A CNN poll this month asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents which leader best reflects the party's core values. Only 1% chose Biden.\n\nWhat's more, the wounds of 2024 are still fresh, with many Democrats aggrieved over Biden's decision to run again and remain in the race until just a few months before the election, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris little time to organize a campaign of her own.\n\nAlan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser from Philadelphia, said in an interview: \"There are plenty of people in the Democratic Party who were obviously very frustrated with how things played out last year, but there are plenty of people who still love Joe Biden.\"\n\nAt the \"appropriate time,\" Biden can be an asset to the party by campaigning in selected areas, such as his hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, but now isn't it, Kessler added.\n\n\"It's time to move on with new leadership,\" he said.\n\nBiden has no pangs of regret, a person familiar with his private conversations said. He remains defiant and believes Trump's victory shows the party did itself no favors by pushing him to drop out of the race, the source said.\n\nOne person in particular seems eager to see Biden return to the political stage: Trump. The new president has used his massive following to ensure that Americans don't soon forget the old one.\n\nTrump has publicly mentioned Biden, Biden family members or the Biden administration an average of seven times a day since the start of his second term, according to an NBC News review of his remarks, interviews and social media posts.\n\nOverall, Trump has invoked his predecessor in some form more than 400 times since the inauguration on Jan. 20. In most instances - more than 325 - Trump has mentioned Biden alone. In about 75 cases, Trump has mentioned Biden family members or the Biden administration.\n\nThe context in which Trump brings up his predecessor often involves immigration, inflation, elections or foreign wars, as well as issues involving the Justice Department.\n\nSpeaking at the Justice Department last week, Trump questioned Biden's use of an autopen to sign documents, calling it \"disrespectful to the office\" and \" maybe not even valid .\"\n\nThe Justice Department blessed the use of an autopen in a memo in 2005, and the Constitution carries no requirement that the president sign documents by his own hand.\n\nVice President JD Vance also uses Biden as a foil. At a tech summit this week, Vance took time in his speech to take a swipe at Biden's mental acuity - an issue that dogged the former president throughout the campaign.\n\n\"In defense of Joe Biden, he was asleep most of the time. I don't think he totally realized what he was doing,\" Vance said.\n\nAsked why Trump speaks about Biden so frequently, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"We still very much are fixing so many of the problems created or started by the Biden administration. It's important to remind the American people and media why these problems exist.\"\n\nA defense that Trump supporters use in rationalizing his attacks on perceived political foes is that he's a \"counterpuncher.\" But here, Biden has already left the ring. He hasn't thrown any public punches since Trump escorted him to the helicopter on Inauguration Day for his departure from the U.S. Capitol grounds.\n\nIndeed, Biden's first speaking event since he left office came last week with no fanfare whatsoever. He appeared in New York City for a conference of the National High School Model United Nations in Manhattan. Six months after having spoken before the actual U.N. for his last time as president, Biden gave a speech to its high school facsimile in a hotel ballroom. He also took questions and posed for pictures with students.\n\n\"He asked me about my future, and I told him how much he inspired me to go into the field of politics,\" said Suzy Radzinski, 18, a senior at Brighton High School in Utah, who met Biden on the photo line.\n\nA Facebook video from the event showed a group of excited students waving to Biden. \"I met you on your book tour!\" one shouted to him as he stood onstage in a suit and tie. \"All right!\" said Biden, prompting appreciative laugher.\n\nInside Biden's close-knit circle, advisers have concluded that it's not wise for him to respond publicly to every insult or accusation Trump throws his way. Doing so would personalize the issue, turning it into a contest between Trump and Biden, as opposed to keeping the focus on whether Trump is being truthful or not.\n\nBiden's approach for now is to let surrogates respond to Trump's broadsides. Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist, said that's the right posture.\n\n\"It makes no sense for Joe Biden to respond to Donald Trump,\" she said in an interview. \"The American people are not looking backward; they're looking forward.\"\n\nRather than take the attacks personally, Jill Biden has found a new role for herself: soothing those who are unnerved by the tumult in Washington, the person close to her said.\n\n\"She is finding herself comforting people. More and more, as she's out and about, people come up to her who are looking for reassurance,\" the person said.\n\nPeter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News.\n\nCarol E.

      "text": "'One of the great tragedies of American politics': Biden ends 5 decades in public life\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nJoe Biden ascended to the highest office in America with a pledge to unite the country, strengthen his party and defend democracy.\n\nInstead, in the 82-year-old's Oval Office denouement, he leaves a nation divided , a party in tatters and the American people questioning the self-described institutionalist's respect for the rule of law.\n\nMany Democrats are blaming Biden for handing the White House to Donald Trump, criticizing the aging politician for staying in office too long and reeling after he pardoned his son . Exacerbating the frustrations, Biden recently expressed doubt about his ability to serve another four years after dismissing voters' concerns about that very issue as he sought re-election.\n\nThe president harbors similar resentment toward members of his own party. After the November election, he privately mused about the idea of pardoning Trump as a magnanimous move, according to a person directly familiar with his comments, though it's not clear he seriously considered it. A White House official said \"to our knowledge, this was not raised.\" At the same time, Biden is not on speaking terms with some of his closest allies.\n\nIt is all an inglorious coda to five decades in public office.\n\n\"The Joe Biden story is one of the great tragedies of American politics. I really mean that. He should be having a glorious, well deserved, highly acclaimed retirement. And he's not,\" veteran Democratic political strategist James Carville said. \"It's hard to blame anybody but him.\"\n\nBiden plans to write another book, providing him with the opportunity to tell his version of his presidency and its conclusion. Despite public polls showing in 2023 that Democratic voters did not want him to run again, he went forward anyway, with the backing of party insiders . He was later forced to step aside in July following a cataclysmic debate that seemed to expose his cognitive state . His late departure gave Vice President Kamala Harris just 107 days to build an ultimately unsuccessful campaign against Trump. Throughout his presidency, Biden granted fewer interviews than his recent predecessors and is ending his term the same way: He does not plan to hold the traditional final formal news conference.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Biden is proud of the number of interviews and impromptu question-and-answer sessions he's held with reporters.\n\nIn the White House, the mood feels \"like a morgue,\" according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don't appreciate. Privately, he has vacillated from feeling melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy, two people close to him said.\n\n\"He's totally dejected and the people around him are, as well,\" another person close to the president said. One White House official attributed the glum atmosphere to Trump's impending return to the Oval Office and noted that Biden's aides warmly reacted with cheers when he surprised them at a staff party earlier this week.\n\nAnother White House official depicted personnel as holding back on emotions until Jan. 20 actually arrives.\n\n\"It's hard to reflect, it's hard for it to sink in that we're done here - until we're actually done and out the gates with our stuff,\" said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. That's their mood ... it hasn't sunk in for people who are still here yet because we're working until the last minute.\"\n\nOnce the elder statesman who was to serve as a bridge to the next generation of leadership, Biden departs with an array of fractured relationships. He is estranged from some of the people who were once among his most powerful allies. He harbors, along with first lady Jill Biden, a simmering resentment toward former President Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several former aides, including Bob Bauer and Anita Dunn, all of whom he believes either failed him or pushed him out of the 2024 race, according to several people close to him.\n\nBiden hasn't spoken in months to Dunn, a former top adviser who was among the few notable Democrats willing to back him if he decided to mount a 2016 campaign to challenge Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination, according to multiple people familiar with the dynamic. Dunn departed the White House during the summer as part of the fallout from Biden's June debate performance.\n\nBiden's relationship with Bauer, his longtime personal lawyer who is married to Dunn, also has deteriorated since the debate and tensions related to the criminal trials of his son Hunter Biden, the people familiar with the situation said. Neither Bauer nor Dunn attended a large black-tie dinner the Bidens hosted in November to thank longtime supporters. And Bauer will no longer represent Biden once he leaves office, three people familiar with the decision said.\n\nAsked about this deterioration of his relationship with Dunn and Bauer, a Biden aide said, \"Anita and Bob are well regarded and loyal to the president.\"\n\nWhile Biden and Pelosi have crossed paths at social events since she pushed for him to end his candidacy in July, they have not had a substantive conversation, according to a Pelosi aide.\n\n\"That relationship is permanently damaged,\" a person close to Biden said.\n\nBiden has not expressed his frustrations with Obama directly to him, a person familiar with their conversations said.\n\nOne former top Obama aide who publicly argued after the June debate that Biden should drop out pointedly noted this week that Biden recently named aircraft carriers after former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, he has not offered any similar honor to Obama.\n\n\"Barack H. Obama did not get a f---ing personnel carrier named after him,\" Ben Rhodes said on the podcast \"Pod Save The World.\"\n\nBefore he left office, Obama surprised Biden by awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in an emotional White House ceremony.\n\nAsked about the president's frustrations with Pelosi and Obama, Bates, the White House spokesperson, said in a statement, \"President Biden's focus is squarely on making as big of a difference as he can in the lives of American families - not events from the campaign.\"\n\nBiden went back on his promise to protect the norms he said undergirded the nation's stability by pardoning his Hunter Biden on federal gun and tax charges. The president blamed \"raw politics\" for his son's prosecution, saying it \"infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,\" tapping the kind of language Trump often uses. Biden was surprised, and angered, by Democrats' criticism of the pardon, according to multiple people familiar with his reaction. Dunn was among those who publicly criticized the move.\n\nThroughout his term, Biden felt the tug-of-war between his White House inner circle and his family members. Some of his family felt at times that the president was not being served well by his team, which has included Dunn, former top White House aide and then campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and longtime close advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. That was particularly the case as the 2024 campaign got into full swing and Biden's approval rating continued to sag while Trump gained ground among voters.\n\nBiden didn't make changes to his team until after he dropped out of the 2024 race. In the weeks and months after that gut-wrenching decision, anger intensified from some of his family members toward his closest aides.\n\nIn some instances, it flowed both ways. Dunn and Bauer resented being unceremoniously cast out of the president's inner circle and blamed two Biden family members in particular for that - Hunter Biden and Jill Biden.Aspects of the family drama could continue into the next administration. Some members of the president's staff are bracing for possible congressional investigations into Hunter Biden's pardon and accusations, denied by the White House, that administration officials covered up the extent of Biden's mental decline.\n\nBiden has argued that he set up the country for long-term economic success after shepherding major pieces of legislation through Congress - even if Americans don't feel the benefits now. He also sees his efforts to unite U.S. allies around Ukraine after Russia's invasion as a critical foreign policy achievement.\n\nIn a major development Wednesday, Israel and Hamas struck a deal for a ceasefire after 15 months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. Biden worked to achieve a ceasefire deal for months, but he now shares some credit for it with Trump, given their two teams coordinated on the round of negotiations that secured the agreement.\n\nWhen reporters asked Biden at a Wednesday news conference whether he or Trump deserves credit for the ceasefire, Biden turned and smiled : \"Is that a joke?\"\n\nBates, the White House spokesperson, said of the president's record in office: \"President Biden put his unique qualification and his whole heart into delivering for the American people, and the results are the strongest record of any modern administration.\"Critics have relentlessly hit Biden for softening border policies early on in his administration, prompting a surge in illegal crossings. While he later tightened controls at the border, public opinion had already swung against him .\n\nSome Democrats said Biden missed the mark early on when it came to the economy. He should have spent more time railing against greedy corporations rather than trying to convince the public the economy really was better than it thought, said Pete Giangreco, a veteran in presidential Democratic politics.\n\n\"There was always this internal struggle from the day he walked into the White House: Was he Joe from Scranton, the populist, union guy? Or is he Joe the senator from Delaware, which is corporate friendly?\" Giangreco said. \"He could never make up his mind who he was. If he had been Joe from Scranton from day one and stayed Joe from Scranton from day one, it might have been a different outcome.\"\n\nBiden paid a political price for the pandemic-era policies of the last two presidencies, said Lynn Vavreck, an American politics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Many voters became accustomed to the subsidies the Trump and the Biden administrations doled out and then watched prices go up as the subsidies ran out - a double whammy that hit when Trump was long gone from office.\n\n\"They believed that they were better off financially during the Trump presidency,\" Vavreck said. \"That is probably true for very, very many people because of those government stimulus payments and all of the support\" for aid programs.\n\nBut another longtime ally, prominent Democratic donor John Morgan, said that Biden is right to feel bitter by the lack of fanfare around his presidency, pointing to massive investments in infrastructure, a booming stock market, low unemployment and for having navigated the pandemic \"masterfully.\"\n\n\"Objectively, I believe it was a great presidency. You know they believe it. You can hear it in the president's voice,'\" Morgan said. \"You look at all the statistics and it's like: 'Why aren't you all carrying me on your shoulders?'\" In the immediate term, it has all done little to move the public. Biden is poised to leave office with a 36% approval rating, according to a CNN poll released Wednesday. Low approval numbers dogged him throughout his presidency and now he's particularly smarting over leaving office without his standing with Americans having improved, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn an alternate universe, one in which Biden would have stepped aside as the Democratic nominee in 2023, the president would have ridden waves of accolades in his final weeks, cutting ribbons at airports named in his honor or banking hundreds of millions of dollars for an Ivy League policy center in his name, Carville suggested.\n\n\"Joe Biden had many successful acts in his life. Unfortunately, you get remembered for your last act,\" Carville said. \"Right now, he's remembered as the guy who stayed too long.\"\n\nNatasha Korecki is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nCarol E.

      "text": "In farewell speech, Biden warns an 'oligarchy' in America is threatening democracy\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nPresident Joe Biden 's farewell address Wednesday came with a series of warnings for the future of the country, among them that a rising \"oligarchy taking shape\" threatens American democracy.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's comments, delivered from the Oval Office, seemed clearly aimed at billionaire Elon Musk, who has been at the side of President-elect Donald Trump since his election win, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBiden recalled former President Dwight Eisenhower's warning against a \"military-industrial complex\" in which he used his 1961 farewell address to caution against \"the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power.\"\n\n\"Six decades later, I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex,\" Biden said. \"It could pose real dangers for our country as well.\"\n\nBiden also launched into a sharp criticism of social media platforms, arguing they are neglecting to fact-check.\n\n\"Social media is giving up on fact-checking. The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit,\" he said, appearing to refer to Meta 's ending its fact-checking program.\n\nBiden warned of the potential perils of artificial intelligence while calling it \"the most consequential technology of our time.\"\n\n\"Nothing offers more profound possibilities and risks for our economy and our security, our society,\" he said.\n\nBiden continued, arguing that without safeguards, AI could \"spawn new threats to our rights, our way of life, to our privacy, how we work and how we protect our nation.\"\n\nBiden also seemed to swipe at his successor in arguing that the Constitution must be amended to \"make clear that no president\" is \"immune from the crimes that he or she commits while in office.\" A constitutional amendment would require deep support and bipartisanship at both the federal and state levels, making it unlikely in the near term.\n\nHis comments appeared to target Trump, who was impeached twice, indicted four times and convicted in Manhattan. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts and has routinely maintained that he did nothing wrong, and federal charges against him were dropped after he won the election.\n\n\"A president's power is not limited,\" Biden said. \"It's not absolute, and it shouldn't be.\"\n\nBiden also said he wishes the incoming Trump administration success.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday: \"It's not just about the last four years of his administration. He is stepping down from his career.\n\n\"So you can imagine the president has a lot to say, a lot of thoughts that he wants to share, really touch on the moment that we're in right now,\" she added.\n\nIn a letter Wednesday previewing his prime-time remarks, Biden highlighted the parts of his speech that touched on what he views as his key accomplishments, touting persistent job growth, lower prescription drug costs and investments in clean energy to fight climate change.\n\nHe said in his speech: \"Powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest: for power and profit. We must not be bullied into sacrificing the future, the future of our children and our grandchildren.\"\n\nHe began his farewell address highlighting the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, noting that the incoming Trump administration would implement much of it.\n\nIf the agreement announced Wednesday afternoon goes into effect this weekend as planned, it would be a breakthrough in the protracted war that has weighed on Biden's presidency and prompted criticism from within his own party.\n\nIn his letter and his speech, Biden did not refer to Trump by name but made indirect references to him.\n\n\"I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. And that's still the case,\" he said in the letter.\n\nHe said in his address that serving as president has been \"the highest honor of my life.\"\n\n\"I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands, a nation where the strengths of our institutions and the character of our people matter and must endure,\" he said. \"Now it's your turn to stand guard. May you all be the keeper of the flame. May you keep the faith.\"\n\nBiden has yet to lay out specifics for his post-presidency plans.\n\nHe and first lady Jill Biden plan to travel directly from the inauguration to Central California for personal time, three administration officials said. They plan to stay in Santa Barbara County, though wildfires in the Los Angeles region could affect their plans, officials said.\n\nLast week, a reporter asked Biden about his plans after he leaves office in terms of his role as a political figure: Will he speak out post-presidency or be \"out of sight and out of mind\"?\n\n\"I'm not going to be out of sight or out of mind,\" he responded.\n\nZoë Richards is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The choices we make today will determine our future,\" Biden said.\n\nHe said Russian President Vladimir Putin, for example, has \"failed\" at his goal of destroying Ukraine and NATO. \"But Ukraine is free,\" Biden said. \"NATO is bigger, stronger, more united than ever before, with two new members: Finland and Sweden.\"He said the world cannot let up in its protection of Ukraine against Russian aggression.\n\nBiden detailed Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed 1,200 people and included acts of sexual violence and the taking of many people into Gaza as hostages. In response, he said, innocent civilians in Gaza have experienced \"hell\" as Israel has sought to fight back against Hamas. He said the U.S. has put forward a cease-fire proposal that has been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, which he called on the parties to finalize.\n\n\"A diplomatic solution is still possible. In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security,\" said Biden, who also criticized the violence against innocent Palestinians in the West Bank and the need to strive for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians. Biden said Gaza is \"not the only conflict that deserves outrage,\" saying Sudan is embroiled in a civil war in which millions of people are on the brink of famine and hundreds of thousands are already suffering from it. \"The world needs to stop arming these generals,\" he said, adding that nations need to speak with one voice and demand that the war end.\n\nBiden spent several minutes toward the end of his speech focusing on artificial intelligence, saying it will change our ways of life, ways of work and ways of war. Biden said countries must ensure that AI supports, rather than undermines, because it can \"uplift and empower everyday people.\"\n\nBiden finished his remarks by sharing his decision over the summer to exit the presidential race and not seek re-election. \"Let us never forget, some things are more important than staying in power,\" he said. \"It's your people that matter the most. ... We are here to serve the people - not the other way around.\" Biden said that \"every age faces its challenges\" and that he has witnessed moments of tension and uncertainty in his decades of public service, referring to the Cold War, the Vietnam War and the wars in the Middle East.\n\nBut, he argued, there's always a \"way forward.\"\n\n\"Things can get better,\" he said. \"We should never forget that. I've seen that throughout my career.\"\n\nHis speech comes against the backdrop of the presidential race on its final leg before Election Day, knowing that his successor - Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump - will face the same issues in the White House and may deal with them very differently.They were also Biden's first remarks before the General Assembly since Hamas' attack on Israel in October and the conflict that has ensued in Gaza, killing thousands of civilians. He spoke to the leaders of other nations as hope for a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas has dimmed.\n\nAs Israel continues its battle with Hamas, its conflict with Iran-backed Hezbollah has also escalated in recent days. On Monday, Israel launched airstrikes on neighboring Lebanon , whose government said nearly 500 people were killed and more than 1,600 were injured in Lebanon's deadliest day of conflict with Israel since 2006. Israel also issued evacuation warnings to people living in its northern region to escape the violence near the border.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby had told reporters last week that Biden would \"reaffirm America's leadership on the world stage\" and \"rally global action to tackle the world's most pressing challenges.\" They include, he said, climate change, artificial intelligence, the opioid epidemic and the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan .Kirby said Biden would meet with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres to \"talk about how the partnership between the United States and United Nations in advancing peace and safeguarding human rights can endure and to - prosper.\" Kirby said Biden will have engagements with foreign leaders Wednesday.\n\nBiden is also scheduled to host a summit of a coalition to address synthetic drug threats, including the supply chain of illicit fentanyl. Republicans have often accused him of not doing enough to tackle the problem as part of the strategy at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOther key speakers expected at the General Assembly include Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian ; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy; Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas; and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .\n\nBiden administration officials have been involved in negotiating a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas for months, though progress appears to have diminished. Defense Department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters last week: \"We do not believe that the deal is falling apart. We believe that that is the best way to end the war that's happening in Gaza and to lower those tensions in the region.\" Still, there have been no recent signs of a breakthrough.\n\nBiden also addressed his administration's 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, over which he has faced ongoing criticism from GOP lawmakers. Congressional Republicans who have been investigating the pullout recently released a scathing report . The administration and Democrats, on the other hand, have largely blamed Trump for what unfolded during the withdrawal.\n\nBiden said Tuesday that \"13 brave Americans lost their lives, along with hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bomb,\" referring to the attack at the Kabul airport. He said he thinks of those lost lives every day, the 2,461 U.S. troops who died during the 20-year war and the more than 20,000 Americans who were wounded. \"I think of their service, their sacrifice and their heroism,\" he said.\n\nBiden kicked off the week of global engagements near his hometown, Wilmington, Delaware, where he hosted the leaders of Australia, India and Japan on Saturday for a meeting of a security grouping known as the Quad .Though officials say the Quad is not aimed at any particular country and China was not explicitly mentioned in the four leaders' joint statement after the summit, Secretary of State Antony Blinken began the closed-door meeting by saying, \"Our first topic of discussion is China.\"\n\nBiden then said, \"China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region,\" in comments that were briefly caught on hot mics after journalists were escorted from the room.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday before the U.N., Biden briefly mentioned China, the world's second-largest economy, and reiterated U.S. policy, which is to \"responsibly manage the competition with China so it does not veer into conflict.\"\n\nAsked about Blinken's and Biden's comments Monday, a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson said that the U.S. is \"lying through its teeth\" when it says it is not targeting China and that groupings such as the Quad undermine regional peace and stability.\n\nBiden announced various initiatives during the summit, including a \"cancer moonshot\" partnership with the other countries to save lives in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The First Step Act, which became law in 2018, made it possible to apply the reduced penalties to sentences for crack offenses that predated the 2010 law.\n\nBiden last month commuted nearly 1,500 sentences and issued pardons for 39 people in another sweeping clemency action. A subsequent move to commute 37 death sentences left only a handful of people on federal death row.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department's clemency statistics , President-elect Donald Trump issued 144 pardons and 94 commutations during his first term. President Barack Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations over two terms.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial use of Biden's clemency power came when he pardoned his son Hunter Biden last month. The move was sharply criticized by Republicans and even some Democrats.\n\nIn his statement Friday, Biden indicated that he could take more clemency action before he leaves office Monday.\n\n\"I am proud of my record on clemency and will continue to review additional commutations and pardons,\" he said.\n\nZoë Richards is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Biden warns of rights under threat from Trump and 'MAGA extremists' in reelect launch\n\nBy\n\nDomenico Montanaro\n\n,\n\nTamara Keith\n\n,\n\nXimena Bustillo\n\nAfter months of hinting at a likely bid , President Biden officially announced on Tuesday that he will seek a second term as president of the United States in the 2024 election.\n\n\"When I ran for president four years ago, I said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And we still are. The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer,\" Biden said in a 3-minute video announcing his run.\n\nThe video links images from the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol with protests over the Supreme Court decision overturning abortion rights.\n\nAt 80, Biden is the oldest person to serve as president, a point that has given Democrats pause, questioning, at times, whether he gives them the best chance at winning. But the former vice president and longtime Delaware senator is unlikely to face a serious challenge for the nomination.\n\nRank-and-file Democratic voters began to coalesce around the president, as his intention to run became evident.\n\nHalf of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said in a February NPR/PBS NewsHour /Marist poll that they had a better chance with Biden than someone else. That was a reversal from shortly before the 2022 midterms when a majority said they though they would have a better shot with someone else.\n\nThat alternative, however, never emerged. Vice President Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, for example, have had consistently worse favorability ratings.\n\nBiden's entry now sets up a potential rematch with former President Donald Trump, who announced in November that he would also make another run for office. Trump is expected to face a vigorous primary race, though he remains the candidate to beat.\n\nTrump responded with his own 4-and-a-half-minute video response on his Truth Social platform, blasting Biden's record and repeating baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged.\n\n\"You could take the five worst presidents in American history and put them together and they would not have done the damage Joe Biden has done to our nation in just a few short years - not even close,\" Trump said, citing among examples inflation, recent bank collapses and the rise of \"woke\" culture. He also called the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan \"the most embarrassing event in the history of our country.\" The Biden administration has blamed Trump for the lack of preparedness.\n\nThe announcement comes four years to the day from the launch of Biden's 2020 campaign - which he also declared via video. But unlike 2020, when there were 19 other candidates already in the crowded race, Biden is not expected to face any serious Democratic contenders this time around.\n\nBiden's win in 2020 was largely a reflection of antipathy toward Trump from a significant portion of the country, and anger over the Trump administration's mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut the pandemic is largely in the political rearview mirror, and the uncertain economy dominates as Americans' top concern. The economy is an area of vulnerability for Biden. A March NPR/ PBS NewsHour /Marist poll found just 38% approved of his handling of the economy, including just 28% of independents.\n\nOverall, Biden's approval rating, like Trump's before him, has lagged in the low-40s. It nose-dived several months into his first year in office after the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nIn recent months, views of Biden have stabilized, but he remains in a tenuous position in this hyper-partisan era.\n\nBiden has long credited his family for encouraging him to run in 2020 , when he defeated Trump - a win that Trump refused to accept, citing false claims of voter fraud.\n\nBiden's 2024 video features an image of Trump with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a onetime ally and now likely challenger in the Republican race - along with an image of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. - as Biden describes what he calls \"MAGA extremists\" who he said are \"dictating what health care decisions women can make, banning books, and telling people who they can love. All while making it more difficult for you to be able to vote.\"\n\nBiden ran his first campaign on a platform of fighting for \"the soul of our nation,\" arguing that Trump had stirred up racist and antidemocratic sentiment that was hurting the country.\n\nThat year, Biden was able to secure the presidency by flipping Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona - states that in 2016 had gone to Trump.\n\nBiden ended Tuesday's campaign announcement with the phrase \"let's finish the job,\" a line he first tested out in his State of the Union address this year.\n\nBiden repeated the phrase 12 times during that speech in February, referring to rebuilding the middle class, capping the cost of insulin, expanding Medicaid, acting on climate change, increasing taxes on billionaires, strengthening antitrust enforcement, getting more affordable housing, funding universal pre-K, increasing vocational job opportunities, pushing for police reform and banning assault-style weapons.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden also announced some key members of his campaign team: campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodriguez, who has been the White House point person with governors and mayors during Biden's first term in office, and principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks, who ran the campaign of Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., in 2022.\n\nBiden has been saying he intended to run for a second term since his earliest days in office. But even Democratic voters have been lukewarm on him. Biden's popularity plunged last year , pressured by continued concerned over the withdrawal from Afghanistan, then by soaring consumer prices.\n\nBut Biden's prospects improved after the midterms. Democrats performed better than anticipated, largely because of activism around abortion rights following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade - and because of the toxicity of many Trump-backed candidates in competitive states and districts.\n\nBiden's policies have largely been popular, including climate and health care measures in the Inflation Reduction Act, and bipartisan spending bills on infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing. That's helped him to make a strong case for himself for 2024, said Democratic strategist Lis Smith, an adviser to Pete Buttigieg in his 2020 bid.\n\n\"Joe Biden has had one of the most successful first two years of any president in recent history,\" Smith said. \"He has been dismissed and discounted at every turn, and still overperformed expectations. I think that he will be a really formidable nominee in 2024 and that Democrats will fully rally behind him.\"\n\nThat is likely to be particularly true if Trump is the Republican nominee, said Jim Messina, who was the campaign manager for former President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.\n\n\"We've already had this race,\" Messina said of a potential Biden-Trump rematch. \"And Trump is now significantly weaker.\"\n\nThe audio story was produced by Lexie Schapitl .\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

And that's a big factor in any assessment of Biden's legacy. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith covered Biden's entire term. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When Joe Biden entered the race for president in 2019, he was explicit about why he was running - to make Donald Trump a one-term president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. KEITH: Biden was elected in the midst of the COVID pandemic, promising stability and competence at home and abroad. And in his first two years in office, with Democrats in control of Congress, he was able to do a lot. BEN LABOLT: He passed legislation that will have an impact for decades. KEITH: Ben LaBolt is White House communications director. He points to the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. LABOLT: But many of these things will take years to come to fruition - the semiconductor factories opening, the transition to clean energy and all the jobs that come with that. And so there will be a lasting impact here long past the moment that the president leaves office in January. KEITH: The unemployment rate is much lower than it was when Biden took office. Crime is down. Wages are up, but so are prices. And globally, alliances may be stronger, but war is raging in the Middle East and Ukraine. Biden has begun talking about how he hopes to be remembered. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Let me say it's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

And that's a big factor in any assessment of Biden's legacy. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith covered Biden's entire term. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When Joe Biden entered the race for president in 2019, he was explicit about why he was running - to make Donald Trump a one-term president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. KEITH: Biden was elected in the midst of the COVID pandemic, promising stability and competence at home and abroad. And in his first two years in office, with Democrats in control of Congress, he was able to do a lot. BEN LABOLT: He passed legislation that will have an impact for decades. KEITH: Ben LaBolt is White House communications director. He points to the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. LABOLT: But many of these things will take years to come to fruition - the semiconductor factories opening, the transition to clean energy and all the jobs that come with that. And so there will be a lasting impact here long past the moment that the president leaves office in January. KEITH: The unemployment rate is much lower than it was when Biden took office. Crime is down. Wages are up, but so are prices. And globally, alliances may be stronger, but war is raging in the Middle East and Ukraine. Biden has begun talking about how he hopes to be remembered. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Let me say it's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Let me say it's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. KEITH: Biden was elected in the midst of the COVID pandemic, promising stability and competence at home and abroad. And in his first two years in office, with Democrats in control of Congress, he was able to do a lot. BEN LABOLT: He passed legislation that will have an impact for decades. KEITH: Ben LaBolt is White House communications director. He points to the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. LABOLT: But many of these things will take years to come to fruition - the semiconductor factories opening, the transition to clean energy and all the jobs that come with that. And so there will be a lasting impact here long past the moment that the president leaves office in January. KEITH: The unemployment rate is much lower than it was when Biden took office.

MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Let me say it's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy.

KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nKEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy.

KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office.

Joe Biden as they wait to speak at a fundraiser in Wilmington, Del. Barry Thumma/AP hide caption\n\nFeb. 20, 1978: President Jimmy Carter listens to Sen. Joe Biden as they wait to speak at a fundraiser in Wilmington, Del.\n\nOn Presidents Day 1978, Jimmy Carter boarded Marine One at the White House and flew to Wilmington, Del.\n\nHe was there to raise money for one of his first national political allies: the state's 35-year-old first-term senator, Joe Biden.\n\nIt was a joint appearance that underscored the unique relationship Biden developed with Carter early on in his political career - one that will be on display this week when Biden eulogizes Carter at Washington's National Cathedral.\n\n\"I've been hanging out with Jimmy Carter for over 50 years, it dawned on me,\" Biden said in remarks on Sunday from St. Croix, where he was on holiday.\n\n\"I'll always be proud to say that - he used to kid me about it - that I was the first national figure to endorse him in 1976 when he ran for president. And there was an overwhelming reason for it: his character.\"\n\nCarter also fundraised for Biden. Back in 1978, Biden and his young sons met Carter's helicopter at the airport, and then Carter gave Biden a lift in the presidential limousine to the Hotel Du Pont.\n\nThe politics-averse Carter didn't do too many campaign events, let alone fundraising dinners. You could hear the excitement and pride in the young senator's voice as he thanked the crowd, who paid $1,000 a couple for coming out to help him \"raise so much damn money.\"\n\n\"My sons, Beau and Hunt, were here, Mr. President,\" Biden beamed during his introductory remarks. \"Met the president at the plane. But priorities are priorities,\" he told Carter and the donors. \"They had their Cub Scout meeting tonight, Mr. President, and they said as far as they'd go was the helicopter. And when they found out Amy wasn't coming, they weren't even sure they were going to do that.\"\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter and Sen.

Joe Biden greet Biden supporters at a fundraising reception at the Hotel Du Pont in Wilmington, Del., on Feb. 20, 1978.\n\nWhen Carter spoke, he told the audience about the origins of the close relationship he had developed with Delaware's junior senator.\n\nThey had first met four years earlier, in 1974, when Carter was in the final full year of his one term as Georgia's governor. Biden had traveled to Atlanta to address a convention of young business leaders, the Jaycees. And Carter recalled that he couldn't get over Biden's youth.\n\n\"We got a chance to talk for several hours at the governor's mansion,\" said Carter. \"I felt a little ill at ease. I thought that Joe should have been talking to my children instead of to me.\"\n\nEven so, Biden had come with advice. Carter said the two men talked about the possibilities and realities of running outsider campaigns. He said Biden encouraged him to run for president, and had shared stories from his own underdog run for the Senate two years earlier, when Biden, then a 29-year-old county councilman, had ousted a well-known incumbent.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter smiles as he greets donors at a $1,000-a-couple reception for Senator Joe Biden in Wilmington, Del. on Feb. 20, 1978.

And I went to the Jaycee convention with him that night. And I listened to his speech,\" Carter said, as Biden and the audience laughed.\n\nCarter went on to make a long-shot bid for the White House, and Biden became the first senator - and first politician outside of Georgia - to endorse him. Carter told the crowd that night how Biden ended up traveling all over the country on Carter's behalf.\n\n\"When I would go to Wisconsin and say, 'What can I do in this city to explain my position?' They would say, 'Well you don't have to explain your position. Joe Biden's already done it for you.' And when I would campaign in Pennsylvania in those tough days when Pennsylvania was the crucial primary, Joe Biden spent three times as many days and nights in Pennsylvania campaigning for me as I spent campaigning for myself,\" Carter said.\n\nThen-Sen.

Joe Biden and former President Jimmy Carter at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 26, 2008.\n\nThe former president Joe Biden is most associated with is, of course, Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice president for eight years. But back in the 1970s, he was a frequent visitor to the Carter White House.\n\n\"I saw Carter as a necessary transitional figure in the Democratic Party, which was losing middle-class working Americans,\" Biden recalled in his 2007 memoir, Promises To Keep. \"I thought Carter could bridge the gaps in the party.\"\n\nBiden's longtime adviser Ted Kaufman saw the Carter-Biden relationship develop first-hand. He said it was real and deep, and was strengthened by the fact that Jill Biden and Rosalynn Carter got along, too. \"When you and your spouse both have a relationship with someone and their spouse, I have found over the years that's like a booster jet for a friendship,\" Kaufman said.\n\nWhen Carter entered the White House, the young first-term Sen. Biden suddenly found himself as a key congressional point man for the president.\n\nWhite House logs show Carter made frequent phone calls to Biden, including during the middle of the Camp David peace talks.\n\nBiden was frequently in meetings at the Cabinet Room and Oval Office. In fact, Carter's daily White House diary from June 14, 1977, shows the president going directly from a meeting with Biden to an Oval Office chat with Johnny and June Carter Cash. (Later that evening, Carter spoke to Elvis Presley on the phone.)\n\nBiden soaked it all in. \"This was when he was still in his thirties. At a time when normally you don't get a chance to learn about these things at a high level,\" said Kaufman, who was staffing Biden at the time.\n\nIn this Feb. 8, 2014 photo, then-Vice President Biden speaks at the memorial service for Joan Mondale as former President Jimmy Carter waits to speak. Jim Mone/AP hide caption\n\nIn this Feb. 8, 2014 photo, then-Vice President Biden speaks at the memorial service for Joan Mondale as former President Jimmy Carter waits to speak.\n\nCarter ultimately struggled in the White House. And in viewing that struggle from a front-row seat, Biden learned valuable lessons of what not to do in a position of leadership.\n\nIn his 2007 memoir, Biden wrote about how Carter avoided personal relationships with other politicians, and how he held deep grudges.\n\n\"Carter even had a way of making me feel like he couldn't trust me,\" Biden wrote. \"In the meetings, I could see him ... tug at his cardigan sweater, and check the time.\" Biden said Carter also failed to fully consult and communicate with fellow world leaders.\n\nThese are things that Biden would take the opposite approach on as president, decades later.\n\nIn this April 30, 2021, photo released by the White House, former President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter pose for a photo with President Biden and first lady Jill Biden in Plains, Ga.

I think they had a deep personal relationship,\" Kaufman said. \"Carter would call him and he would call Carter at times in their lives when it would be a good thing to have a call.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident Trump says he is \"immediately revoking\" former President Joe Biden's security clearances - access that Biden stripped from Trump four years ago.\n\nFormer presidents are historically given intelligence briefings after leaving office. In 2021, Biden revoked Trump's access just weeks after being sworn in, arguing Trump exhibited \"erratic behavior.\"\n\nNow, Trump appears to be repeating the move.\n\nIn a post Friday on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Biden \"set this precedent\" by taking away his clearances shortly after Trump left office.\n\nTrump criticized the former president's cognitive ability and referenced a report by special counsel Robert Hur that described Biden as having a \"poor memory.\" Biden was investigated by Hur for his alleged mishandling of classified materials after he left the vice presidency, but prosecutors ultimately determined that charges were not warranted.\n\n\"The Hur Report revealed that Biden suffers from 'poor memory' and, even in his 'prime,' could not be trusted with sensitive information,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"I will always protect our National Security - JOE, YOU'RE FIRED.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the former president could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\n\"What value is giving him an intelligence briefing?\" Biden said in an interview with CBS News four years ago. \"What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?\"\n\nTrump's decision to revoke Biden's access follows similar moves taken by the administration against past critics of the president. Last week, the Pentagon revoked retired Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley's security detail and suspended his clearance . Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton have also had their security details removed by Trump.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

The president would be 86 by the end of a second term. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident Biden responded to questions about his age during a press conference at the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. The president would be 86 by the end of a second term.\n\nPresident Biden said that his own age doesn't register with him, despite recent polling that shows Americans have concern over the president's age as he runs for a second term.\n\nAt a press conference with the South Korean president on Wednesday, Biden fielded questions from reporters about concerns from voters.\n\n\"With regard to age, I can't even say I guess how old I am, I can't even say the number. It doesn't register with me,\" Biden said on his age, adding that people are going to watch the campaign and judge for themselves.\n\n\"I respect them taking a hard look at it - I'd take a hard look at it, as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run, and I feel good. I feel excited about the prospects,\" he said.\n\nAn NBC poll released this weekend found that 70% of Americans don't want Biden to run for reelection, with half of those citing age as a major factor.\n\nBiden was 29 when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972, becoming the fifth youngest person to do so. Decades later, at age 78, he became the oldest living president the day he was sworn into office. If elected to a second term, he would be 86 by the end of it.\n\nThe president said the same polling data that shows concern for his age also shows support for what he's done in office.\n\n\"When the same polling data asks what kind of job I've done, it gets overwhelmingly positive results,\" Biden said at a press conference Wednesday.\n\nThe data from the NBC poll shows 41% of adults polled approve of Biden's job performance and 54% disapprove, which is down from January. Biden seemed to separate that from approval of particular legislative accomplishments, including creating manufacturing jobs and climate investments.\n\nBiden works out five days a week and received a clean bill of health at his annual physical earlier this year, with his physician concluding that he \"remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean that his age won't be an issue on the campaign trail.\n\nIn fact, his age as a factor is \"indisputable,\" says David Axelrod, chief strategist for President Obama's campaigns and senior political commentator for CNN.\n\n\"When you look at polling, when you watch focus groups, it's the thing that people bring up first,\" he says. \"We are in uncharted waters, we've never had a president this old.\"\n\nStill, Axelrod says, there are \"upsides\" to Biden's age: wisdom, experience and perspective.\n\n\"And at a time when there's so much churn and turmoil, those three qualities are assets for him,\" he told Morning Edition 's Steve Inskeep.\n\nCristina Tzinzún Ramirez, president of the progressive nonprofit NextGen America, says what is most important to young voters is progressive policy change - not age.\n\n\"Young voters in the last few elections have turned out in historic numbers. Young people overwhelmingly in 2020, during the Democratic primary, supported the oldest candidate in the race, Bernie Sanders. And then they turned out in overwhelming numbers to vote for Joe Biden.\"\n\nRamirez says she thinks young people will turn out again, because Joe Biden has delivered on specific issues they care about: gun reform, climate change legislation, marijuana reform and student debt cancellation. \"Ultimately, that's what people are going to measure him by,\" she said.\n\nQuestions about Biden's age are nothing new. His opponents used it against him when he ran in 2020, and have continued pointing to his on-camera stumbles to insinuate he is suffering from cognitive issues (a line of attack that often backfires, as NPR has reported ).\n\nWhen asked about Biden's age in a recent White House press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said \"It's the same thing that we heard in 2020. Right? If you look at what the President has done this past two years, he's been able to deliver and get things done.\"\n\nAxelrod argues that Biden's approach - particularly when it comes to things like being less reactive on social media - is part of why voters elected him in the first place, and that those qualities were what people wanted after the tenure of former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden's approach is basically \"watch me,\" Axelrod points out, using the phrase the president himself has used.\n\nAxelrod describes being president as \"the hardest job on the planet,\" because of the endless hours and weighty decisions. He says Biden's staff would point to some of his high points as proof he can do it, such as his February State of the Union address , in which he made a pitch to \"finish the job.\"\n\n\"He stood on his feet for an hour, he engaged his hecklers and he was triumphant,\" Axelrod says. \"And that's what they're going to say is 'just watch him.'\"\n\nBut that won't necessarily be enough, says Axelrod, advising Biden to address his age openly, both the \"obvious risks\" and the advantages.\n\n\"He often says 'don't judge me versus the almighty, judge me versus the alternative,'\" he adds. \"And I think that's what they're counting on now, his strategists - that this isn't going to be a referendum on Joe Biden, this is going to be a choice. And the choice very well may be the same choice we faced four years ago.\"\n\nTrump, the current frontrunner in the Republican primary field, is only four years younger than Biden. He will be 77 in June.\n\nA rematch between the two is looking likely, with a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finding that two-thirds of Republicans would still vote for Trump even if he is found guilty of a crime.\n\nHis age could be a concern for voters too, Axelrod says, noting that former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley is making \"generational change a fundamental aspect of her campaign.\"\n\nIn her kickoff speech, Haley called for \"mandatory mental competency tests\" for candidates over the age of 75.\n\nAxelrod believes others will make a similar argument about Trump's age, \"because you can't really exploit this vulnerability as well in Biden if you run a candidate who's basically the same age.\"\n\nAnd if either party ends up with a younger candidate, can they make the argument that it's time to move on from the politics of the past?\n\n\"They can make that argument and I think it will land with some voters,\" Axelrod says. \"And they'll choose between that and those qualities I mentioned before: wisdom, experience and perspective.\"\n\nKaity Kline contributed production and reporting, and John Helton and Miranda Kennedy edited.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

The Trump campaign is still contesting the process in several states.\n\n\"The simple fact is this election is far from over,\" Trump said in a statement Saturday. \"Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. \"\n\nDespite the president's rhetoric, Biden's team projected confidence as ballots were tabulated, knowing that large chunks of the vote still to be counted were in diverse Democratic strongholds like Milwaukee, Detroit and Philadelphia.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Biden on Saturday when it said that Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes put him over the 270-vote threshold needed to win the Electoral College.\n\nIt's a fitting tipping point state. Biden was born in Pennsylvania and launched his campaign with rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. He spent Election Day visiting his childhood home in Scranton and then rallying supporters in Philadelphia.\n\n\"I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect [Kamala] Harris,\" Biden said in a statement . \"With the campaign over, it's time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.\"\n\nTrump had appeared to hold a lead in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night, but the margin was a mirage of sorts, because at the time more than 2.5 million mail-in ballots had not been counted. Biden won the vast majority of those yet-to-be-counted ballots.\n\nThe race was closer than preelection polls had suggested, with Trump holding on to contested states like Florida, Ohio and Texas.\n\nBut Biden won back the White House the way Democrats vowed to since the day Trump won four years ago: by resurrecting the so-called \"blue wall\" that Trump dismantled in 2016 - winning Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nBiden was also able to flip longtime conservative redoubt Arizona, according to The Associated Press, and held a narrow lead in Georgia as of early Saturday.\n\n\"The soul of the nation\"\n\nIn topping Trump in a race that was both upended and largely defined by the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic nominee has become the first challenger to defeat an incumbent first-term president in nearly 30 years.\n\nAt 77, Biden becomes the oldest man ever elected president. (He'll be 78 by Inauguration Day.) He's also the first former vice president to win the White House since George H.W. Bush in 1988; the second Roman Catholic in U.S. history elected president; and he'll be the first president to call Delaware home.\n\nAnd with his victory, his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, will become the first female vice president. She'll also become the nation's second Black candidate, following former President Barack Obama, to serve as president or vice president.\n\n\"This election is about so much more than [Biden] or me,\" Harris tweeted shortly after being declared vice president-elect. \"It's about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let's get started.\"\n\nBiden's slim victory perhaps validates the central conceit of a presidential campaign that fellow Democrats often doubted: After nearly four divisive and drama-filled years of the Trump administration, voters would long for stability and a return to the status quo that Biden and his nearly five decades of federal government experience represented.\n\nFrom the moment he launched his campaign in April 2019, Biden focused on what he called a \"battle for the soul of our nation,\" arguing that Trump was a dangerous aberration in American political history - but an aberration that voters could course-correct.\n\nThe election was seen as a referendum on Trump's tenure, particularly how he had handled - or mishandled - the coronavirus pandemic .\n\nAnd though the election was highly contested, Biden led Trump in polls for almost the entirety of what was, ultimately, a remarkably stable presidential race in an anything-but-stable year.\n\nBut for Biden, a career politician, this victory is a political comeback - a triumph that comes after a rocky start in this year's primaries and two previous failed attempts at the presidency years ago.\n\nAn early political triumph, then tragedy\n\nBiden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and when he was young, his family moved to Claymont and then Wilmington, Del., as his father looked for steady work.\n\n\"The longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child's bedroom to say, 'Honey I'm sorry, we have to move,' \" Biden has often recalled.\n\nBiden struggled, too, to overcome a severe childhood stutter . He learned to navigate it in part by memorizing and reciting the poems of William Butler Yeats and other Irish poets in his bedroom mirror.\n\nBiden went to the University of Delaware, and then law school at Syracuse University, where he met his first wife, Neilia. They returned to Wilmington and started a family as Biden quickly established himself as a politician, winning a seat on the New Castle County Council, and then, in 1972, launching an improbable run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nBiden wouldn't turn 30, the minimum age to serve as a senator, until after the election. He won in an upset and was set to enter the Senate as a rising Democratic star.\n\nThen, Biden's life was shattered. Neilia and their three children - sons Hunter and Beau, and daughter Naomi - were hit by a truck while Biden was in Washington, D.C., setting up his new Senate office. Neilia and Naomi were killed, and Biden weighed resigning his seat before he was sworn in in order to care for his surviving children.\n\nWhen Joe Biden was first sworn in as a U.S. senator in 1973, he took the oath in a Wilmington, Del., hospital, where his sons Beau, in the bed, and Hunter, in the arms of Biden's father-in-law Robert Hunter, had been treated after a car crash that left his wife and daughter dead. Brian Horton/AP hide caption\n\nMajority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., helped persuade Biden to stay in the Senate. And Biden began a habit that would become a trademark of his life and political career: He commuted every single day between Wilmington and Washington, D.C., in order to spend as much time at home with his children as possible.\n\nBiden married again, in 1977, to Jill Jacobs.\n\nAfter two runs for president, the vice presidency\n\nThe Delaware senator made his mark in the chamber on the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, serving for long stints as chair or ranking member on both. Biden presided over several high-profile and contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including Robert Bork's failed nomination and the hearings during which Anita Hill accused future Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.\n\nBiden ran for president in 1988 and 2008. Both times were considered flops. He withdrew from the 1988 campaign before the Iowa caucuses in part because of a plagiarism scandal. In 2008, Biden carved out a niche during the debates as a foreign policy expert but finished well behind fellow Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Iowa, and quickly dropped out.\n\nBut Biden had made an impression on Obama during those debates. That summer, looking to compensate for his lack of foreign policy experience and his relative newness to Washington - and also looking to appeal to white voters who may have been skeptical of the first Black major-party presidential nominee - Obama tapped Biden as his running mate.\n\nBiden headed several key policy efforts for the Obama administration, including the 2009 stimulus package that's credited with helping pull the economy out of a spiral toward a depression. Biden helped set the administration's foreign policy agenda and often acted as the more aloof Obama's emissary to Republican congressional leaders like Kentucky's Mitch McConnell. Biden and the Senate Republican leader crafted several budget compromises in the later years of the Obama administration.\n\nVice President Biden joins President Barack Obama as he speaks about a newly created working families task force just 10 days after they were inaugurated in 2009.

Progressives thought of Biden as the out-of-touch elder statesman who didn't understand the modern Democratic Party.\n\nThey wanted sweeping systemic change; they wanted \"Medicare For-All\"; they wanted a wealth tax. And Biden seemed to offer only incremental solutions to their problems.\n\nBiden and his wife, Jill, arrive at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 2.

Biden would finish a disappointing fourth in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nHe was battered by his fellow Democrats during the primary debates for his orchestration of the 1994 crime bill and his work with segregationist senators.\n\nAnd yet despite that record and the fact that he faced several Black opponents - including Harris, his eventual running mate - the polls showed Biden consistently had the support of Black voters. Some elder Black voters pointed to Biden's loyalty to Obama during their eight years in the White House. Others more specifically pointed to Biden's willingness to be \"No. 2\" to a Black man, something they said many white people wouldn't be willing to do.\n\nCampaign aides routinely insisted there was no path to the Democratic nomination without the clear support of Black voters. And in their view, no candidate but Biden had support from that key demographic.\n\nStill, the early primaries were rocky for him. He finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and fifth in the New Hampshire primaries. His fundraising slowed to a trickle.\n\nNew Hampshire was such a blow to his candidacy that his campaign hightailed it out of the state before the polls had closed. That night, Biden was instead in South Carolina, where he tried to reassure his supporters not to count him out.\n\n\"We just heard from the first two states,\" Biden said during a speech in Columbia, S.C. \"Where I come from that's the opening bell, not the closing bell.\"\n\nBut at that time, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appeared to be on his way to building an insurmountable lead in the primary's early states. Biden needed a decisive win in South Carolina to resurrect his fledgling campaign - and he got it. With the help of the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn, the most influential Democratic politician in the state, Biden won South Carolina by roughly 30 points.\n\nIt was the conclusive victory he needed to head into Super Tuesday, the single most consequential day in the Democratic primary process, in which more than a third of all delegates were at stake. But Biden was still without the campaign infrastructure, grassroots support and the fundraising dollars that some of his rivals boasted.\n\nAnd so perhaps just as influential as the South Carolina result itself was the decision by a number of Biden's rivals to quickly coalesce behind him. On the eve of Super Tuesday, three of Biden's former opponents - former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke - endorsed him in quick succession.\n\nThat day was critical in swiftly reshaping the narrative of the primary campaign.\n\nThe end result was that Biden scored huge victories on Super Tuesday . Shortly after, the Democratic contest became a two-man race between Biden and Sanders.\n\nBiden hugs his former primary rival and future running mate, California Sen.

Kamala Harris, after she endorsed him at a campaign rally in Detroit on March 9.\n\nBut before that battle could substantively get underway, the country was facing a new crisis: The coronavirus was threatening to close schools, shutter businesses and hospitalize vast numbers of Americans.\n\nOn March 10 , as voters cast ballots in Michigan and five other states, Biden and Sanders both abruptly canceled primary night rallies because of public health concerns. The campaign trail would never return to normal, and Biden would at times struggle to adapt to a new remote-only platform.\n\nBiden won Michigan in a rout, and the primary was effectively over.\n\nIn countless interviews, voters - even some on the more progressive end of the party - said they ultimately opted for Biden because they thought he had the best chance of defeating Trump, regardless of whether they agreed with all of his ideas.\n\nBy early April, Sanders decided to end his own campaign. Unlike in 2016, he enthusiastically endorsed and worked with his rival to unify progressives against Trump.\n\nTaking on Trump\n\nBiden ran his primary campaign in much the same way that he would go on to wage his general election bid - with an appeal to unity and healing.\n\nBut the coronavirus pandemic brought traditional campaigning to a standstill. For months, Biden was stuck at home in Wilmington, Del., trying to fight an Internet war against a president known for his social media savviness.\n\nBut as the pandemic turned into an economic recession, coupled with a summer of racial protest, the November election increasingly turned into a referendum on Trump's leadership. Polls showed voters increasingly losing confidence in how the president was handling the pandemic and race relations. And the Biden campaign sought to fill that leadership void by focusing on competence and empathy.\n\n\"Today in America, it's hard to keep faith that justice is at hand. I know that. You know that,\" Biden said in a June 2 speech in Philadelphia, the day after Trump responded to nationwide protests by marching through a Washington, D.C., park that had been cleared of protesters by force so that he could appear in front of the press at a damaged church. \"The pain is raw. The pain is real. A president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem.\"\n\nWhen Biden cautiously returned to the campaign trail after those remarks, he did so in eerily empty settings. Biden would often give speeches to empty rooms of socially-distanced reporters. Over time, his campaign filled venues with a few dozen supporters at a time, eventually building up to drive-in rallies. The sometimes-awkward scenes were efforts to prioritize safety and to signal to voters that Biden - who was regularly seen wearing a mask - took public health seriously.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, began to ignore the advice of his own public health advisers and held massive in-person rallies - most open-air, some indoors - with supporters - many without masks - crowded together.\n\nBiden and President Trump participate in the final presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 22. This debate was a more civil affair, following Trump's persistent interruptions in the first faceoff. Jim Bourg/Pool/Getty Images hide caption\n\nAs the U.S. death toll from the pandemic climbed, eventually surpassing 200,000 people, many parents entered a new school year juggling the demands of working from home while monitoring virtual classes. And yet despite the instability, the polls seemed to suggest a remarkably stagnant race. Throughout the summer and into the fall, Biden retained a consistent lead in most national polls.\n\nAnd after struggling to raise money in the primary, Biden's team started collecting huge sums, often from virtual fundraisers. Just in the months of August and September, the campaign and joint Democratic efforts raised nearly $750 million, smashing records. That money gave the campaign the resources to invest and try to compete in traditionally Republican states like Texas and Georgia.\n\nThe race's most notable stretch came near the end of September, when Biden and Trump met face to face for their first debate, and the president made the event nearly unwatchable with constant interruptions. Then, a couple of days later, news broke that the president had been diagnosed with the coronavirus. He was soon hospitalized for treatment.\n\nIt was an unpredictable October surprise, and yet Trump acted as if it didn't matter. He was quickly back on the campaign trail, holding his trademark rallies and boasting that he felt better than he did 20 years ago.\n\nHe continued to defend his administration's response to the virus, citing his decision to ban some travel from China and his efforts to boost therapeutics and vaccines.\n\nWhat's on the Biden agenda\n\nIn the final days of the race, Trump dismissed the pandemic even more bluntly than before - as cases soared to new records in key electoral states like Wisconsin.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, promised to immediately marshal the resources of the federal government toward tackling the pandemic. He has promised that his administration will centralize decision-making on distributing testing and personal protective equipment. He will push for universal mask usage and has urged Congress to pass a substantial coronavirus relief package in the first weeks of his administration.\n\nThe longtime foreign policy expert has also vowed to repair the international alliances that have been frayed by four years of an isolationist, treaty-busting Trump administration, beginning with a reentry into the Paris climate accords.(The U.S. withdrawal from the accord actually became official the day after Election Day.)\n\nOver the course of the campaign, Biden embraced many of the more progressive policy goals of his onetime primary rivals. He'll enter office vowing an agenda inspired by the transformative New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nBiden wants to retool the Affordable Care Act by adding a public, government-run option; invest $2 trillion in green energy and transform the country's energy production to almost entirely renewable sources over the next 15 years; and make massive investments in education and child care, including universal pre-kindergarten and tuition-free public college for middle- and lower-income students.\n\nBiden leaves the Gettysburg battleground after delivering remarks at the historic Civil War site in Pennsylvania in October. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nBut the broad scope of Biden's progressive agenda took a serious blow with Democratic struggles to flip Senate seats this election. As of the AP race call for Biden, control of the upper chamber remained in doubt .\n\nRegardless, throughout his entire campaign, Biden largely emphasized tone and style over policy. He began and ended his campaign promising to \"restore the soul of the nation\" and repeatedly vowed in its closing days to govern with all Americans in mind, not just the ones who voted for him.\n\n\"We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together,\" Biden said in a speech in Gettysburg, Pa., last month. \"What we need in America is leadership that seeks to deescalate tension, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together.\"\n\nAs Obama's vice president, Biden saw firsthand that unifying messages and aggressive policy agendas are difficult to make coexist - especially in a divided government.\n\nNow, elected president after a lifetime of government experience, in the wake of a turbulent and divisive administration, and amid an unprecedented global crisis, Biden will get his chance to try to accomplish both those ambitious goals."

Their talks come as tensions between the world's two largest economies have been on the rise, and as the White House has been trying to take a strong-on-China approach.\n\nThe last time Biden and Xi spoke face to face was at the G20 summit in Indonesia in November 2022.\n\n\"Our meetings have always been candid and straightforward. We haven't always agreed, but they've been straightforward,\" Biden said on his meeting today with Xi.\n\nAt the press conference, Biden announced that he and Xi reached an understanding about reducing the flow of fentanyl from China to the U.S. Watch the press conference here.\n\n\"We're taking action to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals and pill presses from China to the Western hemisphere,\" Biden said. \"It's going to save lives and I appreciate President Xi's commitment on this issue.\"\n\nBiden also announced the countries would resume military to military contact.\n\nIn August 2022, Beijing declared it was cutting off dialogue with the U.S. on major issues such as climate and military relations after then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\n\"We're back to direct, open, clear, direct communications on a direct basis,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden added the two spoke about getting their experts on artificial intelligence together as well to discuss risks and safety issues associated with the technology. He said the world expects the U.S. and China to compete with each other without veering into conflict, and to work together when possible.\n\nPresident Joe Biden Meets with China's President President Xi Jinping at the Filoli Estate in Woodside, Calif., on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative conference.

He said he specifically provided names of people the U.S. thinks China is holding hostage but said there was \"no agreement\" on getting them released. He told Xi he expects no interferenc from China in Taiwan's upcoming election. And he was critical of China's activity in the South China Sea.\n\nBut Biden emphasized that the open line of communication reestablished between the U.S. and China was critical, particularly between Xi and himself.\n\nBiden noted that he's spent tens of hours speaking with Xi when the two leaders were vice presidents.\n\nListen to NPR special coverage and watch Biden's press conference below:\n\n\"I know the man and I know his modus operandi. We have disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things, but he's been straight,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden said he's been \"deeply involved\" with hostage negotiations and said the U.S. believes here are between 50-100 hostages. He didn't go into detail on recent conversations, but he said he's had \"great cooperation\" with leaders in Qatar on the issue.\n\n\"I am mildly hopeful,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president also commented on Israeli troops entering the Al Shifa hospital in Gaza , the largest medical center in the region, where conditions among medical staff and patients have been massively deteriorating.\n\nU.S. officials have claimed that militant groups, including Hamas, use hospitals for military operations but have not provided any evidence.

In June, the president was speaking about the spy balloon that was shot down over Alaska and off handedly called Xi a dictator, without using his name.\n\nAt the time, Beijing had a strong response and the back and forth clouded the already tense relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

He was rushed to the hospital, where the doctors called in a priest to deliver last rites. Biden survived brain surgery but spent months in recovery.\n\nOsnos points to a connection between Biden's failed 1988 presidential bid and his prognosis following the aneurysms: \"Had he been on the campaign trail, he might not have survived, because he would not have gone to see a doctor about the symptoms,\" Osnos says.\n\nMore than 30 years later, Osnos sees a candidate who has come to terms with the tragedies and mistakes that have shaped his life.\n\n\"If you talk to the 77-year-old Joe Biden now, he's a man who is at peace,\" Osnos says. \"He's at peace from a series of hard-won scars. And it's a very different mindset than he had back then.\"\n\nOn writing about Biden in a fair way\n\nFrom the very beginning, actually, Joe Biden was, I think, treated with some skepticism by a lot of the press because they looked at his some of his mistakes on the trail. They would say he seems out of touch. He may not be aware of what it is that voters are really looking for in 2020. He would ... bungle the address for his fundraising text message campaign, things like that. And actually, I think that from a reporter's perspective, the challenge was that our responsibility has to be to hold Joe Biden and the other Democratic candidates to the same level of scrutiny that we have subjected Donald Trump to over the last 3 1/2 years. Because if we're not doing that, we're not going to generate trust from our readers and from voters, and we're not really doing the job. But it's hard, because the reality is that there is one candidate who is overtly hostile to the press - that's the president. And then you have another candidate who is in many ways a more conventional candidate and is doing things like releasing his tax returns and making his personal history more available. But it is challenging because you can't look like you're going soft on one guy and hard on the other.\n\nOn how Biden was defined by the tragic death of his wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident in 1972\n\nWhen it happened, the reality is that Joe Biden did not expect to take his seat in the Senate. He thought that period of his life was over. He didn't see practically or spiritually how he could go on. The reality was he considered suicide. Some older members of the Senate said to him, \"You need to do this not only because it's the right thing to do for your voters, but it's also the right thing to do for you personally, because if you don't do something, you will cave in.\" His sister Valerie told me that one of the ways that they were able to get him off the floor, in effect, was by telling him, \"You have two boys at home now who have no mother. And if you collapse, then they have nobody.\"\n\nBiden struggled in that period with what it meant to become this kind of public symbol of grieving. And what surprised me was he really bridled against it.\n\nEvan Osnos\n\nBiden struggled in that period with what it meant to become this kind of public symbol of grieving. And what surprised me was he really bridled against it. He didn't like that. That was the public image that people were imagining for him, that they were thrusting upon him, the sort of grieving widower and father. His image of himself was that he was the college football player who'd been elected to the Senate and in his 20s, and that's what he wanted to be. And he sort of had this idea that he could become a great foreign policy statesman. That's what he wanted to be. He didn't want to become a symbol of human vulnerability. But it was thrust upon him and he had to decide whether to embrace it or rebel against it or something else. ...\n\nIt was only later in his life, really, it was after the death of his son Beau in 2015 when Biden kind of came to accept more fully that that's something that people wanted from him as a political person. They wanted actually somebody in politics to talk to them about something like suffering and like vulnerability. And he kind of embraced it, but he didn't come to it quickly. It took a long time for him to acknowledge that.\n\nOn what Biden stood for in his early years in the Senate\n\nIn his very early years as a senator, he was kind of a moving target politically. I mean, to be blunt about it, he was more concerned about being reelected than he was about specific policy items. The most acute example of that is that he had run for office as a progressive candidate on the side of civil rights, and he had played a bit part in some desegregation efforts in Wilmington, Del. And he got to the Senate, and he was representing a district that had a large white suburban contingent who were very wary of court-ordered busing. And they told him so. And there was a famous meeting that he went to in which parents in the suburbs, most of them white, of course, attacked him for being in favor of integration and civil rights efforts. And he turned on that issue and became the Senate's most forceful Democrat against court-ordered busing.\n\nOn Biden's work on domestic issues\n\nOn the domestic front, one of the things that he defined himself by was being active on issues of law enforcement and crime and punishment. He was one of the authors of the Violence Against Women Act, and he was active very much in the crime bill of 1994. So these became some of the issues that he was best known for. He was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which is a very powerful position. And all of those began to give him more stature as a kind of technician in the ways of Congress. He was somebody who knew how to get things accomplished. He would work the cloakroom ... and he took pride in that. Later, when he was tapped to become vice president, part of it was because he was somebody who believed in a functioning Senate. He thought you could get things done if you knew how to do it. And the Obama administration wanted some of that.\n\nOn Biden's role in Justice Clarence Thomas' 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and his decision not to allow other women to testify alongside Anita Hill\n\nBiden imagined himself in that period as being somebody who was a Democrat, but who treated Republicans seriously, tried to maintain the standards of the Senate, which was that you give the other side credence and allow them to have a serious hearing for their ideas. ... In some ways, what he tried to do was to try to pay respect to the Republican side of the process by allowing Republican senators to question Anita Hill very intensively, harshly in some cases. And then he also did not allow these other accusers to testify in person. They were allowed to testify in written form, which ultimately meant it didn't really have any impact on the proceedings. And Biden came to regret that. He said later that the mistake was that he gave Clarence Thomas more credence than he deserved. ...\n\nBut to be precise, [Biden] doesn't say that he made an error. What he says is that he wished Anita Hill had been treated better. And I think that's a key distinction because if we're trying to understand the ways in which Joe Biden is capable of self-reflection and what are the issues on which he has expressed his clear regret and no, he has not gone as far as Anita Hill wants him to in saying that ... he was wrong about handling that case.\n\nOn Biden's role in drafting the 1994 crime bill, which contributed to mass incarceration\n\nThe crime bill of 1994 was inspired most of all by the crack epidemic, which was at that point, it was raging through American cities, and there was this surge of political activity and demands to try to do something about it by raising the consequences, by imposing steeper sentences and making policing tougher. And interestingly, it wasn't just coming from Joe Biden and other white politicians, but it was coming from the Congressional Black Caucus. Many Black members of Congress were in favor of the crime bill in particular. ...\n\nIf you talk to Joe Biden about it today, Biden says the mistake we made, and it was a serious mistake, was that we believed this idea that crack was somehow different, that it was an order of risk that was unlike other things that we'd seen in the drug war or in the world of law enforcement. And it had to be treated with extraordinary force. And that was the reason why they undertook these, what turned out to be very punitive and damaging steps.\n\nOn deciding whether to write about allegations concerning Hunter Biden's business activities in Ukraine\n\nI was not going to simply amplify the allegations for the sake of amplifying them. I'm going to stick to what we know to be true. ... As a technical matter, by the time the book was done, the Giuliani conspiracy theory about Hunter Biden had not yet come out, or at least it was not as detailed as it is now. So it was not a particularly hard call. I mean, what I talked about in the book was Hunter Biden's involvement in Ukraine as a board member of the gas company. I talked about the impact that that had on Joe Biden in the sense that Hunter Biden apologized to his father for creating an issue in the campaign and has promised not to have any business with foreign sources of income if his father is elected. As far as I was concerned, those are the known facts. It's not a known fact that anything [Trump lawyer and former New York Mayor Rudy] Giuliani is talking about is real, and therefore I was not going to give it the credence of reality.\n\nSam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited the audio of this interview.

Hur about his five hours of interviews with the president on Oct. 8 and 9 drove months of coverage. The prosecutor said Biden had \"diminished faculties in advancing age\" and called him a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Biden angrily dismissed these assertions, which Vice President Kamala Harris called \"politically motivated.\"\n\nHouse Republicans on Monday sued Attorney General Merrick B. Garland for audio recordings of the interview as the White House asserts executive privilege to deny their release .\n\nProPublica obtained a rare interview with Biden on Sept. 29, nine days before the Hur interviews began. We released the video , which was assembled from footage shot by five cameras, on Oct. 1. We edited out less than a minute of crosstalk and exchanges with the camera people, as is customary in such interviews.\n\nToday, we are releasing the full, 21-minute interview, unedited as seen from the view of the single camera focused on Biden. We understand that this video captures a moment in time nine months ago and that it will not settle the ongoing arguments about the president's acuity today.  Still, we believe it is worth giving the public another chance to see one of Biden's infrequent conversations with a reporter.\n\nThe Interview With the Camera Focused on Biden\n\nThe Interview as Published\n\nConducting the interview was veteran journalist and former CNN White House correspondent John Harwood, who requested it and then worked with ProPublica to film and produce it.\n\nHe did not send questions to the White House ahead of time, nor did he get approval for the topics to be discussed during the interview.\n\nRecording began as soon as Biden was miked and sitting in the chair that Friday at 2:50 p.m. Earlier that day, Biden's press staff had said the president would have only 10 minutes for the interview, instead of the previously agreed upon 20 minutes. We requested that the interview go the full 20 minutes. You can hear during the unedited interview a couple of moments when White House staff interrupted to signal that the interview should come to a close.

      "text": "The Biden Interview: The President Talks About the Supreme Court, Threats to Democracy and Trump's Vow to Exact Retribution\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that he was not fully confident that the current U.S. Supreme Court, which he described as extreme, could be relied on to uphold the rule of law.\n\nWhen asked the question directly, Biden paused for a few seconds. Then he sighed and said, \"I worry.\"\n\n\"Because,\" he said, \"I know that if the other team, the MAGA Republicans, win, they don't want to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nBut he said, \"I do think at the end of the day, this court, which has been one of the most extreme courts, I still think in the basic fundamentals of rule of law, that they would sustain the rule of law.\"\n\nStill, Biden said the court itself should recognize it needs ethics rules after stories by ProPublica revealed that billionaires had given undisclosed gifts to Supreme Court justices and that Justice Clarence Thomas has made appearances at events for donors to the Koch political network. The code of conduct that applies to other federal judges doesn't apply to the Supreme Court. \"The idea that the Constitution would in any way prohibit or not encourage the court to have basic rules of ethics that are just on their face reasonable,\" Biden said, \"is just not the case.\"\n\nThe discussion was part of a rare formal interview on a topic the president has laid out as a priority: How America's democracy is under siege. Seated in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday afternoon, Biden seemed relaxed and confident, batting back a question about why he thinks he's the only Democrat who can protect democracy next year, especially given voter concerns with his age: \"I'm not the only Democrat that can protect it. I just happen to be the Democrat who I think is best positioned to see to it that the guy I was worried about taking on democracy is not president.\"\n\nBiden cast the threat to democracy posed by Donald Trump's 2024 candidacy as a resistance movement animated by fear of change. \"I think Trump has concluded that he has to win,\" Biden said, noting the rising vitriol in the embattled former president's rhetoric. \"And they'll pull out all the stops.\"\n\nBiden linked the attempt by House Republicans to bring Washington to \"a screeching halt\" through a government shutdown to Trump's effort to regain the presidency. He warned against the desire of \"MAGA Republicans\" - which he called a minority of the GOP, much less the nation as a whole - to weaken institutions such as the federal civil service to shift power over the U.S. government toward the president alone. Trump has promised his supporters to \"be your retribution\" in a second term.\n\nThe drama over a government shutdown resulted from the \"terrible bargain\" Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy made with extremist colleagues to secure his job, Biden said. \"He's willing to do things that he, I think, he knows are inconsistent with constitutional processes.\" He added: \"There is a group of MAGA Republicans who genuinely want to have a fundamental change in the way that the system works. And that's what worries me the most.\"\n\nBiden faulted his Democratic Party for failing at some points to respond effectively to one of the wellsprings of the anti-democratic threat: the anxieties of Americans, most conspicuously blue-collar white men, unsettled by economic, cultural and demographic change.\n\nWhat's needed isn't so much economic benefits as \"treating them with respect,\" said Biden, who has emphasized his middle-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, upbringing throughout his political career. \"The fact is, we're going to be very shortly a minority-white-European country. Sometimes my colleagues don't speak enough to make it clear that that is not going to change how we operate.\"\n\nBiden expressed confidence that the majority of the Republican Party and the nation itself would ultimately safeguard the American experiment. But he exhorted them to \"speak up\" in opposition to the increasingly menacing rhetoric Trump has deployed in response to his legal peril.\n\n\"[Do] not legitimize it,\" he said. He added, in what seemed a reference to the vitriol aimed at jurors and potential jurors in trials for the Jan. 6 insurrection and Trump-related cases, \"I never thought I'd see a time when someone was worried about being on a jury because there may be physical violence against them if they voted the wrong way.\"\n\nHe encouraged Americans concerned about democracy to be \"engaging\" more with family, friends and acquaintances who have embraced extremism. Even more urgent, he added, is voting in next year's presidential election. \"Get in a two-way conversation,\" he said. \"I really do believe that the vast majority of the American people are decent, honorable, straightforward. ... We have to, though, understand what the danger is if they don't participate.\"\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica also asked Biden whether his former Senate colleague Joe Lieberman is upholding democracy by working with an organization called No Labels to pursue a potential third-party candidacy. \"Well, he has a democratic right to do it. There's no reason not to do that. Now, it's going to help the other guy. And he knows [that]. ... That's a political decision he's making that I obviously think is a mistake. But he has a right to do that.\"\n\nBiden was asked whether Fox News and other outlets that spread falsehoods about the 2020 election drive the threat that he's concerned about or simply reflect sentiment that already exists. Both, Biden said: \"Look, there are no editors any more. That's one of the big problems.\" Without providing detail, he suggested that reporters on outlets such as Fox are just doing what they're told.\n\nIn response to a question about whether the decision by Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X (formerly Twitter), to lower guardrails against misinformation contributes to the problem, Biden said, \"Yeah, it does.\" Biden noted that the invention of the printing press had effects that are still felt today. He suggested something similar was happening with the internet. \"Where do people get their news?\" he continued. \"They go on the internet. They go online ... and you have no notion whether it's true or not.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "A Year of Empty Threats and a \"Smokescreen\" Policy: How the State Department Let Israel Get Away With Horrors in Gaza\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nIn early November, a small group of senior U.S. human rights diplomats met with a top official in President Joe Biden's State Department to make one final, emphatic plea: We must keep our word.\n\nWeeks before, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the administration delivered their most explicit ultimatum yet to Israel, demanding the Israel Defense Forces allow hundreds more trucksloads of food and medicine into Gaza every day - or else. American law and Biden's own policies prohibit arms sales to countries that restrict humanitarian aid. Israel had 30 days to comply.\n\nIn the month that followed, the IDF was accused of roundly defying the U.S., its most important ally. The Israeli military tightened its grip, continued to restrict desperately needed aid trucks and displaced 100,000 Palestinians from North Gaza, humanitarian groups found , exacerbating what was already a dire crisis \"to its worst point since the war began.\"\n\nSeveral attendees at the November meeting - officials who help lead the State Department's efforts to promote racial equity, religious freedom and other high-minded principles of democracy - said the United States' international credibility had been severely damaged by Biden's unstinting support of Israel. If there was ever a time to hold Israel accountable, one ambassador at the meeting told Tom Sullivan, the State Department's counselor and a senior policy adviser to Blinken, it was now.\n\nBut the decision had already been made. Sullivan said the deadline would likely pass without action and Biden would continue sending shipments of bombs uninterrupted, according to two people who were in the meeting.\n\nThose in the room deflated. \"Don't our law, policy and morals demand it?\" an attendee told me later, reflecting on the decision to once again capitulate. \"What is the rationale of this approach? There is no explanation they can articulate.\"\n\nSoon after, when the 30-day deadline was up, Blinken made it official and said that Israelis had begun implementing most of the steps he had laid out in his letter - all thanks to the pressure the U.S. had applied.\n\nThat choice was immediately called into question. On Nov. 14, a U.N. committee said that Israel's methods in Gaza, including its use of starvation as a weapon, was \"consistent with genocide.\" Amnesty International went further and concluded a genocide was underway . The International Criminal Court also issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister for the war crime of deliberately starving civilians, among other allegations. (The U.S. and Israeli governments have rejected the genocide determination as well as the warrants.)\n\nThe October red line was the last one Biden laid down, but it wasn't the first. His administration issued multiple threats, warnings and admonishments to Israel about its conduct after Oct. 7, 2023, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, killed some 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\n\nGovernment officials worry Biden's record of empty threats have given the Israelis a sense of impunity.\n\nTrump, who has made a raft of pro-Israel nominations, made it clear he wanted the war in Gaza to end before he took office and threatened that \"all hell will break out\" if Hamas did not release its hostages by then.\n\nOn Wednesday, after months of negotiations, Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire deal. While it will become clear over the next days and months exactly what the contours of the agreement are, why it happened now and who deserves the most credit, it's plausible that Trump's imminent ascension to the White House was its own form of a red line. Early reports suggest the deal looks similar to what has been on the table for months, raising the possibility that if the Biden administration had followed through on its tough words, a deal could have been reached earlier, saving lives.\n\n\"Netanyahu's conclusion was that Biden doesn't have enough oomph to make him pay a price, so he was willing to ignore him,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute who's focused on U.S.-Israel relations and a former official with the Palestinian Authority who helped advise on prior peace talks. \"Part of it is that Netanyahu learned there is no cost to saying 'no' to the current president.\"\n\nSo-called red lines have long been a prominent foreign policy tool for the world's most powerful nations. They are communicated publicly in pronouncements by senior officials and privately by emissaries. They amount to rules of the road for friends and adversaries - you can go this far but no further.\n\nThe failure to enforce those lines in recent years has had consequences, current and former U.S. officials said. One frequently cited example arose in 2012 when President Barack Obama told the Syrian government that using chemical weapons against its own people would change his calculus about directly intervening. When Syria's then-President Bashar al-Assad launched rockets with chemical gas and killed hundreds of civilians anyway, Obama backpedaled and ultimately chose not to invade, a move critics say allowed the civil war to spiral further while extremist groups took advantage by recruiting locals.\n\nAuthorities in and outside government said the acquiescence to Israel as it prosecuted a brutal war will likely be regarded as one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of the Biden presidency. They say it undermines America's ability to influence events in the Middle East while \"destroying the entire edifice of international law that was put into place after WWII,\" as Omer Bartov, a renowned Israeli-American scholar of genocide, put it. Jeffrey Feltman, the former assistant secretary of the State Department's Middle East bureau, told me he fears much of the Muslim world now sees the U.S. as \"ineffective at best or complicit at worst in the large-scale civilian destruction and death.\"\n\nBiden's warnings over the past year have also been explicit. Last spring, the president vowed to stop supplying offensive bombs to Israel if it launched a major invasion into the southern city of Rafah. He also told Netanyahu the U.S. was going to rethink support for the war unless he took new steps to protect civilians and aid workers after the IDF blew up a World Central Kitchen caravan. And Blinken signaled that he would blacklist a notorious IDF unit for the death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank if the soldiers involved were not brought to justice.\n\nTime and again, Israel crossed the Biden administration's red lines without changing course in a meaningful way, according to interviews with government officials and outside experts. Each time, the U.S. yielded and continued to send Israel's military deadly weapons of war, approving more than $17.9 billion in military assistance since late 2023, by some estimates. The State Department recently told Congress about another $8 billion proposed deal to sell Israel munitions and artillery shells.\n\n\"It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the red lines have all just been a smokescreen,\" said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School and a preeminent authority on U.S. policy in the region. \"The Biden administration decided to be all in and merely pretended that it was trying to do something about it.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times , Blinken disagreed and said Netanyahu has listened to him by softening Israel's most aggressive tactics, including in Rafah. He also argued there was a cost to even questioning the IDF openly. \"Whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel,\" Blinken said, \"Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a ceasefire and the release of hostages.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that not enough humanitarian assistance has been reaching civilians and said the Israelis initially resisted the idea of allowing any food and medicine into Gaza - which would be a war crime - but Netanyahu relented in response to U.S. pressure behind the scenes. Blinken backtracked later in the interview and suggested that the blocking of aid was not Israeli policy. \"There's a very different question about what was the intent,\" he told the Times.\n\nFor this story, ProPublica spoke with scores of current and former officials throughout the year and read through government memos, cables and emails, many of which have not been reported previously. The records and interviews shed light on why Biden and his top advisers refused to adjust his policy even as new evidence of Israeli abuses emerged.\n\nThroughout the contentious year inside the State Department, senior leaders repeatedly disregarded their own experts. They cracked down on leaks by threatening criminal investigations and classifying material that was critical of Israel. Some of the agency's top Middle East diplomats complained in private that they were sidelined by Biden's National Security Council. The council also distributed a list of banned phrases, including any version of \"State of Palestine\" that didn't have the word \"future\" first.  Two human rights officials said they were prevented from pursuing evidence of abuses in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe State Department did not make Blinken available for an interview, but the agency's top spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said in a statement that Blinken welcomes internal dissent and has incorporated it into his policymaking. \"The Department continues to encourage individuals to make their opinions known through appropriate channels,\" he added. Miller denied that the agency has classified material for any reason other than national security.\n\nOver the past year, reports have documented physical and sexual abuse in Israeli prisons, using Palestinians as human shields and razing residential buildings and hospitals . At one point early in the conflict, UNICEF said more than 10 children required amputations every day on average. Israeli soldiers have videotaped themselves burning food supplies and ransacking homes. One IDF group reportedly said , \"Our job is to flatten Gaza.\"\n\nIsrael's defenders, including those on the National Security Council , acknowledge the devastating human toll but contend that American arms have helped Israel advance western interests in the region and protect itself from other enemies. Indeed, Netanyahu has significantly diminished Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing many of the groups' leaders. Then Iran's \"axis of resistance\" received its most consequential blow late last year when rebel groups ousted Assad from Syria.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew told the Times of Israel he worried that a generation of young Americans will harbor anti-Israel sentiments into the future. He said he wished that Israel had done a better job at communicating how carefully it undertook combat decisions and calling attention to its humanitarian successes to counter a narrative in the American press that he considers biased.\n\n\"The media that is presenting a pro-Hamas perspective is out instantaneously telling a story,\" Lew said. \"It tells a story that is, over time, shown not to be completely accurate. 'Thirty-five children were killed.' Well, it wasn't 35 children. It was many fewer.\"\n\n\"The children who were killed,\" he added, \"turned out to have been the children of Hamas fighters.\"\n\nThe repercussions for the United States and the region will play out for years. Protests have erupted outside the American embassies in Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia, the world's third-largest democracy, while polls show Arab Americans grew increasingly hostile to their own government stateside. Russia, before its black eye in Syria, and China have both sought to capitalize by entering business and defense deals with Arab nations. By the summer, State Department analysts in the Middle East sent cables to Washington expressing concerns that the IDF's conduct would only inflame tensions in the West Bank and galvanize young Palestinians to take up arms against Israel. Intelligence officials warn that terrorist groups are recruiting on the anti-American sentiment throughout the region, which they say is at its highest levels in years.\n\nThe Israeli government did not answer detailed questions, but a spokesperson for the embassy in Washington, D.C., broadly defended Israel's relationship with the U.S., \"two allies who have been working together to push back against extremist, destabilizing actors.\" Israel is a country of laws, the spokesperson added, and its actions over the past 15 months \"benefit the interests of the free world and the United States, creating an opportunity for a better future for the Middle East amid the tragedy of the war started by Hamas.\"\n\nNext week, Trump will inherit a demoralized State Department, part of the federal bureaucracy from which he has pledged to cull disloyal employees. Grappling with the near-daily images of carnage in Gaza, many across the U.S. government have become disenchanted with the lofty ideas they thought they represented.\n\n\"This is the human rights atrocity of our time,\" one senior diplomat told me. \"I work for the department that's responsible for this policy. I signed up for this. ... I don't deserve sympathy for it.\"\n\nThe southern city of Rafah was supposed to be a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who the IDF had forced from their homes in the north at the start of the war. When Biden learned that Netanyahu intended to invade the city this spring, he warned that the U.S. will stop sending offensive arms if the Israelis went through with it.\n\n\"It is a red line,\" Biden had said, marking the first high-profile warning from the U.S.\n\nNetanyahu invaded in May anyway. Israeli tanks rolled into the city and the IDF dropped bombs on Hamas targets, including a refugee camp , killing dozens of civilians. Biden responded by pausing a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs but otherwise resumed military support.\n\nIn late May, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to stop its assault on the city, citing the Geneva Conventions. Behind the scenes, State Department lawyers scrambled to come up with a legal basis on which Israel could continue smaller attacks in Rafah. \"There is room to argue that more scaled back/targeted operations, combined with better humanitarian efforts, would not meet that threshold,\" the lawyers said in a May 24 email. While it's not unreasonable for government lawyers to defend a close ally, critics say the cable illustrates the extreme deference the U.S. affords Israel.\n\n\"The State Department has a whole raft of highly paid, very good lawyers to explain, 'Actually this is not illegal,' when in fact it is,\" said Ari Tolany, an arms trade authority and director at the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. \"Rules for thee and not for me.\"\n\nThe administration says that it restrained Israel's attack in Rafah. In a recent interview, Lew told the Times of Israel the operation ultimately resulted in relatively few civilian casualties. \"It was done in a way that limited or really eliminated the friction between the United States and Israel,\" he added, \"but also led to a much better outcome.\"\n\nSeveral experts told me international law is effectively discretionary for some countries. \"American policy ignores it when it's inconvenient and adheres to it when it is convenient,\" said Aaron Miller, a career State Department diplomat who worked for decades under both Democratic and Republican presidents as an adviser on Arab-Israeli negotiations. \"The U.S. does not leverage or bring sustainable, credible, serious pressure to bear on any of its allies and partners,\" he added, \"not just Israel.\"\n\nRead More\n\nMiller and others note that the barbarity of Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, galvanized domestic support for Israel and made it significantly easier for Biden to avoid holding the Israelis accountable as they retaliated.\n\nThere are other likely reasons for Biden's unwillingness to impose any realistic limitations on Israel's use of American weaponry since Oct. 7. For one, his career-long affinity for Israel - its security, people and the idea of a friendly democracy in the Middle East - is shared by many of the most powerful people in the country. (\"If this Capitol crumbles to the ground, the one thing that would remain is our commitment to our aid - I don't even call it aid, our cooperation - with Israel,\" Nancy Pelosi said in 2018, weeks before resuming her role as House speaker.) That rationale aligned with the Democrats' political goals during an election when they were wary of taking risks and upsetting large portions of the electorate, including the immensely powerful Israel lobby.\n\nImmediately after the ICJ's order about the Rafah invasion, officials in the State Department's Middle East and communications divisions drafted a list of proposed public statements to acknowledge the importance of the court and express concern over civilians in the city. But Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesperson, nixed almost all of them. He told the officials in a May 24 email that those on the White House's National Security Council \"aren't going to clear\" any recognition of the ruling or criticism of Israel.\n\nThat was an early sign that the State Department was taking a back seat in shaping war policy. In its place, the NSC - largely led by Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein - assumed a larger role. While the NSC has grown significantly in size and influence over the decades, State Department officials repeatedly told me they felt marginalized this past year.\n\n\"The NSC has final say over our messaging,\" one diplomat said. \"All any of us can do is what they'll allow us to do.\"\n\nThe NSC did not make its senior leaders available for an interview or respond to questions from ProPublica. Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser and brother to the State Department's counselor, said recently it was difficult, for much of the past year, \"to get the Israeli government to align with a lot of what President Biden publicly has been saying\" about Gaza.\n\nRead More\n\nSullivan said too many civilians have died there and the U.S. was frequently required to publicly and privately pressure Israel to improve the flow of humanitarian aid. \"We believe Israel has a responsibility - as a democracy, as a country committed to the basic principle of the value of innocent life, and as a member of the international community that has obligations under international humanitarian law - that it do the utmost to protect and minimize harm to civilians.\"\n\nDuring another internal State Department meeting in March, top regional diplomats voiced their frustrations about messaging and appearances. Hady Amr, one of the government's highest-ranking authorities on Palestinian affairs, said he was reluctant to address large groups about the administration's Israel policy and he took issue with much of it, according to notes of the conversation. He warned colleagues that the sentiment in Muslim communities was turning. From a public diplomacy perspective, Amr told them, the war has been \"catastrophically bad for the U.S.\" (Amr did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAnother attendee at the meeting said they had been effectively sidelined by the NSC. A third said it was a huge amount of effort to even get permission to use the word \"condemn\" when talking about Israeli settlers demolishing Palestinians' homes in the West Bank.\n\nSuch sanitizing language became common. Alex Smith, a former contractor with the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that at one point the State Department distributed NSC's list of phrases that he and others weren't allowed to use on internal presentations. Instead of \"Palestinian residents of Jerusalem,\" for example, they were meant to say \"non-Israeli residents of Jerusalem.\" Another official told Smith in an email, \"I would recommend not discussing [international humanitarian law] at all without extensive clearances.\"\n\nA USAID spokesperson said in an email that the agency couldn't discuss personnel matters, but the list of terms was given to the agency by the State Department as early as 2022, before the war in Gaza. The list, the spokesperson added, includes the \"suggested terms that are in line with U.S. diplomatic protocol.\"\n\nDeference to Israel is not new. For decades, the U.S. has repeatedly looked the other way when Israel is accused of human rights abuses.\n\nOne of the most conspicuous paper tigers in American foreign policy is the Leahy Law, experts say. Passed more than 25 years ago, the law's authors intended to force foreign governments to hold their own accountable for violations like torture or extrajudicial killings - or their military assistance would be restricted. The law allowed precision targeting of individual units that faced credible allegations, so that the U.S. didn't need to cut off entire countries from U.S.-funded weapons and training. It's essentially a blacklist.\n\nRead More\n\nAlmost immediately, Israel got special treatment, records show. In March 1998, IDF soldiers fired on journalists covering demonstrations in the West Bank city of Hebron. Congress asked the State Department, then led by Madeleine Albright, to take action under the new law. \"An Israeli official informed the U.S. Embassy that the soldiers were disciplined after the incident, but was unable to provide further information,\" State Department officials responded in a letter - more than two years later - to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the law's namesake. \"It is the Department's conclusion that there are insufficient grounds on which to conclude that the units involved committed gross violations of human rights.\"\n\nWhile the country took action across the globe in South America, the Pacific Rim and elsewhere, the U.S. government has never disqualified an Israeli military unit under the law - despite voluminous evidence presented to the State Department.\n\nIn 2020, the agency even set up a special council, called the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, to assess accusations against the country's military and police units. The forum is composed of State Department officials with expertise in human rights, arms transfers and the Middle East who review public allegations of human rights abuses before making referrals to the Secretary of State. While it had ambitious goals to finally hold Israeli units accountable, the forum became widely known as just another layer of bureaucracy that slowed down the process and protected Israel.\n\nCurrent and former diplomats told me that U.S. leaders are fundamentally unwilling to follow through on the law and cut off units from American-funded weapons. Instead, they have created multiple processes that give the appearance of accountability while simultaneously undermining any potential results, the experts said.\n\n\"It's like walking toward the horizon,\" said Charles Blaha, a former director at the State Department who served on the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum. \"You can always walk toward it but you will never ever get there.\"\n\n\"I really believed in the Israeli military justice system and I really believed that the State Department was acting in good faith,\" he added. \"But both of those things were wrong.\"\n\nA review of the vetting forum's emails and meeting minutes from 2021 through 2022 shows even the most high-profile and seemingly egregious cases fall into a bureaucratic black hole.\n\nAfter the IDF was accused of killing Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in May 2022, videos circulated on the internet of Israeli police units beating pallbearers at her funeral. \"It is indeed very difficult to watch,\" a deputy assistant secretary wrote in an email to a member of the forum. Another member told colleagues, \"I think this would be what is actionable for the funeral procession itself as we wait for more info on circumstances of death and whether this would trigger Leahy ineligibility.\"\n\nNeither Akleh's killing, nor the funeral beatings, led to Leahy determinations against Israel.\n\nFor years, lawmakers pushed the U.S. government to take action on Akleh's case. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide who helped draft the Leahy Law, recently held a meeting with State Department officials to discuss the case again. The officials in the meeting again punted. \"We're talking about an American journalist who was killed by an Israeli soldier and nothing happened,\" he said. \"They are walking out the door on Jan. 20th and they haven't implemented the law.\"\n\nIn another case considered by the forum, a 15-year-old boy from the West Bank said he was tortured and raped in the Israeli detention facility Al-Mascobiyya, or Russian Compound. For years, the State Department had been told about widespread abuses in that facility and others like it.\n\nMilitary Court Watch, a local nonprofit organization of attorneys, collected testimony from more than 1,100 minors who had been detained between 2013 and 2023. Most said they were strip searched and many said they were beaten. Some teens tried to kill themselves in solitary confinement. IDF soldiers recalled children so scared that they peed themselves during arrests.\n\nAt the Russian Compound, a 14-year-old said his interrogator shocked and beat him in the legs with sticks to elicit information about a car fire. A 15-year-old said he was handcuffed with another boy. \"An Israeli policeman then walked into the room and beat the hell out of me and the other boy,\" he said. A 12-year-old girl said she was put into a small cell with cockroaches.\n\nMilitary Court Watch routinely shared its information with the State Department, according to Gerard Horton, one of the group's co-founders. But nothing ever came of it. \"They receive all our reports and we name the facilities,\" he told me. \"It goes up the food chain and it gets political. Everyone knows what's going on and obviously no action is taken.\"\n\nEven the State Department's own public human rights reports acknowledge widespread allegations of abuse in Israeli prisons. Citing nonprofits, prisoner testimony and media reports, the agency wrote last year that \"detainees held by Israel were subjected to physical and sexual violence, threats, intimidation, severely restricted access to food and water.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2021, the State Department reached out to the Israeli government and asked about the 15-year-old who said he was raped at the Russian Compound. The next day, the Israeli government raided the nonprofit that had originally documented the allegation, Defense for Children International - Palestine, and then designated the group a terrorist organization.\n\nAs a result, U.S. human rights officials said they were prohibited from speaking to DCIP. \"A large part of the frustration was that we were unable to access Palestinian civil society because most NGOs\" - nongovernmental organizations - \"were considered terrorist organizations,\" said Mike Casey, a former U.S. diplomat in Jerusalem who resigned last year. \"All these groups were essentially the premier human rights organizations, and we were not able to meet with them.\"\n\nMiller, the State Department spokesperson, said in his statement that the agency has not \"blanketly prohibited\" officials from speaking with groups that document allegations of human rights abuses and they continue to work with organizations in Israel and the West Bank.\n\nAfter the raid on DCIP, a member of the forum emailed his superior at the State Department and said the U.S. should push to get an explanation for the raid from the Israelis and \"re-raise our original request for info on the underlying allegation.\"\n\nBut almost two years went by and there were no arrests, while those on the forum struggled to get basic information about the case. Then, in the early months of the Israel war on Hamas, another State Department official reached out to DCIP and tried to reengage, according to a recording of the conversation.\n\n\"As you can imagine, it's been a bit touchy here,\" the official said on the call, explaining the months without correspondence. \"The Israeli government's not going to dictate to me who I can talk to, but my superiors can.\"\n\nThe IDF eventually told the State Department it did not find evidence of a sexual assault but reprimanded the guard for kicking a chair during the teenager's interrogation. To date, the U.S. has not cut off the Russian Compound on Leahy grounds.\n\nIn late April, there was surprising news: Blinken was reportedly set to take action against Netzah Yehuda, a notorious ultraorthodox IDF battalion, under the Leahy law.\n\nThe Leahy forum had recommended several cases to him. But for months, he sat on the recommendations . One of them was the case of Omar Assad.\n\nOn a cold night in January 2022, Netzah Yehuda soldiers pulled over Assad, an elderly Palestinian American who was on his way home from playing cards in the West Bank. They bound, blindfolded and gagged him and led him into a construction site, according to local investigators. He was found dead shortly after.\n\nAfter the killing, DAWN, an advocacy group founded by the slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, compiled a dossier of evidence on the case, including testimony from family and witnesses, as well as a medical examiner's report. The report found Assad had traumatic injuries to the head and other injuries that caused a stress-induced heart attack. The group delivered the dossier to the State Department's Leahy forum.\n\nThe dossier also included information about other incidents. For years, Netzah Yehuda has been accused of violent crimes in the West Bank, including killing unarmed Palestinians. They have also been convicted of torturing and abusing detainees in custody.\n\nBy late 2023, after the Oct. 7 attacks, the experts on the forum decided that Assad's case met all the conditions of the Leahy law: a human rights violation had occurred and the soldiers responsible had not been adequately punished. The forum recommended that the battalion should no longer receive any American-funded weapons or training until the perpetrators are brought to justice.\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica published an article in the spring of 2024 about Blinken sitting on the recommendations . But when he signaled his intention to take action shortly after, the Israelis responded with fury . \"Sanctions must not be imposed on the Israel Defense Forces!\" Netanyahu posted on X. \"The intention to impose a sanction on a unit in the IDF is the height of absurdity and a moral low.\"\n\nThe pressure campaign, which also reportedly came from Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La. and Lew, the ambassador, appears to have worked. For months, Blinken punted on an official decision. Then, in August, the State Department announced that Netzah Yehuda would not be cut off from military aid after all because the U.S. had received new information that the IDF had effectively \"remediated\" the case. Two soldiers involved were removed from active duty and made ineligible to serve in the reserve, but there is no indication that anyone was charged with a crime.\n\nMiller, the spokesperson, said the IDF also took steps to avoid similar incidents in the future, like enhanced screening and a two-week educational seminar for Netzah Yehuda recruits.\n\n\"In seven and a half years as director of the State Department office that implements the Leahy law worldwide,\" Blaha wrote shortly after the announcement, \"I have never seen a single case in which mere administrative measures constituted sufficient remediation.\"\n\nIn its statement to ProPublica, the Israeli government did not address individual cases, but said, \"All of the incidents in question were thoroughly examined by the American administration, which concluded that Israel took remedial measures when necessary.\"\n\nLast summer, CNN documented how commanders in the battalion have been promoted to senior positions in the IDF, where they train ground troops and run operations in Gaza. A weapons expert told me the guns that Netzah Yehuda soldiers have been photographed holding were likely made in the U.S.\n\nLater in the year, Younis Tirawi, a Palestinian journalist who runs a popular account on X, posted videos showing IDF soldiers who recorded themselves rummaging through children's clothing inside a home and demolishing a mosque's minaret. Tirawi said the soldiers were in Netzah Yehuda. (ProPublica could not independently verify the soldiers' units.)\n\nHebrew text added to one of the videos said, \"We won't leave a trace of them.\"\n\nOn Nov. 14, more than a year after the war started, Human Rights Watch released a report and said that Israel's forced displacement of Palestinians is widespread, systematic and intentional. It accused the Israelis of a crime against humanity, writing, \"Israel's actions appear to also meet the definition of ethnic cleansing.\" (A former Israeli defense minister has also made that allegation .)\n\nDuring a news briefing later that day, reporters pressed a State Department spokesperson, Vedant Patel, on the report's findings.\n\nPatel said the U.S. government disagrees and has not seen evidence of forced displacement in Gaza.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"certainly would be a red line.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

      "text": "Following a Series of Government Hacks, Biden Closes Out His Administration With New Cybersecurity Order\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nOn Thursday, in his final week in office, President Joe Biden issued an executive order intended to strengthen the nation's cyber defenses, in part by requiring software providers like Microsoft to provide proof that they meet certain security standards before they can sell their products to the federal government.\n\nThe action follows an onslaught of cyberattacks in recent years in which hackers linked to Russia, China and other adversaries have exploited software vulnerabilities to steal sensitive documents from federal agencies.\n\nIn demanding more accountability from software makers, Biden pointed to instances in which contractors \"commit to following cybersecurity practices, yet do not fix well-known exploitable vulnerabilities in their software, which puts the Government at risk of compromise.\"\n\nIn June, ProPublica reported on such a case involving Microsoft, the largest IT vendor to the federal government. In the so-called SolarWinds attack, which was discovered shortly before Biden took office, Russian state-sponsored hackers exploited a weakness in a Microsoft product to steal sensitive data from the National Nuclear Security Administration and other agencies. ProPublica found that, for years, Microsoft leaders ignored warnings about the flaw from one of their own engineers because they feared that publicly acknowledging it would alienate the federal government and cause the company to lose ground to competitors.\n\nThat profit-over-security culture was driven in large part by the rush to gain ground in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing market, the news organization reported. One former Microsoft supervisor described the attitude as, \"Do whatever it frickin' takes to win because you have to win.\"\n\nMicrosoft has defended its decision not to address the flaw, telling ProPublica in June that the company's assessment at the time involved \"multiple reviews\" and that it considers several factors when making security decisions, including \"potential customer disruption, exploitability, and available mitigations.\" But in the months and years following the SolarWinds hack, Microsoft's security lapses contributed to other attacks on the government, including one in 2023 in which hackers connected to the Chinese government gained access to top U.S. officials' emails. The federal Cyber Safety Review Board later found that the company had deprioritized security investments and risk management, resulting in a \"cascade of ... avoidable errors.\"\n\nMicrosoft has pledged to put security \"above all else.\"\n\nTo be sure, Microsoft is not the only company whose products have provided hackers entree to government networks. Russian hackers in the SolarWinds attack gained access to victim networks through tainted software updates provided by the Texas-based SolarWinds company before exploiting the flawed Microsoft product.\n\nTo help prevent future hacks, the government wants IT companies to provide proof that they use \"secure software development practices to reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities\" in their products, according to the order. In addition, the government \"needs to adopt more rigorous third-party risk management practices\" to verify the use of such practices, Biden said. He asked for changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the rules for government contracting, to implement his recommendations. If fully enacted, violators of the new requirements could be referred to the attorney general for legal action.\n\nBiden also said that strengthening the security of federal \"identity management systems\" was \"especially critical\" to improving the nation's cybersecurity. Indeed, the Microsoft product that was the focus of ProPublica's June article was a so-called \"identity\" product that allowed users to access nearly every program used at work with a single logon. By exploiting the weakness in the identity product during the SolarWinds attack, the Russian hackers were able to swiftly vacuum up emails from victim networks.\n\nIn November, ProPublica reported that Microsoft capitalized on SolarWinds in the wake of the attack, offering federal agencies free trials of its cybersecurity products. The move effectively locked those agencies in to more expensive software licenses and vastly expanded Microsoft's footprint across the federal government. The company told ProPublica that its offer was a direct response to \"an urgent request by the Administration to enhance the security posture of federal agencies.\" In his executive order, Biden addressed the fallout of that 2021 request, directing the federal government to mitigate the risks presented by the \"concentration of IT vendors and services,\" a veiled reference to Washington's increased dependence on Microsoft, which some lawmakers have referred to as a \"cybersecurity monoculture.\"\n\nThough the order marks a firmer stance with the technology companies supplying the government, enforcement will fall to the Trump administration. It's unclear whether the incoming president will see the changes in the executive order through. President-elect Donald Trump has emphasized deregulation even as he has indicated that his administration will take a tough stance on China, one of the nation's top cyber adversaries.\n\nNeither Microsoft nor the Trump transition team responded to requests for comment on the order.\n\nThursday's executive order was the latest in a series of regulatory efforts impacting Microsoft in the waning days of the Biden administration. Last month, ProPublica reported that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company in a probe that will examine whether the company's business practices have run afoul of antitrust laws. FTC attorneys have been conducting interviews and setting up meetings with Microsoft competitors, and one key area of interest is how the company packages popular Office products together with cybersecurity and cloud computing services.\n\nRead More\n\nThis so-called bundling was the subject of ProPublica's November investigation , which detailed how, beginning in 2021, Microsoft used the practice to box competitors out of lucrative federal contracts. The FTC views the fact that Microsoft has won more federal business even as it left the government vulnerable to hacks as an example of the company's problematic power over the market, a person familiar with the probe told ProPublica.\n\nMicrosoft has declined to comment on the specifics of the investigation but told the news organization last month that the FTC's recent demand for information is \"broad, wide ranging, and requests things that are out of the realm of possibility to even be logical.\"\n\nThe commission's new leadership, chosen by Trump, will decide the future of that investigation.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI am a ProPublica reporter focused on technology, cybersecurity and business.\n\nI'm interested in the intersection of Big Tech and national security.

Hur about his five hours of interviews with the president on Oct. 8 and 9 drove months of coverage. The prosecutor said Biden had \"diminished faculties in advancing age\" and called him a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Biden angrily dismissed these assertions, which Vice President Kamala Harris called \"politically motivated.\"\n\nHouse Republicans on Monday sued Attorney General Merrick B. Garland for audio recordings of the interview as the White House asserts executive privilege to deny their release .\n\nProPublica obtained a rare interview with Biden on Sept. 29, nine days before the Hur interviews began. We released the video , which was assembled from footage shot by five cameras, on Oct. 1. We edited out less than a minute of crosstalk and exchanges with the camera people, as is customary in such interviews.\n\nToday, we are releasing the full, 21-minute interview, unedited as seen from the view of the single camera focused on Biden. We understand that this video captures a moment in time nine months ago and that it will not settle the ongoing arguments about the president's acuity today.  Still, we believe it is worth giving the public another chance to see one of Biden's infrequent conversations with a reporter.\n\nThe Interview With the Camera Focused on Biden\n\nThe Interview as Published\n\nConducting the interview was veteran journalist and former CNN White House correspondent John Harwood, who requested it and then worked with ProPublica to film and produce it.\n\nHe did not send questions to the White House ahead of time, nor did he get approval for the topics to be discussed during the interview.\n\nRecording began as soon as Biden was miked and sitting in the chair that Friday at 2:50 p.m. Earlier that day, Biden's press staff had said the president would have only 10 minutes for the interview, instead of the previously agreed upon 20 minutes. We requested that the interview go the full 20 minutes. You can hear during the unedited interview a couple of moments when White House staff interrupted to signal that the interview should come to a close. Biden seemed eager to continue talking.\n\nRead More\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe Biden administration announced on Monday that it has finalized new regulations to strengthen protections for mental health care coverage and hold insurance companies accountable for unlawfully denying it.\n\nThe rules update the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which was passed in 2008, requiring health insurance plans to provide the same access to mental health care as medical care. The new provisions will force health insurance plans to collect and report more robust data on how they limit and deny mental health claims. If disparities exist between mental and medical care, insurers will need to lay out how they are attempting to address these gaps.\n\n\"Mental health care is health care. But for far too many Americans, critical care and treatments are out of reach,\" President Joe Biden said in a press release announcing the final rules. \"There is no reason that breaking your arm should be treated differently than having a mental health condition.\"\n\nThe updated rules seek to address a problem captured in numerous studies and reports and examined in a new level of detail in a recent ProPublica investigation.\n\nAlthough nearly all Americans have health insurance, millions still can't access mental health care. ProPublica found that insurance companies have interfered with patient care , deployed aggressive audits and set reimbursement rates so low that providers felt they had no choice but to quit insurance networks. Our reporting also documented how consequences can be fatal when patients can't find therapists or mental health treatment.\n\nFederal regulators have struggled to police insurance companies . Nearly all of the recent reports that the Department of Labor has collected from insurers and health plans have lacked enough detail to determine companies' compliance with the law, the department reported to Congress last year. Some states have passed laws to close those gaps in information , but we found mental health protections often depend on where one lives.\n\nThe new rules require insurers to collect and turn over outcomes data, like denial rates, to measure how often patients access care. The companies will have to disclose details on insurance networks, which may include how regularly patients go out of network for mental health treatment and how reimbursement rates are calculated for mental health providers.\n\nThe rules also clarify that patients have the right to access this data and require insurers and health plans to furnish records within 30 days of a request .\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., who chairs the Committee on Education and the Workforce, said the rules are too burdensome. \"These rules do nothing to improve mental health care access and instead put paperwork over patients,\" she said in an emailed statement.\n\nBut former U.S. Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, who sponsored the 2008 parity bill and co-founded the mental health advocacy nonprofit The Kennedy Forum, said the new rules will protect access for patients. \"This is an opportunity for consumers to finally have a seat at the table,\" he told ProPublica.\n\nThe law applies to 175 million people who have private health insurance. Under the new rules, these protections will also cover people with health insurance through state and local governments, about 120,000 additional Americans.\n\nRead More\n\nThe finalized regulations came after a yearlong review process, in which three departments - Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Labor - collected thousands of public comments. The departments had initially published proposed rules in August 2023. Some of the provisions will go into effect on Jan. 1, said Lisa Gomez, the assistant secretary of employee benefits security at the Department of Labor.\n\n\"People living with mental health conditions and substance use disorders continue to face greater barriers,\" she said. \"That's not fair, it's not right and it's against the law.\"\n\nWe're Investigating Mental Health Care Access.

      "text": "Following a Series of Government Hacks, Biden Closes Out His Administration With New Cybersecurity Order\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nOn Thursday, in his final week in office, President Joe Biden issued an executive order intended to strengthen the nation's cyber defenses, in part by requiring software providers like Microsoft to provide proof that they meet certain security standards before they can sell their products to the federal government.\n\nThe action follows an onslaught of cyberattacks in recent years in which hackers linked to Russia, China and other adversaries have exploited software vulnerabilities to steal sensitive documents from federal agencies.\n\nIn demanding more accountability from software makers, Biden pointed to instances in which contractors \"commit to following cybersecurity practices, yet do not fix well-known exploitable vulnerabilities in their software, which puts the Government at risk of compromise.\"\n\nIn June, ProPublica reported on such a case involving Microsoft, the largest IT vendor to the federal government. In the so-called SolarWinds attack, which was discovered shortly before Biden took office, Russian state-sponsored hackers exploited a weakness in a Microsoft product to steal sensitive data from the National Nuclear Security Administration and other agencies. ProPublica found that, for years, Microsoft leaders ignored warnings about the flaw from one of their own engineers because they feared that publicly acknowledging it would alienate the federal government and cause the company to lose ground to competitors.\n\nThat profit-over-security culture was driven in large part by the rush to gain ground in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing market, the news organization reported. One former Microsoft supervisor described the attitude as, \"Do whatever it frickin' takes to win because you have to win.\"\n\nMicrosoft has defended its decision not to address the flaw, telling ProPublica in June that the company's assessment at the time involved \"multiple reviews\" and that it considers several factors when making security decisions, including \"potential customer disruption, exploitability, and available mitigations.\" But in the months and years following the SolarWinds hack, Microsoft's security lapses contributed to other attacks on the government, including one in 2023 in which hackers connected to the Chinese government gained access to top U.S. officials' emails. The federal Cyber Safety Review Board later found that the company had deprioritized security investments and risk management, resulting in a \"cascade of ... avoidable errors.\"\n\nMicrosoft has pledged to put security \"above all else.\"\n\nTo be sure, Microsoft is not the only company whose products have provided hackers entree to government networks. Russian hackers in the SolarWinds attack gained access to victim networks through tainted software updates provided by the Texas-based SolarWinds company before exploiting the flawed Microsoft product.\n\nTo help prevent future hacks, the government wants IT companies to provide proof that they use \"secure software development practices to reduce the number and severity of vulnerabilities\" in their products, according to the order. In addition, the government \"needs to adopt more rigorous third-party risk management practices\" to verify the use of such practices, Biden said. He asked for changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the rules for government contracting, to implement his recommendations. If fully enacted, violators of the new requirements could be referred to the attorney general for legal action.\n\nBiden also said that strengthening the security of federal \"identity management systems\" was \"especially critical\" to improving the nation's cybersecurity. Indeed, the Microsoft product that was the focus of ProPublica's June article was a so-called \"identity\" product that allowed users to access nearly every program used at work with a single logon. By exploiting the weakness in the identity product during the SolarWinds attack, the Russian hackers were able to swiftly vacuum up emails from victim networks.\n\nIn November, ProPublica reported that Microsoft capitalized on SolarWinds in the wake of the attack, offering federal agencies free trials of its cybersecurity products. The move effectively locked those agencies in to more expensive software licenses and vastly expanded Microsoft's footprint across the federal government. The company told ProPublica that its offer was a direct response to \"an urgent request by the Administration to enhance the security posture of federal agencies.\" In his executive order, Biden addressed the fallout of that 2021 request, directing the federal government to mitigate the risks presented by the \"concentration of IT vendors and services,\" a veiled reference to Washington's increased dependence on Microsoft, which some lawmakers have referred to as a \"cybersecurity monoculture.\"\n\nThough the order marks a firmer stance with the technology companies supplying the government, enforcement will fall to the Trump administration. It's unclear whether the incoming president will see the changes in the executive order through. President-elect Donald Trump has emphasized deregulation even as he has indicated that his administration will take a tough stance on China, one of the nation's top cyber adversaries.\n\nNeither Microsoft nor the Trump transition team responded to requests for comment on the order.\n\nThursday's executive order was the latest in a series of regulatory efforts impacting Microsoft in the waning days of the Biden administration. Last month, ProPublica reported that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company in a probe that will examine whether the company's business practices have run afoul of antitrust laws. FTC attorneys have been conducting interviews and setting up meetings with Microsoft competitors, and one key area of interest is how the company packages popular Office products together with cybersecurity and cloud computing services.\n\nRead More\n\nThis so-called bundling was the subject of ProPublica's November investigation , which detailed how, beginning in 2021, Microsoft used the practice to box competitors out of lucrative federal contracts. The FTC views the fact that Microsoft has won more federal business even as it left the government vulnerable to hacks as an example of the company's problematic power over the market, a person familiar with the probe told ProPublica.\n\nMicrosoft has declined to comment on the specifics of the investigation but told the news organization last month that the FTC's recent demand for information is \"broad, wide ranging, and requests things that are out of the realm of possibility to even be logical.\"\n\nThe commission's new leadership, chosen by Trump, will decide the future of that investigation.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI am a ProPublica reporter focused on technology, cybersecurity and business.\n\nI'm interested in the intersection of Big Tech and national security.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nby Eric Umansky\n\nWith Sen. Joe Biden joining the Democratic ticket, there's renewed scrutiny of Biden's connections to the credit card industry. Biden has been particularly cozy with MBNA, a financial services company from Delaware, and now a subsidiary of Bank of America.\n\nOver the past 20 years, MBNA has been Biden's single largest contributor . And as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal note, Biden's son Hunter was hired out of law school by MBNA and later worked as a lobbyist for the company.\n\nThe Times also details just how helpful Biden has been to MBNA and the credit card industry. The senator was a key supporter of an industry-favorite bill -- the \"Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act  of 2005\" -- that actually made it harder for consumers to get protection under bankruptcy.\n\nAs the Times notes, Biden was one of the first Democratic supporters of the bill and voted for it four times until it finally passed in March 2005. A spokesman for Sen. Obama told the Times , \"Senator Biden took on entrenched interests and succeeded in improving the bill for low-income workers, women and children.\"\n\nYet the Times actually looked at the legislative record and paints a different picture :\n\n[Biden] was one of five Democrats in March 2005 who voted against a proposal to require credit card companies to provide more effective warnings to consumers about the consequences of paying only the minimum amount due each month. Mr. Obama voted for it.\n\nMr. Biden also went against Mr. Obama to help defeat amendments aimed at strengthening protections for people forced into bankruptcy who have large medical debts or are in the military; Mr. Biden argued that the amendments were unnecessary because the legislation already carved out exemptions for those debtors. And he was one of four Democrats who sided with Republicans to defeat an effort, supported by Mr. Obama, to shift responsibility in certain cases from debtors to the predatory lenders who helped push them into bankruptcy.\n\nThe Washington Post 's David Broder detailed other industry-friendly aspects of the bill back in 2005. One proposed amendment to the bill would have stopped corporations from \"judge-shopping\" and going to the most-friendly venues for their bankruptcy cases. The amendment was introduced by Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and appeared to have wide bipartisan support.  But it never passed. Broder writes that Biden helped kill it.\n\nEric Umansky\n\nEric Umansky is an editor-at-large at ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "The Biden Interview: The President Talks About the Supreme Court, Threats to Democracy and Trump's Vow to Exact Retribution\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that he was not fully confident that the current U.S. Supreme Court, which he described as extreme, could be relied on to uphold the rule of law.\n\nWhen asked the question directly, Biden paused for a few seconds. Then he sighed and said, \"I worry.\"\n\n\"Because,\" he said, \"I know that if the other team, the MAGA Republicans, win, they don't want to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nBut he said, \"I do think at the end of the day, this court, which has been one of the most extreme courts, I still think in the basic fundamentals of rule of law, that they would sustain the rule of law.\"\n\nStill, Biden said the court itself should recognize it needs ethics rules after stories by ProPublica revealed that billionaires had given undisclosed gifts to Supreme Court justices and that Justice Clarence Thomas has made appearances at events for donors to the Koch political network. The code of conduct that applies to other federal judges doesn't apply to the Supreme Court. \"The idea that the Constitution would in any way prohibit or not encourage the court to have basic rules of ethics that are just on their face reasonable,\" Biden said, \"is just not the case.\"\n\nThe discussion was part of a rare formal interview on a topic the president has laid out as a priority: How America's democracy is under siege. Seated in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday afternoon, Biden seemed relaxed and confident, batting back a question about why he thinks he's the only Democrat who can protect democracy next year, especially given voter concerns with his age: \"I'm not the only Democrat that can protect it. I just happen to be the Democrat who I think is best positioned to see to it that the guy I was worried about taking on democracy is not president.\"\n\nBiden cast the threat to democracy posed by Donald Trump's 2024 candidacy as a resistance movement animated by fear of change. \"I think Trump has concluded that he has to win,\" Biden said, noting the rising vitriol in the embattled former president's rhetoric. \"And they'll pull out all the stops.\"\n\nBiden linked the attempt by House Republicans to bring Washington to \"a screeching halt\" through a government shutdown to Trump's effort to regain the presidency. He warned against the desire of \"MAGA Republicans\" - which he called a minority of the GOP, much less the nation as a whole - to weaken institutions such as the federal civil service to shift power over the U.S. government toward the president alone. Trump has promised his supporters to \"be your retribution\" in a second term.\n\nThe drama over a government shutdown resulted from the \"terrible bargain\" Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy made with extremist colleagues to secure his job, Biden said. \"He's willing to do things that he, I think, he knows are inconsistent with constitutional processes.\" He added: \"There is a group of MAGA Republicans who genuinely want to have a fundamental change in the way that the system works. And that's what worries me the most.\"\n\nBiden faulted his Democratic Party for failing at some points to respond effectively to one of the wellsprings of the anti-democratic threat: the anxieties of Americans, most conspicuously blue-collar white men, unsettled by economic, cultural and demographic change.\n\nWhat's needed isn't so much economic benefits as \"treating them with respect,\" said Biden, who has emphasized his middle-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, upbringing throughout his political career. \"The fact is, we're going to be very shortly a minority-white-European country. Sometimes my colleagues don't speak enough to make it clear that that is not going to change how we operate.\"\n\nBiden expressed confidence that the majority of the Republican Party and the nation itself would ultimately safeguard the American experiment. But he exhorted them to \"speak up\" in opposition to the increasingly menacing rhetoric Trump has deployed in response to his legal peril.\n\n\"[Do] not legitimize it,\" he said. He added, in what seemed a reference to the vitriol aimed at jurors and potential jurors in trials for the Jan. 6 insurrection and Trump-related cases, \"I never thought I'd see a time when someone was worried about being on a jury because there may be physical violence against them if they voted the wrong way.\"\n\nHe encouraged Americans concerned about democracy to be \"engaging\" more with family, friends and acquaintances who have embraced extremism. Even more urgent, he added, is voting in next year's presidential election. \"Get in a two-way conversation,\" he said. \"I really do believe that the vast majority of the American people are decent, honorable, straightforward. ... We have to, though, understand what the danger is if they don't participate.\"\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica also asked Biden whether his former Senate colleague Joe Lieberman is upholding democracy by working with an organization called No Labels to pursue a potential third-party candidacy. \"Well, he has a democratic right to do it. There's no reason not to do that. Now, it's going to help the other guy. And he knows [that]. ... That's a political decision he's making that I obviously think is a mistake. But he has a right to do that.\"\n\nBiden was asked whether Fox News and other outlets that spread falsehoods about the 2020 election drive the threat that he's concerned about or simply reflect sentiment that already exists. Both, Biden said: \"Look, there are no editors any more. That's one of the big problems.\" Without providing detail, he suggested that reporters on outlets such as Fox are just doing what they're told.\n\nIn response to a question about whether the decision by Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X (formerly Twitter), to lower guardrails against misinformation contributes to the problem, Biden said, \"Yeah, it does.\" Biden noted that the invention of the printing press had effects that are still felt today. He suggested something similar was happening with the internet. \"Where do people get their news?\" he continued. \"They go on the internet. They go online ... and you have no notion whether it's true or not.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "AOC, Sanders erase Biden as progressive movement moves on\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDENVER, Colo. â Now we know what they really thought.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, at the biggest rally of his political career, Sen. Bernie Sanders encouraged some 32,000 people here to organize against âoligarchy,â dismantle the private campaign finance system, and maybe run for office themselves.\n\nHe never ran as a Democrat â and they wouldnât need to, either. The party hadnât earned it.\n\nâFor the last 30 or 40 years, Democrats have turned their backs on the working class of this country,â said Sanders.\n\nThe Vermont independent shared the stage with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called for âa Democratic Party that fights harder for us.â They were introduced by Jimmy Williams, the president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, who denounced Democrats for not raising the minimum wage or expanding Social Security when they held the House, Senate, and White House.\n\nâFor the Democratic Party to ever win back the majority, they have to represent the working class and not the corporate class,â said Williams.\n\nThe blunt talk barely made ripples in Washington, where Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are often covered as problems for their party. But as they reboot their movement, progressives who traded loyalty to Joe Biden for big policy victories âÂ from the Green New Deal to clemency for Leonard Peltier â are breaking ranks with the Democratic Party and its feeble brand. Sanders is stepping up efforts to recruit Democratic and independent candidates, and Ocasio-Cortez is taking a larger role in responding to the Trump administration.\n\nAnd unencumbered from their 2024 task â to make a progressive case for Biden, and then, for Kamala Harris â they are no longer selling his presidency as a success.\n\nIn this article:\n\nWhen he secured the 2020 Democratic nomination, Biden made a deal with Sanders and other progressives, giving them a role in drafting the party platform and incorporating their ideas into his campaign and administration. To progressivesâ surprise, he often responded to their direct actions; climate activists protested with Ocasio-Cortez for a New Deal-style âclimate conservation corps,â and he created one by executive order.\n\nâWhen it comes to domestic policy, President Biden probably would go down as one of the most effective presidents that centered the working class,â Ocasio-Cortez told the New York Times in January.\n\nBut Bidenâs support for Israelâs war in Gaza smothered progressivesâ good will. In Denver, Sanders mentioned the former president just once by name, when he denounced Trump for maintaining âthe horrific Biden policy of giving more money to Netanyahu to destroy the Palestinian people.â\n\nNow Biden, whoâs made just two public appearances since leaving Washington, is a non-factor in his party. His achievements, including trillions of dollars of infrastructure, health care and climate spending, are being pulled down by his successor. Democrats rarely talk about Bidenâs role in those programs as they fight (and sue ) to save them.\n\nThe erasure started before Biden left office, with Sanders crediting Trumpâs victory to âDemocratic leadershipâ that defended the âstatus quoâ and lost working class votes.Sanders and other progressives had taken another tone during the campaign, defending Biden and his record. (So had Williams: IAPUT endorsed Biden, then Harris, in the 2024 election, and he praised âUnion Joeâ as the best president for labor in generations.)\n\nâWe came out of that economic downturn a lot faster than anyone dream we would have, and you can thank President Biden for that,â Sanders told a crowd in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on June 28 â the day after the disastrous CNN debate with Trump that unraveled Bidenâs campaign and damaged Democratsâ argument that voters could overlook his age. âBidenâs policies, by and large, are for the working class of this country, and weâve got to appreciate that.â\n\nIn conversations on Monday, progressive strategists said that there was no upside to mentioning Biden at all, even when defending programs he funded or created. In Denver, Ocasio-Cortez spoke more positively of the Democrats than Sanders did, praising the stateâs senators and Democratic members of Congress by name for opposing the GOPâs spending packages.\n\nâI want you to look at every level of office around you, and support Democrats who actually fight, because those are the ones that can win against Republicans,â she said.\n\nWhy does it matter if Democrats and progressives wrap up Bidenâs presidency into a story of Democratic failure? It explains the Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez project, which in part is about disentangling their politics from a toxic brand and turning it into an anti-establishment cause.\n\nâTrump basically said the system is broken, and Iâm going to fix it,â Sanders told me before his âFight Oligarchyâ tour began last month. âDemocrats more or less said: You know, the status quo is not perfect, but weâre gonna tinker with it around the edges.â\n\nThe senatorâs new electoral project is recruiting progressives to run against Republicans and beat them, whether they want to run as Democrats or independents.\n\nâThere are a whole lot of people, who voted Republican, who are not crazy about the Republican Party,â Sanders told me in Greeley. âWorking-class Republicans donât want tax breaks for billionaires and cuts to veterans programs.â In the story heâs telling, those voters did not have an ally in the White House who did the right thing for four years; neither party has answered those votersâ concerns.\n\nBut Republicans have not forgotten about Biden. During his address to Congress last month, Trump mentioned Biden, âthe worst president in American history,â 14 times. In remarks to reporters, the president frequently blames Bidens for problems he didnât leave him, like a stock market correction. The story Trump and the GOP are telling is that their party is delivering for the working class, rescuing it from the costs and failures inflicted by their last president and the Democratic Party.\n\nDefeated parties have been here before. George W. Bush vanished from Republican politics after leaving the presidency in 2009; apart from a few âMiss Me Yet?â memes and Dick Cheneyâs criticism of the Obama presidencyâs anti-terrorism strategy, that team played no role in the Tea Party-era GOP rebrand. Republicans built space to attack their former presidentâs legacy, with conservative candidates taking down incumbents who had supported Bushâs Wall Street bailout. The party won the presidency again with Trump, who has mocked Bush as a failure.\n\nParties have also swung hard in the other direction. In 2021, when Trump was beaten but able to run again, his party retconned his presidency into a success. They were boom years, with no new foreign wars, undermined only by a deranged anti-Trump deep state and the COVID-19 pandemic. The few Republicans who criticized Trump over his handling of that pandemic, like Floridaâs Ron DeSantis, lost to him and endorsed him.\n\nThis was never going to happen for Biden, who left office when voters held a far darker view of the economy than they did in 2020 . But itâs significant that the progressives are skipping right past it. Democratsâ argument about how they can win back working class voters might start with Biden, who implemented some big progressive ideas and watched more of those voters walk away.\n\nAs Biden left office, The Nationâs Katrina vanden Heuvel called him a âremarkably consequential one-term presidentâ who âorchestrated the best recovery in the industrial worldâ and âconsolidated the break with the failed market fundamentalism of the conservative era that Trump began.â Itâs the sort of analysis many progressives had of Biden â Gaza record aside â until the results came in from Pennsylvania on Election Night.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nCongressional Republicans are lining up votes to roll back Biden administration rules on bank mergers, WiFi hotspots and more for floor consideration as early as next week, five people familiar with the plans said Friday.\n\nThe GOP can undo regulations issued within the last 60 legislative days with simple majority votes under the terms of the Congressional Review Act. And now that Donald Trump is in the White House, they can get a presidential signature on repeal of some of former President Joe Bidenâs regulations.\n\nThe 60-legislative-day clock limits Republicansâ window to use their control of Washington to chip away at Bidenâs legacy, however, and they notably have yet to send Trump any Congressional Review Act repeals. Thatâs guaranteed to change by March as House and Senate GOP leaders plan strikes on Biden regulations while they continue to fight over passing Trumpâs broader legislative agenda.\n\nThe specifics of which regulations will be axed are still getting finalized, but Republicans have identified several high-priority efforts â and the new cross-chamber coordination on which repeals to pursue suggests that Republicans may cut a quick swath.\n\nThe bank merger rollback, led by Louisianaâs John Kennedy in the Senate , would undo an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rule that placed more guardrails on those corporate consolidations. The WiFi hotspot repeal, led by Texan Ted Cruz in the Senate , would negate a Federal Communications Commission order that allows the subsidy of off-campus WiFi hotspots for students.\n\nA third regulatory strike, also led by Kennedy , would scrap a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management requirement that oil and gas companies submit an archeological report before beginning production on federally managed offshore waters.\n\nA fourth one, led by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, would repeal an EPA rule that charges oil and gas companies for methane emissions. And a fifth, led by Cruz and Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., would reverse an Energy Department policy that set higher standards for gas-powered water heaters.\n\nThe House is expected to take up Pfluger and Palmerâs resolutions next week, one of the people familiar with the plans said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nEnacting any of the regulatory rollbacks will also prevent the agencies in question from issuing similar regulations in the future â a big win for the firms that have lobbied against them and for Republicans who want to keep fighting the Biden administrationâs progressive bent.\n\nBanks have pushed hard for Congress to overturn the OCC rule, which they say makes it too difficult for them to merge.\n\nâWith the ongoing regulatory tsunami creating increased pressure for consolidation, regulators must ensure that banks that decide to combine have clear standards for how proposed mergers will be evaluated, that regulatorsâ decisions will be made promptly and that the approval process will not reflect a bias against mergers,â American Bankers Association President and CEO Rob Nichols said when the regulator finalized the rule in September.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Meanwhile, GonzÃ¡lez has urged Venezuelaâs army to recognize him as their commander-in-chief, CNN reported, a call the countryâs defense minister rejected. Opposition figure MarÃ­a Corina Machado has encouraged GonzÃ¡lezâs supporters to protest on inauguration day, prompting officials to warn any opposition would âpay dearly.â The ongoing crackdown on dissent indicates that Venezuela is â about to become a full-blown dictatorship ,â a Western diplomat in Caracas told The Economist.\n\nIncoming US President Donald Trumpâs approach to Maduro could rehash his first-term âmaximum pressureâ policy: Trump has appointed Marco Rubio â a known Venezuela âhawkâ â as his secretary of state. A complicating factor is that Venezuela is a major source of immigrants to the US â more than 5 million people left the country between 2019-2022 â and Trump has vowed to dramatically cut those numbers. A senator close to the incoming US administration said it is open to working with Maduro to stem drug and migration flows. âMaduro is leaving the door open for a more pragmatic approach from the Trump administration, â an expert told Al Jazeera.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Read it now .\n\nUS President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump pledged to ensure a smooth transition of power on Wednesday, their first meeting since Trump won reelection.\n\nAt the Oval Office encounter, Biden apparently stressed the need for a âsmooth transition,â telling Trump that the White House would do âeverything we can to make sure youâre accommodated.â\n\nTrump replied that âitâll be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that, Joe.â\n\nThe two met privately for nearly two hours, and Trump came with a âdetailed set of questions,â White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. âIt was actually a substantive meeting,â she added.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden raised the issue of US hostages held in Gaza, and signaled willingness to work with Trumpâs team to seek their release. Biden also told the president-elect that continued support for Ukraine remains in the US national interest, Sullivan added.\n\nThe transition process is already behind schedule: the Trump team has yet to sign the routine paperwork to kickstart the transition (the documents carry requirements about ethics and disclosing transition donations).\n\nâIt is hard to do this thoroughly and the biggest challenge is lack of time, and so loss of time is consequential,â Max Stier, president of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, told Semafor.\n\nTrumpâs team stonewalled the Biden transition team as the outgoing president contested his 2020 election loss that year.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "The 'What Ifs' That Will Haunt Biden's Legacy\n\nA lthough the President of the United States is the most scrutinized person on the planet, myopia invariably sets in as we assess them in real time. Often our impressions are dominated by the caricatures we're served up in the media-a bumbling Gerald Ford, hapless Jimmy Carter, intellectually feeble Ronald Reagan, inept George W. Bush, or doddering Grandpa Joe Biden.\n\nIt's a remarkable transformation for the folksy \"Uncle Joe\" who first took office in 2021 , and one that was cemented after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in June.\n\nBut what Biden has accomplished over the past four years, drawing on his extensive political and diplomatic experience, speaks resoundingly to his effectiveness as one of the best one-term Presidents in American history.\n\nEarly in his term he unified the Democratic Party around his leadership with impressive rapidity, quieting those who predicted he would be co-opted or defied by his party's unruly left flank. Among other things, he created unity task forces designed to bring progressive and moderate Democrats together to identify areas of agreement, informing his ambitious domestic agenda.\n\nThe party harmony came to bear in his congressional wins, becoming signature accomplishments. A veteran horse trader and sausage maker through his 36 years in the Senate and eight years as Barack Obama's Vice President, Biden championed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan , mitigating the economic fallout due to COVID-19; the $1 trillion Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act , repairing dilapidated roads and bridges, and allowing for massive investment in rural broadband; the CHIPS Act , reducing dependence on the foreign manufacturing of critical semiconductor chips; and two of the most sweeping gun safety bills in nearly three decades. And when his $2 trillion Build Back Better bill was voted down, Biden resurrected it as the still-significant $800 billion Inflation Reduction Act , which passed in August 2022. All those laws were enacted despite the narrowest majority in the House and a 50/50 split in the Senate. Those achievements make Biden the most important legislative President since Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nBiden also proved an able steward of the economy despite immense headwinds. Unemployment is at its lowest in over a half a century, while GDP growth remains strong , making the U.S. economy the \" envy of the world .\" Pandemic-era inflation has tarnished Biden's economic legacy but he should be duly credited for boosting a hampered economy left over from Trump.\n\nAdditionally, the former chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee has quietly appointed 213 federal judges , slightly off the pace of Trump at this point in his presidency, but far ahead of Obama who ended up leaving 105 empty federal judgeships owing to an obstructionist Republican-dominated Senate.\n\nFinally, Biden made good on his promise to return to democratic norms after Trump's destructive first term. Though he didn't unite the country as he had hoped-perhaps an impossible task short of a threat to the homeland-he led as President of all Americans. He also revived NATO , which was severely weakened at Trump's hand, trading on the relationships he cultivated during his years in the Senate and West Wing to bring back an alliance that has been central to underwriting the post-war international order. The resurrection of NATO meant that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine didn't go unchecked by the West, which, led by the U.S., has poured billions into Ukraine's defense.\n\nBiden should be rightfully acknowledged with rallying his party around his leadership and pushing through the most transformative legislative agenda since LBJ. But it is the safeguarding of democracy that Biden called the \" central cause \" of his presidency, and on which his legacy principally rests.\n\nAfter leaving public life in 2017, Biden, who had launched failed campaigns for the presidency in 1988 and 2008, was compelled to seek the office again in 2020 due to the existential threat to democracy posed by Trump, waging a battle \"to restore the soul of America.\" Wresting the White House from Trump was a significant accomplishment , marking the first time a sitting President was defeated for reelection in nearly 30 years and preventing the 45th President from inflicting further democratic damage. Biden summoned the nation's \"better angels\" and course-corrected impressively through the first years of his presidency, bringing America back as a thriving liberal democracy.\n\nHis courageous decision to step aside -in the face of mounting pressure from Democrats after the June presidential debate-speaks to his characteristic instinct to put country above personal ambition. As he explained it , \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.\" Had he been able to prevent a second Trump term, surely Biden would have been considered one of our great or near-great Presidents.\n\nTo that end, several \"What ifs\" will dog Biden's legacy. What if he had more effectively conveyed his Administration's economic achievements? What if he had performed as well in his June debate against Trump as he had in their two 2020 match-ups? What if he had stepped aside sooner and let the Democratic primary process play out, yielding a more viable challenger to Trump? What if he hadn't thrown his support to Kamala Harris?\n\nBut such hypotheticals are mere folly. What we know is this: Despite his best intentions, Biden was unable to stem the orange tide of Trump's resurgent, angry populism rooted in economic discontent. Instead of turning the page on the MAGA Movement, Biden will be seen as a productive interlude, a relative calm before the Trump storm surge returned.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Read the Full Transcript of President Joe Biden's Interview With TIME\n\nRead our full cover story on President Joe Biden here . You can also read the full fact check here and buy a copy of the issue here .\n\nPresident Joe Biden sat down for an interview with TIME at the White House on May 28.\n\nOver the course of the interview, Biden spoke at length about his foreign policy agenda, including his views on China, Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel, as well as concerns about his age as he runs for re-election.\n\nThank you for doing this, Mr. President. We appreciate your time. Busy moment. I'll dive right in. You're traveling next week to Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day to commemorate a turning point in America's leadership with the free world. But the anniversary comes at a time when the US under your leadership has been unable to deter crises. First in Afghanistan, then Ukraine, Israel, and mounting tensions in the Far East. Is America still able to play the role of world power that it played in World War Two, and in the Cold War?\n\nBiden: Yes, we're planning even more. We are, we are the world power. And what I inherited, as a consequence of the mistake that we made in Afghanistan is a-was not a loss in Afghanistan, excuse my cold. But I think that, look, I believe, I have a fundamentally different view than Mr. Trump has on a range of things. Number one: I really believe that we have a values-based as well as practical-based alliances around the world. And he, Trump, wanted to just abandon them. He says he's practical, one-on-one things he's doing.\n\nWell, he didn't get much done. And so we end up in a situation where, when I came into, when I got sworn in, we were in a position where we didn't have-for example, there's a quote from Macron at the time saying that, in 2019, that Trump wants to eviscerate NATO. He thinks NATO is useless. And we have to rethink our entire relationship with the United States, they no longer lead the world.\n\nI have that exact quote here. And they no longer lead the world and the transatlantic alliance has to be reexamined. And the interesting piece of that is you now have his former adviser John Bolton saying, he's certain that the first thing Trump would do if he got reelected is get out of NATO completely.\n\nAnd so I've always believed that there are two elements to American security, and the biggest element and, and our normative example, is our alliances, our alliances. We are-we have, compared to the rest of the world, we have put together the strongest alliance in the history of the world, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where we are able to move in a way that recognizes how much the world has changed and still lead the world. And it's our security. For example, the idea that if when Putin decided to go into Russia-I mean, he's gonna go from Russia into Ukraine-the reason why I cleared the intelligence so we can release the information we knew that he was going to attack, was to let the world know we were still in charge. We still know what's going on.\n\nThis, by the way is, if you haven't read it, you should. [Pulls out copy of speech Putin delivered on Feb. 21, 2022] It's the address to the Russian people on the Donbass problem on February 21, when Moscow was going in. And it lays out why I believe Trump-what he never understood-which is that Russia, he wasn't just going into Moscow, I mean from Russia into Ukraine, for purposes of keeping them from having weapons, etc. He believes it is an essential part of Russia, from the beginning.\n\nHe has just laid out, straight out. He said, he said, 'I would like to emphasize again, Ukraine is not a neighboring country of us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space...Since time immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russia, Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.' And he goes on. He makes this whole speech about why it is part of reestablishing the Soviet Union.\n\nSo understanding Putin's aims, the world, the West, the United States, and you find yourselves facing a difficult situation in Ukraine. The war is stalled. Every day, an average of 42 Ukrainian civilians are killed or wounded. Is Russia's proposal for, to end the war in Ukraine, the best that Ukraine can hope for at this point?\n\nBiden:  No, it's not. And by the way, I don't know why you skip over all that's happened in the meantime. The Russian military has been decimated. You don't write about that. It's been freaking decimated . Number one.\n\nNumber two, NATO is considerably stronger than it was when I took office.  I put it together. Not only did I reestablish the fact that it was the strongest alliance in the history of the world, I was able to expand it. While I was in one of the G7 meetings in Europe. when I got back I called on the President of Finland because when I had met earlier in the year with Putin, he said he wanted to see the Finlandization of NATO. I told him, he's gonna get not the Finlandization, the Natoization of Finland. And everybody thought, including you guys, thought I was crazy.\n\nAnd guess what? I did it. I did it.  And we're now the strongest nation. We have the strongest alliance in all of America, all of history. In the meantime, what we keep skipping over is what the consequence of the success of Russia in Ukraine would be. That's why I brought this along. You probably haven't read it. Most people haven't read it. He says this is part of reestablishing the Soviet Union. That's what this is all about. It wasn't just about taking part of-He wanted, he wanted to go back to the, to the days when there was NATO and there was that other outfit that Poland, everybody belonged to. So that's what it was about. And in the meantime, what happened was, we were able to-and by the way, we spent a lot of money in Ukraine, but Europe has spent more money than the United States has, collectively . Europe has spent more money in taking on Russia.\n\nSo what is the endgame though in Ukraine and what does peace look like there?\n\nBiden: Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine. That's what peace looks like. And it doesn't mean NATO, they are part of NATO, it means we have a relationship with them like we do with other countries, where we supply weapons so they can defend themselves in the future. But it is not, if you notice, I was the one when-and you guys did report it at TIME-the one that I was saying that I am not prepared to support the NATOization of Ukraine.\n\nIt should not, it is not- I spent a month in Ukraine when I was a Senator and Vice President . There was significant corruption. There was a circumstance that was really difficult. And so, the point is, though, that if we ever let Ukraine go down, mark my words: you'll see Poland go, and you'll see all those nations along the actual border of Russia, from the Balkans and Belarus, all those, they're going to make their own accommodations.\n\nI want to switch to Israel. But on that last point, is there a danger that NATO is on a slippery slope to war with Ukraine-with Russia, as things stand?\n\nBiden:  No, we're on a slippery slope for war if we don't do something about Ukraine. It's just not gonna...anyway...\n\nSo in Israel, obviously, a difficult time there. What steps are you prepared to take against Israel now that Netanyahu appears to have crossed your red line in Rafah, Mr. President?\n\nBiden: I'm not going to speak to that now because you're going to report this before I make, before-I'm in the process of talking with the Israelis right now. So I'm not going to...\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nBiden: If I tell you, you'll write it.  It's not time for you to write it.\n\nWhat are the nature of your conversations with the Israelis right now? Have you spoken with Bibi?\n\nBiden: I have not spoken with Bibi since-I have not spoken with Bibi since the attack on Sunday. Was it Sunday?\n\nBen LaBolt: Yep. Sunday.\n\nBiden: I have not. My team has.\n\nBut has he crossed your red line?\n\nBiden: I'm not going to respond to that because I'm about to make a...anyway.\n\nMore broadly, from the intelligence in the evidence you've seen, either currently or in the last months, have Israeli forces committed war crimes in Gaza?\n\nBiden: The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don't, we don't recognize. But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed. But it is-and a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak. Hamas is intimidating that population. I went over right after that attack on the Israelis. What they did was-exceeded anything I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. Tying mothers and daughters together with rope and pouring kerosene on it and burning them to death. That kind of thing, attempting to intimidate. And it is dastardly.\n\nOn what Hamas has done, are the eight US hostages there in Gaza is still alive?\n\nBiden: We believe there are those that are still alive. I met with all the families. But we don't have final proof on exactly who's alive and who's not alive. And by the way, I've been calling for-we should have a ceasefire, period. And to get those hostages. That's the main reason why we push. Both the Israelis desperately want a ceasefire in order to get the hostages home. And it's a way to begin to break the momentum. And so that's why we're pushing hard for the-and we're-Is our intelligence chief in? Where is he now?\n\nKirby: He is back, sir. He was just over in Europe, in Brussels, over the weekend.\n\nAnd whose fault is it that the-that deal, the ceasefire for hostages-has not been consummated? Is it Hamas or Israel or both?\n\nBiden:  Hamas. Hamas could end this tomorrow. Hamas could say (unintelligible) and done period. And, but, and the last offer Israel made was very generous in terms of who they'd be willing to release, what they'd give in return, et cetera. Bibi is under enormous pressure on the hostages, on the hostages, and so he's prepared to do about anything to get the hostages back.\n\nYou mentioned the hunger in Gaza. Some have alleged that Israel is intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. Do you think that's the case?\n\nBiden: No, I don't think that. I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate. That is...When I went over immediately after the-Hamas' brutal attack, I said then, and it became public, I said, don't make the same mistake we did going after bin Laden. Don't try-The idea of occupying Afghanistan, the idea that you had nuclear arsenals in Iran that were being, I mean, in Iraq, that were being generated, simply not true. And it led to endless wars. They were not true. Don't make the mistakes we made. And they're making that mistake, I think. Excuse my voice, I apologize.\n\nNot at all. Some in Israel have suggested that Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his own political self-preservation. Do you believe that?\n\nBiden: I'm not going to comment on that. There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion. And I would cite that as-before the war began, the blowback he was getting from the Israeli military for wanting to change the constitu-change the court. And so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\n\nTrump has said that Netanyahu is rightfully criticized for Oct. 7. Do you believe that he bears some responsibility for the fact that Oct. 7th happened?\n\nBiden: I don't know how any one person has that responsibility. He was the leader of the country, so therefore, it happened. But he wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up. He wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up. That's why there's got to be-my major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after, what happens after Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in? I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work.\n\nThere needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\n\nDo you have agreement from all the other parties to this multi-part package of deals that would deliver that in Israel, in the region, other than Bibi?  Is Bibi the only thing standing in the way of that?\n\nBiden: I gotta be careful, because you're gonna print this before the article comes out and I'm in the process of negotiating a lot of that. The answer is that I think there is a clear path for a transition where the Arab states would provide security and reconstruction in Gaza in return for a longer-term commitment to a transition to a two-state solution. And that extends all the way from Saudi Arabia, who I continue to talk to-my team-to the Jordanians that are trying to work bringing in goods and certain goods now, food, medicine, etc. And the Egyptians who I've been talking with frequently about what happens in terms of access for more material to get into Gaza to prevent this catastrophe from continuing.\n\nMr. President, you mentioned at the beginning value-based alliances, and you mentioned the Saudis. Do you believe we share the same values?\n\nBiden: Remember, I said what the other one was: there's values-based and there's practical-based. And it's overwhelmingly in our interest. For example, you may recall a resolution I introduced at the G20 that no one thought would go anywhere and it passed by providing for a railroad and oil line-oil, excuse me, I misspoke. Railroad lines and transportation, all the way from Riyadh-to Saudi Arabia, to Jordan, to Israel, all through Europe and continuing. And the reason for that is that the economy can be used to bring people together as well. The fact of the matter is the world's changing. We are at a significant inflection point.\n\nThe Saudis are aware that oil is not going to be their ticket to the future 10 years from now. They know it. They know what's happening. The same way with the rest of these countries. So if you have mutual economic interests in mind, you're less likely to have conflict. So that's what-and it passed, by the way, that resolution.\n\nWe have a lot of the world to cover. Elsewhere in the region in Iran, but also in the Far East, there are troubling national security developments, long-standing problems that appear to be getting worse, Iran is expanding its stockpile of enriched, highly enriched uranium. North Korea has reportedly restarted its nuclear program and is testing missiles capable of reaching the mainland US, some even as far as New York potentially. Is it effectively American policy now to live with a nuclear or near-nuclear Iran and North Korea?\n\nBiden: No, it's not. And by the way, that's been going on for some time. You could have sat here five years ago and said the same thing with regard to North Korea. So...\n\nBut that situation is getting more threatening, don't you think, Mr. President?\n\nBiden: No, I don't. I think it's equally as threatening as it was before. I don't think it's more threatening and North Korea has something else that it has to deal with. I did something that you would have been too cynical to think I could possibly do. I put together an Indo-Pacific strategy that is incredibly broad.\n\nDid you ever think if I told you that Japan would be devoting 3% of its GDP to defense and make a rapprochement at Camp David with South Korea as an overwhelming threat that exists to North Korea as well as to Europe? You know, I've been able to put 50 nations together to help in Ukraine, led by us but also engaged with, with Japan's leadership.\n\nSo there is-look as long as there are nuclear weapons available, it's always going to be a problem. It's gonna-the question is how do we stop it? That's why I thought Trump was wrong in not wanting to work early on five years ago, and three years ago, when he left office-with trying to control, work out an arrangement to control access to North Korea, to nuclear weapons and/or nuclear weapons that are available to any other area. And that's why I was able to put together four or five major initiatives in Europe. I put together a quad that never existed before . I put together-I mean personally put together-worked on it, I put together AUKUS with Great Britain and Australia. I put together an agreement between Japan and the Philippines dealing with making sure that we know the international rules of the road pertaining in terms of air and water and territorial integrity.\n\nAnd so the point is we've invested billions of dollars. We are much stronger in the Pacific than we ever were before. China, by the way, China is very concerned about it. They asked me-I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any leader in the world, over 90 hours alone with him since I've been Vice President. And we have a very candid relationship.\n\nYou know, I don't have any (unintelligible) He wanted to know why I was doing all these things. I said the simple reason I'm doing those things: to make sure that you don't, that you aren't able to change the status quo any.\n\nSo getting to exactly that point. Pretty much everybody agrees that managing China's rise is the most important foreign policy and national security issue for America and Americans in the coming century. CIA director Bill Burns says the President Xi Jinping of China has ordered the Chinese military to be ready by 2027 to conduct a successful invasion of Taiwan. You said on multiple occasions that you would use US forces to defend Taiwan. What does that mean? Is it boots on the ground? What, what shape would that take?\n\nBiden: It would depend on the circumstances. You know, by the way, I've made clear to Xi Jinping that we agree with-we signed on to previous presidents going way back-to the policy of, that, it is we are not seeking independence for Taiwan nor will we, in fact, not defend Taiwan if they if, if China unilaterally tries to change the status. And so we're continuing to supply capacity. And, and we've been in consultation with our allies in the region.\n\nSo if I might, not ruling out the possibility of deploying US troops to Taiwan in the case of an invasion?\n\nBiden: Not ruling out using US military force. There's a distinction between deploying on the ground, air power and naval power, etc.\n\nSo you're maybe striking from bases in Philippines or Japan, is that...\n\nBiden: I'm not going to get into that. You would then criticize me with good reason if I were to tell you.\n\nThe competition in the Pacific Rim is broader than hard power and you've expanded Donald Trump's trade war with China. Mr. President, which you once criticized.\n\nBiden: No, I haven't. Go ahead.\n\nMost economists say tariffs raise prices.\n\nBiden: They do.\n\nCumulative inflation means that prices are up 18%, at least since you took office and wage increases have not kept pace.\n\nBiden: Since who took office? Since I took office?\n\nYeah, cumulative inflation means prices are up nearly 20% since you took office and wage increases have not kept pace.\n\nBiden: Wage increases have exceeded what the cost of inflation , which you're talking about as the prices that were pre-COVID prices. Pre-COVID prices are not the same as whether or not they-you have American, corporate America ripping off the public now. You have everything from shrinkflation to what's going on in terms of the way in which they're artificially moving significantly to increase their, their, their, their, their profits. That's not the same as inflation. That's price gouging.\n\nBut Mr. President, won't your newly announced tariffs raise the prices on American consumers?\n\nBiden: No, because here's the deal. There's a difference. I made it clear to Putin from the very beginning that-I'm not, we're not engaging in...For example, Trump wants a 10% tariff on everything. That will raise the price of everything in America. [Editor's note: Biden appeared to mean Xi here, not Putin.]\n\nWhat I'm talking about, I said, we're gonna play by the same rules. You tell me if I want to, if an American corporation wants to invest in China, it has to give 50% ownership, 51% ownership to a Chinese operator. And that goes on from there. And I said, so you're gonna do that to us? (unintelligible) We're going to do the same thing if you want to invest here. We're not putting a tariff on. We're just saying, if you want to do that, well, we're gonna do that. And you cannot change the market in a way where you flood the market by-ignore all Chinese government subsidies to undercut their ability as to deal with electric vehicles. And we're not going to put up with it. That's the thing we talked about. And that's what we're talking about. We're not talking about tariffs across the board.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna do a couple of rapid fire here. Another of your first acts as President under the banner of value-based leadership was to lift various punitive Trump-era immigration measures, Mr. President, that you and others said were inhumane. In retrospect, do you think those humanitarian moves helped drive record illegal border crossing?\n\nBiden:  No.\n\nWere you wrong to lift any of those measures?\n\nBiden: If I was wrong, it's because I took too long,\n\nYou've put some back in place. The Green Card issue, it's been reported that you're looking at reinstating Remain in Mexico. Are you looking at reinstating...\n\nBiden: No\n\nThe last two years of Presidents, two-term President's tenure are usually focused on foreign affairs. You are 81 years old, and would be 86 by the time you left office. Large majorities of Americans, including in the Democratic Party, tell pollsters they think you are too old to lead. Could you really do this job as an 85-year old man?\n\nBiden: I can do it better than anybody you know.  You're looking at me, I can take you too.\n\nDid you consider not running again because of your age?\n\nBiden: No, I didn't.\n\nAnd what do you say to Americans who are worried about it?\n\nBiden: Watch me. Look, name me a president that's gotten as much done as I've gotten done in my first three and a half years. When all of you wrote in Time magazine I couldn't get any of it done. When you told me there's no pay, no way, no way he can get a trillion-plus dollar bill done in terms of, to deal with infrastructure, where there's no way he gets $368 billion for dealing with the environment, where there's no way I could get the, the, the legislation passed on.\n\nI remember when I was heading to Taiwan, excuse me, to South Korea, to reclaim the chips industry that we had gotten $865 billion in private-sector investment, private-sector investments since I've been in. Name me a president who's done that.\n\nYou pledged at the beginning to restore unity. Both Trump and top Democrats, including some of your aides, say the greatest threat to America's national security is its-and its ability to lead the free world comes not from abroad, but from within, from US politics. Do you agree with that?\n\nBiden: I think it has a significantly diminishing impact on our ability to get things done internationally. Look, I tell you, I'll just-let me give you one example. After I was elected, the first G7 I attended as President was in, in London-in England, along the beach down there. And I sat down with the seven leaders that were there. And I was sitting where you were, at this longer table.\n\nI said, \"Well, America's back.\" Macron looked at me and he said, \"For how long? For how long?\"  And then Scholz said to me, \"What would you say Mr. President, if tomorrow you pick up The London Times and found out that thousands of people stormed the British Parliament, broke down the doors, killed two Bobbies to prevent the implement-the swearing in of a, of a prime minister, a choice of prime minister?\"\n\nAnd it made me realize just how fundamentally what he allowed to happen sitting in this room, looking at that television for three hours and didn't do a damn thing, said about America, and how much confidence people lost in America. There's not a, there's not a...I'm gonna, say, be careful what I say...There's not a major international meeting I attend that before it's over-and I've attended many, more than most presidents have in three and a half years-that a world leader doesn't pull me aside as I'm leaving and say, \"He can't win. You can't let him win.\"\n\nMy democracy and their democracy is at stake. My democracy is at stake. And so name me a world leader other than Orban and Putin who think that Trump should be the world leader in the United States of America.\n\nLaBolt: We'll have to leave it there.\n\nLet me ask you one on the...if you do win in November, Mr. President, with a mandate to continue your approach to foreign policy, what would your goals be in the second term?\n\nBiden:  To finish what I started in the first term. To continue to make sure that the European continent-I'll tell you, I got a call from Kissinger about 10 days before he died. And he used the following comment. He said that not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their shoulder at dread with what Europe-what Russia may do, until now. Until now, you can't let that change.\n\nThe point is that we have an opportunity to have the decisions we make in the last couple of years, in the next four years, are going to determine the future of Europe for a long time to come. And so that's why we can not let NATO fail, we have to build that both politically and economically. And militarily, which we're investing significantly. In addition to that, I am desperately focused on making sure that we deal with the...what they are calling the south now. There are going to be a billion people in Africa in the next several years . We have to, we have to be a catalyst for change for the benefit, for the, for the better, we have to help them build back better, we have to help them.\n\nWe, on the climate side, have come along and we've done everything that is reasonably-and three other countries are the reason we're in the problem we're in. But what happens if all of a sudden, on the Amazon, they're starting to clear, vast swaths of land, cut down forests, etc. Back when Dick Lugar was alive, he and I started something back in the 90s, where we said-late 80's, excuse me-where we said to, in the Amazon, they said, look, if you, we'll make a deal with you Brazil. You don't cut your forest, we'll pay you not to do it. We'll pay you not to do it, We have to prevent-And that's why we're working so hard to make sure Angola can be in a position that they have more solar capacity than almost any place in the world, to help that whole continent.\n\nThat's why we want to build a railroad all the way-with others in Europe-all the way across the continent. So that you have, you have countries that have overproduction of agriculture and some that don't have it, but no way to get a transfer. There's so much opportunity in Africa. And we have to work it.\n\nIn addition to that, we have to deal with the Indo-Pacific. I've had 15 island presidents and leaders here twice now. They know if they-if we don't do something about global warming, a couple of them are going to be underwater. I mean, literally underwater, not to-So we're putting together coalitions of people that have a similar interest. And it makes it difficult. You know, you're talking, everybody talks about how, how strong China is and how powerful they are.  Name me-Would you trade places with Xi Jinping and any other country?  Not a joke, I'm being deadly earnest, a rhetorical question. But would you? You've got a population that's considerably older than the vast majority of the youth in Europe, that is too old to work. And they are xenophobic.  Where is it coming from? Where is it going to grow? You've got an economy that's on the brink there. The idea that their economy is booming? Give me a break.\n\nI do have one last on China, which is are they meddling in the election? Have you seen evidence that they're meddling with AI or in other ways in the US election?\n\nBiden: There, there, there, there is evidence that meddling is going on. I'm not going to get into, I don't think I should from an intelligence standpoint, there...\n\nIt sounds as if they are.\n\nBiden: I think China would have an interest-let me put it this way-would have an interest in meddling.  Everybody, all the bad guys are rooting for Trump, man. Not a joke. Think about it. Think about it. I mean, that line that Macron used, and it says that...I was making notes for this. It said, Macron, they know the experience of brain death unlike any time. Because lack of US leadership, we should reassess the reality of NATO in light of the lack of US leadership.\n\nYou know, we talked about what they're looking at in terms of Asia. One thing that I was able to convince the Japanese of is we're not walking away from Japan. Because Japan, collected with us, is a source of great economic strength and stability, physical stability for both of us. You're not going to have, I mean, the idea that China wants to screw with everybody is a different place.\n\nBy the way, the cost of China to build their military is multi-billions of dollars.  And guess what they're, you know, they're, they're...what they call it? Going around the world? The Belt and Road initiative? It's become a nuisance graveyard initiative. I'm serious. Think about it. I've been saying this for three years, and you guys write, \"No, China's on the right-China's gonna break through.\" Where are they, where are they breaking through? And look what's happening in Africa.\n\nWell, I could I could go on with that question for a long time, Mr. President, thank you very much I've taken-\n\nBiden: After this is all over, I'm happy to talk with you. For real.\n\nCorrection, June 5\n\nThe original version of this transcript misspelled the surname of someone President Biden mentioned while recalling conversations with fellow world leaders.

      "text": "Inside Biden's Debate Disaster and the Scramble to Quell Democratic Panic\n\nA s President Joe Biden was going over his final notes with his inner circle and getting ready to debate Donald Trump on June 27 in Atlanta, his wife slipped into a nearby meeting of the Democratic Party's biggest donors. The Biden Victory Fund and the Democratic National Committee's financial bigwigs had all assembled in the Ritz Carlton as part of a two-day political briefing that featured emotional pep talks and face-time with VIPs. \"Joe's ready to go,\" Dr. Biden told the group. \"He's prepared.\"\n\nFact check: false.\n\nBefore midnight, Joe Biden would slog through 90 minutes of a debate against Trump that even Biden's closest allies privately admitted was a disaster. Biden appeared every bit the 81-year-old grandfather that he is, stammering with a thin voice through unintelligible arguments and often staring blankly, mouth agape, as Trump lobbed one verbal attack after another. Biden froze up repeatedly and fumbled even some set-piece lines he had prepared in advance for the moment. When fielding a question about the national debt, his answer was incomprehensible as he seemed to be trying to argue for super-rich Americans paying more taxes. \"We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do-childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the-with, with, with the COVID. Excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with-look, if-we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nPanic is not too strong a word to describe the sentiment that coursed through the Democratic Party from top to bottom as the debate unfolded. \"What the actual f- is happening?\" one Democratic fundraiser texted. Across the room another sent along something of a distress call and a hostage video at once: \"This won't be as bad for voters as it is for us, right?\" From progressive to pragmatist, the verdict among Democrats was perhaps the most united the party's upper ranks have been in decades. \"Unintelligible must have been the [closed captioning],\" for the entirety of Biden's performance, another senior Democrat strategist mused. \"It would have been the most honest.\" Almost immediately after it was over, Democrats started asking whether and how Biden could be convinced to bow out for the good of the party, for the nation, and for the candidate himself.\n\nBiden loyalists rushed into the breach. Vice President Kamala Harris did a round of scheduled late-night cable hits, making her best effort at staving off party activists' dreams of ditching Biden, and maybe Harris as well. Biden's team publicly insisted that the night was just one of many, and that the candidate was absolutely, 100% up for another four years. As proof, they stuck to their plan for after the debate, sending him to a watch party at the Hyatt Regency on Atlanta's Peachtree Street for 45 minutes of selfies before a midnight drop-in at a Waffle House on his way to an Atlanta airfield for a quick jump up to Raleigh, N.C., where he'd campaign the next day. Air Force One landed just before 2 a.m.  The next day, the nation's most popular senior Democrat, Barack Obama, told his allies to back off Biden. \"Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\" Biden's former boss messaged.\n\nBut the reality remains: everyone in America who tuned in to the debate could see for themselves how Biden has aged. Already locked into what is at best a neck-and-neck race with Trump, Biden's path to victory suddenly seemed to be turning into a dead-end before Democrats' eyes. That left the party asking two questions. Was there any way to get him off the ticket? And if not, was there any chance to stagger across the finish line with a deeply flawed candidate? Either way, it was nothing like what Biden and his team had plotted while secluded at the presidential retreat of Camp David in Maryland's mountains for six full days of rehearsal in an airplane hangar and movie theater. For all the talk about the most successful first-term agenda ever and a history-defying midterm election, Biden's team spent the wee hours of Thursday and all of Friday trying to talk Democrats off a ledge.\n\nWhen a candidate biffs, it's expected that a loyal aide will take the fall. And few have more experience in throwing people under the bus than Joe Biden. When his first campaign imploded over the summer of 1987, a young aide and future Democratic National Committee Chairman named David Wilhelm took the blame for passing along a British Labor Leader's speeches that Biden cribbed on a debate stage. When his third bid for the job finished in fourth place in lead-off Iowa, Biden removed his longtime aide and campaign manager Greg Schultz as the entourage slowly navigated icy New Hampshire roads on the way to a debate site. With the never-ending investigations about his son's involvement with dodgy business partners, Biden blamed his staff for not flagging the potential conflicts of interest sooner. And when classified documents were recovered in his personal possession, it was again the help's fault.\n\nBut this time, blame can only go so far beyond the president himself and his closest family members. No one can say that what happened in Atlanta was unexpected. Voters have been consistent in telling pollsters they're worried about the ages of both candidates. Almost two-thirds of the nation thinks both Trump and Biden are too old for the job, according to Ipsos polling. Another one-quarter thinks Biden is too old. Separate polling from Gallup finds just 22% of Americans say they're satisfied with the direction of the country, a number that puts Biden in the danger zone. Around this time in 2020, Trump was at 20% and lost while Barack Obama was at the same level at this leg of the 2012 marathon and kept his job. In 1992, as George H.W. Bush was seeking a second term as President, that number stood at 14%; he lost that three-way race.\n\nAnd it's not like no one had been trying to warn of this exact scenario. Senior Democrats had been telling their peers that Biden is missing a step and not the best version of himself. Obama insiders like David Axelrod and David Plouffe had been cautioning donors and operatives alike that Biden was a risky bet and the party needed new blood. But raising the age question was grounds for excommunication from the high command of the Biden orbit. Dark stories swirled among those with access to the Biden's top advisors of one close aide who raised the issue of age and was summarily iced out.\n\nImmediately after the debate there was talk of an uprising, with unnamed Hill Democrats, wary of their own electoral vulnerability, swearing that this time an intervention by party leaders would be unleashed. But if Biden had resisted talk of a one-term presidency when the opportunity gracefully to step aside was available, he was even better positioned to hold his ground now. The rules of the Democratic party make it almost impossible to replace Biden atop the ticket unless he voluntarily steps aside. Biden currently has 3,894 of the nearly 4,000 estimated pledged delegates so far, most of whom are required to stick with him through the first round of voting, which will be held virtually online ahead of the Democratic National Convention. Some 25% of delegates at the convention would be needed to hold a vote opening the way to another candidate's chance to be the nominee. That remains very unlikely.\n\n\"Things are dark. No doubt about it,\" says one hand who has been sitting in the West Wing since Day One. \"But onward. That's the only option that's on the table.\"\n\nIf Biden could be convinced to step aside there would be chaos inside the party unlike anything since 1968. Vice President Kamala Harris would start with advantages of incumbency, but her approval number is low and she would be vulnerable to a challenge. Prominent contenders, nominally jockeying for 2028 but all quietly talked about as possible Biden replacements in 2024, include Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.\n\nThe Trump campaign, for their part, seems delighted with the status quo. \"Democrats are stuck with Joe Biden whether they like it or not,\" says Alex Bruesewitz, a Trump-allied GOP consultant. That's probably true, and the former president's team was making the most of it in the wake of the debate. \"Joe Biden forgot that 13 heroes died in Afghanistan and thinks there is an epidemic of sister-on-sister rape. He should not be anywhere near the nuclear briefcase. It's never been more clear that President Donald Trump's strength is needed back in the White House,\" Bruesewitz says.\n\nTo quiet the fears, Biden had to acknowledge the error. \" Begrudgingly Biden isn't really a yard sign I want,\" a donor-strategist put it on Friday. The campaign doubled down on its resolve, circulating positive reviews from allies. And they remain convinced that Trump is an unlikeable figure who won over no voters with his haphazard showing at the debate. In the cold light of morning, campaign chief Jen O'Malley Dillon dropped by the Atlanta Ritz to buck-up the donors. \"The campaign leadership put it all in context and supporters left feeling better than last night,\" says Noah Mamet, a former Ambassador to Argentina. \"Supporters were telling each other it could have been better but no bed wetting, it's time to focus.\" In the upper ranks of the Biden orbit, there was no point adding gloss. \"This election was never going to be won or lost in one rally, one conversation, or one debate,\" a senior adviser says. \"We have a largely locked-in electorate and two well-defined candidates-and the voters who will decide this election are going to require consistent time and effort to win for November.\"\n\nBiden went to work delivering that vision on Friday in North Carolina, telling his crowd he understood the panic inside the party and then firmly rejecting it. \"Folks, let me close with this: I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,\" Biden deadpanned in Raleigh as he launched into a mea culpa donors were demanding and strategists were hoping he understood. \"I don't debate as well as I used to. I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. I know what millions of Americans know: when you get knocked down, you get back up.\"\n\nTrue, Biden has been knocked down plenty in his career, but sometimes it's best to stay on the canvas. \"Folks, I give my word as a Biden: I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job,\" he said. For many Democrats who watched the debate, the problem is that what Biden believes is starting to look more and more at odds with reality.\n\n- With reporting by Eric Cortellessa\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com"

      "text": "'We Are the World Power.' How Joe Biden Leads\n\nYou can read the transcript of the interview here and the fact-check here .\n\nJoe Biden makes his way through the West Wing telling stories. In the Cabinet Room, with sun pouring through French doors from the Rose Garden outside, he remembers the first time he sat around the long mahogany table, its high-backed leather chairs ordered by seniority. It was more than 50 years ago, Biden says, and Richard Nixon told National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger to brief the 30-year-old first-term Delaware Senator on the still secret timing of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. Walking slowly through the halls, the President unspools anecdotes about heads of state: Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping , Emmanuel Macron. In the Oval Office, he talks about his childhood home in Scranton, Pa., and the 2008 phone call from Barack Obama asking Biden to be his running mate.\n\nBiden recounts these memories over the course of more than 90 minutes on a warm spring day, speaking in a quiet, sometimes scattershot way. The impression he gives is one of advancing age and broad experience, of a man who has lived history. Biden leads the U.S. as the American century is fading into an uncertain future, a changing world of threats, opportunities, and power shifts. At 81, he holds fast to a vision that has reigned since World War II, in which a rich and powerful America leads an alliance of democracies to safeguard the globe from tyranny.\n\nOn June 6, Biden will travel to Normandy, France, to memorialize an event that has served for eight decades as a focal point of this vision. He will arrive as the 12th-and certainly the last-American President who was alive on that day in 1944, when 73,000 American troops led the largest amphibious invasion in human history, accelerating Nazi Germany's defeat and Europe's liberation. For generations, D-Day has been a hallowed anniversary. The President says commemorating it is as much about the future as the past. \"We're playing [that role] even more,\" Biden says. \"We are the world power.\"\n\nWhether this view of America's role in the world will outlast Biden's presidency is an open question. Voters face a clear choice this November. Biden calls America's democratic values the \"grounding wire of our global power\" and its alliances \"our greatest asset.\" His presumptive opponent, former President Donald Trump, called for withdrawing American forces in Europe and Asia and has promised, most recently in his April 12 interview with TIME, to cut loose even our closest allies if they don't do as he tells them. By his own account, Trump sees all countries as unreliable, the relations between them transactional. That sentiment has spread throughout a Republican Party that once championed America's values abroad. J.D. Vance, the Ohio Senator in contention to become Trump's Vice President, tells TIME that the D-Day story has become a sepia-toned distraction. \"The foreign policy establishment is obsessed with World War II historical analogies,\" says Vance, \"and everything is some fairy tale they tell themselves from the 1930s and 1940s.\"\n\nBuy TIME's President Biden 'If He Wins' cover here\n\nDuring his 40 months in office, events have tested Biden's vision of American world leadership. Alliances haven't been enough to win a new European war in Ukraine. U.S. power and leverage haven't prevented a humanitarian catastrophe in the Middle East, marked by alleged war crimes. Putin is trying to assemble an axis of autocrats from Tehran to Beijing. In China, the U.S. faces an adversary potentially its equal in economic and military power that is intent on tearing down the American global order. President Xi has told his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, U.S. officials say, raising the possibility of a dark analogue to Normandy in Asia. Biden doesn't rule out sending troops to defend Taiwan if China attacked, saying, \"It would depend on the circumstances.\"\n\nBiden's record in facing these tests is more than just nostalgic talk. He has added two powerful European militaries to NATO, and will soon announce the doubling of the number of countries in the Atlantic alliance that are paying more than the target 2% of their GDP toward defense, the White House says. His Administration has worked to prevent the war in Gaza from igniting a broader regional conflict. He brokered the first trilateral summit with long-distrustful regional partners South Korea and Japan, and coaxed the Philippines to move away from Beijing's orbit and provide the U.S. new access to four military bases. He has rallied European and Asian countries to curtail China's economic sway. \"We have put together the strongest alliance in the history of the world,\" Biden says, so that \"we are able to move in a way that recognizes how much the world has changed and still lead.\"\n\nBut American Presidents must earn a mandate from their fellow citizens, and it's far from clear that Biden can. In surveys, large majorities say that he is too old to lead. As he walked TIME through the West Wing and sat for a 35-minute interview on May 28, the President, with his stiff gait, muffled voice, and fitful syntax, cut a striking contrast with the intense, loquacious figure who served as Senator and Vice President. Biden bristles at the suggestion that he is aging out of his job. Asked whether he could handle its rigors though the end of a second term, when he will be 86, he shot back, \"I can do it better than anybody you know.\" Age aside, Biden's handling of foreign affairs gets poor marks from voters, and not just for the bungled withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan or the ongoing war in Gaza. While 65% of Americans still believe that the U.S. should take a leading or major role in the world, that number is down 14 points from 2003 and is at its lowest level since Gallup began polling the issue two years earlier.\n\nBiden, who is the most experienced foreign policy President in a generation, believes that role is in America's interest. \"When we strengthen our alliances, we amplify our power as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they can reach our shores,\" he said soon after taking office. To judge the merit of Biden's plan to sustain American world leadership, voters can look to his record: what he has accomplished, where he has fallen short, and how he intends to build on his work in a second term.\n\nAround 3 p.m. on Dec. 13, 2021, the White House Situation Room put through a call from Biden to his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto. Putin's invasion of Ukraine was still more than two months away, and Finland, with its 830-mile border with Russia and tense history with Moscow, had long declined to join NATO. Less than a quarter of Finns supported entering the alliance at the time. But Biden had decided, aides say, that if Russia invaded, the West's response should be not just to defend NATO, but to strengthen it.\n\nOn March 4, days after the invasion, Biden met with the newly enthusiastic Niinisto in the Oval Office. Together they called Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, who had resisted joining the alliance, to try to persuade her. After both countries applied for membership in May 2022, Biden turned to getting the rest of NATO to accept them. In June, he called Turkey's leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan from Air Force One on the way to a summit in Madrid, in hopes of getting Erdogan's support for expanding the alliance. Dangling a one-on-one meeting, Biden said of Turkey's long-sought access to America's F-16 fighter jets, \"Let's find a way to get that done,\" according to the White House. By March 2024, Sweden and Finland were in. \"Everybody thought, including you guys, thought I was crazy,\" Biden says. \"Guess what? I did it.\"\n\nThe accession of Finland and Sweden was part of Biden's broader efforts to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by rallying the free world. Starting in October 2021, Biden held a series of meetings with European and NATO leaders, discussing postinvasion support for Ukraine, including military assistance, sanctions, diplomacy, and economic support. Biden also brought Asian allies into the effort. South Korea and Japan have imposed sanctions on Russia and its arms suppliers. The result, Biden advisers say, is a strengthened alliance of shared democratic values worldwide. \"He has connected Europe and Asia in a way no previous President has,\" says National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.\n\nOthers view all the investment in Ukraine as a distraction from the bigger challenge America faces in East Asia. \"Who doesn't think that $200 billion spent in Europe would've been incredibly useful in the Pacific?\" says Elbridge Colby, a former Trump Administration Pentagon official and lead architect of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. \"Great nations fail,\" says Lieut. General Keith Kellogg, Trump's former National Security Adviser, when \"you fix somebody else's potholes instead of fixing your potholes.\"\n\nBiden says he remains committed to Ukrainian victory. Asked about the war's endgame, Biden says, \"Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine.\" But last year's Ukrainian counteroffensive was a failure. Russia recently has made its largest advances since the opening months of the invasion. Alliance building may have reached its limit, along with Americans' appetite for funding a war of attrition. Biden's allies in Kyiv complain he has been too cautious, giving Ukraine enough weapons to survive the war but not to win it. \"It's not a decisive stance,\" says a senior official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's government. \"It's not the way to victory.\"\n\nOn balance, however, even longtime critics are impressed with Biden's efforts in Ukraine. Former Defense Secretary and CIA director Robert Gates wrote in 2014 that Biden had \"been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national-security issue over the past four decades.\" But on May 19, Gates said that Biden's response to Russia's invasion has gone a long way toward repairing the damage of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. \"He gained a lot of credibility with the speed with which he assembled the coalition of partner countries, allies, and friends before, during, and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\" Gates told CBS's Face the Nation.\n\nBiden says his response has been part of a broader deterrence strategy. \"If we ever let Ukraine go down, mark my words, you'll see Poland go, and you'll see all those nations along the actual border of Russia [fall],\" he tells TIME. But in other theaters, the high-minded Normandy vision has given way to a different kind of diplomacy.\n\nHalfway through our interview, Biden responds to a question about America's relationship with Saudi Arabia by saying that the U.S. has two kinds of alliances: \"There are values-based, and there are practical-based.\" During the campaign, Biden had sworn to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah.\" One of his first moves in office was to cut off certain arms supplies over the kingdom's war in Yemen, which has displaced 4.5 million people and killed 377,000, including 11,000 children, according to the U.N. Soon after, the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, met with China's Foreign Minister and proposed greater cooperation on nuclear energy and security with Beijing, already the kingdom's largest economic partner.\n\nThe Biden Administration quietly pivoted. A new \"great game\" was afoot, with the world dividing between competing Chinese and American spheres of influence. For all Biden's efforts to stimulate a green transition, Saudi Arabia was still providing much of the world's energy. Moreover, the Saudis had expressed willingness during the Trump presidency to normalize relations with Israel, which would tilt the regional balance of power against Iran and in the U.S.'s favor. On Sept. 27, 2021, Sullivan traveled to Saudi Arabia with instructions from Biden to explore the possibility of a peace deal between the kingdom and Israel.\n\nBiden himself traveled to Saudi Arabia in July 2022, bucking a flurry of criticism for meeting with MBS, who has led a widespread crackdown on clerics, academics, and human-rights advocates critical of his regime, according to Human Rights Watch, and who the U.S. says ordered the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi . But the visit helped stabilize relations. Over the course of the next year, it began to look as if Biden's moral climb down with MBS had brought the Saudis back on the U.S. side, and restarted a possible bargain with Israel. The outlines of that deal, Biden now says, were \"overwhelmingly in our interest.\"\n\nHamas, the terrorist group that controls Gaza, was determined not to allow it. Days after its Oct. 7 attack against Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad told TIME, \"We planned for this because Israel thinks it can make peace with anyone, it can make normalization with any country, it can oppress the Palestinians, so we decided to shock the Israelis in order to wake up others.\" Eight Americans were among the estimated 240 taken hostage in the massacre. The Biden Administration has sought to secure their release, but it is not clear how many of the American hostages have survived; three reportedly have been killed. \"We believe there are those that are still alive,\" Biden tells TIME. \"I met with all the families. But we don't have final proof on exactly who's alive.\"\n\nBiden's reaction to Oct. 7 was to provide rock-solid support to Israel. Within a week he had deployed two aircraft carriers to the region. Quietly, he tried to rally Egypt and Saudi Arabia to resist expansion of the conflict into a war between Israel and Iran. Biden's \"practical-based\" alliance building appeared to pay off on April 13, when Iran responded to an Israeli attack on a satellite diplomatic office by launching more than 300 missiles and drones in its first-ever direct attack on Israel. The Saudis and Jordanians reportedly provided intelligence assistance and opened their airspace to U.S. and other jets. With Israel leading the way, the ad hoc alliance managed to shoot down all but four of the projectiles, with no fatalities. More important, the episode helped avert a region-wide war.\n\nBut Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has upped the cost of Biden's commitment to Israel at every turn. Nearly eight months after the conflict started, the death toll in Gaza, according to the local Hamas-led Ministry of Health, has climbed to more than 36,000 people, including an unknown number of Hamas fighters. More than 1.7 million have been displaced by Israeli attacks that have destroyed much of the enclave. On May 20, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court requested a war-crimes indictment for Netanyahu, his Defense Minister, and three leaders of Hamas. Four days later, in a largely symbolic move, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt operations in Gaza . Human Rights Watch says Israel has \"imposed collective punishments on the civilian population, deprived the civilian population of objects indispensable to its survival, and used starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.\"\n\nAsked if Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, Biden says, \"It's uncertain.\" From the start, the Administration knew Israel was pushing the limits of legal warfare, the Washington Post and others have reported. The conflict is driving a wedge between the U.S. and its allies. On May 31, Biden laid out a phased cease-fire plan that would end the war and secure the release of hostages. He has continued to pursue the complicated regional deal with Saudi Arabia. Some close to Biden say the only holdout to the broader pact is Netanyahu. The President declines to say as much, but when asked by TIME if Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his own political reasons, Biden admits, \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nAs aides try to bring the interview to a close, Biden turns to China. Hawks say Beijing is in a sprint to match American economic and military production. By some measures, it is catching up on GDP and defense manufacturing, and already has a larger navy. But Biden takes a bullish view of the competition with the rising Asian power. \"Everybody talks about how, how strong China is and how powerful they are,\" Biden says. \"You've got an economy that's on the brink there. The idea that their economy is booming, give me a break.\" That doesn't mean they can't pose a threat. Asked if China is using AI or other means to meddle in the upcoming U.S. election, Biden says someone is, but declines to say who. Pressed, he adds, \"I think China would have an interest in meddling.\"\n\nWhat Biden describes as China's economic weakness could make confrontation more, not less, likely-another argument, as he sees it, for expanding America's alliances in East Asia. And in that arena, the President has pursued a mix of \"values-based\" and \"practical\" approaches.\n\nBiden was on Air Force One on his way to a fundraiser in Illinois on May 11, 2022, when the results of the Philippine presidential elections were announced, showing that Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. had won. Biden \"had the instinct to just pick up the phone and said, 'Hey, let's get together soon and start building a relationship,'\" Sullivan says. It was a long shot. Marcos has a pending $2 billion judgment against him in a U.S. court relating to his parents' human-rights record during their more than 20-year dictatorship, which ended in 1986. The Philippines are now rated \"partly free\" by Freedom House, and the outgoing President, Rodrigo Duterte, had courted China even as Beijing claimed nearby islands and territorial waters. Marcos had sent cold signals to the U.S. during his campaign.\n\nBiden's call was the first Marcos had received from a foreign leader. As U.S. officials followed up, they briefed the new President on the parallels between Putin's invasion of Ukraine and Xi's declared goals in the South China Sea. Biden dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris and his Secretaries of State and Defense to woo Marcos. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman made clear Marcos had diplomatic immunity and would be welcome in the U.S. Less than a year after Biden's congratulatory call, Marcos made a visit to the White House. More significantly, he provided the U.S. military new access to four bases in the Philippines. In April and May, the two countries engaged in their largest military exercises together, simulating an effort to repulse an amphibious landing. \"The President got engaged early in a very personal way,\" says Sullivan, \"and then kind of showed both respect for him and a vision for where the relationship would go.\"\n\nBiden has pursued this brand of personal realpolitik across Asia. He elevated the communist autocracy in Vietnam to the highest diplomatic status, comprehensive strategic partner, and has moved to embrace the increasingly repressive regime of Narendra Modi in India. He has tried to boost the \"Quad\" alliance with India, Japan, and Australia, upgrading it from a meeting of Foreign Ministers to one of heads of state. In April 2023, Biden convened a Camp David summit with the South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Overcoming long-fraught relations between Seoul and Tokyo, the three countries criticized China's behavior in the South China Sea and declared \"a hinge point of history, when geopolitical competition, the climate crisis, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and nuclear provocations test us.\"\n\nCritics say the problem is too much friend making and not enough deterrence. The U.K. recently said China may be preparing to provide lethal aid to Russia, a move that Biden said in March 2022 would put Xi \"in significant jeopardy\" of harsh U.S. sanctions. \"The single biggest problem with the Biden team is their failure to grasp what it takes to achieve effective deterrence against aggressors,\" says Matt Pottinger, who was Deputy National Security Adviser under Trump. \"They failed against the Taliban, then Putin, and then Iran and its proxies. And now Beijing is making moves that could prove fateful for the world.\" Former Trump official Colby says Biden's diplomatic work is a weak substitute for the one thing that can deter China's rise. \"These high-profile photo ops,\" says Colby, \"are not a substitute for raw military power.\" He points to recent statements by senior U.S. military officials that China is outpacing the U.S. on missile- and shipbuilding, and war games showing the U.S. losing badly in a contest over Taiwan, and says the U.S. should put all its efforts into defending the \"first island chain\" of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines.\n\nBiden believes that withdrawing from Europe and the Middle East to focus on East Asia would backfire, aides say. If America abandons its allies elsewhere, they argue, its Asian allies will abandon it, in turn. The U.S. needs European and Middle Eastern countries to increase its economic and military advantages over China. And ultimately, failing to confront instability now-in Ukraine, Gaza or elsewhere-will only make doing so later a more costly distraction from the competition with Beijing.\n\nBack in the Cabinet Room after the interview, the sun is lower, and Biden has more stories. He turns to a sideboard with a commendation from the Kosovo government to his son Beau Biden, who died of cancer nine years ago. The President relates with evident pride his son's work supporting its judicial system. A mention of diplomat Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton accords for the Balkans, elicits a story about Afghanistan and an argument Biden had with Holbrooke over the search for peace there.\n\nOn a matching sideboard on the other side of the door, the President opens an album with travel pictures, launching a series of anecdotes about the Popes he has known, including John Paul II and Benedict, whom Biden calls \"the Rottweiler.\" Recounting an exchange with one over abortion, he casts an eye toward the cracked door to the Oval Office and asks an aide, \"Are they in there?\" Turning back to his visitors, he says, \"Let me show you one more picture.\"\n\nThis avuncular politicking remains a Biden trademark, one that has helped with allies overseas but failed to unite Americans at home, as Biden pledged when running for President. Not that he has stopped trying. Biden ultimately persuaded Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to move a roughly $95 billion supplemental aid package for Ukraine, the Middle East, and Taiwan. To build support for his Middle East peace package, he has worked both sides of the aisle. On Nov. 8, 2023, Biden sat for two hours in the windowless Roosevelt Room with a bipartisan group of nine Senators who had just returned from the region, asking for impressions from the trip and moderating a conversation between them, Sullivan, and Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk. At the end, he pulled Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham into the Oval Office for separate 10-minute conversations about next steps in the effort, says Coons.\n\nBiden may be right that despite the partisanship, a consensus exists for a values-based, pragmatic role for America in the world. His challenge is to get Americans to focus on that rather than on other issues driven by foreign affairs, like inflation or immigration. Biden denies that his expansion of Trump's trade war with China will increase prices, and says his only regret about lifting Trump's anti-immigration measures is that he didn't do it sooner. His goal in a second term, he says, is \"to finish what he started.\"\n\nAt stake is the direction of the world for the coming century. At Normandy, Biden will make the case for what historian Hal Brands says is \"the 80-year tradition of internationalism that has been quite good for America and the world.\" The alternative, says Brands, would be a \"more vicious and chaotic\" world where Americans ultimately would be less safe, prosperous, and free, but only after everyone else suffered first.\n\nWrapping up his conversation with TIME, Biden offers cookies from a tray in the outer Oval. \"They're homemade,\" he says. Turning to leave, he offers a final salutation: \"Keep the faith.\" But then he pauses and turns back, as the phrase triggers one last story. It's about a relative who had his own response to that admonition. And here Biden taps one of his visitors on the chest and says, \"Spread the faith.\"\n\n- With reporting by Simon Shuster/Kyiv; Leslie Dickstein, Simmone Shah, and Julia Zorthian/New York; and Melissa August, Brian Bennett, Vera Bergengruen, Eric Cortellessa, and Sam Jacobs/Washington\n\nOrder your copy of the President Biden 'If He Wins' issue here\n\nCorrection appended, June 5: The original version of this story misstated the terms of an agreement the Biden Administration struck with the Philippines.

      "text": "Watch and Read Joe Biden's Full Speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention\n\nP resident Joe Biden closed out the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago with a nearly hour-long speech-amid chants of \"thank you, Joe\" and \"we love Joe\" from the crowd-that had been built up as a farewell address from the longtime politician who recently withdrew from the 2024 presidential election and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris to carry his legacy forward.\n\nThe following transcript was prepared and provided to TIME by Rev , using AI-powered software, and it was reviewed and edited for accuracy by TIME staff.\n\nTo my dearest daughter, Ashley, God love you, you're incredible. Thanks for the introduction, and for being my courageous heart, along with Hunter and our entire family. And especially our rock, Jill, who is, those of you who know us, she still leaves me both breathless and speechless. Everybody knows her. I love her more than she loves me. She walks down the stairs and I still get that going \"boom, boom, boom.\" You all who know me know I'm not kidding. Let's give a special round of applause to our First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nMy dad used to have an expression for real. He'd say, \"Joey, family is the beginning, the middle, and the end.\" And I love you all. Folks-and America, I love you.\n\nFolks, let me ask you. Let me ask you: Are you ready to vote for freedom? Are you ready to vote for democracy and for America? Let me ask you: Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz President and Vice President of the United States?\n\nMy fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, nearly four years ago in winter on the steps of the Capitol, on a cold January day, I raised my right hand and I swore an oath to you and to God, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and to faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States. In front of me was a city surrounded by the National Guard. Behind me, a Capitol just two weeks before had been overrun by a violent mob. But I knew then, from the bottom of my heart that I knew now, there is no place in America for political violence. None.\n\nYou cannot say you love your country only when you win. In that moment, I wasn't looking to the past, I was looking to the future. I spoke to the work at hand, the moment we had to meet. It was, as I told you then, a winter of peril and possibility. Of peril and possibility. We're in the grip of a once in a century pandemic, historic joblessness, a call for racial justice long overdue, clear and present threats to our very democracy.\n\n( Crowd chants: \"We love Joe!\" ) Thank you.\n\nYet, I believed then, and I believe now, that progress was and is possible. Justice is achievable, and our best days are not behind us, they're before us. Now it's summer. The winter has passed, and with a grateful heart I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed, democracy has delivered, and now democracy must be preserved.\n\nYou've heard me say it before, we're facing an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. That's not hyperbole, I mean it literally. We're in a battle for the very soul of America.\n\nI ran for President in 2020 because of what I saw in Charlottesville in August of 2017. Extremists coming out of the woods, carrying torches, their veins bulging from their necks, carrying Nazi swastikas and chanting the same exact antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the early '30s. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the Ku Klux Klan, so emboldened by a President then in the White House that they saw as an ally. They didn't even bother to wear their hoods.\n\nHate was on the march in America. Old ghosts in new garments, stirring up the oldest divisions, stoking the oldest fears, giving oxygen to the oldest forces that they long sought to tear apart America. In the process, a young woman was killed. When I contacted her mother, I asked about what happened. She told me. When the President was asked what he thought had happened, Donald Trump said, and I quote, \"There are very fine people on both sides.\" My God, that's what he said. That is what he said and what he meant.\n\nThat's when I realized-had to listen to the admonition of my dead son-I could not stay on the sidelines. So I ran.\n\nBecause I had no intention of running again. I'd just lost part of my soul. But I ran with a deep conviction in America. I know and believe in an America where honesty, dignity, decency, still matter. An America where everyone has a fair shot and hate has no safe harbor. An America where the fundamental creed of this nation that all of us are created equal is still very much alive. And a broad coalition of Americans joined with me. Eighty-one million voters voted for us, more than any time in all of history. Because of all of you in this room and others, we came together in 2020 to save democracy.\n\nAs your President, I've been determined to keep America moving forward, not going back. To stand against hate and violence in all its forms. To be a nation where we not only live with but thrive on diversity, demonizing no one, leaving no one behind, and becoming a nation that we profess to be.\n\nI also ran to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. I made a commitment to you that I'd be a President for all Americans, whether you voted for me or not. We have done that. Studies show the major bills we have passed actually delivered more to red states than blue, because the job of the President is to deliver to all of America.\n\nAnd because of you-and I'm not exaggerating, because of you-we've had one of the most extraordinary four years of progress ever. Period. When I say we, I mean Kamala and me.\n\nJust think about it. COVID no longer controls our lives. We got from economic crisis to the strongest economy in the entire world. Record 16 million new jobs. Record small business growth. Record high stock market. Record high 401(k)s. Wages up and inflation down, way down and continuing to go down. The smallest racial wealth gap in 20 years. And yes, we both know we have more to do, but we're moving in the right direction. More Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history.\n\nAnd after-as a young senator beginning to fight, beginning to fight for 50 years, to give Medicare the power to negotiate low prescription drug prices, we finally beat big Pharma. And guess who cast the tie breaking vote? Vice President soon-to-be President Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of the land. Instead of paying $400 a month for insulin, seniors with diabetes will pay $35 a month. The law we passed already includes, starting in January, every senior's total prescription costs can be capped at $2,000 no matter how expensive the drugs they have. And what we don't focus on, and our Republican friends don't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money. You know what we just passed saved? It saved $160 billion over the next decade. That's not hyperbole. It's because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices to the Big Pharma.\n\nBut look.\n\n( Crowd chants: \"Thank you, Joe!\" ) Thank you, Kamala, too.\n\nLook. Folks, how can we have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world? Donald Trump promised Infrastructure Week, every week for four years, and he never built a damn thing.\n\nAnd now because of what Kamala and I have done-remember, we were told we couldn't get it done? Remember, when we came into office, we couldn't get anything passed?-but right now, we're giving America an infrastructure decade not week. We're modernizing our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our trains, our buses, removing every lead pipe from schools and homes so every child could drink clean water. We're providing affordable high speed internet for every American no matter where they live, unlike, not unlike what Roosevelt did with electricity. And so much more. We are uniting the country, we're growing our economy, we're improving our quality of life, and we're building a better America. Because that's who we are.\n\nHow can we be the strongest nation in the world without leading the world in science and technology? After years of importing 90% of our semiconductor chips from abroad, which America invented those chips, our CHIPS and Science Act meant that private companies from around the world are now investing literally tens of billions of dollars to build new chip factories right here in America. And over that period, they'll create tens of thousands of jobs. And many of those jobs in the so-called Fabs, the buildings that make the chips that are being constructed now. And guess what? The average salary in those fabs, size of a football field, will be over $100,000 a year, and you don't need a college degree.\n\nBecause of you and so many electeds out there, American manufacturing is back. Where the hell does it say we wouldn't lead the world in manufacturing. Eight-hundred-thousand new manufacturing jobs.\n\nOur Republican friends and others made sure they'd go abroad to get the cheapest labor. We used to import products and export jobs. Now we export American products and create American jobs, right here in America, where jobs belong. With every new job, with every new factory, pride and hope is being brought back to communities throughout the country that were left behind. You know you're from it, many of you. You know what it's like when that factory closed where your mother, your father, your grandmother, grandfather worked. And now you're back, providing once again, proving that Wall Street didn't build America, the middle class built America, and unions-unions-built the middle class.\n\nIt's been my view since I came to the Senate and that's why I'm proud to have been the first President to walk a picket line and be labeled the most pro-union President in history. And I accept it. That's a fact. Because when unions do well, we all do well.\n\n( Crowd chants: \"Union Joe!\" ) You got it man. You got it. I agree. I'm proud.\n\nLook, remember when we were told we couldn't get anything done, we couldn't get anything done in the Congress? Well, with your support, we passed the most significant climate law in the history of mankind. Over $370 billion. Cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030. Launching a Climate Corps similar to AmeriCorps and Peace Corps, creating tens of thousands of jobs for young people in the future who are gonna make sure this continues. Creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy for American workers, including the IBEW installing 500,000-500,000-charging stations all across America. And in the process, reducing carbon emissions.  And we're seeing it, we're seeing to it that the first beneficiaries of environmental initiatives are those fenceline communities that have been smothered by the legacy of pollution. Louisiana and Delaware, Route 9, all the factories, all those chemical factors are right next to the poorest neighborhoods. They're the ones we're going to bring back.\n\nAnd how, how can we be the greatest nation in the world without the best education system in the world? Donald Trump and the Republican friends-they not only can't think, they can't read very well. Seriously, think about it. Look at their Project 2025. They want to do away with the Department of Education.\n\nWell, during the pandemic, Kamala and I helped states and cities get back their schools back open. And we gave public school teachers a raise. We created apprenticeships with businesses in the communities, putting students on a path to a good paying job whether or not they go to college. And by the way, we're making college a hell of a lot more affordable. Increasing Pell grants by $900. Over $15 billion dollars to HBCUs, minority-serving institutions including Hispanic institutions and tribal colleges. We kept our commitment to provide more student relief than ever by lifting the burden of helping millions of families so they could get married, start a family, buy a home, and begin to build family wealth and contribute to the community and grow our economy. It's not costing us, it's creating more wealth.\n\nWe fundamentally transformed how our economy grows, from the middle-out and the bottom-up instead of the top-down. You know, my dad used to say there wasn't a whole hell of a lot to drop down on my kitchen table at the end of the month. I come from a basic middle-class family-three bedroom house, four kids, a grandpop living with us, decent neighborhood, but never a penny to spare-and look, that top-down notion never worked. A lot of Democrats thought it worked, but it doesn't. And when we did all that, what we've done, everybody can do well. Everybody.\n\nDonald Trump calls America a failing nation. No, I'm saying, but think about this. Think about this. He publicly says to the whole world-I'm going to say something outrageous. I know more foreign leaders by their first names and know them well than anybody alive just because I'm so damn old. Well, I'm not joking-think of the message he sends around the world when he talks about America being a failing nation.\n\nHe says, we're losing. He's the loser. He's dead wrong. Many of you are very successful people who travel the world. Name me a country in the world that doesn't think we're the leading nation in the world. Without America-not a joke, think about it, I'm being literal-who can lead the world other than the United States of America?\n\nWell, guess what? America's winning and the world's better off for it. America's more prosperous and America is safer today than under Donald Trump. Trump continues to lie about crime in America like everything else. Guess what? On his watch, the murder rate went up 30%, the biggest increase in history. Meanwhile, we made the largest investment, Kamala and I, in public safety ever. Now, the murder rate is falling faster than any time in history. Violent crime has dropped to the lowest level of more than 50 years. And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon.\n\nAnd folks, the distinguished Senator from California and I passed the first ban on assault weapons. And guess what? It worked. If we care about public safety, we need to prevent gun violence. And what makes me ashamed when I've traveled the world, which I do, more children in America are killed by a gunshot than any other cause in the United States. More die from a bullet than cancer, accidents, or anything else in the United States of America. My God. That's why Kamala and I are proud. We beat the NRA when we passed the first major bipartisan gun safety law in 30 years. I am serious. That comes from here. ( Biden points to his heart. ) And now it's time to ban assault weapons again and demand universal background checks.\n\nIt's hard. I never thought I'd stand before a crowd of Democrats and refer to a President as a liar so many times. No, I'm not trying to be funny. It's sad.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the border. Here's what he won't tell you. Trump killed the strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States that we negotiated with the Senate Republican took four weeks. Once it passed, and then we acknowledged those expansive border change in American history, he called senators to say, \"Don't support the bipartisan bill\" because he said it would help me politically and hurt him politically. My God. No, I'm serious. Think about it. Not a joke. Ask even the press who doesn't like me, they'll tell you that's true. Typically Trump, once again, putting himself first and America last.\n\nThen I had to take executive action. The result of the executive action I took: border encounters have dropped over 50%. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office. And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they're the poison of the blood of America, poison the blood of our country. Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting Dreamers and more.\n\nAnd here's what else I believe in: protecting your freedom. Your freedom to vote, your freedom to love who you love, and your freedom to choose. In its decision overturning Roe v. Wade , as you heard earlier tonight, the United States Supreme Court majority wrote the following, \"Women are not without electoral or political power.\" No kidding. MAGA Republicans found out the power of women in 2022. And Donald Trump is going to find out the power of women in 2024. Watch.\n\nAnd where Trump and his MAGA Republican right wingers seek to erase history, we Democrats continue to write history and make more history. I'm proud. I'm proud to have kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman in the United States Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a symbol for every young woman in America that you can do anything. I'm proud that I've kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and that taps into the full talent of our nation. The most diverse cabinet in history, including the first Black woman and South Asian descent to serve as Vice President-and will soon serve as the 47th President of the United States.\n\nShe's good. Look.\n\n( Crowd chants: \"Thank you, Joe!\" ) Thank you, Kamala.\n\nFolks, I've long said, we have many obligations as a nation. But I got in trouble years ago for saying I'd make no apologies. We have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't. That's why I was so proud to have written and signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans and their families exposed to toxic materials like burn pits and Agent Orange.\n\nI was around during the Vietnam War. It's hard. Nobody's able to prove that their illness is a consequence of Agent Orange. And no one was able to prove initially that because they lived in burn pits-like my son lived next to in Iraq for a year-that it was the cause of their illness. But because of the PACT Act, a surviving spouse to two children, is now eligible for a stipend of about $3,000 a month. And those children who lost a parent are eligible for tuition benefits to go to college and to get job training. It's already helping over one million veterans and their families just so far. Well, I love them and I'm so proud of my son's service.\n\nWe get it. But guess who doesn't get it-and doesn't respect our veterans. We know from his own chief of staff, the four-star general John Kelly, that Trump when in Europe would not go to the grave sites, the one of-in France-the brave service members who gave their lives to this country. He called them suckers and losers. Who in the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is? There's no words for a person. They are not the words of a person-not worthy of being a commander-in-chief, period. Not then. Not now. And not ever. I mean that. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Just as no commander-in-chief should ever bow down to a dictator, the way Trump bows down to Putin. I never have, and I promise you, Kamala Harris will never do it, will never bow down.\n\nWhen Trump left office, Europe and NATO was in tatters. Not a joke. \"America First\" doctrine changed our whole image in the world. Well, I spent-they gave the hours, about 190 hours, sum total-[inaudible] with my counterparts or heads of state in Europe to strengthen NATO. We did. We united Europe like it hadn't been united for years, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO.\n\nTen days before he died, Henry Kissinger called and said, \"Not since, not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their shoulder at Russia with dread, until now. Until now.\" Well, guess what? Putin thought he'd take Kyiv in three days. Three years later, Ukraine is still free.\n\nWhen I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. They haven't noticed: No one's saying that now.\n\nAnd we'll keep working to bring hostages home and end the war in Gaza and bring peace and security to the Middle East. As you know, I wrote a peace treaty for Gaza. A few days ago, I put forward a proposal that brought us closer to doing that than we've done since October 7th. We're working around the clock, my Secretary of State, to prevent a wider war and reunite hostages with their families and surge humanitarian health and food assistance into Gaza now, to end the civilian suffering of the Palestinian people and finally, finally, finally deliver a ceasefire and end this war.\n\nThose protesters out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides.\n\nJust as we worked around the clock to bring home wrongfully detained Americans and others from Russia, in one of the most complicated swaps in history-but they're home-Kamala and I are going to keep working to bring all Americans wrongfully detained around the world home. I mean it.\n\nFolks, I've got five months left in my presidency. I've got a lot to do. I intend to get it done.\n\nIt's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your President. I love the job, but I love my country more. I love my country more.\n\nAnd all this talk about how I'm angry with all those people who said I should step down-that's not true.\n\n(Crowd chants: \"We love Joe.\")\n\nI love my country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. In 2024, we need you to vote. We need you to keep the Senate. We need you to win back the House of Representatives. And above all, we need you to beat Donald Trump and elect Kamala and Tim President and Vice President of the United States of America.\n\nLook, they'll continue to lead America forward, creating more jobs, standing up for workers, growing the economy, lowering the cost of American families so they just have a little more breathing room. We made incredible progress, and we have more work to do. And Kamala and Tim will continue to take on corporate greed and bring down cost of food. They'll keep taking on Big Pharma, making insulin $35 a month, not just for seniors but for everyone in America. And capping prescription drug cost to a total of $2,000, not just for seniors but for everyone. And folks, that's going to save America again tens of billions of dollars. Folks, they'll make housing more affordable, building 3 million new homes, providing $25,000 down payment assistance for the first-time home buyer, more than the 10 we approved.\n\nDonald Trump wants a new tax on imported goods, food, gas, clothing, more. You know what that would cost the average family, according to the experts? $3,900 a year in tax. No, it's a fact. Kamala and Tim will make the childcare tax credit permanent, lifting millions of children out of poverty and helping millions of families get ahead.\n\nBut you know what Trump has? He created the largest debt any President had in four years with his $2 trillion tax cut for the wealthy. Well, Trump has a new plan. He wants to provide a $5 billion tax cut for corporations that are very wealthy-read it-put us further in debt. And folks, you know we have a thousand billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate they pay? 8.2%. If we just increased their taxes-we proposed to 25%, which isn't the highest tax rate even-it would raise 500 billion new dollars over 10 years, and they'd still be very wealthy. Look, Kamala and Tim are going to make them pay their fair share. They'll protect social security and Medicare. Trump wants to cut social security and Medicare. Kamala and Tim will protect your freedom. They'll protect your right to vote. They'll protect your civil rights.\n\nAnd you know Trump will do everything to ban abortion nationwide. Oh, he will. You know, Kamala and Tim will do everything they possibly can. That's why you have to elect a Senate and a House to restore Roe v. Wade .\n\nThe ancient Greeks taught us that character is destiny. Character is destiny. For me and Jill, we know Kamala and Doug are people of character. It's been our honor to serve alongside them. And we know that Tim and Gwen Walz are also people of great character.\n\nSelecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee. And it was the best decision I made my whole career. We've not only gotten to know each other, we've become close friends. She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity. Enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story.\n\nAnd like many of our best Presidents, she was also Vice President. That's a joke.\n\nBut she'll be a President our children could look up to. She'll be a President respected by world leaders because she already is. She'll be a President we can all be proud of. And she will be an historic President who puts her stamp on America's future.\n\nThis will be the first presidential election since January 6th. On that day, we almost lost everything about who we are as a country. And that threat-this is not hyperbole-that threat is still very much alive. Donald Trump says he will refuse to accept the election result if he loses again. Think about that. He means it. Think about that. He's promising a \"bloodbath\" if he loses, in his words, and that he'll be a dictator on \"day one,\" in his own words. By the way, this sucker means it. No, I'm not joking. Think about it. Anybody else said that in the past, you'd think he was crazy-he is crazy-but you'd think it was an exaggeration. But he means it. We can't let that happen.\n\nFolks, all of us carry a special obligation. Independents, Republicans, Democrats. We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024. The vote that each of us cast this year will determine whether democracy and freedom will prevail. It's that simple. It's that serious. And the power is literally in your hands. History's in your hands. Not hyperbole. It's in your hands. America's future's in your hands.\n\nLet me close with this: Nowhere else in the world could a kid with a stutter and modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, grow up to sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. That's because America is and always has been a nation of possibilities. Possibilities. We must never lose that. Never.\n\nKamala and Tim understand that this nation must continue to be a place of possibilities. Not just for the few of us, but for all of us. Join me in promising your whole heart to this effort. And where my heart will be, I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Walz's camp have ever seen.\n\nEach of us has a part in the American story. For me and my family, there's a song that means a lot to us, that captures the best of who we are as a nation. The song is called American Anthem . There's one verse that stands out-and I can't sing worth a damn so I'm not gonna try, I'll just quote it-\"The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day. What shall our legacy be? What will our children say? Let me know in my heart when my days are through. America, America, I gave my best to you.\"\n\n( Crowd chants: \"Thank you, Joe!\" )\n\nI've made a lot of mistakes in my career, but I gave my best to you. For 50 years, like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation. And I've been blessed a million times in return with the support of the American people.\n\nI've either been too young to be in the Senate because I wasn't 30 yet and too old to stay as President. But I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nI can honestly say, and I mean this from the bottom-I'll give you my word as a Biden-I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States Senator. I mean it.\n\nFolks, we just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing we cannot do when we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Why Joe Biden Dropped Out\n\nI t took nearly a half-century for Joe Biden to rise to the pinnacle of American politics, an ascent haunted by tragedy and capped by triumph. The fall, in comparison, felt brutally fast.\n\nJust weeks after a disastrous debate spurred a dramatic revolt within his own party, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the 46th President of the United States, caved on July 21 to concerns among Democrats about his dwindling re-election chances, dropping out of the contest against former President Donald Trump . The dramatic decision upends the 2024 race and sets the stage for a frantic scramble to Election Day.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden wrote in a letter posted on social media a little before 2 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon. \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\" In a separate post issued minutes later, Biden threw his support for the Democratic nomination behind Vice President Kamala Harris .\n\nOrder your copy of this issue of TIME here\n\nSince the June 27 debate against Trump deepened questions about the President's mental acuity and his ability to campaign and govern, dozens of the party's elected officials had urged Biden, 81, to withdraw. Biden stubbornly defied those calls, bristling at the uprising and determined to forge ahead. He was 100% all in, aides insisted-until suddenly he wasn't.\n\nThe historic decision makes Biden the first sitting President to cancel his re-election campaign in over half a century, when Lyndon Johnson announced in March 1968 he would not accept the Democratic Party's nomination amid disapproval over his handling of the Vietnam War. Biden's departure opens the door for Harris or another younger Democratic leader to vie for the top job against the 78-year-old Trump, depending upon how Democrats decide to replace him. And while Biden's preference still carries influence among many party loyalists, there's hardly a guarantee that a party willing to defenestrate its leader will take its cues from the President any longer.\n\nRead More : Trump and Other Leaders React to Biden Dropping Out It cannot have been easy for a man who fought most of his life for the power of the presidency to relinquish it now, in a diminished state and under difficult conditions. Biden did not want to go. Pushing through adversity had become a defining characteristic of his identity. He saw the mounting concerns about his age as another hurdle to get over.\n\nTo understand the deliberations of the President as he weighed whether to step aside, it helps to trace the path that led him here. No sooner had Biden been elected to the Senate in 1972 than he suffered the death of his wife and daughter in a car crash. Fifteen years later, his first run for the White House ended abruptly after he delivered a debate argument pilfered from a British politician. As the plagiarism scandal snowballed, Biden's inner circle-many of whom still occupy positions in his orbit today-urged him to exit. Even now, Biden has regrets that he heeded his advisers over his family, who urged him not to quit.\n\nThe experience colored Biden's contempt for both the press and his critics. He sees the elitists in Washington working against him . To bow to the calls for him to end a storied career would be tantamount to admitting he wasn't up for the task, and he believed he was. For Biden, it meant reliving 1987 all over again.\n\nBut Biden's dismissal of the Democrats' doubts as a Beltway phenomenon was inaccurate. Americans long had doubts about Biden's age. An Associated Press-NORC poll last summer found 77% of adults believed Biden was too old to govern effectively through a second term. The debate with Trump ­cemented that perception. Democrats were shaken to watch Biden stumble his way through, mixing up names and figures, losing his train of thought, failing to parry Trump's lies or give ­coherent descriptions of his own accomplishments and vision for a ­second term.\n\nUnable to push him out, many frustrated Democrats stayed silent, either too timid to declare the President could no longer lead the ticket or unsure whether Harris would fare better. But in the days and weeks that followed, a growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers and donors sounded the alarm, warning that Biden was likely to lose in November, potentially dragging down the party's candidates across the country and handing the House and Senate to Republicans.\n\nBiden insisted he would stay in the race and worked overtime to shore up pillars of support within the party, from union leaders to the Congressional Black Caucus. For a moment, it looked like Biden had quelled the dissent. Then his longtime ally Nancy Pelosi gave the ditch-Biden effort fresh momentum. \"It's up to the President to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,\" the 84-year-old former House Speaker said of her 81-year-old President , speaking as if Biden hadn't been promising to stay in the race. It was a remarkable diptych-one octogenarian determined to cling to power, even when his capabilities had flagged; another who had voluntarily surrendered it, and yet retained the clout to clip the President of the United States' campaign when he became a political liability.\n\nAs the party fretted, a string of appearances designed to showcase Biden's strength did little to quell doubts. Polls showed him trailing across battleground states. Prominent donors began abandoning him or recalibrating their investments. Discussion of his apparent cognitive decline dominated the news. Stan Greenberg, who was Bill Clinton's pollster and who had previously touted Biden's re-election chances, repeatedly petitioned the White House to take his current peril more seriously. Other party strategists were similarly concerned that the campaign was ignoring a crisis situation for both the President and the down-ballot candidates across the country whose fortunes were tethered to his. Reliably Democratic states were suddenly trending purple.\n\nThen shots rang out across a fairground in Butler, Pa., on July 13, and a gunman's attempt to kill Donald Trump sent shock waves through the country.\n\nMoments before Trump was shot , Biden had slipped into St. Edmond Catholic Church near Delaware's Rehoboth Beach boardwalk just as Saturday-­evening services were slated to start. Soon, news broke of the shooting. Biden was hustled out of the building, a black baseball hat over his shock of white hair, to receive word that his predecessor had been the target of an apparent assassination attempt.\n\nBiden sprang into action and set into motion his return to Washington. He got his national-security team on the phone and peppered aides with questions. He soon spoke with Trump, and had addressed the nation three times by the following night. His campaign halted political activities in deference to the sensitivity of the moment, even as aides acknowledged that his opponent's staring down a bullet would only intensify the MAGA movement's ardor and maybe strengthen Trump's advantage in the race.\n\nThe Trump shooting barely put the debate over Biden's age on pause. Both House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and his Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer, had told Biden directly that their caucuses harbored deep concerns about his candidacy. Pelosi, too, told Biden that his refusal to bow out jeopardized Democrats' ability to hold the Senate and retake the House.\n\nThen, during a campaign swing through Nevada, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19 , and retreated to his beach house in Rehoboth to convalesce. To a tightened circle of advisers, he blasted Democratic donors for trying to push him out of the race, stewed at the lack of credit accorded to his achievements, seethed at the disrespect from purported allies and old friends. But even close allies knew he had all but run out of road, and was beginning to mull an exit in earnest.\n\nBuoyed by the iconic images of his near assassination and show of strength in response, Trump emerged from the Republican convention ascendant. An Associated Press poll released that same day found that 7 in 10 voters thought Biden should withdraw from the race-including 65% of Democrats. Party leaders were no longer willing to muffle their panic.\n\nNow Biden's decision to bow out resets the race. Trump's campaign, tooled to mock, deride, and defeat Biden, is scrambling to rethink their approach to the electoral map. Democrats will try to capitalize on the fresh start, banking that a new candidate at the top of their ticket will energize the base. But who that might be is an open question.\n\nEven before Biden endorsed his running mate to top the new Democratic ticket, the easiest path forward for the party was to swap in Harris, who quickly announced that she would seek the nomination . Passing over the first woman and first person of color to fill the vice presidency would be politically tricky for a party that relies on those constituencies at the ballot box. Unlike other replacements, Harris would face no trouble tapping into the ticket's war chest. Biden has said he wouldn't have picked Harris for Vice President if he didn't think she would make a strong President.\n\nBut party bigwigs are eager to start fresh. For weeks, some have been drawing up and circulating notional plans for a truncated nominating contest that would culminate at the party's convention in Chicago in August. The Democrats, and America, are in uncharted territory now.\n\nWith reporting by Eric Cortellessa\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com"

      "text": "Biden Says Goodbye-With Some Warnings\n\nW hen he ran for President, Joe Biden promised to \"restore the soul\" of the country after four years of Donald Trump's divisive and chaotic leadership. Now, in a few short days, he's handing the Oval Office back to Trump-though he clearly feels like his work is unfinished.\n\nIn a 20-minute farewell address to the nation Wednesday night, Biden said he was optimistic about the promise of America. But he warned about a \"dangerous\" concentration of power in the country in the hands of a few, a \"tech-industrial complex\" that spreads false information for profit, and the need to end anonymous donations in politics. \"Today an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden didn't name the world's richest man, Elon Musk , or the other billionaires who have supported Trump's return to power . But he had a message for them nonetheless. He said that Americans stood up to the \"robber barons\" who consolidated power over a century ago. \"They didn't punish the wealthy, just made the wealthy play by the rules,\" Biden said.\n\nSitting behind the Resolute Desk for the prime time address, Biden ticked off his work in office jump-starting the U.S. economy after the pandemic, boosting American manufacturing, creating millions of jobs, and trying to steer the country's industrial sector away from fossil fuels. He said that Americans don't have to choose between protecting the environment and improving the economy. \"We are doing both.\"\n\nBiden highlighted turbulent forces that are changing American culture and politics and diluting the power of working Americans. He took aim at social media companies, like Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Meta , that have decided to allow false information to spread freely on their platforms. \"The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit,\" Biden said. \"Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power. The free press is crumbling, others are disappearing, social media has given up on fact checking.\"\n\nBiden had some prescriptions for the ailments he diagnosed. He called for 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices and said that \"dark money\" donations hidden behind campaign contributions need to be rooted out of politics. He said that the dawn of artificial intelligence could have tremendous benefits-like improving the treatment of cancer-but needs safeguards to protect our basic rights.\n\nAfter nearly half a century as a public servant, Biden wished success for his successor's administration, he said, because he wants the country to succeed. \"That's why I've held my duty to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition of power,\" Biden said, a duty that Trump did not follow when Biden came into office in the wake of Trump's unwillingness to acknowledge the 2020 election results and his repeated efforts to overturn Biden's win.\n\n\"The strength of our institutions and the character of our people matter and must endure,\" Biden said, before leaving Americans with this final task: \"It's your turn to stand guard.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Joe Biden's 'Garbage' Gaffe Should Never Have Happened\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nJoe's Gotta' Go.\n\nTalk with just about any professional Democrat in Washington or with a state party or even in a local race for utility commission, and that's the overwhelming and increasingly contemptuous verdict when it comes to President Joe Biden in the final days of a tighter-than-it-should be race for the White House. A long-known gaffe factory who has repeatedly upended the best-laid plans with a verbal outburst, Biden had largely been relegated to campaign emeritus status as his Vice President took up the nomination in July and has done her level best to stay loyal to her boss. But with Biden's latest-he sounded like he was calling Trump supporters \"garbage\"-it's increasingly clear that the instinct to humor the President is coming at a cost.\n\nIn fact, the ghosting of Biden may have to become a stiff-arm from Harris herself in these final days if her bid to block Trump is to have even odds. It will be awkward, for Harris and her staff alike, but Biden's feelings cannot supersede the political needs for Democrats at this fragile moment. The stakes are too high, and Biden too unpredictable and desperate to prove he is more than a placeholder in a gilded storage locker. In fact, Biden has the lowest approval rating of any president at this point in his presidency since George H.W. Bush was coasting toward defeat in 1992. His latest slip-up only further digs the hole he finds himself in.\n\n\"Garbage\" was not a word many of us had on our campaign BINGO cards, but twice in the final 10 days it has emerged as a potential race-changing utterance. First, a comedian who spoke at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally included in his lewd and racist routine an observation that Puerto Rico was a \"floating island of garbage.\" Trump tried to pass the comments on Sunday off as something he had no knowledge of, even though his aides had vetted the routine. The political damage was done.\n\nBut then, two days later and about a half-hour before Harris was set to deliver a masterful closing argument with the White House's south front as her backdrop, Biden was trying to buck up Latino supporters in a call from the White House residence. (Campaign events cannot take place in the West Wing, which guaranteed Biden would not be in the Oval Office while Harris spoke. Eagle-eyed watchers of Harris' address absorbed some symbolism in the darkened Oval Office behind her: a Harris administration would be a new thing, not a continuation of the current one.) As Biden spoke up his Vice President and talked down his predecessor, he touched on the uproar over Trump's comic. What was meant as a comment denouncing the comic's rhetoric toward Puerto Rico instead turned into a flub that seemed to know no limits. Biden sounded as if he was calling Trump's supporters \"garbage,\" although a crisis-mode White House distributed a transcript that suggested that the President was calling the rhetoric garbage, not the supporters who cheered it.\n\nTo wit, this is how the White House transcribed the comment: \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's-his-his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.\" Trump allies, summoning every bit of performative outrage, claim that the White House clean-up is meant to mask that what Biden actually said was \"his supporters\"-no apostrophe. It's impossible to say what Biden exactly meant in the moment although given his half-century of public life, it was probably more a stutter and stammer than slander.\n\nEven so, that's not a place where Harris wanted to be. A day after an uplifting and unifying speech just off the White House grounds and before an epic crowd, Harris risked her pledge to work for all Americans and be the antithesis of Trump seeming hollow. And her campaign team knew it. On Wednesday, she told reporters traveling with her from Andrews Air Force Base that Biden had \"clarified\" his comment, but distanced herself from her boss more strongly than ever before: \"Let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.\"\n\nIt did little to quiet the chaos, with Trump donning a sanitary worker's vest and riding in a garbage truck at a campaign stop in Wisconsin later that day. In a way, Biden's attempt to help actually muted the real \"garbage\" remark and injected a late-breaking messaging misstep that should have never come up.\n\nDemocrats have long tolerated Biden's total lack of verbal discipline. As a Senator, he was a guaranteed gaffe-a-day on the Hill, often contradicting party Leadership, preempting his colleagues' long-laid plans, and sabotaging his fellow Democrats in the White House. His first bid for the White House ended in a plagiarism scandal, his second began with comments that came off as disparaging Barack Obama, who would later pick Biden as his steady-handed global ambassador. As Vice President, Biden was a string of unforced errors, most notably at a bill signing for the law now known as Obamacare where he was caught on a hot-mic deploying vulgar language.\n\nBiden's allies have tried with varying degrees of success to make such unscripted moments part of the Biden brand, an authenticity that is often lacking. The spin made him into a laughable Uncle Joe , a cartoon who likes aviator sunglasses and ice cream. But the front lasted only so long, and a disastrous debate against Trump in June set in motion weeks of recrimination about 81-year-old Biden's ability to win, let alone serve another four years. Eventually , Biden recognized the realities, endorsed Harris as his heir, and nursed his wounded ego. Biden's loose tongue eventually proved his undoing.\n\nBut Biden still has the top job in geopolitics, and nominally still is the head of the Democratic Party. He delivered the biggest investment in green tech in U.S. history, helped dig the global economy out of a recession, and passed the infrastructure bill Trump never could . The problem is this: no one has the heart to tell him his presidency is coasting in lame-duck status with every passing week, especially with an absentee Congress looking at its own re-election bids. By the time the Democrats assembled in Chicago to officially nominate Harris, Biden's presence was the awkward relative who had to be invited to the wedding but no one wanted to sit next to. His 52-minute speech seemed never-ending as delegates shifted between respectful and restless. \"It was sad to watch him. He didn't realize how everyone else had already turned the page,\" says a former Biden aide who was there. \"No one had the courage or the heart to tell him that the crowd was not there for him.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Biden has been itching to get out on the road, his orbit says. He still thinks he alone has the decoder for white, working-class voters who have been tepid on Democrats and even more lukewarm on Harris, who would make history as the first woman and second person of color elected to the presidency. Biden keeps asking his staffers to check with the Harris campaign-which took over Biden's own offices in Wilmington as a matter of efficient take-over-about where he could be helpful.\n\nAnd with respectful consistency, Wilmington has been telling the White House a steady message: We'll let you know . It's an especially awkward brush-off , especially since so many members of the Harris high command were initially hired as Biden's operatives. Middle-Class Joe is going to have to stay Second-String Joe in this final inning, no matter how steamed both camps are at the moment.\n\nBiden's braintrust insists they get it, even if their longtime boss is slower to see it. They see a friend a few steps off his best game, and at its peak was never flawless. His \"garbage\" gaffe was only the latest such blunder. During a visit to New Hampshire last week, saying of Trump, \"We got to lock him up,\" before quickly adding, \"Politically lock him up. Lock him out.\" It was catnip for conservatives who believe Trump's claims that Biden weaponized the justice system against him.\n\nThen, on Friday, Biden seemed to suggest former Rep. Gabby Giffords was dead. She is not, having survived an assassination attempt and still running the vanguard anti-gun violence group in the country that bears her name.\n\nIf any of these missteps were stand-alone events, it would be reasonable to chalk them up as a tired man showing his age. But it's been like this for a long while, even if Biden hasn't accepted it. Biden thinks the elites and the press are hyper-focused on his gaffes, and let those made by Trump and others slide. To the ever-thin-skinned Biden, he's getting bullied again despite his good intentions.\n\nSo, heading into the final weekend before Election Day, a sidelined and chastened President is going to have to ride the bench and let Harris land the massive machine she inherited from him. For his part, Biden plans a trip Friday to visit with union members in Philadelphia, something of a second homebase for the Bidens across the river from Delaware. That event, however, is tellingly an official White House function, not a Harris campaign rally. Biden just doesn't seem to understand a maxim of all performative endeavors, including politics: the greatest know when to cede the stage.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

You can also read the transcript of the interview here and buy a copy of the issue here\n\nPresident Joe Biden sat down for an interview with TIME about America's role in the world and his foreign policy agenda.\n\nBelow is a review of Biden's statements from the interview. TIME has also published the transcript of the conversation.\n\nWhat Biden Said : \"The Russian military has been decimated. You don't write about that. It's been freaking decimated.\"\n\nThe Facts: This is a fair assessment, according to a Reuters report on a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment provided to Congress. The intelligence determined that Russia had 360,000 active military personnel when it invaded Ukraine in February of 2022. By December of last year, 315,000 Russian troops had been either killed or injured in the war-a reduction in troop strength by 87%.\n\nWhat Biden Said: \"We spent a lot of money in Ukraine, but Europe has spent more money than the United States has, collectively.\"\n\nThe Facts : The European Union has provided over $107 billion dollars in financial, military, humanitarian, and refugee assistance since the war in Ukraine began, as of April 24. Comparatively, Congress has authorized the United States to provide up to $175 billion to support Ukraine, and has provided the country approximately $81 billion since the Russian invasion, according to the White House.\n\nWhat Biden Said : I spent a month in Ukraine when I was a Senator and Vice President.\n\nThe Facts : Biden's trips to Ukraine include six he made as Vice President-more than any previous President or Vice President. He was also involved in Ukraine during his 36 years as a US Senator. He sponsored or co-sponsored 39 pieces of legislation in support of Ukraine, and worked on issues involving Ukraine as a longtime member of the Foreign Relations Committee, including 12 years as chairman or ranking member.\n\nWhat Biden Said : \"Japan [is] devoting 3% of its GDP to defense...\"\n\nThe Facts : Japan aims to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by 2027, according to a statement by Prime Minister Kishida  Fumio .  From 1960 to 2022 , Japan's defense spending was 1% of GDP or lower.\n\nWhat Biden Said : \"I put together a Quad that never existed before.\"\n\nThe Facts : The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, known as the Quad, is a partnership between the US, Japan, Australia and India that began in 2004, following the Indian ocean tsunami. The group was formalized by then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2007, but was inactive until reforming in 2017. The Quad's first in-person summit  was held at the White House in Sept. 2021, during Biden's first year as President.\n\nWhat Biden Said : \"Wage increases have exceeded what the cost of inflation...\"\n\nThe Facts : New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows hourly wage growth topping inflation for the past 12 months. In April, nominal hourly earnings were up 3.9% from a year ago; inflation held at 3.4%. But cumulative inflation has outpaced wage growth for most of the Biden presidency.\n\nWhat Biden Said : \"I remember when I was heading to Taiwan, excuse me, to South Korea, to reclaim the chips industry that we had gotten $865 billion in private-sector investment, private-sector investments since I've been in. Name me a president who's done that.\"\n\nThe Facts: The White House announced an $866 billion private-sector investment in May, not when Biden went to South Korea in 2022. The funding was also meant for initiatives across clean energy and manufacturing industries, and is not limited to just the chips industry.\n\nWhat Biden Said: \"There are going to be a billion people in Africa in the next several years.\"\n\nThe Facts : Africa's total population already exceeds one billion people-an estimated 1.4 billion people live on the continent. That number is expected to reach nearly 2.5 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations .\n\nWhat Biden Said: \"I mean, that line that Macron used, and it says that...I was making notes for this. It said, Macron, they know the experience of brain death unlike anytime. Because lack of US leadership, we should reassess the reality of NATO in light of the lack of US leadership.\"\n\nThe Facts: Biden appears to be referencing what French President Emmanuel Macron said in a October 2019 interview with The Economist , in which he warned that European countries could no longer rely on the United States to come to the defense of NATO allies. \"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,\" he said, adding that the alliance \"only works if the guarantor of last resort functions as such. I'd argue that we should reassess the reality of what NATO is in the light of the commitment of the United States.\"\n\nCorrection, June 4\n\nThe original version of this story incorrectly described one definition of \"decimate\" as being \"reduce to one-tenth.\" It means to reduce by one-tenth. The relevant sentence has been removed.\n\nCorrection, June 5\n\nThe original version of this story misstated the assistance the U.S. has provided to Ukraine since the Russian invasion. It has provided approximately $81 billion, according to the White House, not $175 billion, which is how much Congress has authorized in aid to Ukraine and allied nations.\n\nWrite to Simmone Shah at simmone.shah@time.com and Julia Zorthian at julia.zorthian@time.com"

      "text": "We were right: New books expose truth about Biden's failing health. I'm furious. | Opinion\n\nFor months in early 2024, conservatives like myself tried to sound the alarm on President Joe Biden 's declining physical and mental health. It was obvious that he was unwell.\n\nYet, Democrats and much of the legacy news media ignored that reality and even attacked those of us who were willing to speak the truth. They claimed we were fabricating tales and spreading baseless conspiracy theories.\n\nNow, the narrative has changed dramatically. Journalists are publishing books and news articles detailing not only Biden's poor health but also an orchestrated cover-up inside the White House . According to one of the books, even one of Biden's closest former aides now admits that the commander in chief was \"out of it\" last year as he attempted to run for reelection.\n\nThis is one of the biggest scandals of my adult life. Now we know that Biden's inner circle deliberately misled the American people in an election year about the incumbent president's ability to serve a second term.\n\nWe also know that journalists were far too passive, at best, in reporting revelations that Americans needed to know before the election.\n\nPolitico reported last week that at least four books will be published in the next few weeks that provide new details about Biden's failing health and the conspiracy to cover it up.\n\nOne of those books, \" Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House ,\" by NBC News' Jonathan Allen and The Hill's Amie Parnes, includes incredible details about Biden's poor health while he was still in office.\n\nThe authors report that Democratic leaders were worried that Biden could not win another election and had \"hush-hush talks\" discussing his potential withdrawal from the race as early as 2023.\n\nBiden did withdraw, but not until July 2024 , after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump .\n\nThe most damning part of \"Fight\" is the revelation that Vice President Kamala Harris ' aides were so concerned about the president's health that they \"strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office.\" The authors report that Jamal Simmons, the vice president's communications director, drew up a \"death-pool roster\" of federal judges who could swear in Harris as president if Biden died.\n\nIn \" Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History ,\" author Chris Whipple details Biden's serious mental and physical decline.\n\n\"I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden's final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story,\" Whipple told Politico .\n\nAfter extensive reporting, Whipple, a former \"60 Minutes\" producer, came to the conclusion that Democrats were in deep denial about Biden's condition: \"I happen to think that to call it a 'cover-up' is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden's inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.\"\n\nRon Klain, a longtime aide to Biden and his former White House chief of staff, helped the president prepare for his fateful debate with Trump last year. Klain told Whipple that Biden \"didn't know what Trump had been saying and couldn't grasp what the back and forth was.\"\n\nKlain also described how Biden \"didn't really understand what his argument was on inflation\" and \"had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job.\"\n\nBiden didn't just run for reelection, quit and pass the torch to Harris. He was the sitting president, who was in serious decline and was surrounded by people who knew it but stayed silent.\n\nA Washington Post review of \"Fight\" notes, \"So much fresh material, so many bruised egos, so many scores to settle. ... Every one of them saw the wreck coming, of course, in the instant the train lurched out of the station, but no one would listen. Now, at long last, they can tell it all.\"\n\nBut Americans deserved to be told the truth at least a year ago, not months after the 2024 election. The fact that they weren't is a scandal not only for Democrats but much of the legacy media as well.\n\nDemocratic insiders knew that concerns about the president's ability to continue serving were serious. Journalists who covered the president had ample evidence to suggest those concerns were valid.\n\nOnly now, a year too late, are they finally telling us the truth.\n\nNicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

      "text": "In exclusive sit-down, Biden reveals his biggest regret and the compliment Trump gave him\n\nWASHINGTON ― President Joe Biden, both reflective and defensive as he discussed his legacy, told USA TODAY he believes he could have won his reelection bid - but isn't sure he would have had the vigor to complete four more years in the Oval Office.\n\n\"So far, so good,\" he said. \"But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?\"\n\nIn an exit interview about policy, politics and family, the president also said he hasn't decided whether to take one more momentous action before he leaves office in two weeks: preemptive pardons, something only three presidents have done before.\n\nA fire crackled in the fireplace on a cold Sunday afternoon, a massive portrait of FDR hanging above the mantle. Sitting at the historic Resolute desk, his presidential hero in his line of sight, the 46th president seemed determined to define his own record in office, and he discussed what he might do in his final days.\n\nBiden said he is considering preemptive pardons for public figures such as former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney and former senior health official Dr. Anthony Fauci who have been threatened with investigation and prosecution by incoming president Donald Trump.\n\nWhen Biden met with Trump in the Oval Office a week after the November election, he urged the president-elect not to go forward with threats to target those who have criticized him or, in Cheney's case, helped lead efforts to impeach him.\n\n\"I tried to make clear that there was no need, and it was counterintuitive for his interest to go back and try to settle scores,\" Biden said. How did Trump respond? \"He didn't say, 'No, I'm going to ...' You know. He didn't reinforce it. He just basically listened.\"\n\nBiden said his decision would be based \"a little bit\" on whom Trump names to top administration roles. The president-elect has chosen former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi as his nominee to head the Justice Department and firebrand loyalist Kash Patel to head the FBI.\n\nIt has been more than a half-century since Joseph Robinette Biden, a garrulous 28-year-old lawyer, won his first election by ousting a Republican incumbent for a seat on the New Castle County Council in Delaware. Now, at 82 and after 35 years in the U.S. Senate, eight years as vice president and four as president, he clearly isn't looking forward to leaving his final elective office.\n\n\"It is a pretty historic time, isn't it?\" he said as he greeted a reporter with a grin, hours before a monster snowstorm was set to pound the capital. \"I mean, who would've - as my brother kids - who would've thunk it?\"\n\nRead the transcript of USA TODAY's full interview with President Joe Biden here .\n\nConcerns about the age and acuity of America's oldest president flared with his faltering performance in a televised debate with Trump in June. Democratic leaders who feared Trump would trounce Biden, among them former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, urged him to withdraw from the race, an unprecedented step so late in the campaign.\n\nAfter he reluctantly pulled out in July, Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee, then lost in November.\n\nCould he have won?\n\n\"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,\" Biden said, adding he based that view on polling he had reviewed. He expressed no such confidence when asked whether he had the vigor to serve another four years in office, though. \"I don't know,\" he replied.\n\nTo be sure, many analysts doubt Biden could have won another term from voters who were gloomy about inflation and eager for change. What's more, his shuffling gait and verbal miscues had raised questions about his fitness for office.\n\nThrough an interview that stretched for nearly an hour, Biden was engaged and loquacious, though at times he spoke so softly that it was difficult to hear him. On his desk were index cards that seemed to have talking points and statistics, but he glanced at them only once, at the end, as if to make sure he had mentioned the items most important to him.\n\nHe became most animated, his voice rising, when he described the efforts of his son Hunter to stay sober - speaking of him not as someone whose troubles had embarrassed the president but as a fighter who had made his father proud.\n\nHe acknowledged his age was an issue.\n\n\"I had no intention of running after Beau died - for real, not a joke,\" Biden said, referring to the death of his elder son in 2015 of brain cancer. That family tragedy at what seemed to be the end of his political career was a bookend to the one at its beginning, when his first wife and baby daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash.\n\nThen, in 2020, \"when Trump was running again for reelection, I really thought I had the best chance of beating him. But I also wasn't looking to be president when I was 85 years old, 86 years old. And so I did talk about passing the baton\" to the next generation of Democratic leaders, a phrase many in his party took to mean he wasn't likely to seek a second term.\n\n\"But I don't know,\" he said, returning to the question about whether he could have fulfilled the world's hardest job for another four years. \"Who the hell knows?\"\n\nHis long experience has been an asset in handling foreign affairs , Biden said.\n\n\"I think the only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time. And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests,\" he said. He had chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee even before serving two terms as vice president. \"And so I think it helped me navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"\n\nBiden said he reestablished alliances that Trump had frayed during his first term and managed an \"inflection point\" in history. As he leaves office, no American troops are deployed in wars abroad, though the United States is deeply involved in the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"The world's really getting small, man. Really getting smaller and smaller,\" he said, with the United States as its crucial leader. That view is at odds with Trump's call for \"America First,\" with a national government less concerned about its global role. \"What affects what happens in Japan is profoundly affected what happens in Ukraine. What happens in Zambia is going to affect what the hell happens in the Gulf.\"\n\nInterviews like this one have been rare in Biden's tenure. He has held fewer news conferences and individual sessions with reporters than any president since at least Ronald Reagan. USA TODAY is the only print organization scheduled to sit down with him as he leaves office.\n\nThat the White House agreed to this interview is a sign that, while Biden is still in a position to command the world's attention, he wants to make the case that he has forged a robust and positive legacy. The underlying message: The impact of his presidency cannot be fairly judged primarily by controversies over his health, his on-again-off-again presidential bid and his decision to grant a sweeping pardon for his son.\n\n\"I hope that history says that I came in and I had a plan how to restore the economy and reestablish America's leadership in the world,\" Biden said. \"That was my hope. I mean, you know, who knows? And I hope it records that I did it with honesty and integrity, that I said what was on my mind.\"\n\nSigns that his time was short were all around. The press room was almost empty, a member of the small pool of journalists asleep in a chair in the briefing room. White House staffers were giving quiet tours of the West Wing to family and friends while they still could, peeking into the Roosevelt Room and the Cabinet Room.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Biden would go to the East Room to sign the Social Security Fairness Act, expanding benefits for millions of retirees and one of his last pieces of legislation.\n\nOn the economy, Biden defended the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and other legislative programs enacted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as crucial to boosting growth and jobs, though the massive spending has been criticized for also fueling inflation. \"We spent money doing it. But the fact is that we had a soft landing, no recession,\" he said. Most economists had predicted a recession was inevitable.\n\n\"How in the hell in a changed world can America lead the world without having the finest infrastructure in the world, without having the best education system in the world, without being in a position where it has the best health care system in the world? I mean, they're just things that I thought were necessary.\"\n\nThe higher costs of groceries and rent continue to create kitchen-table problems for millions of Americans, although the rate of inflation has tempered. As Biden prepares to depart, the unemployment rate is near its historic lows, stock markets have surged and the economy is growing.\n\nIn public, Trump has decried the state of the nation as \"a disaster\" and \"a mess.\" But at their private meeting, Trump praised him, Biden said. \"He was very complimentary about some of the economic things I had done. And he talked about - he thought I was leaving with a good record.\"\n\nThe two men will be forever intertwined in history, Trump's two terms sandwiching Biden's one. They have offered Americans starkly different perspectives on the most fundamental issues, including the role of democratic institutions and the importance of political norms.\n\nEventually, one of them may be seen as a signal of the country's future course, the other as a political aberration.\n\nBiden warned that Trump risked upending the economic good times if he enacts some of the policies he advocates.\n\n\"I think if he moves on the tax cuts of $5 trillion, I think if he moves on dealing with increasing tariffs across the board, all they are is increasing costs of consumers in America. And if he decides to do away with some of the major programs, whether it's dealing with the rescue plan or infrastructure or the climate law, I think he's just going to, you know, hurt himself, hurt the economy.\"\n\nBiden's predecessor-turned-successor has vowed to undo much of his legacy. Biden has tried to make that as difficult as possible, including by spending billions of dollars from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in red states and districts - projects now lauded by some of the Republican members of Congress who represent them.\n\n\"It's the way to lock in a changed economic policy,\" Biden said. He hopes.\n\nRegrets? He has a few.\n\nHis biggest disappointment, Biden said, was his failure to effectively counter misinformation, including that from Trump. He said that challenge reflects the revolution in how Americans get their news, and whom they trust to tell it.\n\n\"Because of the way, nature, the nature of the way information is shared now, there are no editors out there to say 'That's simply not true,'\" Biden said. He mentioned Trump's rhetoric about the threat from migrants, though in doing so he apparently conflated two recent attacks by Army veterans involving trucks, one in New Orleans and the other in Las Vegas.\n\n\"The guy in Las Vegas is a guy, is a veteran, born and raised in America,\" Biden said. \"And yet the president comes along, soon to be president again, come along and says: 'It's clear. It's an invasion from the south. All these immigrants are causing all this problem.' ... And I'll bet you there's 70% of people out there that read that and believe it. How do you deal with that?\"\n\nIn Las Vegas, the man behind the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel was reportedly a Trump supporter, leaving writings calling it a \"wake up call\" and saying the United States was \"terminally ill and headed toward collapse.\"\n\nIn New Orleans, the man who drove a truck into a crowd in the French Quarter was a Texas-born American who had been radicalized by the Islamic State group, or ISIS.\n\n\"When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true,\" Trump had posted on Truth Social after the New Orleans attack.\n\nBiden also expressed frustration about how long it took to get shovels in the ground for the infrastructure projects. \"Historians will talk about (how) great the impact was, but it didn't (have) any immediate impact on people's lives,\" he said. \"I think we would've been a hell of a lot better off had we been able to go much harder at getting some of these projects in the ground quicker.\n\n\"And so I don't think I've been very good at - \" He paused.\n\nTaking credit?\n\n\"Or not so much me, but establish that the government did this for you.\"\n\nSusan Page is the Washington Bureau chief of USA TODAY.

      "text": "'It's a beautiful day': Joe Biden departs White House for final time as president\n\nWASHINGTON - And just like that, it was over.\n\nJoe Biden departed the White House for the final time as president on Monday, ending a half-century career in politics that took him from a county council seat in Delaware to the United States Senate, the vice presidency, and ultimately, the highest elected office in the land.\n\nA long motorcade of black limousines and SUVs rolled down the driveway of the White House North Lawn at 10:39 a.m., through the iron gates surrounding the presidential mansion and turned toward the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn the back seat of the presidential limo was Biden, taking his last ride as leader of the free world. Beside him, President-elect Donald Trump , who would take the oath of office and assume the presidency at noon.\n\nFour years ago, Biden made the 10-minute drive to the Capitol without his predecessor.\n\nTrump, bitter over his loss to Biden and in denial about his defeat, departed the White House the morning of the inauguration aboard the presidential helicopter. He refused to participate in the ceremonies for the man who would replace him, as previous outgoing presidents have done for decades. He was i n Palm Beach, Florida, when Biden's swearing-in ceremony began.\n\nBiden, however, a believer in traditions and institutions, argued that Americans want to see the peaceful transfer of power. So on Monday, he rode to the Capitol with Trump, whose two nonconsecutive terms will bookend Biden's single, four-year term as president.\n\nAsked by reporters before his departure how he felt, Biden responded: \"Good. It's a beautiful day.\"\n\nThe changing of the guard started early Monday when Biden and first lady Jill Biden greeted Trump and his wife, Melania Trump , at the White House for a ceremonial tea.\n\n\"Welcome home,\" Biden said to Trump as he stepped out of an SUV at the White House North Portico.\n\nThe Trumps walked up the steps of the White House toward its front entrance hand in hand.\n\nMelania Trump arrived at the White House at the start of her husband's first term carrying a Tiffany Blue box that she presented to Barack and Michelle Obama. She was empty-handed on Monday.\n\nAlso notably absent were the hugs and European kisses the Obamas welcomed their replacements with as they presented themselves at the North Portico. While the handoff from the Obamas was strikingly warm, the couples' handshake with the Bidens was decidedly formal.\n\nTrump fiddled with the button on his overcoat but finally left it unbuttoned as the couples posed for photos. Melania Trump put her hand on her head to keep her hat down as a gust of wind threatened to knock if off as all four headed inside the presidential mansion.\n\nAtop the White House, the American flag flew at hal f -staff i n honor of former President Jimmy Carter , who died last Dec. 29. Trump had protested that the flag ritual would coincide with his inauguration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris ' exit from her Naval Observatory residence was a lower-key affair. She and second gentleman Doug Emhoff said their public goodbyes on Thursday as Harris continued the vice presidential tradition of signing the desk in her Ceremonial Office. Staff and alumni of Harris' operation stuffed themselves into the ornate room.\n\nEvery vice president has used the office, with one exception, since 1960 . It will become JD Vance's workplace next.\n\nHarris lost the 2024 election to Trump after taking over as the Democratic nominee from Biden. Her political future is unclear. She is considering a run for California governor in 2026.\n\n\"It is not my nature to go quietly into the night,\" she said with a laugh at her desk signing. \"So don't worry about that.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said the former California attorney general and U.S. senator would decide what comes next in her career after the inauguration. She and Emhoff will fly to Los Angeles on Monday. The couple own a home in Brentwood, which had been under evacuation orders amidst the wildfires . California will be their primary residence.\n\nFollowing Trump's inauguration , the Bidens and the Trumps walked out of the Capitol's East Front and headed to a waiting Blackhawk military helicopter.\n\nAfter handshakes and farewells, the Bidens boarded the chopper for the short flight to Joint Base Andrews in suburban Maryland, where the now-former president spoke to a cheering crowd of his former staffers.\n\n\"It has been the honor of my life to serve as your president,\" he said.\n\nHe thanked his team \"for the sacrifices you've made\" and \"for being part of this journey.\"\n\n\"Never, never, never give up,\" he said.\n\nBiden left the stage amid chants of \"Thank you, Joe!\" and walked to a waiting blue-and-white 747. He quickly climbed the steps and, just before stepping through the door of the plane, turned one last time and waved goodbye.\n\nThe plane then rolled down the runway and lifted off at 1:56 p.m., carrying Biden - now a private citizen - to a vacation in California.\n\nMichael Collins and Francesca Chambers cover the White House.

      "text": "From everyman to family man: The essence of Delaware's Joe Biden, our 46th US president\n\nJoe Biden is ending more than five decades of political service with history-making bookends - he was the youngest ever elected to the U.S. Senate in modern times and is now the oldest to leave the country's highest office.\n\nIt's been a career fueled by ambition, resiliency, and idealism and highlighted by tragedy, disappointments and triumph. And while he is not leaving the office of the presidency the way he envisioned, Delaware - Biden's home for more than 70 years - has always been his touchstone. As vice president and president, he brought the world to his home state.\n\nBiden told The News Journal in 1976 that he was not sure if he ever wanted to live in the White House.\n\nTrue to his word, he has returned to Delaware so often during his one-term presidency that locals have dubbed the traffic backups created by his motorcade as \"Joe Jams.\"\n\nAnd Biden's encounters with the locals are uniquely Delaware.\n\n\"It's like Elvis in Memphis. Everyone has a Biden story if they've lived here long enough,\" said Jude Baseden, who resides in north Wilmington.\n\nWilmington's Bill Pegram had his Biden moment in 2019 when he spotted the then-former vice president leaving a Greenville coffee shop with a cup of joe, stopping his truck in the middle of the parking lot to shake his hand.When Biden learned Pegram's father, Richard, was a World War II veteran, he told Pegram to get his then-95-year-old father on the phone.\n\n\"He thanked him for his service and made my father's day,\" Pegram recalled. \"Politics aside, anyone who would call my dad and thank him like that - I have to give a little appreciation to him.\"\n\nBiden always told the press and anyone who listened that he wanted to be known as \"just plain Joe.\"\n\nA former assistant public defender, Biden was a criminal lawyer with the Wilmington law firm of Aerenson and Balick in 1971 when he decided as a New Castle County councilman to run for the U.S. Senate seat against incumbent Sen. J. Caleb Boggs.\n\nBiden was a county councilman for only 16 months. At the time, News Journal columnist Al Cartwright said Boggs, who had been elected statewide to public office since 1946 - three times as a U.S. representative, twice as governor, and twice as U.S. senator - had shoes older than Biden.\n\nThe 29-year-old Biden's youth and stunning upset over a veteran lawmaker who seemed unbeatable propelled him into the spotlight as a national political figure where he would remain for 52 years.\n\nThe senator \"ran as Joe Biden and was elected as Joe Biden and he signs his name Joe Biden,\" said Wes Barthelmes, Biden's administrative assistant, who had once worked for the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in February 1973.\n\n\"Don't keep looking for mystique. There's no mystique. He's just just a hard-working senator,\" Barthelmes would later say.\n\nThe \"just Joe\" theme would be repeated at a March 1973 chicken-and-covered dish dinner for Sussex County Democrats in Wesley United Methodist Church hall.\n\nBiden became emotional and wept as he stood on the same stage where he first announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate to Sussex County voters a year earlier. The last time he was there, Biden was with his wife, Neilia, who had died three months earlier in an automobile accident.\n\n\"I very seldom have trouble speaking, as you know, but this is where we started,\" he said as his voice trembled.\n\nSeveral in the audience cried openly as Biden said, \"My wife had a great deal of respect for you all. I didn't want to come tonight. ... I've never done this [cry] in public ....\" Biden regained his composure, continued the speech, and told the audience he was still \"Joe Biden, not Senator Biden.\"\n\nHe received a standing ovation and perhaps for the first time realized he could find solace and strength in shared grief.\n\nBiden's ability to work a rope line, pump up a crowd, or connect with a random voter on the street has always been among his superpowers.\n\nHe may live in million-dollar houses in Greenville and Rehoboth Beach that many will never be able to afford, but he still can come across as someone most can relate to on a middle-class level.\n\nAs one News Journal article noted in 1986, \"He is a man who lives in a mansion on the edge of Chateau Country, but who treats his family to pizza after a long day in Washington and takes guests out to lunch at a sub shop.\" He's also the kind of guy who is genuinely wowed when his staff flies in Charcoal Pit milkshakes as a surprise treat following his Democratic National Convention speech last year.\n\nBut when it comes to voters, he looks them square with his blue eyes undistracted, trained on its target. The 6-foot former University of Delaware football player asks how you are and about your family, sometimes with both hands on your shoulders.\n\nThere's always a handshake or two. Or three. And then there's The Smile. For his entire career, he has turned on the huge grin, revealing gleaming perfect rows of white teeth, whether he's happy with a question just asked - or looking to duck one.\n\nWhen a 35-year-old Biden broke his right wrist sliding head-first into third base at a 1978 charity baseball game in Claymont, it left him in a cast up to his elbow for six weeks.\n\nFor a gregarious senator, losing his ability to use his hand-shaking arm was akin to Samson getting a buzzcut. Not to mention how it hindered his speech-giving, which sometimes seemed to be powered by arm movement. At the time, Biden conceded the broken wrist may leave him speechless.\n\nBut, of course, it did not. His ability to talk. And talk. And talk some more quickly became legendary when he landed in the U.S. Senate office he held continuously for Delaware from 1973 to 2009.\n\nAs he said at the Sussex County Democrats' Jamboree in 1988 during his heavily-anticipated return to the public eye following his brain aneurysm: \"I do miss this.\" As 1,000 cheered the start of his comeback, he added, \"It's the honest-to-God's truth. I could hardly wait to get here.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Biden's gift for gab, many have noticed during his presidency what Delawareans have known for decades: He will often tell the same stories or use the same phrases repeatedly.\n\nOne News Journal columnist in 1982 mentioned that Biden opened a recent speech by \"dragging out the Gumboro gas station joke that it seems he has been using since the Nixon administration.\"\n\nNews Journal columnist Norm Lockman wrote in 1973 that Biden sometimes \"indulged in a little self-pity that makes some people wonder about his own sincerity.\" Shortly after his wife Neilia's 1972 death, he had talked about her so frequently in speeches that people began criticizing him, particularly in Delaware (and mostly behind his back) for exploiting the tragedy, Lockman wrote.\n\n\"There are people who think I've taken advantage of the tragedy. It makes me mad, but it's understandable. I know it looks contradictory. Why should this guy who wouldn't let anyone come to her funeral turn around and, in a political context, talk about his wife and a personal relationship?\" Biden said.\n\n\"But I can't help it. I can try not to talk about it, but if it comes up, then I can't talk about Neilia without talking about Neilia. I can't help but become personal. I mean, I just can't treat her memory like some campaign worker who is gone and it's all over with.\"\n\nIn recent years, Biden has often mentioned his late son Beau in speeches and sometimes receives the same criticism.\n\nStill, his folksy homespun tales, paired with jokes and knowledge of foreign and domestic issues, were a potent combination when combined with his natural charisma and ability to connect one on one with voters.\n\nThat everyman persona would sometimes create headlines on its own, like in 1977 when two teens snatched a purse from a 41-year-old woman in Wilmington.\n\nOn his 35th birthday, Biden was nearby and heard her scream while driving home on Miller Road after dropping his children off at the movies. He raced down 27th Street, hopped out of his car, and chased the pair, dubbed \"quick little devils\" by the woman - jumping a pair of fences in the process. One of them eventually dropped the purse as the senator gained on them.\n\n\"I was really disappointed I didn't get [the thieves], but at least I got her purse,\" he told a reporter at the time.\n\nIn March 1969, Biden - then a lawyer living off Marsh Road - found and helped an injured St. Bernard in front of his office at the Farmers Bank Building. The 80-pound dog was limping from an injury to its right paw. Biden took off his belt and put it around the dog's neck as a makeshift leash.\n\nHe put the dog in his car and drove it to his home, even though he was late for court. Biden said he was a sucker for stray animals. The dog joined two cats named Foupi and Squirrel and a German shepherd named Senator at his home until the owner was found and the dog was returned to its home.\n\nBiden's dogs would gain even more headlines over the years.\n\nJude Baseden, who referenced Elvis in Memphis when describing Biden in Delaware, and two friends found Biden's lost Great Dane in 1975 when she was 12 years old in the Brandywood neighborhood in Talleyville.\n\nShe and her friends thought they would be rewarded for finding the dog known as \"Governor.\" Every day, Baseden went to the mailbox looking for a letter and a reward. A few weeks later, a large brown envelope came. Inside was a thank you letter from Biden.\n\nHe included a black-and-white glossy photo of himself. Baseden, then known as Judy, said there was no money and no reward.\n\n\"I was really mad and tore up the photo,\" now says Baseden, adding that people need to remember she was 12 at the time.\n\nHistory took some time to sink in and Baseden said she now appreciates the letter. It hangs in a frame on the wall in her Wilmington-area home.\n\nBiden's German shepherds Champ, Major and Commander lived in the White House. The elderly Champ, a good boy who also lived at the vice president's Number One Observatory Circle , died in 2021. But Major and Commander were banished from Washington for good after multiple biting incidents. The president's cat, Willow, remains.\n\nJoe Biden's mouth has always been both an asset and a liability.\n\nNews Journal columnist Lockman said Biden \"has the shortest link between his brain and his mouth of any big-time Delaware politician.\"\n\nBiden in October 1973 spoke in Chicago shortly after then-President Nixon appeared on TV in a press conference and said Nixon had done for politicians \"about what the Boston Strangler did for door-to-door salesmen.\"\n\nBack in Delaware, Biden said he received a telegram about his comments and he read the contents: \"I resent the comparison. [signed] The Boston Strangler.\"\n\nThe younger Biden could especially be a big mouth with enough bluster to fill a few Senate offices, an impression made immediately when he complained about the size of his Senate salary as a freshman lawmaker.\n\n\"I do not know about others, but I'm worth a lot more than my salary of $42,500 a year in this body,\" the 30-year-old said in July 1973. \"I'd better shut up or I'm going to lose the next election before I get a chance to run.\"\n\nBiden later said he regretted \"shooting off at the mouth.\"\n\nHe once called a former colleague a \"phony SOB\" in 1994 - Democratic Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth, for the record - and in 2022 he called Fox News's Steve Doocy a \"stupid son of a bitch\" while speaking to himself in a hot mic moment as reporters were leaving a press conference.\n\nBiden has changed over the years, however. He's softer-spoken and the loss of son Beau, whose promising political career seemed posed to track with his father's, has left a sad void.\n\nAfter the disastrous debate with former President Donald Trump in June sparked a widespread push for him to end his candidacy, the fire-breather seemed like he would struggle to blow out a birthday candle. While he still can show a flash of his old self, he has slowed down markedly.\n\nHe has also evolved on some issues.\n\nFor example, he voted for a 1994 bill co-sponsored by North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms to cut off federal funding to any school district that has programs \"encouraging or supporting homosexuality as a positive lifestyle alternative.\" But 18 years later, he would famously get out in front of President Obama and voice his support for same-sex marriage on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in a headline-making moment.\n\nOn other issues, he has not changed his stance. Biden grew up Catholic and still regularly attends Mass at St. Joseph on the Brandywine in Greenville and St. Edmond's in Rehoboth Beach, but believes in a woman's right to choose abortion.\n\nBiden's attachment to his family goes beyond the often-told tragedy of the 1972 Hockessin car accident that stole his wife Neilia and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi Christina, known as \"Amy.\" Or the 2015 cancer death of his son Beau. Or his famous weekday commutes every morning and night to Washington via Amtrak as a senator.\n\nThe Biden clan has always kept its circle tight. Joe's parents, two brothers, sister, and brother-in-law all worked on his first Senate campaign. \"We have very few close friends outside of the family,\" said his wife, Neilia, a week before her death.\n\nBiden's beloved mother, Catherine \"Jean\" Biden, frequently told her children: \"Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end. Period.\"\n\nHis younger sister, Valerie Biden Owens, has played a central role in her brother's life as an advocate, strategist and best friend. She is a frequent companion to Biden at the 5 p.m. Saturday church service at St. Joseph on the Brandywine, and the pair also sometimes meet up for meals around Wilmington at old familiar places like Mrs. Robino's in Little Italy.\n\nOwens had been her brother's campaign manager for more than five decades beginning with a high school race. She became the first woman in United States history to run a presidential campaign. In 1987, Owens was by Biden's side when he ended his first run for president after being accused of plagiarizing a speech from United Kingdom Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.\n\nWife Jill Jacobs, whom he married in 1977, has been his rock. He is so proud of his wife and her long career as an educator that he often says in speeches, \"I'm Jill Biden's husband.\"\n\nThe affection between the couple is longstanding. Joe and Jill were known to sprawl out on facing seats on the Amtrak train home from Washington when he was a senator. She would kick off her shoes and put her feet in his lap.\n\nOn his last day as vice president in 2017, Joe and Jill Biden rode an Amtrak train home to Wilmington. The next day, he showed up at an indoor track meet at Tower Hill School to watch his grandchildren.\n\nHis daughter Ashley could often be seen by his side during overseas trips as vice president and president.\n\nAnd his sons were an especially ubiquitous presence as they grew from high schoolers into college students, more able to take part in their father's fast-moving world.\n\nThat was then-20-year-old Georgetown University student Hunter Biden in 1990 attending each day of the contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nNearly 35 years later, one of the most controversial moments of Biden's presidency would be granting sweeping amnesty to Hunter - convicted of federal gun charges and also pleading guilty to federal charges of tax evasion - after promising not to pardon him. The move might have shocked the nation, but many Delawareans, long familiar with the Biden family's closeness, were hardly surprised.\n\nWhen then-22-year-old Beau Biden was graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1991, his father was there to give the commencement address. Closing his speech, which had been void of any mention of the special family connection to the day, Biden simply stated, \"Congratulations Beau,\" from behind the podium.\n\nBiden decided against delving into their relationship because it would be \"cheating the other parents on this special day,\" he told the press, before adding that he was also worried he'd embarrass Beau by \"losing it. I'm afraid if I had tried that at all, I wouldn't have been very good at it. We've come a long way together.\"\n\nInstead, he shared a quick hug and kiss with his son when Beau collected his diploma on stage before the procession continued.\n\nAfter a high-risk surgery for a life-threatening brain aneurysm in February 1988 and suffering from a serious pulmonary embolism complication, Biden stayed out of the public eye as he recovered.\n\nHis first public appearance came two months later when he sneaked into Archmere Academy's mock presidential debate to support 18-year-old Hunter's performance as the Rev. Jesse Jackson from a production booth. He was unseen by parents and participants that night. His own staff didn't know about the outing until they read about it in the newspaper.\n\nHis closeness to Delaware and his family could also be used as a political weapon.\n\nDuring his 1990 campaign against former Delaware Attorney General and Superior Court Judge M. Jane Brady, she accused Biden of being part of bureaucratic Congress and \"out of touch\" with the state at a voter forum.\n\nBut Biden earned applause from the 300-person crowd - many of whom were wearing \"Joe\" campaign stickers on their chest - when he countered by asking how he could be out of touch if he took the train home from Washington every night, lives in Delaware, shops in Delaware and sends his children to school in Delaware.\n\nHis medical setbacks in early 1988, less than five months after dropping out of his first presidential run amid the plagiarism charges, had the effect of calming the hard-charging Biden, leaving him more subdued and philosophical, even serene, as he described himself at the time.\n\nAfter recovery, he told the Washington Post he understood how he could have come off as a \"hothead.\" At the very start of his Senate career, he once rattled off terms used to describe himself, some of which came from his political enemies: \"brash,\" \"glamor boy,\" glib-tongued\" and \"arrogant\" were some of them.\n\nSometimes, those characterizations came to life in front of television cameras.\n\nJust days before he dropped out, Biden squared off with a voter questioning his aptitude.\n\nThe voter quizzed him about his law school career and Biden shot back, \"I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,\" before adding, \"I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you'd like,\" and rattling off a steady stream of his academic accomplishments.\n\nThe voter responded by saying, \"I'm not questioning your IQ. I'm just saying that with the people that we have elected to office in recent years, I think that we have to question their credentials very solidly.\"\n\nMore than four years earlier, a voter was on the receiving end of a testy exchange with Biden in front of visiting PBS cameras, this time at a town meeting on the home turf of his alma mater Archmere Academy.\n\nBiden was questioned about calling fighting forces in El Salvador \"rightists and leftists.\"\n\n\"Since you're so damn well informed, let me answer your question,\" Biden spat at his critic. The voter fought back: \"What do you mean I'm so damn well informed? You guys like it when someone isn't informed. Look, I pay your salary senator ....\"\n\nFor every angry confrontation, there are thousands of moments where Biden used his equally natural charm on voters.\n\nWhen Biden is out living his life in Delaware, he is a selfie magnet. He seems to stop for anyone, anywhere. That's why many Delawareans seem to have a selfie with Biden somewhere, whether it's in a photo folder on Facebook or framed in their home.\n\nHis genial, outgoing nature is on display during local coffee runs, but also when it matters most.\n\nSeaford-born 21-year-old U.S. Marine Michael A. \"Moke\" Hastings was killed in a bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 240 other U.S. military personnel 35 years ago when Biden was a senator.\n\nIn a News Journal letter to the editor published more than a year after the bombing, the Hastings family wrote about the help Biden and his staff gave in the aftermath of his death. They noted other politicians had called and offered long-term help, but never left a phone number. Biden left several to make sure they could always reach him.\n\n\"Sen. Biden took the time to come to Seaford for our son's funeral, but it didn't stop there,\" they wrote. \"He has called several times since to ask how we were doing. A friend in need is a friend, indeed, and we'll never forget his acts of kindness.\"\n\nBiden's ability to help others during times of grief can be traced back to 1972 when about 650 people attended the December memorial service at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church off Concord Pike in Talleyville for his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi. Biden showed up unexpectedly and comforted mourners.\n\nMore than 40 years later, he again would do the same for the thousands who waited hours in a more than two-block-long procession at Wilmington's St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church to pay their respects to Neilia and Joe's oldest son, Beau Biden, who died of cancer in 2015 at age 46.\n\nThe plagiarism kerfuffle during his first presidential campaign in 1987 left Biden somewhat abashed after he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"It's a humbling experience,\" he said several months later. \"But I deserve to be humbled. ... I made serious mistakes and I made stupid mistakes.\"\n\nIt also opened the floodgates to national ridicule for Biden. And local opponents thought it would stick, finally giving them an angle at taking down the swaggering wunderkind. It never did.\n\nAt the time, his 1984 senate challenger John Burris said, \"His magic, his invisible shield has been pulled away ... that almost invisible bubble has been popped. [The credibility question] didn't stick in 1984. Next time around it will.\"\n\nEven in hindsight, you can't fault them for believing the future U.S. president could have been mortally wounded politically. He was a walking, talking punchline - pantsed on the national stage.\n\nLate-night talk show hosts fed off on the scandal, as they continued to do after he ascended to the vice presidency and presidency, more focused on his uncanny ability to talk his way into gaffes.\n\nOn \"The Tonight Show,\" Johnny Carson joked, \"Joe Biden called his staff together and said the whole plagiarism issue is nothing to worry about. There's nothing to fear, but fear itself, he said.\"\n\nDavid Letterman also chimed in on \"Late Night,\" joking that Biden's new campaign slogan was \"Kennedy '68.\"\n\nEven two years later, a 1990 episode of the family sitcom \"Growing Pains\" starring Alan Thicke and Kirk Cameron took a jab. A character sold his sister's term papers to fellow students at school. When the principal found out, he told their parents and before reading one of the copied papers, he said, \"And just listen to this one that Joey Biden turned in!\"\n\nNewsweek even used his name as a synonym for plagiarism - \"committing a Biden.\"\n\nAs someone as prideful as Biden - \"I give you my word as a Biden,\" as he often says - seeing his name mutate into a cause for mockery in front of the world must have been jarring; a real shot to his healthily-sized ego. But for a man sometimes known for his braggadocio, he didn't let it show for long.\n\nWhen reporters asked if he was politically hurt, Biden responded, \"My feeling is not at all,\" before launching into one of his famous anecdotes.\n\nHe recalled entering the men's room of an Italian restaurant a month after his campaign ended in disaster and was met with a standing ovation when he left.\n\n\"You can't be a major leader without taking some very hard knocks,\" he declared.\n\nOne of the hardest for President Biden came during a late July weekend this past summer at his Rehoboth Beach home as he grappled with the idea that polls, donors, and voters had lost confidence in the nominee and felt that at age 81, Biden was too old to win a second term.\n\nOn July 20, Judge Jane Roth, the wife of Biden's longtime Delaware colleague, the late Sen. Bill Roth, shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal that Biden's situation seemed to mirror her husband's heart-breaking reelection loss in 2000 to Tom Carper.\n\n\"I have witnessed the grief of a politician, one with a long record of significant accomplishments when he loses the support of the people,\" Judge Roth wrote in an opinion piece. \"Bill thought he would win despite his age and his health problems. The reality was that the voters wanted a younger representative with new ideas and new energy. For Bill, it was a very sad ending to his 30 years in the Senate. I think he never got over it. As his spouse, I believe he would have been happier if he had bowed out. His remaining years would not have been touched with a sense of loss but instead with one of accomplishment.\"\n\nOne day later, on July 21, Biden once again made political history when he decided to bow out of the race.\n\nHow Biden will be remembered remains to be seen.\n\nIn the closing days of his administration last month, he spoke of his legacy at a holiday reception at the White House in broad strokes.\n\n\"The one thing I always believed about public service, especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, 'Have we left the country in better shape than we found it?'\" he said. \"Today I can say with every fiber of my being and all my heart that the answer to that question is a resounding yes.\"\n\nThat reflective moment came more than 51 years after he spoke about legacy at a Hotel du Pont dinner honoring the man Biden had just beat for the senate seat: his two-term Republican predecessor and former Delaware Gov. J. Caleb Boggs.\n\nIn the speech, a young Biden laid out what he hoped for himself when his time as a public servant came to an end, without knowing it would be five decades later when he walked out of the White House for the last time as our nation's 46th president.\n\n\"I hope I will live to have what Cale Boggs has today: an unblemished reputation for integrity.\"\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com or 302-324-2861 and follow her on X (Twitter) @pattytalorico .

      "text": "Farewell and welcome home, Joe: A recap of Biden's decades in politics and in Delaware\n\nWhile so much of the world knows Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States, many in Delaware have always known the state's longtime political leader as just Joe.\n\nIt's what makes Biden's looming departure from the White House feel so momentous - it will mark the first time in over half a century that Biden hasn't been in politics.\n\nTake a journey through Biden's time in office, how he got here and what you can expect as Delaware's president gets ready to return to the place he calls home.\n\nJoe Biden is ending more than five decades of political service with history-making bookends - he was the youngest ever elected to the U.S. Senate in modern times and is now the oldest to leave the country's highest office.\n\nIt's been a career fueled by ambition, resiliency, and idealism and highlighted by tragedy, disappointments and triumph. And while he is not leaving the office of the presidency the way he envisioned, Delaware - Biden's home for more than 70 years - has always been his touchstone.\n\nAs vice president and president, he brought the world to his home state.\n\nTake a closer look at the moments and decisions that defined Biden's career and political tenure.\n\nWhere in the world could Biden's presidential library end up?\n\nFor many, the short answer (and hope) is Delaware - even the president says so.\n\nIdeas continue to range. Existing structures meet sprawling institutions, from Wilmington's Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse, to Winterthur, Hagley or even the Gibraltar mansion. And down in Dover, one couldn't forget the state's only HBCU: Delaware State University.\n\nRead the full story here and then hear from Biden himself about where he's thinking his library may go.\n\n\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,\" Joe Biden said.\n\nJoe Biden previously said he would not pardon his son, who was the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, both reflective and defensive as he discussed his legacy, told USA TODAY he believes he could have won his reelection bid - but isn't sure he would have had the vigor to complete four more years in the Oval Office.\n\n\"So far, so good,\" he said. \"But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?\"\n\nRead the full exit interview Biden granted USA TODAY and hear about where he stands on about policy, politics and family as he prepares to leave office.\n\nIn the weeks before his expected announcement of a presidential run, Joe Biden began taking heat for a stance he's held since the 1970s against busing children to achieve racially balanced public schools.\n\nA freshman Delaware senator when Wilmington's school desegregation plan was being fought out in federal court, he vocally opposed busing as an integration method.\n\nThis story, which was originally published in April 2019, was updated after Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 Democratic primaries. It provides a look at an issue - and Biden's stance - that again became a lightning rod during his presidential campaign.\n\nThe headmaster required it of every student. They were to stand in front of hundreds of their classmates and speak on a topic for several minutes - a lifetime for many.\n\nThese assemblies were held every week at Archmere Academy, a school with rigorous academics and strict priests. Decades later, some alumni say they still have nightmares about those speeches.\n\nDuring the 1957-1958 school year, the headmaster allowed only one boy to not make the speech.\n\nHis name was Joe Biden, and he had a terrible stutter."

      "text": "Letters to Joe: Messages, words of wisdom and thanks as Biden leaves the White House\n\nAs Joe Biden exits the White House, we asked those who know him, have worked with him and even a few folks who are also in the national spotlight and from Delaware, to share their memories, well-wishes and send-off messages to the outgoing president.\n\nHere's what they had to say.\n\nI met Joe Biden when I was sixteen years old at the Joe Biden youth leadership conference in Delaware. I was so excited to be chosen to represent my high school and get to voice my opinions about local issues and policies. I'll never forget Joe delivering the closing speech in the auditorium - his face getting all red because he was so impassioned. I can't remember the topic of the speech, but I knew he meant every word he was saying up there! It was fiery and we all loved it.\n\nYears later, when I was cast on \"Parks and Recreation,\" I had the privilege of working with Joe and Jill. We got a tour of the vice president's office and I found a note on Joe's desk that had my name on it and some facts about where we had met in Delaware. I felt so special that he remembered we had a history. In true April Ludgate style, I pocketed the note. Mike Schur [the creator of \"Parks and Recreation\"] was very concerned I'd get in trouble. It was the White House after all. You can't steal from the White House! Turns out you can.\n\nSome more years later, I was asked to host \"Saturday Night Live.\" A dream come true. I pitched an idea to Lorne Michaels to have Joe (who was the sitting president at that time) do a little bit in my monologue. Lorne seemed skeptical, but he let me pursue it. I was hoping that Joe would remember me enough to want to participate. But I wasn't sure I could pull it off. Not only did he say yes -- he left a heartwarming voicemail on my phone after he filmed his bit.\n\nHe said on the message, \"Hey kid, it's Ashley Bidens dad...,\" and it made me laugh. Even as the sitting president, he was still the same guy. A total sweetheart.\n\nAubrey Plaza is an actor, comedian and Ursuline Academy graduate.\n\nI am not a very political person, but I can certainly recognize the importance of hard work and bringing pride to the country you represent.\n\nI want to thank President Biden and Dr. Biden for their contributions to our country, to our futures and for keeping us safe.\n\nAs a Delawarean, I hope that President Biden's legacy will be a message to all young people that even if you're from a little state, you can dream big.\n\nJohnny Weir is a retired figure skater and American commentator who calls Delaware home.\n\nMr. President,\n\nLike virtually every Delawarean, we could tell too many stories about your impact on our lives. Jobs that represented transformative beginnings; celebrations of births and support after deaths; conversations about the meaning of service and citizenship, about family, friendship... and football.\n\nThroughout those personal stories, there are themes that, to us, have also defined your public leadership.\n\nStarting in 1972, always with respect for those who came before, you gave us faith that our then-young voices mattered - to you and to the country. We felt that message on a personal level, at the same time recognizing that it was for all who had not been heard or seen enough in the halls of power. And you said, and showed, that honoring the dignity of each of us could strengthen the community of all of us.\n\nYou've called on us, at every phase, \"to remember who we are,\" toward upholding both our individual integrity and our shared identity as Americans. You've embodied the confidence that our ideals are not just about a world that should be; they are also essential to getting things done in the world that is. What we say we value - as you defined it, \"opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, service, and truth\" - are not just ideas; they must be action items, in the world of policy and in how we treat one another.\n\nAs one of the writers you quote most - \"not because they are Irish but because they are the best\" - Seamus Heaney once said of poetry, you have touched \"the base of our sympathetic nature while taking in at the same time the unsympathetic nature of the world.\" You've lived that paired reality of courage and vulnerability, often to our amazement, finding in too much heartbreak a renewed inspiration to serve.\n\nSo your leadership, like your friendship, is chronicled not only in what has been done - remarkable in itself - but also in what has been felt, an honesty of the heart that your neighbors and fellow Americans could always trust. Like the care and compassion of your personal connections, the public faith you've preached - \"possibility\" - has been more persuasive, and more practiced, because of that trust. True to the lesson of your Finnegan grandparents, you haven't just kept the faith, you've spread it.\n\nYou've often said that \"Delaware\" is written on your heart. As we welcome you and Jill back to where your heart is most at home, we wish for you and your family what you've always wished for all of us, that, \"He will raise you up on eagles' wings/Bear you on the breath of dawn/Make you to shine like the sun/And hold you in the palm of His hand.\"\n\nJohn Carney is the mayor of Wilmington and, most recently, former governor of Delaware. Former first spouse Tracey Quillen Carney worked on the staff of then-Sen. Joe Biden for 15 years.\n\nDear Joe,\n\nFifty-three years ago, my brother, Robbie Richards, invited my husband Bill and me to come to dinner to meet a young New Castle County Councilman who Robbie thought had a bright future. Bill and I were a little surprised because the young man was a Democrat, and we were all Republicans. But we went to dinner and met you, Joe, and your first wife, Neilia. The dinner was a success. The conversation was lively and we were impressed by both you and Neilia. Bill and I agreed that you would go far.\n\nWe were somewhat taken aback a year later when you ran for the other Senate seat against our good friend, the incumbent, Cale Boggs. In an upset. you beat Cale but Bill understood the reality of politics. Bill was sorry that Cale had lost but he was glad that he already knew his new colleague.\n\nThen Neilia and your daughter Naomi were tragically killed in an automobile accident. Your two sons, Beau and Hunter, were seriously injured. You were distraught. It was difficult for you to think of the future without Neilia and Naomi. Your family and friends, however, encouraged you to move forward with your Senate career. You decided that you would be sworn in as Senator in the hospital room where your sons were recovering. Bill and I attended this hospital room swearing-in. Your two little boys had an unparalleled view of this important step in their father's life. On this occasion, I witnessed your deep devotion to your family.\n\nThus began 28 years of Bill and you working together in the U.S. Senate to represent Delaware. To be with your family, you returned by train to Wilmington every evening and took the train back to Washington in the morning. Bill also often came back in the evening and returned the next day. You frequently took the same train. When you did, you often sat together. Both of you worked hard on the train, reading and writing. And, If you were sitting together and busy working, constituents would be less likely to interrupt you by stopping and chatting. You got a lot done by sitting together.\n\nOver the years, you and Bill, a Democrat and a Republican, learned what areas you both would support and where you did not agree on policy. With this understanding, you were very effective in representing the people of Delaware. When you could work together, you got a lot done. I also benefited personally from your being a Senator. When I was nominated to the U.S. District Court in 1985 and to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1991, Bill, as my spouse, couldn't very well present me to the Judiciary Committee for its approval. You stepped in and did so - and very enthusiastically. It meant a lot to me to have that bipartisan support.\n\nBill died in 2003 and then my daughter Katy died in 2014 after an extended illness. On both occasions, you gave me great support in my grief. At Katy's memorial service, you told me about the illness of your son, Beau. This was before there was public awareness of the gravity of Beau's condition. I could tell how stricken you were by Beau's illness. But you were also thinking of my situation. You could appreciate my grief while experiencing your own.\n\nI had strong Republican roots before becoming a judge, but as a constituent I have observed your dedication to your job and to the people you represent. I admire you for the many things you have done both for the State of Delaware and for the country. It's been wonderful to have had a President from Delaware - one who spoke as a statesman with world leaders, who funded infrastructure improvements throughout our country, and who was at the same time a consummate politician - indeed, here was a bright young man who went far. And I am very proud of our First Lady, Jill. She has been a superb wife for you.\n\nBut when I think of you, Joe. I think not of the Senator or Vice President or President. I think of the friend who is dedicated to his family and who understands grief -- not just his own, but mine as well. You have relieved my grief. You know grief's enduring nature but you have learned to live with it in order to maintain a life of service to others. This life of service is what you will be remembered for and why we are proud of you.\n\nJoe, that is what you mean to me.\n\nBest wishes to you, Jane Roth\n\nJane R. Roth is a senior judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit and wife of the late Bill Roth, a long-serving U.S. senator from Delaware. She currently resides in Washington, D.C.\n\nI was first introduced to Joe Biden when I was serving in the United States Navy. During one of my six-month deployments in Southeast Asia, the best days were when the mail came, bringing cards, care packages, newspapers, and magazines. Following the 1972 election, the issues of both Time and Newsweek included stories of a stunning upset in Delaware, where a 29-year-old upstart, Joe Biden, defeated Caleb Boggs, a Delaware icon. I remember thinking to myself, \"I'd like to meet that young guy someday if I ever make it to Delaware.\"\n\nAnd then, one day, after finishing my military obligation, I found myself enrolled in an MBA program at the University of Delaware and volunteering to help a beloved professor, Jim Soles, with his congressional campaign. I was new to Delaware, and miraculously, I was invited by Dr. Soles a month or two later to join in a strategy session at the home of none other than Delaware's young junior Senator, Joe Biden. He could not have been more gracious that day. After learning of my military service in Southeast Asia, he embraced me and welcomed me to Delaware, marking the beginning of a friendship that has lasted for 50 years.\n\nJoe Biden has a saying that \"all politics are personal.\" During the last five decades, those words have served both of us well. Making personal connections with people in Delaware - and around the world - has allowed him to attain the highest level of office, but still remember he is a public servant at the end of the day. Some people may think that Joe Biden is just a partisan and only likes to work with Democrats, but he can work with just about anyone. Early in his Senate career, he did that with people like Senator John Stennis (D-Miss.) and even Senator Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). One might ask, how could a Democrat ever find common cause with any of those guys? But Joe Biden did, and he's been able to do the same thing in the years since then including his time as President.\n\nIt's his bipartisan approach that has largely paved the way for our country to make historic economic progress during his presidency. Over 16 million jobs have been created over the last four years, and in 2023 alone, a total of 2.7 million jobs were created, which is more jobs that any single year under the previous administration. That's more than the populations of Delaware, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Virginia combined! The improvement in inflation over the last year is the best story never told, with inflation now below 3 percent, the lowest level since April 2021.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is roaring back. The United States has made the most substantial investments in science, innovation, and industrial strategy in over 50 years, and more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs have been added across the country. Thanks to the historic investments in two landmark bills that I helped to author at the encouragement of Joe Biden who signed them into law - the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act - we have made a commitment to build a new clean energy economy which is creating good-paying jobs while helping to save our planet. And, thanks to the PACT Act, we expanded access to health care for more than 3.5 million Post-9/11 veterans, which has special meaning to Joe Biden, who fought for that bill in his son Beau's memory.\n\nJoe Biden is a man of his word and a person of unfailing integrity, and it is that commitment to doing what is right - not what is easy - that has earned him the respect of voters and world leaders alike. When challenged in his personal or professional life, he puts his country ahead of himself. He has proven that people can disagree without being disagreeable, and that we can compromise on policy without compromising our principles.\n\nFor over five decades, Joe Biden has been a principled leader and an even better friend. More importantly, though, he is a devoted husband, a loving father and grandfather, and a dedicated son and brother. It is those qualities that have helped make him an exceptional person and an excellent president.\n\nTom Carper is a former U.S. senator who represented Delaware for years.\n\nYou can't tell the story of modern Delaware politics without Joe Biden, but it's also true that you can't tell the story of Joe Biden without Delaware. Sure, Joe is understandably proud of his Scranton, Pennsylvania roots, but it's what he learned in Delaware that most shaped his approach to public service.\n\nAs I came up in Delaware politics, I often heard people speak of the \"Delaware Way.\" While it can mean different things to different people, the general idea is that folks work together to overcome their differences and find common ground. Joe took that Delaware Way to Washington, and that's an important part of what's made him so successful as a senator and vice president, and the most consequential president of my lifetime.\n\nWhen he made a focus on bipartisanship and working together a central theme of his primary campaign in 2020, Joe was at times dismissed as naively believing in a bygone era. Once Joe won, he began proving the naysayers wrong, building bipartisan majorities in Congress to pass transformative legislation to invest in America's infrastructure, re-shore advanced manufacturing, fulfill our sacred obligation to veterans, protect communities from gun violence, and invest in community mental health.\n\nHe did all that by bringing people together, not by tearing us apart. He led on the national stage by staying true to his Delaware roots.\n\nIt's not just Delaware's political civility that shaped Joe, however. No matter where he goes, he is always Joe from Claymont, son of a hardworking car salesman who valued the dignity of work as much as a paycheck. Coupled with his mother's \"American creed\" - that \"no one is better than you. You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to you\" - Joe has never stopped believing in the remarkable possibilities that America offers and the importance of treating people with respect.\n\nIt's a promise grounded in the values strengthened by the nuns at St. Helena's and Holy Rosary, who stressed the importance of \"decency, fair play, and virtue.\" Joe's early parochial education, followed by his four years at Archmere, bolstered his Catholic faith and a belief in the obligations we all have to each other. The nuns taught their students that \"it was noble to intervene,\" as Joe recalled in his memoir, emphasizing above all the broader lesson of John 15:13: \"No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.\"\n\nYou can draw a direct line from Joe's Catholic education to his decision to take a lifeguarding job at a majority Black swimming pool in Wilmington as a 19-year-old during the Civil Rights Movement. Joe knew very little about the Black experience in Delaware, a segregated state at the time, but he was determined to change that by listening to his peers at Prices Run public swimming pool. There, Joe met lifelong friends like Richard \"Mouse\" Smith and Maurice Pritchett, who - between swimming laps and playing late-night basketball games - explained the challenges they faced as young Black men in 1960s America. Joe took his new friends' messages seriously. As Pritchett recounted, \"Biden, you could see it in his eyes, he wanted to know about us.\" Pritchett and Smith described the repeated indignities - what Joe later termed the \"dozen small cuts a day\" - that left them hurt and angry.\n\nThose stories resonated with Joe. After all, one of Joe's defining values is that he hates bullies; hates it when people misuse power and refuse to give others a fair shake. It's what's driven him to do more to counter racial inequality than any president in 50 years: funding HBCUs at record levels; appointing an historically diverse slate of federal judges to the bench, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on our nation's highest court; and creating economic opportunity for Black Americans by emphasizing underserved communities and Black homeownership, among many other priorities.\n\nThis is the man who served as the loyal No. 2 to our nation's first Black president, Barack Obama, and who chose Kamala Harris as his running mate in 2020, leading her to become the first Black vice president (and then solidly endorsed Harris for president after ending his own campaign this summer). Once confronted with the inequality and indignities imposed on Delawareans by decades of racial segregation, the values of his faith and his family made Joe a lifelong advocate for racial equality.\n\nOnce again, it all comes back to Delaware. Just as Joe did, every night as a senator. He took the Amtrak train north so he could be home for his two young sons after the death of their mother and sister. What started in tragedy soon bonded him even further to our state and the people he represented, because no matter what, Joe was there. He always showed up when we needed him, just as he did for his sons.\n\nAs Delawareans, we've gotten used to an outsized influence because of Joe. From Wilmington to Dover to Georgetown, we've benefited from his presence in our lives. That will change this month when he leaves office and comes home. What won't change, however, is what he gave our state, and what our state gave him. I know I speak for many Delawareans when I say, thank you, Joe, for taking us to heights we've never reached before. Thank you, Joe, for being one of us, and showing the rest of America what it means to be a Delawarean.\n\nChris Coons is a U.S. senator from Delaware.\n\nDear President Biden,\n\nI write this letter not as your constituent of nearly 50 years, nor as Delaware's former Secretary of Labor and Congresswoman, or our new United States Senator. Today, I write to you as a first-time grandmother on behalf of my beautiful granddaughter, Lennox. Lately, I've been reflecting on your presidency, and how I will describe your legacy to her. Three words immediately come to mind: progress, compassion and promise.\n\nThe first word is progress . You entered office amid a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. At the time, our country had lost over 400,000 Americans to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment was at 6%. We had to get our nation back on track - and you rose to the occasion. Working with Congress, you signed the American Rescue Plan Act into law to help us recover, rebuild, and restore. From life-saving vaccines to the reopening of our schools and businesses safely, your leadership in this turbulent time was consequential. We expanded the Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty in half. We revived our economy.  As President, you ushered in an era of unprecedented legislative progress, while bringing our allies together, and I am proud to have worked alongside you in accomplishing these historic wins for Delaware and the nation.\n\nHistory will show that working with Democrats and Republicans, you accomplished things that had only been talked about for decades. The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making transformational investments in our nation's roads, bridges, highways, ports, and rail, while expanding broadband internet to millions of Americans. By reaching across the aisle, you helped us keep our sacred obligation to our veterans by signing the Honoring Our PACT Act into law, which marked the largest expansion of VA benefits since the G.I. Bill. You fought for safer communities by signing into law the most comprehensive action ever taken to address gun violence, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act . And working with Democrats in the House and Senate, you championed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower the cost of health care and prescription drug costs for seniors and make the largest investment in fighting the climate crisis in our nation's history. The impact your leadership will have on communities at home and abroad will undoubtedly be felt across generations. Simply put, you're leaving office as the most accomplished president in modern history.\n\nThe second word is compassion . When our country was at a crossroads after witnessing the horrific attack in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, and later the murder of George Floyd, you stepped up to bring back compassion at a time when our nation needed it most.\n\nAnd for me, and countless others, you've been a compassionate friend and mentor. In 2014, when my husband suddenly and unexpectedly passed away; years later when my sister suffered a stroke; and most recently when my father, the late Ted Blunt, received the diagnosis of cancer and six months later left this earth - you were there. Even as I sought wisdom in my run for the Senate, you were there. It's a generosity that I hope you know is appreciated and will always be reciprocated. And despite tremendous personal loss throughout your own life, including the passing of your late son, Beau, you've continued to show us as individuals and as a country how to \"keep the faith\" in the face of adversity. That's because your North Star - your devotion to your state and nation - has never wavered.\n\nThe final word is promise . What you have brought with you from position to position has been a commitment to the promise of a better and brighter future for all Americans. The promise of a future where our schools, movie theaters, places of worship, and grocery stores are free from gun violence. The promise of a future where all Americans have access to quality and affordable health care, childcare, and housing opportunities. The promise of a future where our democracy is protected and not diminished. The promise of a future where access to clean drinking water isn't just a privilege but a basic human right. The promise of a nation where freedom, justice, and equality are the basis for everything we do. Thank you for all you've done to show us this future is achievable - if we're willing to work for it.\n\nMr. President, as you have often said, family is the beginning, middle, and the end so I would be remiss if I did not mention your other half, Dr. Jill Biden, and the unconditional love, strength, and support of your family. To the Bidens - thank you for being an anchor for the President and for sharing him with us.\n\nThough my granddaughter is too young to read or write, she will grow up hearing of your decades of impactful service, your steadfast leadership, your deep compassion, your unwavering friendship, and your unshakeable optimism for the \"possibilities\" of America. The example you have set will inspire Lennox and future generations to lead with integrity, honor, and decency - not just in word but in deed. Thank you for your service to our state, our nation, and our future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nU.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester is one of Delaware's two U.S. senators, as well as the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to ever represent the First State in that chamber.\n\nPresident Biden,\n\nI'm honored to join thousands of our neighbors in thanking you for a lifetime of service to us, our state, and our country.\n\nYou are the definition of a true patriot, and you have led the most accomplished administration we've seen in my lifetime. Under your leadership, we have historic employment across the country, we've made critical investments in addressing climate change and we've bolstered economic opportunity for millions of Americans.\n\nBut I've been lucky to see you champion working families, and equity over my whole life - as my Senator, Vice President, and over the last three and a half years as President. In that time, you have proven that we can do big things together that make a real difference in the lives of Americans, from Wilmington to Scranton and beyond - and through it all, you have shown how decent, kind, and selfless you are.\n\nNearly 250 years ago, Delaware became the first state to sign on to the journey that is America. In the centuries since our small state has come to realize that the promise of our Constitution is only possible when we respect our differences and resolve our disagreements through conversation and collaboration. Through the power of our proximity here in this state, we have come to see our fellow citizens as neighbors with shared hopes and a common destiny. We know that the divisions and nastiness that we too often see nationally must not - and does not have to - be our new normal. That a different kind of politics is possible: a politics of hope, not of hate; of grace, not of grievance; of progress, not of pettiness.\n\nThis is the legacy you leave us with, as Delawareans and as Americans. It is a legacy that we are all called to honor especially now.\n\nMy heart is full of love for you, Jill, and the entire Biden family. Whenever I think of your legacy I am filled with love and adoration for Beau - who taught me that there is no better quality in a public servant than authenticity. Beau was always the same sweet, kind, and generous man behind closed doors as he was in front of a crowd. I count myself lucky to have gotten to know you through the eyes of your son, Beau.\n\nWhen I won my race for Congress this fall, you called me to say that you got a message from heaven from Beau: \"Beau's looking down from heaven, congratulating you.\" I'll always remember that call from you. Mr. President, I know that today and every day Beau is proud of you.\n\nAt this moment in America's journey, hope sometimes feels hard to come by, your legacy reminds us that we must never forget that we are the beneficiaries of seemingly impossible change becoming a reality; that it's always been in our country's most significant challenges that we take our biggest steps forward. Because no matter what obstacles stand in our way, so long as we breathe, we hope - and, together, we can once again turn that hope into historic progress.\n\nIt's easy to be cynical but you, Mr. President, have never done that - you have shown us that in facing the most impossible of circumstances, we always have the propensity to take our biggest steps forward. Now more than ever, we need to channel that hope and determination to build on the work you have accomplished.\n\nMr. President, yes, you showed me how to be a good public servant and how to serve our state with integrity, grit, and decency. More than that, you showed me how to summon courage and hope after tremendous personal loss. That is a gift that I will always treasure.\n\nIt's only fitting that I'm writing this letter on the Amtrak. Mr. President, welcome home. You will always be my idol.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCongresswoman Sarah McBride\n\nRep. Sarah McBride is Delaware's sole congresswoman beginning this year, as well as the first openly transgender politician ever elected to those halls.\n\nDear Mr. President,\n\nA simple truth: YOU ARE THE BEST. Mr. President, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., you are the best person, president, and public servant I have ever had the great good fortune of knowing and serving. So many people can and will say the same. So, let me be more specific about the difference you have made in my life and have enabled me to make in the lives of others, thanks to the trust you placed in me.\n\nServing as U.S. Ambassador to Germany and representing you and your Administration overseas has been the greatest honor of my life. I could not be prouder of the work we have done to defend democracy and to advance all our shared values and interests with Germany.  Germany is now a stronger partner than ever with the U.S, thanks to your global leadership.\n\nI know the important role your father played in your life, and I could not be more grateful to you for enabling me to pay the greatest possible tribute to my father. As the daughter of Kurt Gutmann, who fled Nazi Germany in 1934, I could never have imagined that I would go on to serve as your envoy to his home country one generation later.\n\nThat day I received your unexpected call informing me of your intention to nominate me as Ambassador, I felt so many emotions, but the one that has stuck with me most is gratitude. I am grateful to call you a friend and to have had the privilege and pleasure of getting to know you over the past twenty years. I am deeply grateful for your public service over half a century and for the unsurpassed good that you have accomplished in your Presidency for the nation, and the world.\n\nWhen we first discussed the idea of your joining the University of Pennsylvania after your Vice Presidency, I could not have imagined in that moment that you would go on to run for President again. When you decided not to run in 2015 after the passing of your beloved Beau, you were so focused on all that you would go on to do after leaving office.  Among so many other things, you launched the Cancer Moonshot initiative, and your focus was inspiring young people. You certainly did that, and I literally was by your side in observing how much you taught-and inspired-our students. You brought such a depth and richness of experience, insight, and wisdom to our campus in that time.\n\nIt has always been important for universities to bring leaders from across the political spectrum to engage with students, and you engaged with your unsurpassed and irresistible passion. Penn students benefited enormously from your unique vision. Everyone loves to talk about their memorable interactions with you as Professor Biden. What I said at the time bears repeating because it shows what an amazing and unique President you are:\n\nEvery time Joe Biden...visited campus, he brought forth endless expertise on a wide variety of topics-from international affairs and domestic politics to immigration policy and cancer research, and so much more... His unmatched personal connections with global leaders made our mission to bring the world to Penn and Penn to the world even stronger.\n\nI saw firsthand how valuable these personal relationships are to diplomacy, from Oval Office meetings with Chancellor Scholz, to your recent October visit to Berlin where President Steinmeier presented you with the Order of Merit at the highest level- Germany's highest tribute - for your commitment to the transatlantic alliance since your days in the Senate.\n\nYears before I had ever attended a Munich Security Conference (MSC), you shared your passion for this global convening with me - a forum that embodies how meaningful effective person-to-person diplomacy can be. The beginning of my Ambassadorship was marked by rushing to attend my first MSC just days before Russia's unprovoked, brutal reinvasion of Ukraine. We lost no time in urging Germany and our other allies to be prepared to stand with us in supporting Ukraine. It was not lost on me how serious our work was and continues to be. Your leadership made it possible for Ukraine to resist Putin's aggression.\n\nOver the years, we have discussed our shared passions for democracy and education, collaborative medical research, and creating job opportunities for the middle class. You always took a keen interest in my perspective, as a scholar of democracy and as the first person in my family to attend college. When I was Chair of President Obama's Commission on the Study of Bioethical Issues, I saw your integrity and commitment to improving the lives of Americans firsthand. There is no greater honor and privilege that I could have imagined in my life than to work with you, and now call you a friend. I have learned so much from your principled leadership, decency, and vision. Thank you for this. Thank you for being the best - and a mensch!\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nAmy Gutmann\n\nAmy Gutmann is the Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Political Science, School of Arts and Sciences, and professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication. She is also a Penn president emerita and a retired U.S. ambassador to Germany.\n\nFor more than three years, I've been fortunate to serve as chairman of President Joe Biden's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nAfter much reflection, I am resigning that position on Monday, full of gratitude for President Biden's tremendous record of service, and proud of what we've accomplished together.\n\nHere's the truth: no president in U.S. history has done more to support HBCUs than Joe Biden.\n\nWhile many have suggested they understand the importance of America's HBCUs, the Biden/Harris administration's actions can be summed up this way:\n\n\"Deeds; not words.\"\n\nSince their election in 2020, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have invested $20 billion in our country's HBCUs.\n\nThat includes nearly $4 billion through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief legislation to help HBCUs support students' ability to meet basic needs and maintain campus operations; $2.6 billion from the U.S. Department of Education to support the growth and sustainability of HBCU degree programs; more than $1.6 billion through federal grants, cooperative agreements, and other competitive funding opportunities to drive academic and training programs; and almost $950 million to support HBCUs in growing research capacity and infrastructure.\n\nBiden and Harris made these investments because they understand the unmistakable value of America's HBCUs.\n\nAcross the country - despite representing only a small fraction of higher education institutions - HBCUs educate twice as many students who are low-income and Pell eligible as non-HBCUs.\n\nAnd they do so with incredible success.\n\nIn addition to generating nearly $16 billion in direct economic impact, HBCUs still produce 80% of Black judges, 25% of Black science professionals, 70% of Black dentists and physicians, and 40% of Black members of Congress. And the return-on-investment for HBCUs is not just financial. On every indicator of well-being, Black students attending HBCUs students fare better than similarly situated students at Predominantly White Institutions, or PWIs.\n\nBiden's decisions to invest in America's HBCUs will have a significant impact on generations of students who attend these institutions, the faculty and staff who pour their whole hearts into providing HBCU educations, and the families who sacrifice so much in favor of boundless futures for their children.\n\nWe know Joe Biden in Delaware. So we're not surprised by his commitment to service. But his work as president has been singular in its commitment, and will be forever remembered by a grateful set of American citizens who will continue to achieve in every field of human endeavor.\n\n\"Deeds; not words.\"\n\nIn four years, Biden's deeds are unprecedented: tangible artifacts - demonstrable symbols - of an incomparable legacy.\n\nTony Allen is president of Delaware State University and chairman emeritus of the President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\n(This piece was updated with three letters.)"

Biden has forever changed Delaware's place in history - and the places in Delaware history.\n\nThis is a map of Joe Biden's Delaware.\n\nGreenville home, 1209 Barley Mill Road : The Bidens call their Barley Mill Road home \"the Lake House,\" though the body of water next to it is a manmade pond. They've lived there since 1998. Joe Biden, an architecture enthusiast, designed the 7,000-square-foot home himself.\n\nNorth Shores home, 34 Farview Road, Rehoboth Beach : The Bidens bought a home in the community just north of Rehoboth Beach in 2017, but they had been spending time in Rehoboth Beach for decades prior. While Joe Biden used to be seen around town with an ice cream cone in hand, nowadays, few-and-far-between outings include the Secret Service.\n\nSt. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church , 10 Old Church Road, Greenville: \"St. Joe's\" is the home church of Joe Biden, only the second Catholic U.S. president in history.

Biden Jr. Aquatic Center , 26th and Locust streets, Wilmington: A city pool in Prices Run where Joe lifeguarded in the summer of 1962. Out of 12 lifeguards that summer, he was the only one who wasn't Black. The well-known story of him taking on \"Corn Pop\" is set at this pool, which was renamed for him in 2017.\n\nClaymont: Joe Biden's family moved from Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Claymont when he was about 10 years old, making a home at Brookview Apartments while Joe attended Holy Rosary. Two years later, the family moved to the new Brandywine Hundred housing development of Mayfield and Joe started school at St. Helena's.

      "text": "Tarnished legacy? How Biden's age and refusal to pass torch earlier hang over his exit\n\nWASHINGTON ― President Joe Biden assured Americans throughout his 2024 reelection campaign he was eager and able to serve for four more years, even though it would have meant holding the world's most powerful job until he was 86 years old .\n\nBut now ‒ just a few days before he leaves office and President-elect Donald Trump takes over the White House ‒ he's not so sure he would have had the vigor.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Biden told USA TODAY earlier this month in an exclusive interview . \"When Trump was running again for reelection, I really thought I had the best chance of beating him. But I also wasn't looking to be president when I was 85 years old, 86 years old. And so I did talk about passing the baton.\n\n\"Who the hell knows?\" the 82-year-old president added. \"So far, so good. But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?\"\n\nBiden's public admission that time is catching up with him is now very much part of the narrative and debate over his legacy: More than a half-century in Washington, eight years as the vice president, four as the commander in chief, yet like an aging athlete, unsure when to hang it up.\n\nHis decision to run for reelection in 2024 ‒ ignoring well-documented concerns among voters and his party about his age and ability to serve through January 2029 ‒ is central to the discussion of a legacy that's being judged less by legislative achievements and more by his refusal for \"passing the baton\" earlier .\n\nSome Democrats blame Biden's initial decision to run for a second term - only to end his campaign 107 days before the election - for helping pave the way to Trump's return to power.\n\nHis determination exposed a diminished president to the American people during a disastrous June debate performance against Trump that showed him struggle to piece together answers. When he finally dropped out one month later amid pressure from top Democrats , he left his vice president, Kamala Harris , less than four months to mount a campaign against Trump.\n\n\"It certainly would have been better for the Democratic nominee if he had decided earlier. No question about it,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \"Kamala Harris was handicapped by the lack of sufficient time to build her case.\"\n\nThe turning point in Biden's calculus to run again came when Democrats exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm elections and thwarted a widely predicted midterm \"red wave\" for Republicans. Not only did House Democrats lose vastly fewer seats than projected in the House that cycle, the party retained power in the Senate - despite Biden's low approval ratings.\n\nBiden felt vindicated at the time and took delight proving his skeptics wrong, convinced the results spoke to quiet popularity for his polices - and himself ‒ that pundits were missing.\n\n\"Watch me,\" Biden told reporters the day after the midterms in a message to the two-thirds of voters who in exit polls said they didn't want him to seek reelection. It was a strong hint at the formal reelection announcement that would come months later in April 2023.\n\n\"The dark moment of the Biden presidency occurred when he misread his mandate after the Democrats outperformed in the midterm elections of 2022,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor of history at Rice University. He said Biden could have \"built the bench of the Democratic Party\" but instead \"reneged on his pledge\" to be a transition president.\n\n\"Biden's now going down as a failed presidency,\" Brinkley added, pointing to Democrats winning millions fewer votes in 2024 than in Biden's first run in 2020. \"He didn't energize the nation.\"\n\nWhat Biden perceived as a victory for his agenda in the midterms, political experts now say might have been the result of the immediate enthusiasm infused into the party just months after the overturning of Roe v. Wade , a lackluster field of Republican Senate candidates, and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol being fresher on the minds of voters than it was in 2024. Midterm elections historically energize the bases of the nation's major political parties but have smaller turnout than presidential races.\n\nSignals from the president and the White House following the 2022 midterms about Biden's reelection intentions effectively cleared the field from other viable Democrats entering the primary race. Had Biden bowed out, it's a list that could have included the party's crop of governors like Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, in addition to Harris.\n\n\"In retrospect, yeah,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said on Democrats being better off had Biden passed the torch earlier. \"But retrospect ‒ what does that mean? This was a very close race.\"\n\nStill, McGovern added, \"Had we had a primary, and Harris won that primary, she would have been a stronger candidate. She would have had more time to be able to not only introduce herself to the American people, but to combat all the bull--- that Trump was throwing out there.\"\n\nBiden's top aides reject the notion that the president's decision to run, and then to retreat, paved the way for Trump's victory.\n\n\"The assumption that somehow the Democrat would have won had it not been for the last year is just wrong,\" said a former Biden senior adviser who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \"People in this country were unhappy, and they were unhappy about inflation.\"\n\nThe same senior adviser said other Democrats who didn't want Biden to run again could have stepped up. \"Any of those Democrats who felt that way could have run against him, banded together to get someone into the process.\"\n\nBut the most viable party challenger Biden attracted was a long shot: then- Rep. Dean Phillips , a 55-year-old congressman from Minnesota who was effusive in praise of Biden's presidency but argued it was time for new Democratic voices. Phillips was roundly mocked by the party's establishment for taking on Biden and ended his bid early in the nomination process.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a 35-year-old progressive Democrat who stood behind Biden's reelection bid, countered the postelection second-guessing, noting the party's elite was publicly behind his decision to run again.\n\n\"There is an entire party establishment here,\" said Ocasio-Cortez, \"that was also supportive with that at the time as well.\"\n\nSince entering the White House four years ago, Biden has displayed visible signs of aging. His gait became stiffer. He often spoke softly. And his willingness to take questions from reporters became few and far between.\n\nYet Biden is convinced he could have defeated Trump had he stayed in. \"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes, based on the polling,\" Biden said during the exclusive interview with USA TODAY on whether he could have beaten Trump.\n\nResponding to a question from a reporter last Friday, Biden said he doesn't regret initially running for reelection.\n\n\"I think I would have beaten Trump, could have beaten Trump. And I think Kamala could have beaten Trump,\" Biden said. \"I thought it was important to unify the party. And when the party was worried about whether or not I was going to be able to move ‒ even though I thought I could win again ‒ I thought it was better to unify the party.\"\n\nBiden's assessment has raised eyebrows. Trump led Biden throughout the campaign in both national and battleground state polls. After Biden's exit, Harris quickly erased Trump's sizable polling leads despite ultimately losing all seven closely contested swing states.\n\nMost Democrats are staying away from Biden's postelection hypothetical that he could have defeated Trump.\n\n\"We're looking forward not backward,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said last week when asked whether he agrees with Biden.\n\nIn his waning days in office, Biden and his allies have tried to assert a legacy defined by signature laws Biden pushed through in his first term ‒ overcoming a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate ‒ to unleash historic infrastructure spending, a resurgence of clean-energy factories and investments in the microchip industry to catch up to China. Biden calls it the \"most significant investment in America since the New Deal.\"\n\nBiden has also touted his record \"restoring the economy\" after assuming office during a global pandemic, restoring the nation's global alliances and leading international support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion and war.\n\n\"On substance, there's no Democrat outside of Lyndon Johnson who was more productive,\" said Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a close Biden confidant. \"You even talk about how successful (Barack) Obama was, how successful Bill Clinton was. I don't think, pound for pound, any one of them legislatively made it up to Joe Biden's production. That's why I believe history is going to be so kind to him.\"\n\nClyburn, whose endorsement in the 2020 Democratic primary helped steer Biden's comeback, said he doesn't believe Biden's reluctance to pass the torch to a new nominee will have much consequence on how history will view him.\n\n\"People look at his age and look at the age of the guy who's about to take the office,\" Clyburn said of the 78-year-old Trump, now the oldest person ever elected president, \"and ask, 'What's the difference?'\"\n\nClyburn attributed Biden's misspeaks and gaffes to the president's lifelong battle with stuttering. He blamed the media for fixating on it. And unlike some of his Democratic colleagues, Clyburn said he questioned whether Biden should have even bowed out to hand the nomination to Harris.\n\n\"I don't think he should have gotten out before he did. And a lot of us wonder whether he should have gotten out at all,\" said Clyburn, who, like Biden, believes the president could have defeated Trump had he stayed in the race.\n\nBiden leaves office with a mixed legacy, said biographer Chris Whipple, author of \"The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden's White House.\"\n\n\"When he came into office, he was facing the most daunting challenges since FDR's time - an economy in free fall, a once-in-a-century pandemic, global warming, racial injustice and then an invasion of a democracy in Europe,\" Whipple said. \"He gets really, really strong marks on his handling of the economy. He pulled it out of a free fall. He guided the country out of the pandemic. And I think he's got a pretty extraordinary record of passing bipartisan legislation in a 50-50 Congress.\"\n\nOn the other hand, he said, Biden failed to adequately address concerns about migration at the U.S.-Mexico border and misjudged the impact of inflation on working-class Americans.\n\nAnd Biden's unwillingness to end his bid for a second term until just four months before the election will impact the way many Americans remember him, Whipple added. He attributed Biden's determination to run again to a mindset of long feeling counted out and underestimated.\n\n\"Biden's stubborn refusal to face the reality that he was too old, A, to run for reelection and then, B, to govern for a second term, is going to haunt him,\" he said, adding that Democrats' performance in the 2022 midterms \"reinforced this delusion that he could run and win and serve a second term.\"\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., another close Biden ally, suggested Biden's legacy will improve over time. Coons cited President Harry S. Truman, who he said was viewed negatively by the public immediately after leaving office in January 1953 but whose reviews changed \"as Americans have focused on the substance of his accomplishments.\"\n\n\"I think there will be different historical assessments right after the end of his presidency and a decade and two or three from now,\" Coons said of Biden, who he said will be remembered as a president who \"never forgot where he came from, fought tirelessly for the middle class, worked across the aisle and delivered significant, consequential legislative results.\"\n\nCoons said Democrats' 2022 midterms performance \"gave a sense of optimism to everyone who was looking at running either for reelection or running for the first time.\" But he also pointed to difficulties for incumbent parties in elections throughout the world over the past year.\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said two decades from now, Biden will be ranked as one of the top 10 presidents of all time.\n\n\"We rarely talk about presidential campaigns,\" Daschle said of sizing up past presidents. \"We take a look at what they accomplished over the time they were in office.\"\n\nBiden's admirers see a tragic ending to his presidency. He takes enormous pride as the person who defeated Trump ‒ who advisers still note is the only Democrat to do so ‒ yet he's now being replaced by him. Biden warned of Trump being a threat to democracy and called the battle against Trumpism a \"fight for the soul of the nation.\"\n\nBut he will have to watch on Monday as Trump is sworn in as the 47th president.\n\n\"One of his great successes was he saved us from a second Trump term, and then, because of his decision to run for reelection, he's partially responsible for having the second Trump term,\" said Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. \"And the second Trump term, I think, is going to be abominable.\"\n\nAs fate would have it, Biden last week eulogized President Jimmy Carter ‒ the last one-term Democratic president ‒ whose presidency is the one most often compared to Biden's. Carter, who died at 100 and left a postpresidential legacy of volunteerism, was also saddled with high inflation and unrest in the Middle East.\n\n\"To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter's example,\" Biden said.\n\nBut Brinkley said the last year of Biden's presidency ‒ which included the controversial pardon of his son Hunter Biden ‒ has undermined the image Biden had cultivated.\n\n\"What he had going for him was that it seemed public service and 'state of democracy' were his mantras, and in the end, it starts looking that it was just another selfish politician,\" said Brinkley, who has written books about Carter, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt and other presidents.\n\nBrinkley listed off Carter's defining moments: brokering the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, opening diplomatic relations with China, conservation efforts in Alaska, doubling the national parks system, creating the Departments of Education and Energy, and pushing a human rights campaign in his foreign policy.\n\n\"You say the name Jimmy Carter, you think human rights,\" Brinkley said. \"And when you hear Joe Biden in his 80s, what do you think? The answer becomes he stayed too long.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

During the debate, Biden's voice was hoarse and raspy as he stumbled over words. At one point, the former president appeared to lose his train of thought.\n\nBarrett said he did not watch the debate because of his concerns over Biden's physical state but did not witness any stumbles in person.\n\n\"To this moment I haven't watched that debate because I just had concerns,\" Barrett said. \"Now I'll say that the interactions that I had with him during my time as ambassador, which were few - but two or three - he was sharp as a tack.\"\n\n\"So, clearly, there was something that was going on there. I did not sense in the one-on-one interactions that there was an issue, but there may have been.\"\n\nBarrett said his job was made easier once Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and was replaced with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"In some ways it made it easier because that was off the table,\" Barrett said when asked if concerns among European leaders over Biden made his job as ambassador difficult. \"And with Vice President Harris in the race, I think that there was hope and there was enthusiasm for her, quite honestly, in Europe, that she could win the race.\"\n\n\"There was always this fear with President Trump,\" Barrett said. \"The fear was there, and it was not below the surface.\"\n\nBarrett said last week in an appearance at the Rotary Club of Milwaukee that European leaders are concerned their relationships with the U.S. are \"fraying\" after the election of Trump.\n\nMary Spicuzza of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report."

Biden's administration was dogged by questions about his mental acuity and now more revelations are coming out about how his defenders turned a blind eye to his decline or condemned those who questioned his ability to serve.\n\n\"The 2024 presidential campaign was even more of a mess for Democrats than we even saw,\" co-host Joy Behar said, noting that multiple books are reporting inside information about the Biden presidency and campaign.\n\nEven so, Behar argued, \"We have to take a lot of this, I think, with a bit of a grain of salt. I mean, if any of this is true, what can Democrats do about it now? I mean, it seems to me this ship has sailed, what's the point?\"\n\nBiden Insider Expresses How White House 'Gaslit' The Public About Former President's Decline\n\nCo-host Alyssa Farah Griffin argued that Biden, despite the fact he stepped down, was instrumental in the Democratic Party's defeat.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\n\"We're in a moment we're in where a lot of people are scared, they're nervous. They're worried that we're seeing America fundamentally changed. And a reason for that, not just a little asterisk, is that Joe Biden did not win, did not step aside in time to allow someone else to win, and I do think it is a story that warrants some reflection,\" she said.\n\nGriffin went on to argue that Biden let himself be carried away by his ego and compared him to Trump.\n\n\"People always think I'm so critical just because I think he needed to step aside and give someone else a chance. He does start to come off, the more we're learning, like, 'I alone can fix it.' It almost comes off Trumpy,\" she said, going on to argue that if Biden had stepped down sooner, his Democratic successor could have had a better chance at winning the election.\n\nCo-host Sara Haines offered another major takeaway: \"Listen to the voters.\"\n\n\"One thing that really pissed me off as an independent, and I was one of the people that sat here and said after seeing President Biden - I voted for Biden, I really liked Biden, I actually have been happy with him, and I would have voted for him if he continued to run - but I did look at him and think, 'I think maybe you do need to step aside,' and now the rumors that we're hearing [are] starting to make sense.\"\n\nThe immediate response to questioning Biden's acuity was swift and angry, she recalled.\n\n\"What happened is everyone said, 'You're disloyal if you say that, shut up and fall in line,' and that's why people want to be independents these days, because partisan politics, they lie,\" Haines said. \"It was the Democratic Party that made that choice, that said, 'You're betraying him if you call it like you see it,' and the point here was is he wasn't necessarily fit to run for another four years.\"\n\nAna Navarro disagreed, instead echoing Behar and co-host Sunny Hostin's lack of interest in a postmortem analysis of the Democratic Party's efforts in the election.\n\n\"Usually I like these books, usually I like campaign gossip of 'Primary Colors' after Clinton or, oh, after Obama or 'Game Change' after McCain, but these are not normal times,\" she said. \"So I'm just not interested in palace gossip from a year and a half ago.\"\n\nShe went on to offer a laundry list of problems she'd rather focus on with the current Trump administration.\n\n\"Two things can be true at once,\" Haines replied. \"You can despise Trump and everything the Republicans stand for, and still be able to see straight about what happened here. And denying it and telling people, 'You're not seeing what you're seeing,' is never going to win voters, ever!\"\n\nOriginal article source: 'View' hosts clash over Democrats hiding Biden's decline as one says it's 'why people want to be independents'"

      "text": "Joe Biden's Handlers Definitely Knew. Did the Media? (opinion)\n\nManage your account\n\nTwo reporters have released a book- Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House - that shines a new light on the extent of President Joe Biden's cognitive decline over the course of his reelection campaign. Amie Parnes of The Hill and Jonathan Allen of NBC News gained access to Biden's inner circle, discovering that top officials had grave concerns about Biden's fitness for the presidency; these concerns long predated the public's own awareness of the extent of his decline.\n\nIn fact, Vice President Kamala Harris had discussed plans for what to do in the event of Biden's sudden death-i.e., which judges she would want to swear her in as president. These plans were formulated by Jamal Simmons, a communications director who departed Harris' team in January 2023 . In other words, Harris was thinking through worst-case scenarios as far back as then.\n\nBy the time of Biden's disastrous July debate with Donald Trump, the president's cognitive decline was so bad that aides had to help him navigate a home where a fundraiser was being held... by placing fluorescent tape on the floor to guide him from spot to spot. Parnes and Allen confirmed this shocking detail in an interview with me on Rising .\n\nThis fundraiser wasn't held in the Labyrinth of King Minos or something. It was held at the residence of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. He has a big house, to be sure-repairs and renovations to the mansion cost New Jersey taxpayers $862,000 . Nevertheless, the fact that Biden needed flashy visual cues just to survive a friendly fundraising event obviously raised serious and immediate questions about his ability to fulfill the more demanding aspects of his job.\n\nAnd yet, top Biden surrogates maintained that he was totally capable of remaining president, even after he had exited his reelection campaign. Ron Klain, Biden's former chief of staff, asserted in August 2024 that Biden was \"clearly up to the job.\"\n\n\"He's doing it every day,\" said Klain. \"He's doing it successfully.\"\n\nKlain doesn't even have the excuse that he was obligated to say something positive about Biden because he worked for him. He was out of a job at that point.\n\nWell, Klain is finally admitting the truth. He told reporter Chris Whipple, who has also released a tell-all book on the real story of the Biden campaign, that he \"wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US. 'He just became very enraptured with being the head of Nato,' he said.\"\n\nKlain scheduled a practice debate for Biden, which was supposed to run for 90 minutes, but Biden could only make it through 45 minutes, at which point \"the president's voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject,\" writes Whipple, characterizing Klain's remarks. \"All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term.\"\n\nGiven all that, it's no wonder Biden lost. But it's also remarkable that he didn't actually resign the presidency , despite his obvious impairments. Of course, it seems that no one in his inner circle was willing to speak out about his incapacity until after it was too late.\n\nMedia reporters are certainly having a field day with all this- now. CNN's Jake Tapper has released a book on this subject: Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again . That's in addition to the books by Parnes, Allen, and Whipple. One can't help but wonder, however, why it took so long to get the real story. Maybe journalists weren't properly clued in to Biden's decline until after the debate? That's a bit hard to believe, though: At the very least, Special Counsel Robert Hur's claims some months earlier that Biden appeared to be an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" should have set off alarm bells.\n\nWatch my full interview with Parnes and Allen here.\n\nI am joined by Amber Duke to discuss Trump's deportations, the tariffs, Luigi Mangione and the death penalty, and whether Mark Zuckerberg has truly renounced his ways.\n\nNintendo has announced a live-action Legend of Zelda movie , which is theoretically exciting but could disappoint me in just about a thousand different ways. Here, let me list them.\n\nCasting: I am begging Nintendo to be thoughtful about casting and pick actual teenagers to play Link and Zelda, not much older actors who happen to have famous faces. I like Zendaya and Tom Holland as much as everyone else, but can we please be a bit more creative? For Ganondorf, it's OK to ignore this, since he's an older character. My personal choice would be Dev Patel, who definitely has the right look, though he needs to practice his evil cackling and playing the organ . (I would also love to see Martin Short play the Happy Mask Salesman.)\n\nWorld building: This will be tricky. Stray too far from the source material and the production will quickly become some generic fantasy thing, but mirror it too closely and you'll have something that's basically just a video game. Like, should Link talk in this film, unlike in the games? Probably. Should he spend all his time pushing large crates around? Probably not.\n\nStoryline: I imagine the filmmakers intend to come up with their own plot that draws inspiration from the storylines of the games. (This is basically what happened with the largely successful Super Mario Bros. movie.) I would highly encourage them to borrow heavily from the older games that actually had pretty good stories: Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. The two most recent installments, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, are popular despite having very uninspiring plots. (The sole exception being the latter's villainous Yiga clan: Feel free to use them.)\n\nTime travel: Use it! This is an underrated and key aspect of the Zelda games. In several installments, Link uses his unique abilities to transverse parallel dimensions and timelines-exploiting the differences between them to great storytelling effect. For instance, in Ocarina , Link learns about a magic song that created a thunderstorm at an inopportune moment; later, he returns to the past and discovers that he was the one who caused the thunderstorm in the first place. Intriguing! Big film studios love multiverses and doppelgängers and time travel and are probably overusing said storytelling devices at this point; this is a movie that actually calls for them!\n\nBe weird: People like these games because they have personality and their own style. The Yiga clan is the best thing about Tears because they're weird, incompetent ninjas who patrol a vast underground, have ridiculous ACME-reminiscent technology, love bananas, worship frogs, and leave notes everywhere that read: Glory to Master Kohga. That's cool!\n\nActually, Nintendo could avoid all of these potential issues by simply green-lighting the draft script I put together like a decade ago.\n\nThe post Joe Biden's Handlers Definitely Knew.

      "text": "'It's a beautiful day': Joe Biden departs White House for final time as president\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON - And just like that, it was over.\n\nJoe Biden departed the White House for the final time as president on Monday, ending a half-century career in politics that took him from a county council seat in Delaware to the United States Senate, the vice presidency, and ultimately, the highest elected office in the land.\n\nA long motorcade of black limousines and SUVs rolled down the driveway of the White House North Lawn at 10:39 a.m., through the iron gates surrounding the presidential mansion and turned toward the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn the back seat of the presidential limo was Biden, taking his last ride as leader of the free world. Beside him, President-elect Donald Trump , who would take the oath of office and assume the presidency at noon.\n\nFour years ago, Biden made the 10-minute drive to the Capitol without his predecessor.\n\nInauguration live updates: Donald Trump, Joe Biden enter Capitol after traditional meeting\n\nTrump, bitter over his loss to Biden and in denial about his defeat, departed the White House the morning of the inauguration aboard the presidential helicopter. He refused to participate in the ceremonies for the man who would replace him, as previous outgoing presidents have done for decades. He was i n Palm Beach, Florida, when Biden's swearing-in ceremony began.\n\nBiden, however, a believer in traditions and institutions, argued that Americans want to see the peaceful transfer of power. So on Monday, he rode to the Capitol with Trump, whose two nonconsecutive terms will bookend Biden's single, four-year term as president.\n\nAsked by reporters before his departure how he felt, Biden responded: \"Good. It's a beautiful day.\"\n\nThe changing of the guard started early Monday when Biden and first lady Jill Biden greeted Trump and his wife, Melania Trump , at the White House for a ceremonial tea.\n\n\"Welcome home,\" Biden said to Trump as he stepped out of an SUV at the White House North Portico.\n\nThe Trumps walked up the steps of the White House toward its front entrance hand in hand.\n\nMelania Trump arrived at the White House at the start of her husband's first term carrying a Tiffany Blue box that she presented to Barack and Michelle Obama. She was empty-handed on Monday.\n\nAlso notably absent were the hugs and European kisses the Obamas welcomed their replacements with as they presented themselves at the North Portico. While the handoff from the Obamas was strikingly warm, the couples' handshake with the Bidens was decidedly formal.\n\nMore: Donald Trump to declare federal government recognizes two sexes - male and female\n\nTrump fiddled with the button on his overcoat but finally left it unbuttoned as the couples posed for photos. Melania Trump put her hand on her head to keep her hat down as a gust of wind threatened to knock if off as all four headed inside the presidential mansion.\n\nAtop the White House, the American flag flew at hal f -staff i n honor of former President Jimmy Carter , who died last Dec. 29. Trump had protested that the flag ritual would coincide with his inauguration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris ' exit from her Naval Observatory residence was a lower-key affair. She and second gentleman Doug Emhoff said their public goodbyes on Thursday as Harris continued the vice presidential tradition of signing the desk in her Ceremonial Office. Staff and alumni of Harris' operation stuffed themselves into the ornate room.\n\nEvery vice president has used the office, with one exception, since 1960 . It will become JD Vance's workplace next.\n\nHarris lost the 2024 election to Trump after taking over as the Democratic nominee from Biden. Her political future is unclear. She is considering a run for California governor in 2026.\n\n\"It is not my nature to go quietly into the night,\" she said with a laugh at her desk signing. \"So don't worry about that.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said the former California attorney general and U.S. senator would decide what comes next in her career after the inauguration. She and Emhoff will fly to Los Angeles on Monday. The couple own a home in Brentwood, which had been under evacuation orders amidst the wildfires . California will be their primary residence.\n\nFollowing Trump's inauguration , the Bidens and the Trumps walked out of the Capitol's East Front and headed to a waiting Blackhawk military helicopter.\n\nAfter handshakes and farewells, the Bidens boarded the chopper for the short flight to Joint Base Andrews in suburban Maryland, where the now-former president spoke to a cheering crowd of his former staffers.\n\n\"It has been the honor of my life to serve as your president,\" he said.\n\nHe thanked his team \"for the sacrifices you've made\" and \"for being part of this journey.\"\n\n\"Never, never, never give up,\" he said.\n\nBiden left the stage amid chants of \"Thank you, Joe!\" and walked to a waiting blue-and-white 747. He quickly climbed the steps and, just before stepping through the door of the plane, turned one last time and waved goodbye.\n\nThe plane then rolled down the runway and lifted off at 1:56 p.m., carrying Biden - now a private citizen - to a vacation in California.\n\nMichael Collins and Francesca Chambers cover the White House.

      "text": "How a robotic pen could spell the end for Joe Biden's pardons\n\nManage your account\n\nPresidential pardons ordered by Joe Biden could be cancelled because they were signed using a robotic pen, Donald Trump has declared.\n\nThe president said the pardons were \"void, vacant and of no further effect\" because they had been signed by an autopen machine and not Mr Biden himself.\n\nHe added that some pardons may have been authorised by aides without the president's approval, but offered no evidence.\n\nMr Trump's comments raise questions about a raft of eleventh hour pardons signed by Mr Biden before he left office. They include many of Mr Trump's enemies like Liz Cheney, Dr Anthony Fauci and retired general Mark Milley.\n\nHis attempt to unilaterally cancel the pardons has no legal basis, however Mr Trump has been testing the guard-rails of the US judicial system through the appointment of deeply loyal cabinet members.\n\nIn a Monday morning post on Truth Social, the president wrote: \"The 'pardons' that sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force or effect, because of the fact that they were done by autopen.\"\n\n\"In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary pardoning documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden.\" \"He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime.\"\n\nCredit: The Oversight Project\n\nPresidents including Mr Trump have long used autopen to affix their mark to documents that then have the power to transform America and the lives of its citizens. Unlike the common e-signature, the autopen is a robot writing instrument that learns how to mimic and repeat the pen strokes of any individual.\n\nIt can be fitted with any style of pen, including the sharpie favoured by George W Bush. The Heritage Foundation, a Right-leaning Washington-based think tank, last week reported that all of the signatures on Mr Biden's last-minute pardons and other documents dating back to the early days of his term were identical and appeared to be done by autopen. \"Whoever controlled the autopen controlled the presidency,\" the organisation said, suggesting that one of Mr Biden's close-knit circle of aides may have issued orders carrying his signature without the full awareness of the president. Speaking at the Justice Department Building on Friday, Mr Trump suggested that he would not sign executive orders by autopen. \"No 1 - it's disrespectful to the office,\" he said, before adding in reference to Mr Biden. \"No. 2 - maybe it's not even valid because who's getting him to sign? He had no idea what the hell he was doing.\" Mr Trump has used the autopen to sign executive orders in both his terms, according to Fox News analysis. Many orders from his first term on the Federal Register website appear to be done by autopen.\n\nIn Mr Biden's case, however, the autopen probes have re-energised debate about how far the 82-year-old was in control of the White House, as his health visibly deteriorated. The New York Post cited a Biden White House source claiming that one of the president's top aides was \"unilaterally\" deciding what to authorise in the president's name. \"I think [the aide] was using the autopen as standard and past protocol,\" the source told the Post, adding \"There is no clarity on who actually approved what - potus or [the aide].\"\n\nThe paper decided not to publish the aide's name because of a lack of concrete evidence and strenuous denials from several other Biden administration sources.\n\nAndrew Bates, a former senior deputy press secretary in the Biden administration, said the weight of Biden's executive orders signed by autopen was just the same as those issued by Trump.\n\nThe US constitution grants huge leeway to presidents in issuing pardons and sets no clear limits on how they must be authorised.\n\nIn 2024, the federal appeals court ruled that a pardon did not even have to be issued in writing.\n\nMr Bush was the first president criticised for over-using autopen, but he defended himself citing the huge volumes of correspondence required of a president.\n\nBarack Obama became the first president to sign a bill into law via use of the machine, extending the Patriot Act by autopen while he was in Europe.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Trump admitted that the decision whether or not to seek prosecutions of Ms Cheney and other political foes would be \"up to the courts\".\n\nBut the selection of deeply-loyal allies to lead the Department of Justice, FBI and intelligence agencies gives the president greater leverage than his predecessors in attempting to strong-arm his wishes through the judiciary.\n\nDuring his presidency, Mr Biden was carefully managed by a team of advisers who backed the Democrat's desire to seek a second term and attempted to hide his declining mental faculties from the public.\n\nSpeaking to the Wall Street Journal in December last year, Joe Manchin, the former senator for West Virginia, described the inner-circle as the \"eager beavers\".\n\n\"They were going, 'I'll take care of that,'\" Mr Manchin said, claiming that this group had a far greater role in driving the president's agenda than under previous administrations.\n\nCabinet members also told the newspaper that aides would act as a \"go-between\" on issues they felt should have been the president's prerogative.\n\nThe aides would carry their message to the president and then report back on his verdict.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

      "text": "Joe Biden pushes out 99% of 'Investing in America' funds before Donald Trump's return\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON ― The Biden administration has pushed out nearly all available funds from President Joe Biden's signature climate and economic laws as the White House works to ensure his \"Investing in America\" legacy survives the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe federal government has awarded 99% of existing grant funding for clean energy, infrastructure and manufacturing projects, totaling about $750 billion, according to a new 75-page White House report obtained by USA TODAY that breaks down the spending before Biden leaves office Monday.\n\nThe distributed funds include only money available through the 2024 fiscal year ‒ underscoring Biden's reliance on the Trump team to maintain future spending.\n\nBiden touted the progress report ‒ which outlines what Biden calls \"the most significant investment in America since the New Deal\" ‒ during remarks Friday afternoon to mayors gathered in Washington for the U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting.\n\n\"New roads, bridges, clean water, affordable high-speed internet for every American,\" Biden said in one of his final presidential addresses before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in Monday. \"I know each you can cite so many examples of projects in your community. There's thousands of them.\n\n\"We also made the biggest investment in fighting climate change ever in the history of the world ‒ not just America,\" Biden said.\n\n(Read full report here .)\n\nMore: President Biden warns of 'oligarchy' as he bids farewell to five decades in politics\n\nThe awarded grants represent available money in the current fiscal year or earlier from massive spending packages that stretch out a decade: a $1 trillion infrastructure law, $53 billion in subsidies for microchip companies from the CHIPS and Science Act, and about $400 billion for clean-energy projects from the Inflation Reduction Act, including incentives to support the manufacturing of products like electric cars, solar panels and batteries.\n\nAbout 90% of the existing grant funding has been formally obligated, meaning the government has entered into a binding contract with the recipient of the grants.\n\nMore: Tarnished legacy? How Biden's age and refusal to pass torch earlier hang over his exit\n\nTrump has threatened to roll back many Biden policies on climate and energy outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act, which the then-Democratic-controlled Congress approved in 2022 before Republicans took power in the House.\n\nBut the contracting process effectively safeguards many projects. A future administration cannot rescind or withdraw grants awarded to private companies from the CHIPS Act or other laws ‒ even if the funding hasn't gone out ‒ unless the recipient is found in breach of contract, the White House says.\n\nBiden is also betting the clean-energy factories and other projects are so popular in red-leaning districts and states that congressional Republicans will lack the political will to roll back the policies.\n\n\"I think the change that we have seen over the last four years through these investments is really hard to reverse,\" said Natalie Quillian, Biden's outgoing White House deputy chief of staff. \"And I think you're not just seeing it from the federal government, you're seeing it from the private sector. You're seeing it from state government. You're seeing it from local government.\"\n\nThe final spending allocations follow what White House chief of staff Jeff Zients in a White House memo last month called a \"sprint to the finish line\" with Biden charging his administration to award as much funding as possible.\n\nMore: Regrets, precedent and legacy: 7 takeaways from Biden's exclusive interview with USA TODAY\n\nYet as Biden prepares to leave the White House, he has expressed frustration about the disconnect between projects that can take several years to materialize and Americans' immediate economic anxieties about inflation.\n\n\"I think that we would've been a hell of a lot better off had we been able to go much harder at getting some of these projects in the ground quicker,\" Biden told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview earlier this month. \"There are things that are going to create enormous wealth and work out there, but it takes time.\"\n\nThe report on Biden's spending programs breaks down the status of infrastructure and other projects. It also includes projections if the Trump administration carries out the infrastructure spending. Highlights include:\n\n82,000 infrastructure and clean-energy projects underway\n\n200,000 miles of road repairs underway (356,300 miles of highway are on track to be repaired by the end of 2026)\n\n12,300 bridges are under repair (20,800 bridges on track to be repaired by the end of 2026)\n\n18 of the nation's most economically significant bridges have received funding for repairs\n\n1 million lead pipes on track to be replaced by end of 2028\n\n3 million homes and businesses connected to high-speed internet\n\n100 gigawatts of clean energy generation created through clean-energy investments\n\n5,000 miles of major new electric transmission lines erected to improve electric grid resilience\n\n$1 trillion in private-sector investments in clean energy and manufacturing in the United States\n\n299 federally funded electric vehicle charging stations through the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which provides funding to states to expand the nation's EV charger network\n\n207,000 EV chargers are now publicly available nationwide, the White House says, putting the U.S. ahead of Biden's goal for a network of 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030.\n\n300,000 Americans who have received $7,500 tax credits to purchase new electric vehicles or $4,000 tax credit to buy a used electric vehicle\n\n(This article has been updated to include new information.)\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biden awards 99% of 'Investing in America' funds before Trump return"

      "text": "Breaking Down How Much Time Biden Spent on Vacation While President - It's Not 40%\n\nManage your account\n\nA claim popularized by the Republican National Committee that U.S. President Joe Biden spent 40% of his presidency on vacation stretched the truth. The RNC treated partial days outside of the White House as full days on vacation, made outright errors in its calculations and included locations which are not always used as vacation settings in its analysis.\n\nDue to the duties of the office, the president is never truly on vacation. Therefore, Snopes focused on determining how many days Biden spent in a vacation setting, which was about 117 or 118 full days, or about 8% of his presidency, depending on which source you use. Biden also spent an additional 66 partial days in a vacation setting.\n\nA White House spokesperson said Biden works \"every single day.\" His administration's research said Biden spent 60 total weekdays away from the White House with no public events, or about 4.5% of his presidency.\n\nMuch of a president's work schedule is private and not publicly reported. Snopes found 76 to 77 days where Biden spent some or all of his time in a vacation setting and there was no public evidence that he was working, or about 5% of his presidency.\n\nSnopes also determined that Biden spent an additional 109 full days at Camp David or his personal residence in Delaware -- where Biden often works away from the White House -- with no publicly reported events and15 days where the only public events involved campaigning for his re-election.\n\nIn the months after former U.S. President Joe Biden took office in 2021, a claim began circulating that Biden spent 40% of his presidency on vacation.\n\nExamples of this claim appear on Reddit ( archived ), X ( archived ) and Facebook ( archived ). Snopes received questions from readers about this claim as early as October 2021. There are media reports spanning from 2022 ( archived ) to 2024 ( archived ) repeating the rumor. In 2022, the New York Post ( archived ) claimed the rumor originated from a Republican National Committee analysis:\n\nThe 19-month tally of Biden trips was assembled by the RNC and is consistent with independent journalistic counts. It includes days that Biden spent at his Delaware residences as well as days at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, and trips to Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Kiawah Island, South Carolina.\n\nAdditionally, the Republican National Committee published press releases in early 2023 ( archived ) and early 2024 ( screenshot ) claiming Biden had, at those points in time, spent 40% of his presidency on vacation. The RNC also publicized the claim on X ( archived ) in 2024, along with a video of Biden on the beach:\n\nA comprehensive Snopes analysis of Biden's public calendar , research from his administration and pool reports - detailed daily dispatches from the White House press corps tracking Biden's movements - determined that the Republican National Committee stretched the truth. It is difficult to define what a \"vacation\" is for a president, given that the president is never away from his duties. Thus, Snopes determined how many days Biden was in a vacation setting.\n\nBased on this definition, Biden spent 117 or 118 full days of his 1,461-day presidency on vacation, or about 8% of his presidency. He also spent 66 days, about 4.5% of his presidency, partially in a vacation setting.\n\n(The pool reports say Biden left his vacation home early on April 13, 2024, whereas his official public calendar as published by Roll Call, an insider publication which covers all things Capitol Hill, said he spent April 13 in his vacation home and left on April 14, 2024. That would change how many full days Biden was on vacation, but it would not affect the number of partial days he was on vacation.)\n\nAltogether, that is 183 or 184 days - and on 107 of those days, there is public evidence Biden spent time working in his official capacity as president, which does not mean he was not working, as much of the president's working schedule is not public. Thus, there were 76 or 77 days where Biden spent time in a vacation setting with no public evidence he was working, or about 5% of his presidency.\n\nHere's what Jake Schneider, author of the two RNC press releases, said in an X direct message when Snopes asked how he determined that Biden spent 40% of his presidency on vacation:\n\nI'm happy to share my underlying data with you. Basically, we use the standard of all or part of any day spent at a Biden-style vacation destination (e.g., Wilmington/Rehoboth/Camp David/etc) as a vacation day - which is the exact same standard The Washington Post assigned to President Trump during his first term.\n\nSchneider did not return additional questions about what sources he used to figure out Biden's location and how he decided what a vacation setting was. The RNC press releases also provide images showing each day Biden was purportedly on vacation for 2021, 2022 and 2023.\n\nCalendars created by the Republican National Committee claiming to show when Biden was on vacation. (Republican National Committee/Snopes Illustration)\n\nBut an investigation by Snopes found that the RNC's analysis made sweeping assumptions and included outright errors.\n\nAs acknowledged by Schneider, the RNC included partial days in a vacation setting. However, the party's analysis failed to take into account how much or how little time in the day was spent traveling to or in a vacation setting.\n\nFor example, on September 3, 2021, the RNC calendar says Biden was on vacation. But according to Biden's public calendar, he spent most of that day in Louisiana touring Hurricane Ida relief efforts, meeting local leaders and delivering remarks in his official capacity as president. He does not leave Louisiana until 7:08 p.m. local time, or 8:08 p.m. EST, before arriving at his personal residence in Delaware at 11:11 p.m. In another example, the RNC claimed Biden was on vacation on Sept. 11, 2022, when he arrived at the Pentagon around 8:46 a.m. and spent most of the day at 9/11 remembrance events.\n\nThe RNC said Biden was on vacation on days when he arrived at the White House early in the morning or departed for a vacation setting late in the day. In one instance, the RNC said Biden was on vacation on April 22, 2022 when he was working and according to the pool report , did not arrive in Delaware until 12:24 a.m. the next day. In another instance, the RNC said he was on vacation on Sept. 13, 2022, when he left the White House to travel to Delaware and vote before returning to the White House, all on the same day.\n\nOn some days , Biden spent some time in Delaware visiting gravestones or attending private memorial services to commemorate deceased loved ones, such as his son or his first wife, and the RNC included them as \"vacation\" days.\n\nThe RNC also did not appear to have double-checked its work. On Aug. 13, 2022, for example, the RNC said Biden was on vacation, but according to his public calendar and the pool report , he was at the White House all day. On the flip side, the president left for Camp David on Aug. 17, 2023 , but the RNC does not note this. Errors like these occurred several times.\n\nFinally, the RNC analysis included days spent at Camp David or at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. According to the White House , Camp David, a Maryland country residence, \"has offered every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt an opportunity for solitude and tranquility, as well as an ideal place to work and host foreign dignitaries.\"\n\nThus, while sometimes used for recreation, presidents, including Biden, often work at Camp David, where he has reportedly met with his national security team, signed executive orders and hosted prime ministers.\n\nBiden spent many weekends as president at his residence in Wilmington, Delaware, a practice he's had since his time as a senator, according to both the White House and news reports. A White House official told Snopes that Biden does not treat his Wilmington residence as a vacation home.\n\nBased on Biden's public calendar and pool reports, Biden frequently works from Wilmington. On May 30, 2021, for example, he delivered remarks at Veterans Memorial Park in New Castle Country, Delaware; on Aug. 6, 2021 , he leaves the White House and arrives in Delaware before receiving his weekly economic briefing. He has hosted multiple foreign prime ministers at his Delaware home on the same day.\n\nFinally, Biden has a vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware that he frequents, suggesting that if Biden was to return to Delaware for vacation, he would go there instead.\n\nWhile Camp David and Wilmington are not always vacation settings, Snopes could not determine how often Biden may have treated them as such. Snopes found that Biden spent 109 full days in Delaware or Camp David with no evidence of work on his public calendar or in pool reports, or 7.5% of his presidency.\n\nHere are all of the vacation settings Snopes included in its analysis: Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden's annual Thanksgiving tradition where he and his family travel to Nantucket, Massachusetts, vacations in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, Kiawah Island Golf Resort in South Carolina, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and a friend's home in Santa Ynez, California.\n\nAndrew Bates, the Biden White House's deputy press secretary, said in an emailed statement that \"President Biden works hard every single day - including the few days he has been on vacation during his term - which is reflected in the most accomplished record of any modern administration.\"\n\nHe added that presidents \"have been able to perform all their duties from anywhere in the world for decades.\"\n\nAccording to an Aug. 19, 2024 pool report , Biden's press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when discussing his then-upcoming vacation to Santa Ynez, California, also said \"presidents are never on vacation - he's president wherever he is.\"\n\nThere is evidence that Biden works while on vacation. On June 3, 2022 , for example, he delivered remarks on a May jobs report from Rehoboth Beach Convention Center. There was also a weekend in September 2022 where he told the press pool he was at his Rehoboth home because the Secret Service was working on his Wilmington home and he was thus \"not on vacation.\"\n\nResearch presented by a White House official said there were 60 total weekdays from 2021 to 2024 where Biden \"had no public events and was not at the White House,\" or about 4.1% of his presidency. The Biden administration did not include weekends and federal holidays in its analysis and added that this list does not represent total days in vacation areas.\n\nIt is also worth noting that within those 60 weekdays, there were days the White House noted that Biden had public events not on his public calendar but noted in pool reports, such as briefings on foreign wars and bill signings. Snopes also cross-referenced this list with Biden's public calendar and discovered that the White House included days in which Biden had his \"Daily Briefing,\" an event that nearly always appears on weekdays on Biden's public calendar but is not open to the public.\n\nWhile the White House did not return multiple questions about whether, legally or officially, the president gets weekends and federal holidays off, it is true that presidents cannot fully disengage from their job. \"Most presidents are always on the clock; even when they are not working, they are on call, and can be pulled into discussions at a moment's notice,\" said Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University.\n\nIt is impossible for Snopes to determine how many days Biden was on vacation and did not do any work or primarily spent time away from work. According to Dallek, presidents do \"a ton of work\" not visible to the public or on their official public schedule, including \"behind-the-scenes conversations, briefings, reading memos, preparing for speeches, prepping for interviews and more.\"\n\n\"A president taking a vacation is a bit of misnomer, although some presidents take the job more seriously and work harder than others,\" Dallek added.\n\nTherefore, we can only determine how many days Biden was in a vacation setting, as well as days he was in a vacation setting and there is no public evidence, either from his public calendar or from pool reports, that Biden was working.\n\nMany of these \"working vacation\" days only included one or two publicly reported events and were usually noted in the pool report as information given by unnamed White House officials. Snopes did not include informal conversations Biden had with the press as work, given that it is nearly impossible for the president to avoid press in public areas.\n\nAs noted at the beginning, our analysis found 117 or 118 full days of his presidency on vacation and 76 days partially in a vacation setting, with 107 of the total 183 or 184 days showing evidence that Biden worked. There are 33 of these days where the public calendar does not show evidence Biden worked, but the pool reports say a White House official told a reporter that Biden was engaging in at least one work activity, such as a call with a foreign leader or a national security meeting.\n\nSnopes did not include days Biden traveled for work as well as days Biden was campaigning for other lawmakers and officials because campaigning for others is part of building and maintaining working relationships, as well as an attempt to ensure that your party remains in power and can pass its desired legislation more effectively.\n\nHowever, Snopes did determine how many days Biden campaigned for himself because some may consider that time away from presidential duties. There were 15 days Biden campaigned for himself and there were no events on his public calendar; 14 of those days did not have work events recorded by the press pool. For 62 days, Biden spent some time campaigning; 57 of those days were also spent working and five of those days were also spent in a vacation setting.\n\nBeven, J., Hagen, A. and Berg, R. (2021).

Some thought he seemed, at times, disoriented or in a fog.\n\nThe effort to work around Biden's decline was a tightly coordinated affair, based on the report.\n\nAides had Biden use a teleprompter all the time-even for small fundraisers in donors' homes. They also shortened the steps the president used to board Air Force One.\n\nAt the same time, Biden's team scolded reporters for coverage of the president's age-related challenges, and convinced allies to write articles and social media posts pushing back on the negative press.\n\nAll the while, Biden's own pride fueled a mission to prove his vitality.\n\nSometimes his efforts backfired. For instance, after breaking his foot shortly before his inauguration, Biden declined to wear an orthopedic boot, fearing it would make him look weak. The Times reported that the injury, which never healed correctly, caused a shuffling gait that persisted throughout his presidency.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Beast's request for comment on the Times ' report.\n\nBiden only dropped out of the race for the presidency in July, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. In the wake of Kamala Harris' loss to Trump in November, many observers suggested that the outcome might have been different had Biden stepped aside sooner.\n\nIn an interview with USA Today earlier this month, Biden maintained that he could have beaten Trump, even as he acknowledged that his age was an issue.\n\n\"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,\" he said."

      "text": "Democrats fretted behind the scenes about Biden's decline despite public confidence, new book claims\n\nManage your account\n\nDemocrats had major concerns about former President Joe Biden's decline and cognitive abilities ahead of his June debate against President Donald Trump , despite publicly maintaining that the former president was fit to serve another four years, according to a new book by reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes.\n\n\"Publicly, Democrats scoffed at Republican claims that Biden wasn't up to the job,\" Allen and Parnes wrote. \"But privately, some of them worried all along that they were putting too much stock in an old man who, at best, had long since lost his fastball.\"\n\nAllen, a senior politics reporter at NBC News, and Parnes, a senior political correspondent for The Hill, wrote a book set to be published in April titled, \"FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" about the 2024 election. The Hill published a report on Monday based on excerpts from the new book.\n\nThe reporters revealed that the former president's team had put extensive precautions in place to hide Biden's decline and had several plans in place if the president died while in office or if he chose to step aside, according to The Hill.\n\nBiden Insider Expresses How White House 'Gaslit' The Public About Former President's Decline\n\nAllen and Parnes reported in their book that Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., was worried about Biden's decline in June 2023, after speaking to the president at a White House event.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\nThe authors revealed that Biden did not immediately recognize Swalwell, according to the report, and that the California Democrat needed to remind the former president of who he was with personal details.\n\nAllen and Parnes also reported that the president met with a makeup artist every morning, prior to travel and before calls with his aides, to cover up visible signs of aging.\n\nThe president also occasionally canceled the briefings that followed his makeup appointments, according to the book.\n\nAnother excerpt of the book published by The Hill revealed that Biden had repeatedly urged former Vice President Kamala Harris not to break with him on certain policies.\n\n\"He would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win. But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: let there be no daylight between us,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"But the day of the debate Biden called to give Harris an unusual kind of pep talk - and another reminder about the loyalty he demanded. No longer able to defend his own record, he expected Harris to protect his legacy,\" Allen and Parnes continued.\n\n\"Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him - especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans. To the extent that she wanted to forge her own path, Biden had no interest in giving her room to do so,\" they wrote.\n\nRep. Swalwell's office and Biden's team did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nOriginal article source: Democrats fretted behind the scenes about Biden's decline despite public confidence, new book claims"

      "text": "Biden promises 'peaceful transfer of power' amid Democratic blame game\n\nUS President Joe Biden has vowed to ensure a \"peaceful and orderly transition\" to his Republican predecessor and now successor, Donald Trump.\n\n\"We accept the choice the country made,\" the Democrat said, repeating that he believes \"you can't love your country only when you win\".\n\nBiden also saluted Vice-President Kamala Harris as \"a partner and a public servant\" who ran an \"inspiring\" campaign after he dropped out.\n\nHis first public remarks after Tuesday's election, in the White House's Rose Garden, came as Democrats in Washington began seeking someone to blame for Harris's large loss to Trump.\n\nSome Democrats have blamed Biden for Harris's election loss, suggesting that he should have dropped out of the race sooner or that the 81-year-old should never have run for a second term at all.\n\nThe incumbent sought to balance a conciliatory tone with a message of reassurance, after a bleak campaign season where Harris frequently said that a Trump victory would threaten democracy and Trump often described the US as a \"nation in decline\" and a \"failed nation\".\n\nAmerican democracy is \"the greatest experiment in self-government in the world\" and \"the will of the people always prevails\", Biden said.\n\n\"We lost this battle,\" he said. \"The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back.\"\n\nIn the comments before a crowd of White House staff and top members of his administration, Biden took on an issue that may have cost Harris the White House: the economy.\n\nVoters in the swing states that decided the election listed the economy as a top issue driving them to the polls, and Trump in his rallies cast Biden as directly responsible for inflation spiking to a 40-year high in June 2022.\n\nWhile Harris pointed to the steep recession when Trump was in office and significant improvements in inflation, she could not win over Trump voters who said they felt better about the economy during his first term.\n\nBut Biden said supporters should be proud of his \"historic\" term that had left behind \"the strongest economy in the world\" and \"over $1tn worth of infrastructure work done\".\n\n\"I know people are still hurting, but things are changing rapidly,\" he said.\n\nPromising to work with Trump's transition team without delay, Biden said it was time to \"bring down the temperature\" in the country.\n\n\"I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system,\" he said, a a nod to the president-elect's unproven allegations of fraud after his defeat in 2020, which led many to riot on 6 January 2021.\n\n\"It is honest, it is fair, it is transparent and it can be trusted, win or lose.\"\n\nBiden was the first incumbent to not compete for re-election since Lyndon Johnson in 1968.\n\nHis approval rating as president has been in negative territory for more than three years -  since his administration's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. On top of that, a majority of voters, including most Democrats, have expressed concerns over his advanced age in a steady stream of polls.\n\nBut the Democrat launched his re-election bid in April 2023 with a promise to \"finish the job\".\n\nTypically, political parties do not follow a strenuous primary process when they control the White House and Biden did not have to face campaigns from serious rivals or debates to become the 2024 Democratic nominee. More than 14 million Americans voted for him during the Democratic primaries.\n\nThen, in June 2024, Biden frequently lost his train of thought and meandered through several responses in a debate with Trump watched by millions on live television.\n\nA month later, after a public push from Democratic heavyweights, he withdrew his candidacy and endorsed his vice-president. The election was a little more than three months away.\n\nDemocrats are trying to make sense of how they could win in 2020 and then lose four years later to the same opponent. Biden is not the only person being put at fault.\n\nSome are saying Harris was a weak candidate who struggled with media appearances. Others say her campaign was heavy on celebrity involvement but light on policy substance.\n\nOne-time Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and others have suggested Harris erred in picking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, an older progressive, as her running mate instead of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a more youthful, Jewish-American moderate.\n\nIndependent Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2016 and 2020, blasted the party itself, putting out a lengthy statement that accused it  of abandoning working people.\n\n\"While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\" he wrote. \"And they're right.\"\n\nBut Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison responded on X that the accusation was \"straight up BS\", saying Biden was \"the most-pro worker President of my life time\".\n\nRitchie Torres, a moderate New York congressman, blamed \"the far left, which has managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and Jews from the Democratic Party with absurdities like 'Defund the Police' or 'From the River to the Sea' or 'Latinx'\".\n\nMeanwhile, in his first public remarks since winning the election President-elect Donald Trump doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants.\n\nTrump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border \"strong and powerful\", and that the cost of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants would not be a deterrent.\n\n\"It's not a question of a price tag. It's not - really, we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC News.\n\n\"When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here.

      "text": "What Biden quitting means for Harris, the Democrats and Trump\n\nJoe Biden has turned the US election on its head. After fiercely insisting for weeks that he would remain the Democratic nominee for president, he has bowed to pressure and dropped out of the race.\n\nHere's what it means for Vice-President Kamala Harris, for the Democrats more broadly and for Donald Trump.\n\nThe prospects for Kamala Harris being the Democratic nominee have received a big boost with Joe Biden's endorsement.\n\nHe gave her his full backing, calling his decision to make her vice-president four years ago the best he ever made.\n\nShe responded by saying she was honoured to have his endorsement and would do everything possible to win the nomination.\n\nIt is possible that most Democrats will follow the president's lead and fall in line behind the vice-president to avoid ongoing uncertainty less than a month from the Democratic convention.\n\nThere are practical and political reasons for doing so.\n\nShe is next in the constitutional line of succession. The optics of passing over the first black woman on a presidential ticket would be terrible for the party. She would also immediately have access to the roughly $100 million in funds the campaign has raised so far.\n\nBut there are also risks. Public opinion surveys show Harris' approval ratings are about as low as his. And in head-to-head matchups against Donald Trump, she fares roughly the same as Biden.\n\nSecond is that Harris has had a sometimes rocky time as vice-president. Early in the administration, she was given the task of addressing the root causes of the migration crisis at the US-Mexico border.\n\nThat's a daunting challenge, and a number of missteps and misstatements opened her up to criticism. She's also been the administration's point person on abortion rights, which has been a topic she has much more effectively handled. But those first impressions have stuck.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, Harris has already run for national office - her 2020 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination - and stumbled badly.\n\nWhile she surged early, a combination of fumbled interviews, a lack of clearly defined vision and a poorly managed campaign led her to drop out before even the earliest primaries.\n\nOpting for Harris is a risk for Democrats, but at this point there are no safe options. And the stakes - a possible Donald Trump victory - are as high as they get.\n\nOver the past half-century, political conventions have been transformed into somewhat boring affairs. With every minute carefully scripted for television, they've become extended multi-day commercials for the presidential nominee.\n\nLast week's Republican convention was certainly that way - even with Donald Trump's overly long, sometimes rambling nomination acceptance speech.\n\nNext month's Democratic convention in Chicago is shaping up to be very, very different. Whatever script the party and the Biden campaign had been working on just got thrown out the window. Even if the party falls in line behind Harris, it will be difficult to plan - and control - how things unfold on the convention floor.\n\nAnd if Harris doesn't succeed in uniting the party, the convention could turn into a political free-for-all, with various candidates vying for the nomination before the cameras and behind closed doors.\n\nIt could make for gripping political theatre, live and unpredictable, in a way the American public has never before witnessed.\n\nThis year's Republican convention was a carefully calibrated machine, promoting the party's most popular agenda items and focusing criticism on one man, President Joe Biden.\n\nIt turns out, the Republicans were targeting the wrong guy.\n\nWith the news of Biden's abandoning of his re-election campaign, the Republican game plan spearheaded by Donald Trump has been turned on its head.\n\nThe Republicans spent an entire week of carefully scripted events focusing on the wrong weaknesses of the Democrat opposing them.\n\nThe campaign had highlighted their candidate's strength and vitality by giving him a raucous entrance, preceded by appearances by former wrestler Hulk Hogan and Ultimate Fighting Championship impresario Dana White, as well as a performance by Kid Rock.\n\nThe attempts at contrast with Mr Biden's perceived frailty - and the strategy to peel away younger male voters - were obvious.\n\nBut in any scenario now, the Democratic nominee is going to be someone much younger than the president.\n\nA strategy of strong vs frail against Vice-President Kamala Harris or one of the more youthful Democratic governors who are mentioned as possible Biden successors just won't pack the same punch.\n\nIf Harris is the nominee, expect the Republicans to try to tie her to the perceived failings of the current administration. For months they have called her the \"border czar\".\n\nAlthough the former prosecutor is by no means from the progressive wing of the party, previous Republican attacks on her suggest they may also paint her as \"radical left\".\n\nNo matter who the nominee is, the Republicans are sure to blame the Democrats for covering up Biden's age-related weaknesses - and putting the nation at risk.\n\nAt this point, everyone is flying blind with just a few months until the first presidential ballots are cast.\n\nDo you have any questions? We will be answering a selection of them.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Biden under new pressure from top Democrats as Covid halts campaign\n\nPresident Joe Biden faces new questions over his candidacy in the November election - with his campaign events currently on pause due to a Covid-19 infection.\n\nThe top two Democrats in the US Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are both reported to have met him individually to express concerns over his bid for the White House.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has also privately told him that he cannot beat Donald Trump in November's election, according to CNN.\n\nMr Biden's re-election attempt was already being buffeted by growing dissent among top Democrats after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last month.\n\nAnnouncing his Covid infection on Wednesday, Mr Biden's press secretary said the 81-year-old was facing mild symptoms.\n\nHe would isolate at his home in Delaware while carrying out \"all of his duties fully\", said Karine Jean-Pierre. She added that the president was vaccinated and boosted. He has tested positive for Covid twice before.\n\nMr Biden was seen earlier in the day visiting supporters in Las Vegas and speaking at an event. He was forced to cancel a speech later in the day at UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organisation.\n\nIt marked a sudden and debilitating end to a trip that was supposed to see Mr Biden hitting the campaign trail again with full force - after the pause sparked by the attempted assassination of his rival Trump.\n\nThe president had spent time in Las Vegas trying to revive his appeal among Hispanic voters, with whom his poll lead has slipped since 2020.\n\nLater on Wednesday, he was seen moving slowly and cautiously up the steps to Air Force One. He was not wearing a mask. As he boarded the plane, he was heard to say: \"Good, I feel good.\"\n\nMr Biden has faced growing calls to withdraw from the election race in recent weeks.\n\nDuring their separate private meetings with Mr Biden which took place last week, Mr Schumer and Mr Jeffries expressed concerns that his presence at the top of the November election ticket could hurt their chances for controlling either chamber in Congress, according to multiple reports.\n\nAfter the reports, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said: \"The president told both leaders he is the nominee of the party, he plans to win, and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mr Jeffries said, \"it was a private conversation that will remain private\".  Mr Schumer's office called the reporting \"idle speculation\" but added the Democratic leader \"conveyed the views of his caucus directly to President Biden\".\n\nMs Pelosi, too, is said by CNN to have told the president in a recent conversation that polling suggested he could harm the Democrats' chances of winning the House in November.\n\nThe president pushed back, at which point Ms Pelosi asked for input on key data from the president's long-time adviser, according to CNN, which cited four sources briefed on the call.\n\nIt is not clear when the conversation took place. Ms Pelosi's office told CNN she had not been in touch with the president since Friday.\n\nAbout two dozen Democratic politicians have publicly called for Mr Biden to step aside in recent weeks, including Adam Schiff, a congressman from California who has called on Mr Biden to \"pass the torch\".\n\nMr Schiff said Mr Biden \"has been one of the most consequential presidents in our nation's history\", and he could \"secure his legacy of leadership\" by allowing another Democrat to step forward.\n\nIn an interview with BET, Mr Biden said he did not feel he could pass the mantle with the country so \"divided\".\n\nThe president also said, for the first time, that he would consider dropping out of the race if any of his doctors said he had a \"medical condition\".\n\nBefore the announcement of Mr Biden's infection on Wednesday, reporters on the Las Vegas trip said they had been rushed off the site of a campaign stop at a Mexican restaurant to the city's airport following the announcement.\n\nThe restaurant had been ablaze with colour, with Mexican art and guitars hanging from the walls and banners draped from the ceiling. One wall was adorned with \"Biden-Harris\" posters.\n\nAs ceiling fans swirled on low speed and Latino pop played quietly from the speakers, Mr Biden walked in via the kitchen door - which was flanked by a Secret Service detail - and entered a main dining area.\n\nHe shook hands with diners - who had clearly been prepared some time in advance for his arrival - kissed one and had selfies taken with others.\n\nThe president seemed somewhat stiffer and appeared slower than the day before, when he had given an energised performance in a speech to a national civil rights group.\n\nCommenting later in the day on his Covid infection, the president's doctor Kevin O'Connor said Mr Biden had presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including a runny nose and a cough, and had been given his first dose of Paxlovid.\n\nHe felt fine during his first event of the day but later tested positive, Dr O'Connor said.\n\nMr Biden posted on X to thank everyone for \"the well wishes\" and said he would \"work to get the job done for the American people\" while in recovery.\n\nIn another post on his account, he stated: \"I'm sick\" before going on to write \"... of Elon Musk and his rich buddies trying to buy this election. And if you agree, pitch in here\".\n\nThe tweet pointed to a donations portal.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

      "text": "Biden ends re-election bid, upending White House race\n\nUS President Joe Biden has ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic candidate, in an extraordinary decision that upends an already dramatic race for the White House.\n\nMr Biden, 81, said in a Sunday written statement that it was the \"greatest honour\" to serve but his withdrawal was \"in the best interest of my party and the country\".\n\nThe announcement caps a tumultuous period in US politics, which began with his sometimes incoherent debate performance against Donald Trump on 27 June. Mr Biden says he will remain president until January.\n\nMs Harris, 59, said that she was \"honoured\" to be endorsed, adding she would \"earn and win this nomination\" and unite the country against Trump.\n\n\"We have 107 days until election day,\" she said. \"Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nWhile Ms Harris has been picking up endorsements from many big figures in the party, she is yet to be officially nominated, and that may not happen until the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nA resurgent Trump meanwhile has pulled ahead in polling and was confirmed as Republican nominee at the party's convention in Milwaukee this week, five days after surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nIn the wake of Mr Biden's decision, he declared the president \"was not fit to run... and is certainly not fit to serve\". Other senior Republicans joined him in their criticism, and called on Mr Biden to leave the White House immediately, not just the Democratic candidacy.\n\nSources told the BBC that even senior White House staff and campaign officials were told of Mr Biden's decision only moments before the statement was released on Sunday afternoon, although the president had spoken to Ms Harris and a handful of others beforehand.\n\nDozens of senior Democrats and grandees including former president Barack Obama, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately praised the decision and lauded Mr Biden's accomplishments in office.\n\nFormer president Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton said they backed Kamala Harris as the party's candidate for November's vote, saying they would \"fight with everything we've got to elect her\".\n\nWhile Mr Obama stated that he had \"extraordinary confidence\" that an \"outstanding nominee emerges\", he did not explicitly back Ms Harris or any other candidate.\n\nMs Pelosi has not commented.\n\nPeter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an \"open process\" to nominate Harris.\n\nBut there are already signs that many in the party will unify behind her, including from  high-profile politicians who had been touted as potential rivals for the nomination in the event Mr Biden stepped aside.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, who is believed to have presidential ambitions, praised Mr Biden as \"selfless\" and said he backed the \"fearless\" and \"tenacious\" Ms Harris to face Trump.\n\nJosh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, said he would do \"everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States\".\n\nPete Buttigieg, the current transport secretary and a former presidential contender, said Mr Biden was \"one of the most consequential presidents in American history\", adding he would do \"all that I can to help elect Kamala Harris the next President.\"\n\nGretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, stated that her job \"will remain the same... doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee meanwhile filed to amend the names of its fundraising committees to the Harris Victory Fund and Harris Action Fund.\n\nTwo major Democratic donors - LinkedIn co-funder Reid Hoffman and investor Alexander Soros - publicly endorsed Harris.\n\nAnd within an hour of Mr Biden's announcement, the pro-Trump super-PAC campaign fund Make America Great Again posted an advert attacking Ms Harris, claiming \"she covered up Joe's obvious mental decline\" .\n\nTrump added: \"Whoever the Left puts up now will just be more of the same.\"\n\nMr Biden had faced intense scrutiny since his debate performance in June. Less than two weeks ago, he hosted a high-profile summit with Nato leaders in Washington.\n\nThe occasion did little to calm nerves within his own party, with him mistakenly introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"President Putin\" , and appearing to refer to Ms Harris as \"Vice President Trump\".\n\nAt one point he told an interviewer that only the \"Lord Almighty\" could make him withdraw, but then later said he would consider doing so if he had a health condition. On Friday, while in isolation after testing positive for Covid, he said he would return to the campaign trail in the coming week.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, Mr Biden thanked his Ms Harris, saying she was an \"extraordinary partner\".\n\n\"And let me express my heartfelt appreciation for the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me,\" his statement added.\n\n\"I believe today and always have: that there is nothing America can't do - when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\"\n\nOfficials from the Democratic National Committee held an emergency meeting on Sunday evening.\n\nThe focus will now be on the party's national convention, which is scheduled to start on 19 August.\n\nMr Biden swept the party's primaries, meaning that the delegates representing each state at the convention were pledged to vote for him - although they are now expected to be released to vote for another candidate.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Convention spotlight shines on Biden - with speech he never wanted to give\n\nIt was not the speech Joe Biden wanted to give. At least, not this year, under these circumstances.\n\nBut if anyone knows how quickly fortunes can change, it's this president - whose personal and professional life has been scarred by tragedy and adversity.\n\nSpeaking to a packed arena in Chicago on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Mr Biden offered a full-throated defence of his presidency - touching on many of the themes that he campaigned on in 2020 and again this year before abandoning his re-election bid in mid-July, a few weeks after a catastrophic debate performance.\n\n\"Like many of you, I gave my heart and soul to this nation,\" he said, towards the end of a nearly hour-long address punctuated by raucous shouts of \"Thank you, Joe\".\n\nMr Biden had walked out onto the stage after being introduced by his daughter Ashley and wife, Jill, who told the audience she \"saw him dig deep into his soul\" when he decided to exit the presidential race.\n\nAfter hugging Ashley, he put a tissue to his eyes to dab away the tears.\n\nThe president touched his heart, and stood a little straighter at the lectern, flashing a toothy smile as the crowd continued to cheer.\n\nHis speech had a keen eye on his place in history but he spent time singing the praises of his vice-president - the woman he hopes will succeed him in the White House.\n\n\"Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee and it's the best decision I made my whole career,\" he said. \"She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity.\"\n\nUnlike his Oval Office address four weeks ago, Mr Biden did not speak directly of passing the torch to a new generation - but the message was clear enough. After the president concluded his remarks, Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff came out to embrace Mr Biden and his wife, Jill.\n\n\"I love you,\" the vice-president mouthed to Mr Biden after their hug.\n\nWhile Mr Biden spent much of the end of his speech focusing on Ms Harris - a tacit acknowledgment that how she fares against Donald Trump in November's vote could make or break how history, and his party, remembers him - many of the evening's earlier speakers directed their tributes to the current White House resident.\n\nIt started with a planned - but unannounced - appearance by Ms Harris herself, who took the stage to thunderous applause.\n\n\"Joe, thank you for your historic leadership and for your lifetime of service to our nation and for all you continue to do,\" she said. \"We are forever grateful to you.\"\n\nLater, Delaware Senator Chris Coons - one of Mr Biden's closest allies - took his turn singing the president's praises.\n\n\"I've never known a more compassionate man than Joe Biden,\" he said. \"I've never known a man who has taken from his own loss and his own faith and delivered so much for the future of so many others.\"\n\nHillary Clinton offered her own tribute when she appeared on stage earlier in the evening, telling the crowd that Mr Biden had \"brought dignity, decency and competence back to the White House\".\n\nThe 2016 Democratic nominee received an extended ovation, and she noted that while she did not break the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" by becoming the first woman president, \"on the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office\".\n\nThe reception Mr Biden received from the packed Democratic convention hall was equally electric. The Democrats here in Chicago have been jubilant all day. But the cheers for the president could be as much a sign of gratitude for his grudging decision to step aside as it was a tribute to a storied political career that began in 1972 when he was first elected to Congress at the age of 29.\n\nTomorrow, Barack Obama will address the convention crowd. On Wednesday, Bill Clinton will have his turn. Both are former presidents who stood for - and won - re-election.\n\nMr Biden will not have that opportunity. Instead, he was left to define and defend his legacy as a one-term president in a speech that, barring a major national event in the next five months, will be his final address to a massive American television audience.\n\nToward the end of the speech, he quoted a line from a song, American Anthem.\n\n\"Let me know in my heart when my days are through, that America, America, I gave my best to you,\" he said.\n\nThe crowd erupted in another round of applause.\n\nEight years ago, Mr Biden passed up a presidential bid in favour of Mrs Clinton - under some not so subtle pressure from Mr Obama. Four years ago, he won the nomination, but the Covid pandemic denied him an opportunity to bask in adulation of a packed Democratic convention hall and the celebratory post-speech balloon drop.\n\nThis, then, was as close to a Democratic convention moment in the spotlight Mr Biden will get.\n\nAfter his speech concluded - past midnight on the US east coast - the president left the arena and headed to Air Force One for a flight to California for a holiday. His time in Chicago, at this Democratic National Convention, was measured in hours, not days. And despite his desires just a few months ago, his remaining time as president will be measured in months, not years.\n\nDNC: What else to expect at the Democratic National Convention\n\nSIMPLE GUIDE: Everything you need to know about the vote\n\nSWING STATES: Where the election could be won and lost\n\nEXPLAINER: RFK Jr and other candidates outside the major parties\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Who are the Democrats calling time on Joe Biden?\n\nJoe Biden's campaign has been thrust into a pressure cooker of doubt, as panic and worry about his election chances pour in from the highest levels of the Democratic party.\n\nIn recent days, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all reportedly expressed concerns in private to Mr Biden about his candidacy.\n\nEven his former running mate, former President Barack Obama, has reportedly said Mr Biden's chances of winning the election have greatly diminished.\n\nA 6 July letter from high-ranking congressman Jamie Raskin was made public on Thursday, where the Maryland representative compared the president to a baseball pitcher whose arm has \"tired out\".\n\nMr Biden, 81, has repeatedly and defiantly declared he is \"not going anywhere\", urging his party to refocus on the task of defeating Donald Trump.\n\nBut the calls to exit are nearing a crescendo as Democratic politicians, donors and voters speak out against the president's candidacy.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the Capitol are coming out in growing numbers against the idea of Mr Biden staying in the race.\n\nIt began five days after the June 27 debate with Lloyd Doggett, a 15-term Texas congressman, who said that it was time for Mr Biden to \"make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw\".\n\nMr Doggett, 77, who sits on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said he respected \"all that President Biden has achieved\" but that the Democrat had failed to \"effectively defend his many accomplishments\" on the debate stage.\n\nOnly three members of the Senate have so far publicly called for Mr Biden to drop out. They are Peter Welch of Vermont, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Montana's Jon Tester , who is fighting for re-election.\n\nThey have been joined by House colleagues including the likes of Adam Schiff , California's likely next senator, and several members in tight re-election races of their own. The others are:\n\nOther prominent figures have also joined the growing chorus:\n\nSenior Democrats, including party leaders in Washington, have parsed their tongues in public on whether Mr Biden should continue his 2024 bid.\n\nNancy Pelosi , the former House Speaker, had previously declined to directly answer whether she wanted him to keep running. She did so on MSNBC's Morning Joe, the president's favourite news programme.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said, adding that \"time is running short\" for him to make that call.\n\nCNN reported that since then, Mrs Pelosi had met with Mr Biden privately and told him that polls show he cannot win in November. She later slammed the reporting as a \"feeding frenzy\", but did not deny that a conversation with Mr Biden had taken place.\n\nHer replacement as House Democratic chief, Hakeem Jeffries , and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have reportedly also met Mr Biden to privately express both their concerns about his ability to win re-election and the potential impact of his candidacy on Democratic hopes of controlling the House and Senate.\n\nMany politicians have declined to outright call for Mr Biden's removal, while expressing respect for his record and raising concerns over his campaign's poor standing.\n\nPatty Murray , of Washington state, said Mr Biden \"must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump\". Michael Bennet , of Colorado, warned that Mr Trump was on track to win \"by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House\".

      "text": "Biden's family urges him to stay in White House race\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden's family has urged him to ignore calls to step aside following his disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nHe spent Sunday with relatives at a presidential retreat where they encouraged him to keep fighting, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\n\nAnxiety has gripped sections of his party following a rambling and at times incoherent performance in Atlanta.\n\nPolls since then suggest concerns about his age - he is 81 - have increased.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday indicated that 72% of registered voters believe the president does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. Nearly half of Democratic voters said he should step aside.\n\nBut the message from his campaign team and his family is that he remains the party's best hope to defeat Trump.\n\nThe family gathering at Camp David in Maryland had been previously scheduled as a photoshoot by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz. Mr Biden's wife Jill, his children and grandchildren were among those present.\n\nJill Biden told Vogue magazine in a phone call from Camp David that they \"will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he's been president\".\n\nThey would continue fighting, she said, adding that her husband \"will always do what's best for the country\".\n\nThe encouragement of the family to stay the course was first reported by the New York Times and later confirmed by CBS News.\n\nSome relatives have reportedly blamed his poor performance on over-preparation by his aides. A person close to Jill Biden told CBS she was not among those criticising his team.\n\nConcerns about the age of both candidates - Mr Biden is only three years older than Trump who is 78 - were present before Thursday's debate.\n\nBut Mr Biden's weak voice and muddled answers renewed concerns about his candidacy and left some calling for him to step aside.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board said in an opinion piece that the \"greatest public service [Biden] can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election\".\n\nTrump was also criticised for his performance - he made a number of false assertions including his long-held grievance that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nOn Sunday, top Democrats appeared on the morning shows to defend the president.\n\n\"When you get knocked down, you get back up and you fight harder,\" said Senator Chris Coons.\n\nMaryland congressman Jamie Raskin did entertain the notion that Mr Biden might not be the candidate come the Democratic convention in August when the presidential nominee will be crowned.\n\n\"Whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he's going to be the keynote speaker at our convention. He will be the figure that we rally around to move forward,\" said Mr Raskin.\n\nRepublicans said the debate showed why Trump was the right choice.\n\n\"Joe Biden had a disastrous performance, which is why they're talking about replacing him,\" Republican Senator JD Vance said on Fox News on Sunday.\n\nIf Mr Biden did step aside, it is possible that the Democratic Party could launch a search for a new candidate in time for the convention but it is not a straightforward process.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "How Biden tarnished his own legacy\n\nStanding at a lectern at Washington's National Cathedral last Thursday, Joe Biden delivered the eulogy for former President Jimmy Carter while three other former presidents - Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama - and the once and future president, Donald Trump, looked on.\n\nEach spectating president had achieved the validation of the American people (re-election to a second term) that has eluded Biden. And as Biden, whose term comes to an end next week, paid tribute to Carter, a fellow one-term president, it was hard not to draw other parallels too.\n\n\"Many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality, he saw well into the future,\" Biden said of Carter. He went on to note Carter's accomplishments in advancing civil rights, his work on peace and nuclear non-proliferation, and his efforts to protect the environment.\n\nEarlier in the week, however, Biden was making the case for his own legacy and how history should judge him.\n\n\"I hope that history says that I came in and I had a plan how to restore the economy and reestablish America's leadership in the world,\" he said in a television interview. \"And I hope it records that I did it with honesty and integrity; that I said what was on my mind.\"\n\nWhether that happens is subject to vigorous discussion - but he exits the White House with his approval ratings near their lowest mark of his presidency. Only 39% have a positive view, according to the latest Gallup survey, down from 57% at the start of his term.\n\nNext week, the man he defeated in 2020 returns to power, marking what must feel to him like a dour end to a presidency.\n\nBiden had his accomplishments - adroitly shepherding complex investment and infrastructure legislation through Congress despite narrow majorities, strengthening and expanding Nato, and appointing a remarkable number of diverse judges to the federal bench  - but at least for now, that is overshadowed.\n\nHis current place in history is as the Democratic interregnum between the two Trump presidential terms. A blip, rather than a pivot.\n\n\"He'd like his legacy to be that he rescued us from Trump,\" says author and Democratic strategist Susan Estrich. \"But sadly, for him, his legacy is Trump again. He is the bridge from Trump One to Trump Two.\"\n\nIt didn't have to be this way. Biden and his team were buffeted by events - some within his control and some outside it. Many of the most damaging developments were entirely predictable, however - and, in fact, predicted - yet the president and his administration appeared to be caught flat-footed.\n\nFor that, they paid a high price.\n\nBiden's first misstep as president came half a world away, in the chaos that unfolded during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\nThe exit had been negotiated during the final months of the Trump administration, but Biden backed it - despite warnings from some of his military advisors.\n\nThose dire predictions proved prophetic, as Kabul descended into panic and unrest.\n\nBy the end of that month, Biden's Gallup approval rating had dipped below 50% for the first time - a mark it would never again reach.\n\nOn the domestic front, the situation for the president was equally inauspicious. By summer, US inflation had surpassed 5% for the first time in 30 years.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she believed the spike was \"transitory\". Biden called it \"temporary\". Some outside the administration, most notably Obama's economy adviser Larry Summers, thought otherwise.\n\nBy the time inflation reached its peak a year later, at 9.1% in June 2022, Yellen and Biden had admitted they miscalculated.\n\nAmericans did not forget or forgive, however. And although the monthly inflation numbers had dropped below 3% by summer 2024, unemployment remained low, economic growth was steady and the US had outperformed the world's other industrialised nations, voters continued to have a pessimistic view of the economy.\n\nOther issues followed this pattern: The Biden administration was slow to respond to the post-Covid spike in undocumented migration at the US-Mexico border.\n\nAnd it was seemingly caught off-guard by the disruptive impact the Republican-backed programme of relocating migrants to Democratic-run northern cities would have on government services far from the border.\n\nShortages in Covid tests and infant formula, a dramatic increase in the price of eggs, the end of Roe v Wade abortion protections, and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza - for every seemingly unanticipated fire the Biden administration addressed, two new ones would emerge.\n\nThe challenges were, in fact, daunting - ones that felled incumbent leaders in democracies around the world.\n\nBut for Biden and the Democrats, hoping to prove that they were a competent and effective counterpoint not just to Trump but to global authoritarian regimes, the stakes were high.\n\nAmid all of this, responses from the administration were sometimes glaringly off-key. When asked during a television interview about raising oil production in America to reduce gas prices, in November 2021, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm responded with a laugh.\n\n\"That is hilarious,\" she said. \"Would that I had the magic wand.\"\n\nBiden - once regarded as a gifted communicator and orator - appeared less able to connect with the American people. Signs of his advancing years were also showing.\n\n\"Watching Biden speak, I'm like, oh my God, this is a different person,\" said a senior White House official who served in the early years of the Biden administration and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Maybe it's simply that when you're there every day, you don't see it.\"\n\nA report by Robert Hur, a special counsel appointed to investigate Biden's handling of classified documents, referred to the president as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\", setting off a round of hand-wringing among Democrats.\n\nBiden's interactions with the media were curtailed, and his public appearances tightly scripted. His verbal miscues and stumbles became fodder for Republican attacks. But Biden pressed on, determined to seek and win a second term in office.\n\nDuring his presidency, Biden surrounded himself with veterans of government service. His secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had been one of his top foreign policy advisors since his days in the Senate. Merrick Garland, a distinguished appellate court judge and Barack Obama's ill-fated 2016 pick for the Supreme Court, was tabbed for attorney general. Yellen, his pick for treasury, had previously chaired the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin the White House, Biden chose Ron Klain - who had worked in Democratic presidential administrations for decades - as his chief of staff. Mike Donilon, another Biden veteran, served as a senior advisor.\n\nThe team was particularly successful at managing the narrow majorities in the House and the Senate, notching early legislative victories even in the face of unified Republican resistance and reluctance from centrists in his own party.\n\nBiden's \"American Rescue Plan\", which passed just two months after he took office, included nearly $2 trillion in new government spending. It expanded healthcare subsidies, and funded the distribution of Covid vaccines and a payment programme that cut child poverty in half, to 5%.\n\nLater that year, Democrats and some Republicans joined to pass an infrastructure investment bill, which included $1tn in new spending on transportation, clean energy, water, broadband and other construction programmes.\n\nOthers followed, marking a legislative agenda that few first-term presidents in the modern era could match - but it came with what some critics see as a fatal flaw.\n\nBrent Cebul, an associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that Biden's efforts were too focused on shifting policies that take years to translate into economic benefits for average American workers.\n\n\"I think that the time horizon associated with those big pieces of legislation was way out of sync with the exigencies of the presidential election,\" he said.\n\nBiden would have been better served finding ways to bring the tangible benefits to voters more quickly - a sentiment Biden himself expressed during a recent newspaper interview.\n\nHis team also proved less able when success was measured not in laws enacted but in the daily messaging battle against a political opposition that was growing increasingly assertive.\n\nA senior Biden official said that the White House team was more decisive early on in his presidency.\n\n\"As things started to become a grind and you lose that sense of getting big things done, it can give way to infighting and frustration,\" they admitted, adding that it was their sense that the circle around Biden became more insular as the pressure built.\n\nAfter a two-year respite, his political opponents launched investigations, held hearings (into the Afghanistan withdrawal, the Biden family's business dealings and more) and, in September 2023, formally initiated a presidential impeachment inquiry. All the while, Biden's public approval languished in the low 40s.\n\nBiden's presidency should be seen in two halves, says Mr Cebul. The first was more accomplished. The second was less focused.\n\n\"Biden's sense that the US was macro-economically doing quite well led him and his advisors to take their eyes off the ball when many, many Americans were still very much hurting.\"\n\nOn 25 April, 2023, Biden made his presidential bid official in a campaign video warning that Trump \"extremists\" were threatening America.\n\nOver the following months, there would be more warnings of the danger Trump posed to American democracy. He would tout his economic plan - embracing the label \"Bidenomics\" - and point to how inflation was dropping while the economy was still growing.\n\nI travelled with Biden on a June 2023 trip to Chicago, where he held a reception for deep-pocketed donors and gave a speech on the economy in an historic downtown post office.\n\n\"Bidenomics is about the future,\" he said.\"Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American dream.\"\n\nMr Cebul believes that was a bad move.\n\n\"For him to then spend most of the spring and the early summer basically talking about how he's the most successful economic president in modern history, it was just so discordant,\" he said.\n\n\"Not only was the message out of sync, he was also just a terrible messenger.\"\n\nIn Chicago, as in many of his speeches, Biden's delivery was at times halting. His words sometimes mumbled and his syntax mangled.\n\nThrough it all, however, Biden was telling aides that he believed he was the man best positioned to defeat Trump - that he had done it once, and he would do it again. And those aides vigorously pushed back whenever anyone questioned Biden's abilities.\n\n\"I'm not a young guy, that's no secret,\" Biden said in a campaign advert. \"But here's the deal: I understand how to get things done for the American people.\"\n\nIn the autumn, Biden confronted yet another crisis - following the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, he quickly cautioned Israel not to overreact or overreach in its response to the bloodshed.\n\nAs with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the president turned his attention to world affairs. But unlike Ukraine, during which Biden assembled a unified western coalition against the invasion, the continued US support of Israel eroded enthusiasm and support for Biden in some quarters at home.\n\nAt the same time, Biden was confronting his son Hunter's growing legal troubles - a June trial and conviction on gun charges and, perhaps more concerning for the president, an indictment on tax-related violations that involved Hunter's foreign business dealings.\n\nThe airing of family discord and pain was, at the very least, a distraction and an emotional drain on the president. His ultimate decision to pardon his son, made after November's election, was condemned by many, including some allies.\n\nUltimately, Biden's presidential bid - and his presidency - came crashing down in late June on a stage in Atlanta during a debate with Trump. His confused and at times incomprehensible performance dealt his campaign a mortal blow that seemingly confirmed Republican attacks - and Democratic fears - about his advancing age.\n\nBut eventually, after Trump defiantly responded to a failed assassination attempt and held a boisterous, unified national party convention in mid-July, Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nTrump's victory over Kamala Harris, Biden's hand-picked successor, ensured that the final electoral judgement on Biden's half-century political career would be one of rejection and defeat.\n\nWhat would Biden's legacy have been if he had simply stepped aside  - \"passed the torch\" in his words - without seeking a second term? No video campaign launch. No grasping for campaign messages or Trump debate disaster. Instead, a robust race for the Democratic nomination with Biden floating above it all.\n\n\"We should have had primaries,\" argues Ms Estrich. \"His successor would have had time to make the case.\"\n\nIn the end, Biden's age and Trump's enduring appeal were the fires that his administration could never put out, and the ones that ultimately consumed his presidency.\n\nIn exactly one week, Trump will take the oath of office and will likely set about dismantling much of what Biden accomplished over the past four years. How effective he is at doing this will go a long way towards determining Biden's lasting legacy.\n\nA few weeks ago, I asked Attorney General Garland how he thought history would judge Biden and this administration.\n\n\"I'll leave that to the historians,\" he replied.\n\nThat, in the end, is all Biden has left.\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Under his watch, record streams of migrants flooded across the U.S.-Mexico border. As he heads out the door, a new CNN poll finds that just 36% of Americans approve of how he has handled the presidency, matching his previous low.\n\nPerhaps most painful, Mr. Biden's 50-plus years in public life are ending with an outcome he sought mightily to avoid: the return of Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is leaving office after a single term that many Americans regard as unsuccessful. But history suggests his accomplishments could be viewed more favorably over time.\n\nEven a late-breaking ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is unlikely to be seen as a clear win for Mr. Biden, with Mr. Trump being given as much or more credit for the achievement. To many observers, it's raising unmistakable parallels to another one-term president whose time in office was widely seen as unsuccessful: Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"Not a lot of one-term presidents are considered candidates for Mount Rushmore,\" says Matthew Dickinson, a political scientist at Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nYet Professor Dickinson and other presidential scholars don't rule out the possibility that public estimation of Mr. Biden's term could well improve over time. Biden defenders argue he deserves and will ultimately get credit for getting the COVID-19 pandemic under control and enacting a massive economic relief program. During his first two years in office, when Democrats controlled Congress, Mr. Biden passed major programs that are expected to deliver tangible results in coming years - including investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nEven now, the U.S. economy is outperforming much of the world, with unemployment at 4.1% and inflation at 2.9%. Some Democrats complain that their party had a messaging problem, not a policy problem, as President Biden reduced his interviews and public appearances and struggled to communicate effectively.\n\nIn his final days in office, Mr. Biden has used both his presidential power and his bully pulpit. He's issued a raft of executive orders, and put out a 61-page memo touting his accomplishments. Wednesday night, he delivered a farewell address to the nation that was both hopeful and ominous.\n\nMr. Biden warned specifically of a growing concentration of riches in the United States, a veiled swipe at Mr. Trump and some of his most prominent supporters.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" the president said in his speech. The world's richest person, Elon Musk, has become a key Trump ally, and the next two wealthiest, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, have also curried favor with the incoming president.\n\nOver the long haul, the larger meaning of Mr. Biden's one term remains fluid. Will it be seen as a brief interregnum that effectively stretched out Mr. Trump's era of influence by four years? Or by denying Mr. Trump a second consecutive term in 2020, did Mr. Biden accomplish something more significant?\n\nRussell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, argues that beating Mr. Trump in 2020 could turn out to be a key Biden legacy.\n\n\"It may very well be that an uninterrupted reign of a Trump presidency for eight years would have been markedly more disruptive than two separate intervals of a Trump presidency,\" Professor Riley says.\n\nMr. Biden came to the presidency as the embodiment of the political establishment, an avatar of \"normality.\" He had served 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president before reaching the Oval Office. He also had a history as a centrist dealmaker, skills he honed in the Senate.\n\n\"He was nominated because he was going to move the Democratic Party back to the center, but he didn't necessarily govern that way,\" Professor Dickinson says. \"I think that hurt him.\"\n\nInstead, Mr. Biden tacked left - leading to a \"big government\" ethos and legislation that added trillions to the national debt.\n\nOf course, Mr. Trump was also a big spender, and the national debt rose even more during his first term than Mr. Biden's. Whether Mr. Trump's second-term plans to boost government efficiency and slash the federal workforce come to anything remain to be seen. For now, cutting or eliminating programs dear to Democrats is high on the list.\n\nMr. Biden's decision to run for a second term, after strongly suggesting he wouldn't, is another key part of his legacy. By the time the octogenarian dropped out of the race last July, after a disastrous debate performance, there was no time for a proper primary. Vice President Kamala Harris, as the emergency fill-in, narrowly lost the popular vote, and lost the Electoral College by a wider margin.\n\nIt may well be that no Democrat running on Mr. Biden's record could have beaten Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Biden will get credit in the history books for elevating the first woman to the vice presidency. After the Supreme Court's historic overturning of the nationwide right to abortion in 2022, Ms. Harris became the administration's most prominent voice on reproductive rights.\n\n\"She was a far more effective messenger on that than he was,\" says Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.\n\nMr. Biden is also credited with assembling a diverse Cabinet, and putting the first Black female justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nA persistent challenge throughout the Biden term was the legal and personal troubles of his son. The only surviving child from Mr. Biden's late first wife, Hunter Biden occupied a unique place in his father's presidency, as a source of perpetual concern. When President Biden announced last month the unconditional pardon of his son, going back 11 years, he broke a repeated promise that he would not do that. The president's regular oaths of \"my word as a Biden\" may now ring a bit hollow.\n\nHis son's pardon also shined a light on the larger issue of alleged Justice Department weaponization. The two federal cases against Mr. Trump - now dismissed - helped fuel passions around his 2024 reelection, and could in turn spur efforts by the incoming Trump Justice Department to prosecute Biden allies.\n\nUltimately, the policy dimension of Mr. Biden's one term will be his most durable legacy. In foreign affairs, the disastrous final withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 may be the most memorable episode - a blow to Mr. Biden's public approval from which he never recovered. His shoring up of international alliances and diehard support for Ukraine and Israel, amid brutal wars, underscored Mr. Biden's identity as a globalist.\n\nWednesday's announcement of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal brought back memories of President Carter, and the Iranian hostage crisis that helped make him a one-termer. Mr. Carter's memorial service in Washington was just last week, making the parallel even sharper.\n\nMr. Carter is now remembered fondly by many for his decades-long post-presidency, marked by good works, rather than the missteps of his time in the White House. Of course, Mr. Carter was just 56 when he left office.\n\nBut historians point to other presidents whose public image improved, sometimes dramatically, years after they left office. The once deeply unpopular Harry Truman is now lauded for desegregating the military and supporting the creation of NATO.\n\nLyndon Johnson, who dropped his reelection bid amid growing protests over the Vietnam War, is now best known for signing major civil rights legislation and implementing his Great Society agenda, including creation of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nMr. Biden made no secret of his desire to pass sweeping programs like the Great Society or Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. But ultimately he had to trim back his Build Back Better agenda, which aimed for tax reforms, plus broad investment in infrastructure, environment, and healthcare. Some elements were implemented separately.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history.\n\n\"I've dedicated my career to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Today, I am commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 individuals on federal death row to life sentences without the possibility of parole. These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my administration has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\"\n\nThe Biden administration in 2021 announced a moratorium on federal capital punishment to study the protocols used, which suspended executions during President Biden's term. But Mr. Biden actually had promised to go further on the issue in the past, pledging to end federal executions without the caveats for terrorism and hate-motivated, mass killings.\n\nWhile running for president in 2020, Mr. Biden's campaign website said he would \"work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, and incentivize states to follow the federal government's example.\"\n\nSimilar language didn't appear on Mr. Biden's reelection website before he left the presidential race in July.\n\n\"Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,\" Mr. Biden's statement said. \"But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vice president, and now president, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level.\"\n\nHe took a political jab at Mr. Trump, saying, \"In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\"\n\nIndeed, President-elect Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has spoken frequently of expanding executions. In a speech announcing his 2024 campaign, Trump called for those \"caught selling drugs to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts.\" He later promised to execute drug and human smugglers and even praised China's harsher treatment of drug peddlers. During his first term as president, Mr. Trump also advocated for the death penalty for drug dealers.\n\nThere were 13 federal executions during Mr. Trump's first term, more than under any president in modern history, and some may have happened fast enough to have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus at the federal death row facility in Indiana.\n\nThose were the first federal executions since 2003. The final three occurred after Election Day in November 2020 but before Mr.Trump left office the following January, the first time federal prisoners were put to death by a lame-duck president since Grover Cleveland in 1889.\n\nMr. Biden faced recent pressure from advocacy groups urging him to act to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The president's announcement also comes less than two weeks after he commuted the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, and of 39 others convicted of nonviolent crimes, the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.\n\nThe announcement also followed the post-election pardon that Mr. Biden granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges after long saying he would not issue one, sparking an uproar in Washington. The pardon also raised questions about whether he would issue sweeping preemptive pardons for administration officials and other allies who the White House worries could be unjustly targeted by Mr. Trump's second administration.\n\nSpeculation that President Biden could commute federal death sentences intensified last week after the White House announced he plans to visit Italy on the final foreign trip of his presidency next month. Mr. Biden, a practicing Catholic, will meet with Pope Francis, who recently called for prayers for U.S. death row inmates in hopes their sentences will be commuted.\n\nMartin Luther King III, who publicly urged Mr. Biden to change the death sentences, said in a statement issued by the White House that the president \"has done what no president before him was willing to do: take meaningful and lasting action not just to acknowledge the death penalty's racist roots but also to remedy its persistent unfairness.\"\n\nDonnie Oliverio, a retired Ohio police officer whose partner was killed by one of the men whose death sentence was converted, said the execution of \"the person who killed my police partner and best friend would have brought me no peace.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Log in to hide ads .\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 20, 2025, 3:53 p.m. ET\n\nIn a sweeping act of presidential power in his final hours in office, President Joe Biden issued preemptive pardons to over a dozen people who faced the threat of legal investigation by the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe recipients ranged from members of the Jan. 6 committee and their staff to Capitol police who testified about the events of the Capitol riot. Mr. Biden also singled out Gen. Mark Milley, who served under President Donald Trump, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who managed the COVID-19 pandemic under both Presidents Trump and Biden. The outgoing president also pardoned five members of his own family.\n\nWhile technically within the bounds of the presidential pardon power, no president has issued so many late pardons to individuals yet to be convicted of - or even investigated for - committing crimes. Supporters of the preemptive action counter that an incoming president never threatened legal action against his political enemies the way newly inaugurated President Donald Trump has.\n\nPresident Joe Biden drew criticism for pardoning his son Hunter to protect him from political retribution. Now, Mr. Biden's eleventh-hour preemptive pardons for his family and Trump critics are raising further questions.\n\nIn his inaugural speech on Monday, President Trump reiterated his view that his four criminal indictments - and convictions on one set of the charges - resulted from persecution by the departing president rather than his own actions.\n\n\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced,\" President Trump said. \"The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\"\n\nRegardless, what is unquestionable is that Mr. Biden has pushed the presidential pardon power into new ground. While some pardon recipients expressed gratitude, others worried about the precedent it could set for Mr. Trump and future presidents, who already enjoy broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution gives the president the power to \"grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States.\" While previous presidents have issued pardons to people yet to be charged with crimes, there is little precedent for the preemptive pardons Mr. Biden issued during his final 24 hours in the White House.\n\nIt's not his first run at preemptive pardons. Last month, Mr. Biden pardoned his son Hunter before his sentencing for federal gun and tax fraud felonies. The amnesty covered any crimes he may have committed over the past decade.\n\nOn Monday morning, in the final hours of his term, President Biden also issued preemptive pardons to other individuals who Mr. Trump and his supporters often criticized.\n\nGeneral Milley and Dr. Fauci received full and unconditional pardons \"for any offenses\" they may have committed over the past decade. The members of the Jan. 6 committee and their staff, as well as police officers who testified to the committee, received full pardons for any offenses \"arising from or in any matter related to\" the committee's work investigating the Capitol attack. Five members of Mr. Biden's immediate family, meanwhile, received full pardons for any nonviolent offenses they may have committed over the past decade.\n\nNot everyone supported these actions. Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who served on the Jan. 6 committee when he was in Congress, said last month that he didn't want a preemptive pardon. \"It's unnecessary,\" he told ABC News. Giving \"preemptive blanket pardons on the way out of an administration,\" he added, \"is a precedent we don't want to set.\" Mr. Trump has previously threatened to prosecute Senator Schiff and other members of the committee, including former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, whom Mr. Biden also pardoned.\n\nBut other pardon recipients voiced their appreciation.\n\nGeneral Milley - the nation's highest-ranking military official during the last year of Mr. Trump's first term, who became a prominent critic of the reelected president - said in a statement that he was \"deeply grateful\" for the pardon. He said he was thankful to be spared from \"fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,\" adding that he doesn't want to put \"my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety.\"\n\nDr. Fauci, whose handling of the country's pandemic response was condemned by critics, echoed those sentiments. Earlier Monday, he told CNN he is \"very appreciative\" of the preemptive pardon. \"We did nothing wrong. But the baseless accusations and threats are real for me and my family,\" he added.\n\nBeginning in 2021, Mr. Trump began making public comments that General Milley should be tried for treason. Several prominent Republicans have said that Dr. Fauci should be prosecuted for his handling of the nation's pandemic response.\n\nIn the long run, however, Mr. Biden's preemptive pardons could cast more suspicion on the beneficiaries than it relieves. In a social media post this morning, Republican Sen. Rand Paul said the pardon of Dr. Fauci \"will only serve as an accelerant to pierce the veil of deception\" around the pandemic. \"I will not rest until the entire truth of the coverup is exposed,\" he added.\n\nMr. Biden is not the first president to issue pardons to people yet to be convicted of crimes. President Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon before he could be tried in the wake of Watergate. President Jimmy Carter issued blanket preemptive pardons to those accused of avoiding the draft in the Vietnam War. President Andrew Johnson issued blanket pardons to former Confederate soldiers after the Civil War.\n\nBut the timing and the scope of these pardons - including the Hunter Biden pardon - worry some experts.\n\n\"This may be the strangest year in the history of the pardon power,\" says Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law who studies sentencing and clemency.\n\nThe Biden pardons \"involve people who not only haven't been charged but seem highly unlikely to be convicted of anything,\" he adds. \"He's ignored the hundreds of others who had good cases for clemency, who followed the rules, who submitted a petition, and got nothing.\"\n\nMr. Biden also issued several more traditional pardons before he left the White House. Perhaps most notable was his extending clemency toward Native American activist Leonard Peltier, who was imprisoned for 50 years despite serious doubts over his conviction in the 1970s. Mr. Peltier will be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence at home.\n\nOne person who has voiced concerns about a president issuing eleventh-hour preemptive pardons is Mr. Biden himself.\n\nIn December 2020, amid reports that then-President Trump was considering issuing preemptive pardons, including to his own family members, Mr. Biden told CNN that preemptive pardons \"concer[n] me, in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice.\"\n\nHe added: \"You're not going to see, in our administration, that kind of approach to pardons.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Quite literally.\n\nA week after a disastrous debate performance that led many within his own party to question his physical and mental stamina, the president could be seen jogging from Air Force One to greet Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers in Madison. He jogged across the stage at a middle school to the Tom Petty song \"I Won't Back Down.\" He jogged from the lectern and swayed with the choir after speaking to an enthusiastic Black congregation in Philadelphia.\n\n\"I am running and going to win again,\" he said at the Madison rally, prompting chants from the crowd: \"Let's go, Joe!\"\n\nThe American president is facing perhaps the biggest crisis of his political career, a make-or-break moment for his 2024 reelection campaign. The Monitor accompanied him on the campaign trail this weekend. Here's what our reporter saw.\n\nThe president indignantly cast the calls for him to step down as an affront to the millions of voters who had turned out to support him during the primaries. \"Some folks don't seem to care who you voted for,\" he said. Then, shouting, \"I'm staying in the race!\"\n\nOver the long holiday weekend, as Mr. Biden was staring down the biggest crisis of his political career, I was given a front-row seat to it all, as part of the White House travel pool. At this extraordinary moment in U.S. politics, it happened to be the Monitor's turn to be the eyes and ears for the wider Washington press corps, sending out regular updates about everything the president said and did during swings through Wisconsin, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Jill Biden's husband,\" as the president likes to introduce himself, came on the Washington political scene more than a half-century ago as a 30-year-old senator. Now, pointed questions about his mental acuity have brought Mr. Biden to a make-or-break moment for his 2024 reelection campaign - and a defining juncture for his storied political career.\n\nFacing criticism in the wake of the debate that he and his team were in denial and willfully ignoring concerns, Mr. Biden made a concerted show of energy this weekend. His voice was often strong on the campaign trail. At one stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he spoke and mingled with supporters for over an hour in 90-degree-Fahrenheit heat, in a courtyard filled with balloon animals and wafts of sunscreen. And while he often held the handrail exiting his plane, he also jokingly acted as though he was ready to dart away from us in the press pool.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether those efforts can reverse the tides of criticism. While voters at his events expressed enthusiastic support, there were also signs - literally - that not everyone is on board.\n\n\"Save your legacy, drop out,\" one sign read outside Mr. Biden's rally in Madison. At other stops, protesters criticized the president for \"genocide\" in Gaza. There were also reminders of his opponent, who has been widening his lead in recent polls. As the Biden motorcade sped along a Pennsylvania highway, we passed a Trump billboard urging motorists to \"Achieve the American dream!\"\n\nMr. Biden and his allies are vigorously making the case - both in public and behind the scenes - that he is still the best Democrat to beat Donald Trump. He sat down with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Friday for an interview that some criticized for being short and unconvincing.\n\nMonday morning, the president called into \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC, feistily telling the hosts, \"I'm getting so frustrated by the elites in the party.\" He added, \"If any of these guys don't think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce for president - challenge me at the convention!\" He also released a letter to congressional Democrats saying he had heard the \"fears and worries about what is at stake\" and arguing that he understands that responsibility better than anyone.\n\n\"I wouldn't be running again if I didn't absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024,\" he wrote.\n\nOn the trail this weekend, Mr. Biden doubled down on retail politics, shaking hands and taking countless selfies; gave speeches about American values; and lightly sparred with the press.\n\nOne reporter called out a question as the president was boarding Air Force One in Madison, wondering how he could argue simultaneously that democracy itself was at risk and that he was the best candidate to take on Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Because I beat him before and I've gotten more done than any president has,\" Mr. Biden said.\n\nWe huddled around the president on the tarmac, a sweaty bunch of journalists reflected in his aviators, trying to hear him over the roar of the plane. \"That was four years ago, Mr. President,\" a reporter responded.\n\n\"You've been wrong about everything so far,\" Mr. Biden fired back. \"You were wrong about 2020. You were wrong about 2022 that we were gonna get wiped out. Remember the 'red wave'?\" he said, referring to predictions of Republican dominance in the midterms that never materialized. \"You were wrong about 2023, when you said all the tough races we were going to - and we won them all but two.\"\n\nThe president answered at least 15 questions in that two-minute \"gaggle\" - the most face-to-face time we in the pool had with him this weekend. His answers never varied: He sees himself as the strongest candidate to beat Mr. Trump. He shrugs off the doomsayers and poor poll numbers alike, insisting they're all wrong.\n\nToward the end of the trip, at a Philadelphia church, the senior pastor compared Mr. Biden to the biblical character of Joseph, who overcame fraternal betrayal and exile and ultimately triumphed. \"Don't count him out,\" he called, to cheers and applause from the Black congregation.\n\nThat's the message the president is sticking with. As he boarded Air Force One in Harrisburg to fly home and return to the maelstrom of Washington, the president turned back to us in the pool.\n\n\"I'm up for the job,\" he said, flashing a thumbs-up.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The national archivist disagrees.\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 17, 2025, 2:24 p.m. ET | WASHINGTON\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced Friday that the Equal Rights Amendment should be considered a ratified addition to the U.S. Constitution, making a symbolic statement that's unlikely to alter a decades-long push for gender equality.\n\n\"It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people,\" President Biden said. \"In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.\"\n\nThe Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit discrimination based on gender, was sent to the states for ratification in 1972. Congress set a deadline of 1979 for three-quarters of state legislatures to ratify the amendment, then extended it to 1982.\n\nBut it wasn't until 2020, when Virginia lawmakers passed the amendment, that 38 states had ratified it. The archivist said Congress or the courts must change the deadline to consider the amendment as certified.\n\nAs a result, the Democrat's statement, coming just days before he is replaced by Republican Donald Trump, will probably not have any impact. Presidents do not have any role in the amendment process. The leader of the National Archives had previously said that the amendment can not be certified because it wasn't ratified before a deadline set by Congress.\n\nOn Friday, the National Archives reiterated this position, saying that \"the underlying legal and procedural issues have not changed.\"\n\nA senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the White House's plans, said Mr. Biden was not directing the archivist to certify the amendment, sidestepping what could have become a legal battle over the separation of powers.\n\nActivists gathered outside the National Archives to celebrate President Biden's statement and call on the archivist to take action.\n\n\"Do your job,\" said Zakiya Thomas, head of the ERA Coalition. \"The president has done his.\"\n\nClaudia Nachega, a leader in the Young Feminist Party, said that certifying the Equal Rights Amendment would signal \"the beginning of a new American era that gives us a fighting chance of surviving a second Trump presidency.\"\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Log in to hide ads .\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated March 08, 2024, 5:28 p.m. ET | COLUMBIA, S.C.\n\nJoe Biden exits the Beast - the president's heavily armored stretch limousine - and makes his way into the Regal Lounge, a Black-owned barbershop in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nThe space is cramped, but President Biden works the room like a pro. Customers and stylists alike stop everything to greet the surprise guest, here to campaign ahead of the state's Democratic primary. A member of the Secret Service instructs a barber to put down his razor; after all, he's cheek by jowl with the leader of the free world.\n\nThe setting, of course, is calculated. The largely Democratic Black vote is critical to Mr. Biden's election prospects in November - as it was in 2020 - and Black men, in particular, have been peeling away from the president's column.\n\nPresident Biden's decades of experience have brought valuable perspective, supporters say. Yet the next president will face uniquely modern challenges. Is Mr. Biden's age a liability or an asset? It may be both.\n\nAfter a few minutes inside the Regal, we reporters accompanying Mr. Biden are escorted out. But the president stays inside for a full half-hour. This is the Biden way: More than just grinning for the cameras, he needs to shake every hand, pose for selfies, win people over one by one.\n\n\"That's where Biden is most comfortable\" - engaging with the public, says former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a friend of the president's for 25 years. \"He loves people.\"\n\nIn many ways, Mr. Biden's brand of politics is as old-school as they come. He has been a fixture in Washington since his first election to the Senate in 1972, and his approach can be seen as a relic of a bygone era, when respect and civility in public life were the norm, and the ability to work across the aisle and cut legislative deals was the name of the game.\n\nToday, after 36 years as a senator from Delaware, eight years as vice president, and three-plus years as president, Mr. Biden faces the challenge of a lifetime: fending off likely GOP nominee Donald Trump amid rampant partisan dysfunction, growing isolationism, a crisis on the southern U.S. border, and an increasingly restive left. His job approval rating with the public is now consistently under 40%.\n\nIn his State of the Union message Thursday night, Mr. Biden will have his biggest opportunity before the November election to address a national audience - and woo back supporters. But it's likely to take more than a prime-time speech to turn opinion around.\n\nFour years ago, Mr. Biden's reputation as a moderate, experienced Washington hand who could restore a sense of normality after former President Trump's tumultuous term helped him win the Democratic nomination and then the presidency.\n\nBut that image as a man of the center - able to not only bridge the two main parties but also keep his own side united - has been undercut by the realities of governing in this fractious time. Early in his term, he embraced many of the left's priorities, going big on pandemic relief spending before touting efforts at deficit reduction. And while the economic picture has grown increasingly rosy, the verdict is still out, and a raft of issues from across the political spectrum - from inflation to the border to Israel - could be his undoing.\n\nMr. Biden's ace is that he is tenacious. In his youth, he worked hard to overcome a stutter, a disability he has mostly beaten. He pursued the presidency for decades before reaching the mountaintop. He had to propose to his wife, Jill, five times before she said yes.\n\nHe will also do anything, it seems, to protect his family, including his troubled son Hunter, who faces multiple federal indictments on tax and gun charges and a congressional investigation into his business dealings. Republican-led House investigative committees have had the president himself in their sights, but so far have not presented evidence of an impeachable offense.\n\nNow, much like when Mr. Trump asserted at the 2016 GOP convention, \"I alone can fix it,\" Mr. Biden is displaying a similar mentality. He beat Mr. Trump once and he can do it again, his words and actions suggest - even as the 81-year-old president faces growing questions about his stamina and sharpness.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos poll, taken right after a February special counsel report depicted Mr. Biden as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" found that a whopping 86% of Americans think Mr. Biden is too old for another term. Some 62% also think Mr. Trump, at 77, is too old. But while the former president also misspeaks regularly, his delivery and physical presence onstage are more robust.\n\n\"The visuals are hard\" for Mr. Biden, says veteran Democratic strategist Peter Fenn, who has known the president since the 1970s.\n\nStill, Mr. Fenn sees the younger version of the president shining through - a man who believes in his own problem-solving abilities and yearns for the old way of doing things.\n\n\"What Biden wants is a government that works, and that sense of normalcy and regular order,\" Mr. Fenn says. \"He just wants to set the table for the future - a return, in the next four years, of decency and respect for truth.\"\n\nUltimately, there's no denying a central paradox of the 2024 election. Mr. Biden is old enough to remember when Black Americans sat at the back of the bus, when the Cold War raged, when TV was in its infancy. And those years of experience have brought a valuable perspective on both how far America has come and where it needs to go, supporters say.\n\nYet the next president will face the most modern of challenges, from artificial intelligence to climate change. Is Mr. Biden's age a liability or an asset? The answer may well be both.\n\nDuring the last campaign, Mr. Biden strongly suggested he would be a one-termer if he won.\n\n\"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,\" Mr. Biden said in March 2020, right after effectively clinching the Democratic nomination. \"There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.\"\n\nHe was referring to then-California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, all viewed as potential running mates at the time. Vice President Harris got the nod, and today has even lower job approval ratings than Mr. Biden. Some analysts suggest that her weak political standing is one reason Mr. Biden felt compelled to run again.\n\nAfter special counsel Robert Hur declined to charge Mr. Biden for his handling of classified documents - but raised fresh questions about his memory - a CNN reporter reminded Mr. Biden that in December, he had said there are \"probably 50\" Democrats who could beat Mr. Trump.\n\n\"So why does it have to be you now?\" the reporter asked.\n\nMr. Biden's response: \"Because I'm the most qualified person in this country to be president of the United States.\" And, he added, to \"finish the job I started.\"\n\nTed Kaufman - a close friend of Mr. Biden's and a decadeslong Senate aide - says he's not surprised Mr. Biden is going for a second term.\n\n\"It's not an ego thing,\" says former Senator Kaufman, who was appointed to Mr. Biden's Delaware seat for two years after his boss won the vice presidency. Rather, Mr. Biden's thought process boiled down to this: \"How would he feel if he didn't run, and Trump got elected president? What would that be like in terms of his golden years, and how he lives out the rest of his life?\"\n\nThat mindset permeated Mr. Biden's thinking when he ran against Mr. Trump in 2020, and he feels it just as strongly now, Mr. Kaufman says.\n\nMr. Biden's friend also points to a life marked with tragedies that have forged resilience. There was the car crash in 1972 that killed his first wife and baby daughter, leaving him as a single parent with two young sons; two life-threatening medical emergencies; the death of his son Beau, who was a rising political star in his own right; and his son Hunter's addiction and legal problems.\n\n\"What all that does to someone, in my experience, is it builds character,\" Mr. Kaufman says. \"I'm not saying all politicians lie and steal; that's not been my experience. But he's faced some incredibly difficult things, things that would daunt anyone else.\"\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Biden has a strong record of accomplishments to tout. Despite enormous economic challenges coming out of the pandemic, a long-predicted recession never materialized, and January marked the 24th straight month with unemployment under 4%, which is considered full employment. Still, the sharp spike in inflation early on left many Americans feeling poorer, and the lingering effects could harm the president's efforts to win back blue-collar voters.\n\nMr. Biden also points to student loan forgiveness and price reductions for some prescription drugs under Medicare as big wins. And he notes that infrastructure projects funded under the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are underway, as are investments addressing climate change via the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nBut there's no denying a top political liability - the crisis on the southern border, where illegal crossings have averaged a record 2 million a year since Mr. Biden took office. Mr. Trump effectively killed bipartisan border legislation recently in the Senate by voicing his objection, leaving the president to address the issue without congressional help. Trump critics say the former president wants continued border chaos on Mr. Biden's watch, rather than a solution.\n\nMr. Biden's wish list for a second term is long and ambitious - and focused on bringing down costs for Americans struggling to make ends meet. Highlights include federal money for child care, as pandemic funds dry up; an expansion of the reduction in some prescription drug costs to cover all Americans; and free prekindergarten and community college. To pay for this, Mr. Biden proposes raising taxes on wealthy people.\n\nMore broadly, the president's campaign for a second term is centered on nothing less than the preservation of democracy - or what Mr. Biden calls \"a battle for the soul of America.\" Four years ago, he ran to defeat Mr. Trump and restore, as he likes to say, a sense of common national purpose. Today, those same goals hold, but with more overt fears expressed by some that a second Trump term could creep toward authoritarianism.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Biden's greatest unfulfilled promise from his 2021 inaugural was a pledge to restore national unity - beginning with a call to \"treat each other with dignity and respect.\"\n\nLately, much of the disunity has seemed to come from Mr. Biden's own party. He is routinely confronted at public events by unruly left-wing activists over the United States' handling of Israel and the war in Gaza, as well as climate change.\n\nSome pundits have argued Mr. Biden needs a \"Sister Souljah\" moment - that is, he should publicly rebuke his party's most strident wing as a way to reposition himself in the political center. In 1992, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton took on Black rapper and activist Sister Souljah, helping to rebrand the Democratic Party as not a captive of the left. Sister Souljah had made comments on race that were widely deemed offensive.\n\nBut some who know Mr. Biden best scoff at the idea of him taking on left-wing protesters in that way.\n\n\"Come on, really?\" says Mr. Kaufman. \"You think Joe Biden's going to be spooked by some of these demonstrators?\"\n\nTypically, when protesters disrupt his events, Mr. Biden waits for security to escort them out and then calmly resumes speaking. At times he expresses empathy.\n\n\"They feel deeply,\" the president said at a campaign rally in January, after protesters opposed to U.S. support for Israel's offensive in Gaza interrupted him about a dozen times.\n\nSupporters say that by not engaging with protesters, he's showing confidence in his position and a willingness to let the debate be fully aired. But Mr. Biden's patience can have its limits, as another longtime friend suggests.\n\n\"There will come a time in the next eight or nine months where something will happen, and he'll just say, 'Enough,'\" says Mr. Fenn.\n\nWith some top administration officials, protesters have become especially brazen. Since January, dozens of people have camped outside Secretary of State Antony Blinken's home in suburban Virginia, demanding a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nHeather Bukhari, a Muslim woman from Chicago, says she won't vote for Mr. Biden. She cites the nearly 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them women and children, killed by U.S.-backed Israel since the war began.\n\n\"Many of the people in my social circle are totally disgusted with Biden,\" says Ms. Bukhari, who drove 13 hours to join the Blinken encampment for a bit.\n\nA successful reelection effort by Mr. Biden will depend on his ability to sew together many constituencies and convince them to turn out. For some young progressives, disillusioned over Mr. Biden's strong support for Israel following Hamas' attack on the Jewish state Oct. 7, the choice may not be Biden-Trump; it could be whether to vote third-party - or not at all.\n\nTypically, Mr. Biden responds to the age question in two ways: \"Watch me,\" and then some version of, \"With age comes wisdom.\"\n\nIndeed, looking back over his long career, there's no question that Mr. Biden has evolved both politically and personally.\n\nOne example: He learned to stop being \"handsy\" with people - or \"getting a little too close,\" as a Biden friend put it. Like many male politicians of his generation, he was once known as a hugger and a backslapper, a habit that could make women in particular feel uncomfortable. But in 2019, as Mr. Biden prepared to run for president, aides had a sit-down with him and he changed his ways.\n\nAnother trait that Mr. Biden learned to correct was long-windedness. Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a one-time Biden intern who now holds the president's old Senate seat, recalls stemwinders that could go on for an hour and a half. Today, Senator Coons says, Mr. Biden does less talking and more listening.\n\n\"He changed, fundamentally, as vice president and president,\" says Mr. Coons, noting that before Mr. Biden became vice president, he hadn't had a boss for 36 years. \"He's very disciplined - in meetings, in speeches, in engagement. He reads an enormous amount; he's very present.\"\n\nThat's not to say meetings with Mr. Biden don't often go long. But that's because he wants everyone to have their say and invites debate, according to aides.\n\nHe also seems to have learned from past mistakes. Mr. Biden served as Senate Judiciary Committee chair during the 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Clarence Thomas, when allegations of sexual harassment by a former subordinate, Anita Hill, cast then-Judge Thomas' confirmation in doubt and shined a light on the committee's makeup: all white men.\n\nThe case of now-Justice Thomas and now-Professor Hill, both Black, set the politics of race and gender in sharp relief. And when Chairman Biden made a deal with Republicans that prevented four female witnesses from testifying on Ms. Hill's behalf, that sealed Mr. Thomas' confirmation. Years later, in 2019, as Mr. Biden prepared to announce his campaign for president, he called Ms. Hill to express regret. She said it wasn't enough.\n\nBut for Mr. Biden, and the nation, the lessons of the Hill-Thomas hearings reverberated. The election of 1992 became the \"year of the woman,\" with record numbers of women winning Senate seats. Today, Mr. Biden has made promoting women and people of color a centerpiece of his administration, including Vice President Harris. He touts a Cabinet that \"looks like America,\" with more women and people of color than any previous Cabinet. The Biden administration has seen more Black women confirmed to federal judgeships than any previous administration, including the first Black female Supreme Court justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nEleanor Smeal, a longtime feminist activist who has known Mr. Biden since the 1980s, says he's always been a champion for women. In the Anita Hill episode, she says, it was the Republicans on the committee who sought to discredit Ms. Hill's testimony, not Mr. Biden and fellow Democrats. In 1994, she notes, Mr. Biden was a strong proponent of the Violence Against Women Act, which he has called his \"proudest legislative accomplishment\" as a senator.\n\n\"All I can say is, he has been very, very strong on legislation when it counted,\" Ms. Smeal says.\n\nShe also calls Mr. Biden strong on women's reproductive rights, despite his personal opposition to abortion as a devout Catholic. In 1994, as Judiciary Committee chair, he presided over passage of legislation guaranteeing access to reproductive health clinics.\n\nAnother past position Mr. Biden has backed away from was his support for the 1994 crime bill, which in 2019 he called a \"big mistake,\" with its overly harsh sentencing guidelines that disproportionately affected Black Americans.\n\n\"He gets it about race and racism,\" says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who worked on his 2020 campaign. \"He's also very comfortable around LGBTQ rights and gender issues, which weren't even on the radar for people in the 1990s.\"\n\nMs. Lake credits Mr. Biden's adult grandchildren, with whom he is close, for keeping him up to date on trends and social issues. In 2012, Mr. Biden was famously a step ahead of his boss, President Barack Obama, in voicing support for same-sex marriage.\n\nHis latest foray into modern culture came last month on Super Bowl Sunday, when his campaign joined TikTok after saying it wouldn't over national security concerns. Campaign advisers have said they're intent on \"meeting voters where they are\" - though, notably, the president's risk-averse White House press team declined to make him available for a Super Bowl pregame interview for the second straight year.\n\nIn general, the Biden team has limited his availability to reporters, holding many fewer press conferences so far (33) than Mr. Trump in one term (88) and Mr. Obama in two (163). Mr. Biden's habit of misspeaking in unscripted moments is nothing new. But the optics today are far riskier.\n\nMr. Trump is of the same generation as Mr. Biden, and neither man served in the military, each having received multiple draft deferments during the Vietnam War. But they have diametrically opposite views on America's role in the world.\n\nMr. Biden's worldview is centered on the internationalist tradition, defending freedom around the world, while Mr. Trump's posture is that of an \"America First\" strongman ready to abandon traditional alliances, including NATO.\n\nIn his early Senate days, a young Mr. Biden served with many World War II veterans who instilled in him a reverence for military service, regardless of party affiliation. Later, he bonded with Vietnam War vets. The late Republican Sen. John McCain became one of his dearest friends, and today, Mr. Biden and former Senator Hagel remain close.\n\n\"When the World War II generation left the scene, in the House and Senate, that created an amazing vacuum,\" says Mr. Hagel, who was secretary of defense under Mr. Obama. \"I don't think we even understood what we lost when we lost these people.\"\n\nMr. Hagel says he's still a Republican, \"though I'm not sure why.\" He plans to campaign for Mr. Biden. And he acknowledges that the president faces an extraordinary challenge over the Israel-Hamas war, including at home politically.\n\nThe former senator notes the importance of the Arab American vote in Michigan - a key electoral battleground state and home to the nation's largest Arab community. Last month, top White House officials traveled to suburban Detroit to meet with Arab Americans and hear them out.\n\nMr. Biden's deep devotion to the state of Israel, going back decades, remains one of those bedrock views that he's having to weigh against the current state of affairs.\n\nMr. Kaufman, his longtime friend, explains the Biden love of Israel simply: \"It's because he's Irish. The Irish have a concern for the underdog, especially Irish Catholics.\"\n\nToday, Mr. Biden himself appears to be an underdog in a campaign he describes in existential terms for the nation's future.\n\nBut the race is still young.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But President Biden's announcement on Sunday has provoked bipartisan criticism. The pardon is unusual in that it is both for an immediate family member and exceptionally broad in scope. It also comes after the president said on multiple occasions that, out of respect for the proceedings that found his son guilty of multiple federal crimes, he would leave the convictions in place.\n\nA blanket pardon for the U.S. president's son adds a new strain on public confidence in the justice system, amid wider signs that federal justice isn't immune from the political divisiveness that has gripped America's public square.\n\nAnd the pardon comes as politics and the criminal legal system have become increasingly intertwined. Next month, Mr. Biden will cede his office to Donald Trump, who has been subject to multiple federal prosecutions himself and has said he will use the federal justice system to pursue his political enemies.\n\nAll told, the episode represents another blow to public confidence in the justice system - particularly its independence from politics. Mr. Biden's pardoning of his last surviving son may represent a measure of justice and compassion for some, but for others, it represents more evidence that the system is corrupt and broken.\n\n\"Both sides are using the justice system to justify political actions, and that is worrying about our time,\" says Jeffrey Cohen, a Boston College Law School professor and former federal prosecutor.\n\n\"Everybody can point to things that they view as unjust and a weaponization of the system,\" he adds. \"I hope we all see that it's just a race to the bottom, that it's not good for any of us.\"\n\nOver the summer, a federal jury in Delaware found Hunter Biden guilty on three felony gun charges. Months later, he pleaded guilty to nine tax-related charges, including three felonies. All told, he faced a prospect of decades in prison and over $1 million in fines.\n\nThe convictions came after yearslong investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and Republicans in Congress into alleged crimes committed by members of the Biden family. But in a statement released Sunday, President Biden said both prosecutions were excessive and politically motivated, justifying a pardon.\n\n\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son,\" he wrote.\n\nStill, the statement made clear that President Biden was motivated not just by a perceived injustice, but also by his feelings as a father. Writing that \"raw politics\" had \"infected\" the prosecutions, he asked Americans to \"understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\"\n\nMany presidents have issued pardons for relatives and political allies. But empathy for Mr. Biden's decision has been more the exception than the rule, even across party lines.\n\nMr. Trump, in a social media post on Monday, called the pardon \"a miscarriage of justice.\" Rep. James Comer, the Republican congressman who has led investigations into members of the Biden family for years , said in a statement, \"It's unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability.\"\n\nSome Democrats criticized Mr. Biden's decision. The pardon \"put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans' faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all,\" wrote Michael Bennet, a Colorado senator, on social media. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis echoed that sentiment in a social media post.\n\n\"As a father I certainly understand [his] natural desire to help his son by pardoning him,\" he wrote. But, \"This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents.\"\n\nNot only has no president pardoned an immediate family member before, but Mr. Biden also issued an unusually sweeping pardon. He granted his son a \"full and unconditional\" pardon for all offenses he committed or may have committed, since Jan. 1, 2014 - a period including his final two years as vice president and his entire term as president.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner. He had served more than 16 months of a two-year sentence in federal prison and a halfway program for various financial crimes before he was released in 2006.\n\n\"The only real precedent for such a broad grant is [Gerald] Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon\" after the Watergate scandal, says Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law.\n\n\"Typically, a pardon grant is going to say, 'For this conviction,' or 'For this set of acts,'\" he adds. \"Here we have none of that.\"\n\nA regular citizen in Hunter Biden's position would likely not have received a pardon, experts say . But the pardon, and its broad scope, is undoubtedly a product of Mr. Trump's reelection last month.\n\nThe former and future president has spent the last four years fighting four criminal investigations, including two brought by President Biden's Justice Department into Mr. Trump's alleged retention of classified documents and his alleged efforts to stay in power after his 2020 election defeat.\n\nThose two cases are now winding down as Mr. Trump prepares to install new Justice Department leadership. Mr. Trump has maintained his innocence in all the cases against him and has said that if he regained the presidency, he would exact retribution on his political opponents.\n\nIn this context, Mr. Biden pardoning his son is both understandable and further damaging to a polarized and distrustful nation, says Cara Foos Pierce, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, in an email.\n\n\"While I understand his strong desire to protect his son from prison,\" she adds, \"President Biden is sending the message that the law does not apply the same to powerful, politically connected people as it does to everyone else.\"\n\n\"The idea that you can break the law with no consequences if you are close with the President is damaging to democracy,\" she continues.\n\nRepairing that damage will be difficult, experts say, but it could begin with Mr. Trump's next administration, if not sooner. The president-elect, however, has not signaled an interest in extricating the justice system from political fights.\n\nReinstating an executive order from the final weeks of his first presidency could give him the power to fire rank-and-file Justice Department employees who do not do his bidding. He has threatened to prosecute Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought the federal cases against him, as well as members of the Biden family. So has Pam Bondi , his nominee for attorney general. And Mr. Trump has said that he will issue pardons for at least some defendants convicted for participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection that sought to overturn his election defeat.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Trump's drive to surround himself with loyalists complicates efforts to restore perceptions that the justice system will act independently of politics.\n\nMr. Trump \"should fight the urge to put his outspoken supporters in leadership positions in federal law enforcement agencies,\" says Professor Pierce. \"If he does, he will be showing the country that he cares more about the rule of law than his personal feelings about how the justice system has mistreated him.\"\n\nThere's at least one way Mr. Biden could begin the work of repairing trust in federal justice, says Professor Osler: by using the presidential pardon power in a more conventional, impartial way. To date, he has issued fewer pardons and commutations than any other president this century, including Mr. Trump.\n\nThe pardon of his son is \"going to be a stain on his legacy,\" says Professor Osler, a former federal prosecutor and an expert in sentencing and clemency. \"The best thing he could do is to show this remarkable tool isn't just for his family.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Less than four months before Election Day, the clock is ticking.\n\nHeading into the Republican nominating convention next week, the Democratic Party is still roiled over whether to rally behind the president or quickly find a replacement. Thursday's press conference didn't settle the matter.\n\nMr. Biden's core supporters expressed confidence in his performance, in which he spoke knowledgeably, if haltingly, about foreign policy after hosting a summit of NATO leaders in Washington.\n\n\"I'm all in,\" said Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina on the \"Today\" show Friday . Representative Clyburn, who was key to Mr. Biden's 2020 victory, recently raised eyebrows by suggesting a \"mini primary\" in the event that Mr. Biden dropped out of the race.\n\n\"Trump world\" is watching closely, too. The view among the former president's team is that they'd prefer to run against Mr. Biden, but they're also prepping for the possibility that Vice President Kamala Harris becomes the nominee .\n\nAfter Mr. Biden beat low expectations Thursday, at least one Republican strategist aligned with Mr. Trump agreed that the president didn't disqualify himself. The Florida-based Trump ally, speaking anonymously to be more frank, assessed Mr. Biden's press conference in a text to the Monitor: \"Passable for another couple of days.\"\n\nThe steady drip of bad news for Mr. Biden continues. After the press conference, three more Democratic House members called on the president to drop out of the race: Jim Himes of Connecticut, Scott Peters of California, and Eric Sorenson of Illinois, bringing the number of House Democratic defections to at least 18.\n\nThe swift announcements suggested that their news releases were ready to go before the press conference, and that barring a significantly improved performance by Mr. Biden after his disastrous debate June 27 with Mr. Trump, the members' minds were made up. It didn't help that, on Wednesday, actor George Clooney called on Mr. Biden to step aside, after interacting with him in person at a major fundraiser he hosted in Los Angeles last month.\n\nRight before the press conference, Mr. Biden stumbled badly. He mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\" - quickly correcting himself, but the damage was done. Then, during the press conference, he answered a question on Vice President Harris' fitness to be president by referring to her as \"Vice President Trump.\"\n\nMr. Biden did say that his VP was qualified for the presidency - and opened the door a crack to leaving the race if his advisers told him he had no chance of winning.\n\n\"I believe I'm the best qualified to govern,\" Mr. Biden said . \"And I think I'm the best qualified to win. But there are other people who could beat Trump, too. But it's awful to start - to start - start from scratch.\"\n\nFor now, polling averages show that Mr. Biden trails Mr. Trump by a few percentage points, and is far less popular than the presumptive GOP nominee within their respective parties. A PBS News/NPR/Marist poll released Friday showed that 40% of Democratic voters thought Mr. Biden should not be the party's nominee - triple the share of Republicans who said the same thing about Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Right now, it's a moving target - will Biden step down?\" says Karlyn Bowman, an expert on polling at the American Enterprise Institute. \"If you look below the hood, Biden's weakness as a candidate, being able to do the job, is very significant.\"\n\nMost ominously for the Democrats, Mr. Biden's standing in key battleground states has declined of late, shifting three - Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada - from toss-up to \"lean Republican.\" And must-win Pennsylvania has moved from \"lean Democrat\" to toss-up, according to Sabato's Crystal Ball .\n\nExamples of American presidents struggling in their reelection campaigns abound. Some recover and some don't. Then there are those who opt out altogether. In March 1968, amid protests over the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson shocked the nation by abandoning his campaign for a second full term. Another relevant case is President Harry Truman, who in March 1952 declined to run because of low job approval ratings.\n\nMr. Biden's situation is different - the nation is not at war - but the political challenges related to an apparent decline, at times, in vigor and sharpness are no less profound.\n\n\"The vast majority of presidents want a second term,\" says Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University. \"That's historically been seen as the barometer of a successful presidency.\"\n\nBut today, the context is in some ways dramatically different, he says. In the modern age, presidents are expected to disclose health issues with the public. Gone are the days when a president (Franklin Roosevelt) could hide the fact that he used a wheelchair or, in the case of President Woodrow Wilson, conceal incapacitation following a stroke.\n\nThe advent of social media, too, and the deluge of information now available to the public, have changed the ballgame. In 1984, when President Ronald Reagan was running for reelection as the then-oldest American to hold the office, his administration and campaign \"were able to manage his image in ways that would simply be impossible today,\" Professor Dallek says.\n\nMr. Biden and his team have no choice but to grapple with the new reality. Just a day after his first full press conference since November 2023, which may have kept some critics at bay, there's more bad news. Donors are withholding some $90 million from a super political action committee devoted to the reelection campaign if Mr. Biden stays in the race, according to The New York Times .\n\nOn Thursday night, the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, met with Mr. Biden to convey the views of his caucus and discuss \"the path forward,\" the congressman said Friday . Mr. Biden met virtually Friday with various congressional groups to allay concerns about his electability. According to Politico, a House Democrat told the president to his face that he should drop out of the race.\n\nMr. Biden's reelection effort is clearly still on a knife's edge.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Log in to hide ads .\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 16, 2025, 1:14 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nPresident Joe Biden's legacy, in the short term at least, is likely to be marked by a sense of failure.\n\nHis first few years in office saw persistent inflation, with many Americans struggling to afford groceries, gas, and rent. Under his watch, record streams of migrants flooded across the U.S.-Mexico border. As he heads out the door, a new CNN poll finds that just 36% of Americans approve of how he has handled the presidency, matching his previous low.\n\nPerhaps most painful, Mr. Biden's 50-plus years in public life are ending with an outcome he sought mightily to avoid: the return of Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is leaving office after a single term that many Americans regard as unsuccessful. But history suggests his accomplishments could be viewed more favorably over time.\n\nEven a late-breaking ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is unlikely to be seen as a clear win for Mr. Biden, with Mr. Trump being given as much or more credit for the achievement. To many observers, it's raising unmistakable parallels to another one-term president whose time in office was widely seen as unsuccessful: Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"Not a lot of one-term presidents are considered candidates for Mount Rushmore,\" says Matthew Dickinson, a political scientist at Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nYet Professor Dickinson and other presidential scholars don't rule out the possibility that public estimation of Mr. Biden's term could well improve over time. Biden defenders argue he deserves and will ultimately get credit for getting the COVID-19 pandemic under control and enacting a massive economic relief program. During his first two years in office, when Democrats controlled Congress, Mr. Biden passed major programs that are expected to deliver tangible results in coming years - including investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nEven now, the U.S. economy is outperforming much of the world, with unemployment at 4.1% and inflation at 2.9%. Some Democrats complain that their party had a messaging problem, not a policy problem, as President Biden reduced his interviews and public appearances and struggled to communicate effectively.\n\nIn his final days in office, Mr. Biden has used both his presidential power and his bully pulpit. He's issued a raft of executive orders, and put out a 61-page memo touting his accomplishments. Wednesday night, he delivered a farewell address to the nation that was both hopeful and ominous.\n\nMr. Biden warned specifically of a growing concentration of riches in the United States, a veiled swipe at Mr. Trump and some of his most prominent supporters.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" the president said in his speech. The world's richest person, Elon Musk, has become a key Trump ally, and the next two wealthiest, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, have also curried favor with the incoming president.\n\nOver the long haul, the larger meaning of Mr. Biden's one term remains fluid. Will it be seen as a brief interregnum that effectively stretched out Mr. Trump's era of influence by four years? Or by denying Mr. Trump a second consecutive term in 2020, did Mr. Biden accomplish something more significant?\n\nRussell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, argues that beating Mr. Trump in 2020 could turn out to be a key Biden legacy.\n\n\"It may very well be that an uninterrupted reign of a Trump presidency for eight years would have been markedly more disruptive than two separate intervals of a Trump presidency,\" Professor Riley says.\n\nMr. Biden came to the presidency as the embodiment of the political establishment, an avatar of \"normality.\" He had served 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president before reaching the Oval Office. He also had a history as a centrist dealmaker, skills he honed in the Senate.\n\n\"He was nominated because he was going to move the Democratic Party back to the center, but he didn't necessarily govern that way,\" Professor Dickinson says. \"I think that hurt him.\"\n\nInstead, Mr. Biden tacked left - leading to a \"big government\" ethos and legislation that added trillions to the national debt.\n\nOf course, Mr. Trump was also a big spender, and the national debt rose even more during his first term than Mr. Biden's. Whether Mr. Trump's second-term plans to boost government efficiency and slash the federal workforce come to anything remain to be seen. For now, cutting or eliminating programs dear to Democrats is high on the list.\n\nMr. Biden's decision to run for a second term, after strongly suggesting he wouldn't, is another key part of his legacy. By the time the octogenarian dropped out of the race last July, after a disastrous debate performance, there was no time for a proper primary. Vice President Kamala Harris, as the emergency fill-in, narrowly lost the popular vote, and lost the Electoral College by a wider margin.\n\nIt may well be that no Democrat running on Mr. Biden's record could have beaten Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Biden will get credit in the history books for elevating the first woman to the vice presidency. After the Supreme Court's historic overturning of the nationwide right to abortion in 2022, Ms. Harris became the administration's most prominent voice on reproductive rights.\n\n\"She was a far more effective messenger on that than he was,\" says Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.\n\nMr. Biden is also credited with assembling a diverse Cabinet, and putting the first Black female justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nA persistent challenge throughout the Biden term was the legal and personal troubles of his son. The only surviving child from Mr. Biden's late first wife, Hunter Biden occupied a unique place in his father's presidency, as a source of perpetual concern. When President Biden announced last month the unconditional pardon of his son, going back 11 years, he broke a repeated promise that he would not do that. The president's regular oaths of \"my word as a Biden\" may now ring a bit hollow.\n\nHis son's pardon also shined a light on the larger issue of alleged Justice Department weaponization. The two federal cases against Mr. Trump - now dismissed - helped fuel passions around his 2024 reelection, and could in turn spur efforts by the incoming Trump Justice Department to prosecute Biden allies.\n\nUltimately, the policy dimension of Mr. Biden's one term will be his most durable legacy. In foreign affairs, the disastrous final withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 may be the most memorable episode - a blow to Mr. Biden's public approval from which he never recovered. His shoring up of international alliances and diehard support for Ukraine and Israel, amid brutal wars, underscored Mr. Biden's identity as a globalist.\n\nWednesday's announcement of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal brought back memories of President Carter, and the Iranian hostage crisis that helped make him a one-termer. Mr. Carter's memorial service in Washington was just last week, making the parallel even sharper.\n\nMr. Carter is now remembered fondly by many for his decades-long post-presidency, marked by good works, rather than the missteps of his time in the White House. Of course, Mr. Carter was just 56 when he left office.\n\nBut historians point to other presidents whose public image improved, sometimes dramatically, years after they left office. The once deeply unpopular Harry Truman is now lauded for desegregating the military and supporting the creation of NATO.\n\nLyndon Johnson, who dropped his reelection bid amid growing protests over the Vietnam War, is now best known for signing major civil rights legislation and implementing his Great Society agenda, including creation of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nMr. Biden made no secret of his desire to pass sweeping programs like the Great Society or Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. But ultimately he had to trim back his Build Back Better agenda, which aimed for tax reforms, plus broad investment in infrastructure, environment, and healthcare. Some elements were implemented separately.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Does that mean we could see him again in other high-profile political roles?\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Feb. 16, 2017, 1:13 p.m. ET\n\nJoe Biden has been elected to chair the Philadelphia National Constitution Center's board of trustees, his most significant appointment since the unusually popular former vice president left the White House early this year.\n\nMr. Biden, who has left the door ajar to bigger appointments such as an unlikely third tilt at the presidency in 2020 , was named by the center on Wednesday to succeed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\"The National Constitution Center's mission to teach all Americans about the great document of human freedom that unites us has never been more timely, urgently needed, and inspiring,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe center was established by Congress to \" disseminate information about the United States Constitution on a non-partisan basis in order to increase the awareness and understanding of the Constitution among the American people,\" states the center's website, by hosting interactive exhibits and events to inspire active citizenship.\n\nJeffrey Rosen, president and chief executive officer of the center, said Biden's \"love for the constitution, and passion for teaching all Americans about its enduring principles, have inspired people around the world.\"\n\nBiden said he is honored to succeed former presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush at the head of such a \"national treasure.\"\n\nThe somewhat routine appointment may garner more attention than it otherwise would have, given the rumors he may take up other high profile positions in politics.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in December, Biden half-joked, \"I'm going to run in 2020. For president. So, uh, what the hell, man.\"\n\nPressed for more details, he remained ambiguous.\n\n\"I'm not committing not to run,\" he said. \"I'm not committing to anything. I learned a long time ago, fate has a strange way of intervening.\"\n\nThere were also rumblings late last year that Biden, who is known for his genuine political friendships on both sides of the aisle and broad-based appeal with Americans, might have run to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nBiden had also mulled calls to run against the Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination but declined, citing his family's need of time to grieve the passing of their son Beau Biden.\n\nRegardless, Biden's popularity and immense contribution to American politics was underscored in January when former President Barack Obama awarded him the Medal of Freedom \"with distinction,\" an added rank recent presidents have used only for Pope John Paul II, former President Ronald Reagan, and Gen. Colin Powell.\n\nBefore hanging the award around his neck, Mr. Obama called Biden the \"best vice president America's ever seen\" and a \"lion of American history,\" The Monitor's Peter Grier wrote at the time. He also quoted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina saying, \"If you can't admire Biden as a person, you've got a problem. He's as good a man as God ever created.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Biden sets record for most pardons and commutations with new round of clemency for nonviolent drug offenders\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday he is commuting the sentences of more than 2,000 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, cementing his legacy as the president who has issued the most individual pardons and commutations in U.S. history.\n\nBiden said in a statement that commuting the nearly 2,500 sentences would help \"equalize\" sentencing disparities.\n\n\"Today's clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes,\" he said.\n\n\"This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars,\" he added.\n\n\"With this action, I have now issued more individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history,\" Biden said.\n\nAlmost two dozen congressional Democrats last month urged Biden to commute the sentences of people affected by the sentencing disparities, arguing that harsher penalties for crack \"caused disproportionate harm to communities of color.\"\n\nTwo laws dramatically shifted sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses over the past 15 years.\n\nThe Fair Sentencing Act , which was signed into law in 2010, lowered the statutory penalties for crack cocaine and tossed out the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing it. The First Step Act, which became law in 2018, made it possible to apply the reduced penalties to sentences for crack offenses that predated the 2010 law.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nBiden last month commuted nearly 1,500 sentences and issued pardons for 39 people in another sweeping clemency action. A subsequent move to commute 37 death sentences left only a handful of people on federal death row.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department's clemency statistics , President-elect Donald Trump issued 144 pardons and 94 commutations during his first term. President Barack Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations over two terms.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial use of Biden's clemency power came when he pardoned his son Hunter Biden last month. The move was sharply criticized by Republicans and even some Democrats.\n\nIn his statement Friday, Biden indicated that he could take more clemency action before he leaves office Monday.\n\n\"I am proud of my record on clemency and will continue to review additional commutations and pardons,\" he said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden administration looks for ways to keep TikTok available in the U.S.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration is considering ways to keep TikTok available in the U.S. if a ban that's scheduled to go into effect on Sunday proceeds, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\"Americans shouldn't expect to see TikTok suddenly banned on Sunday,\" an administration official said, adding that officials are \"exploring options\" for how to implement the law so that TikTok does not go dark on Sunday.\n\nIf the administration moves forward with any such plan, it would mean that the popular app going down would not define his last full day in office, and it would defer the issue to Donald Trump, who is inaugurated on Monday.\n\nAt the same time, Mike Waltz, the incoming national security adviser for Trump, told Fox News Wednesday that the president-elect is ready to intervene to preserve access to the Chinese-owned video app in the American marketplace. And Pam Bondi, Trump's pick for attorney general, refused to commit to enforcing the ban when asked about it during her Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\nTaken together, the moves represent parallel efforts by the rival presidents to execute an end run around Congress and the Supreme Court, which is teed up to issue a ruling on the ban at any time.\n\nStill, a White House official insisted that not enforcing the ban, if it is upheld, is not an option.\n\n\"We are not considering deferring enforcement,\" the official said. \"Statutorily, we don't believe we have the authority to do that.\"\n\nBiden and Trump's positions are reversals from their one-time support for banning the app.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on the plan.\n\nTikTok is considering its options, including the last-ditch possibility that the app goes dark on Sunday, though it could also allow the app to remain active but without future updates and bug fixes.\n\nThe law in question required ByteDance, TikTok's China-based owner, to divest from the company and find an outside buyer to take over within nine months. That window closes Sunday. The law also provided the president authority to grant a one-time 90-day extension if \" significant progress \" has been made toward that divestment.\n\nThe measure was enacted in the name of national security, as lawmakers believed Americans' data was at risk of being compromised by China, or that China could influence Americans through controlling content on TikTok. TikTok - which has long said those concerns are meritless - and some of its users sued to block the law, challenging it from a First Amendment standpoint.\n\nWithout a sale, a reprieve for TikTok would mean that those national security concerns would, at least for now, remain unresolved.\n\nBut just days ahead of the potential ban, throngs of American TikTok users have downloaded other Chinese alternatives that pose similar security issues.\n\nTrump, who tried and failed to implement a ban during his first term, vowed on the campaign trail last year to \"save TikTok.\" Biden signed the ban into law as part of a $95 billion measure providing aid to Ukraine and Israel in April. But now his White House is looking to take the teeth out of the law.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a longtime Biden ally, is among a small set of lawmakers who have appealed to the White House and the Supreme Court to stop the ban.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that President Biden will listen to the millions of voices who don't want the lights to go out on this app,\" Khanna said. \"He has the power to extend the timeline to try to have a solution that prevents the app from shutting down.\"\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also said that he has relayed his concerns about the ban to White House officials and asked them to delay it.\n\nHe said they replied that they \"would take it under consideration\" but didn't give a clear answer of what would happen.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nLate last month, Trump filed a brief with the Supreme Court urging it to hold off on implementing that part of the law, so that the incoming president could \"pursue a negotiated resolution\" to prevent a TikTok shutdown. In that brief, Trump's attorney John Sauer argued that the president-elect \"received a powerful electoral mandate from American voters to protect the free-speech rights of all Americans - including the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.\"\n\nDays later, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to ask : \"Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?\"\n\nHe attached a graphic showing his broad reach on the short-form video app, which claims 170 million U.S. users.\n\nLast week, Supreme Court justices did not appear convinced by TikTok's free speech arguments, though it could decide to temporarily block the law while still ruling against the social media company.\n\nDuring arguments , Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to Congress finding that TikTok's parent company is subject to Chinese laws requiring it to assist in intelligence gathering.\n\n\"So are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" he asked.\n\nIn addressing the free speech concerns, Roberts said that \"Congress doesn't care about what's on TikTok.\"\n\nThe law is \"not saying TikTok has to stop,\" he added. \"They're saying China has to stop controlling TikTok.\"\n\nWhile TikTok's Asia-headquarters are located in Singapore, its parent company ByteDance resides in Beijing.\n\nSome congressional Republicans who voted for the TikTok law said they expect Trump to step in and negotiate a sale to U.S. interests once he takes office.\n\n\"They have to divest by law, so Trump could play an effective role by finding a buyer ... He fancies himself as a top negotiator,\" said Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, a China hawk who was chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee when Congress passed the legislation last year. \"Otherwise, I guess it shuts down unless he can find a way to divest it.\"\n\n\"A lot of these influencers rely on TikTok,\" he continued. \"They don't want to switch over, but ByteDance is controlled out of Beijing. It's just not a threat to Congress but to our children.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said there is only one path for TikTok if it wants to continue operating in the U.S.: divestiture.\n\n\"Congress has already passed the bill,\" he said. \"What I'm hoping for is the owners of TikTok come forward and say, 'We will never share Americans' data with the Communist Party of China and here's how that will be enforced: divesting from the parent company.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "GOP-led House committees release lengthy report alleging President Biden committed impeachable offenses\n\nThe Republican-led House committees investigating whether to impeach President Joe Biden released their long-awaited report about their findings Monday morning, arguing that Biden has committed impeachable conduct but deferring to the full House on whether to pursue a formal impeachment.\n\nThe nearly 300-page report is a summary of the investigation conducted by the House Oversight, Judiciary and Ways and Means committees over the past year and a half, nearly all of which has already been made public.\n\nIt argues that Biden enriched himself through his family's business ventures and concealed his mishandling of classified information in office, the subject of the investigation conducted by special counsel Robert Hur, who declined to press charges this year.\n\nIn addition, the committees say that the Justice Department mishandled its investigation into his son Hunter Biden's tax problems and that the White House has withheld key documents and witnesses from the impeachment investigation.\n\n\"The totality of the corrupt conduct uncovered by the Committees is egregious. President Joe Biden conspired to commit influence peddling and grift. In doing so, he abused his office and, by repeatedly lying about his abuse of office, has defrauded the United States to enrich his family,\" the report says.\n\nThe White House has not yet had the opportunity to comment on this article.\n\nThe report itself provides extensive details about the interactions with and payments from foreign companies to Hunter Biden and the president's brother James Biden and their business associates during the end of his time as vice president and when he was a private citizen.\n\nThe investigators put the total at $27 million, according to the bank records they received. But the investigators failed to turn up evidence that Biden himself received money from those companies or participated in the foreign business deals beyond the occasions when Hunter Biden called him on speakerphone to exchange pleasantries while in the company of foreign business associates or when he saw them at his son's birthday dinner.\n\nOne of the examples the committees cite is the case of Russian businesswoman Yelena Baturina, the wife of former Moscow Mayor Yury Luzkhkov, who invested $3.5 million with Hunter Biden's business partner Devon Archer through a company that had some ties to Hunter Biden in 2014. The investment was finalized after Hunter Biden's birthday dinner at Café Milano in Washington, D.C., which Baturina attended and Joe Biden, then the vice president, dropped by. Archer described the conversation in an interview with the Oversight Committee last year as being about \"the world, I guess, and the weather, and then everybody - everybody left.\"\n\nLater in the year, when another of Hunter Biden's business partners, Jason Galanis, was seeking further investment from Baturina that would have benefited Hunter Biden through an equity agreement, Hunter Biden called his father and put him on speakerphone, Galanis said. He told the Oversight and Judiciary committees that the short call included some \"pleasantries and hellos and safe travels,\" after which Joe Biden said, \"You be good to my boy,\" before the conversation ended. Though the committees present an email from Galanis indicating that Baturina had committed to make an additional investment, it does not indicate it ever happened.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nIn other parts of the report, the committees provide numerous examples of financial deals between Hunter Biden and Chinese corporations but does not provide direct links to Joe Biden while he was vice president or evidence of specific policies he changed or encouraged during that time. They also point to an example in 2017 when Sara Biden, the wife of the president's brother James, signed a $40,000 check to Biden designated as \"loan repayment\" from an account with money that had come into her account through various transfers that originated from Hunter Biden's dealings with a Chinese energy company.\n\nThe committees also point to instances of Hunter Biden's business associates' describing a future role in certain business ventures for Joe Biden after his time as vice president ended. In his testimony before the Oversight and Judiciary committees, Hunter Biden denied his father's involvement or ascribed any references he made to his father to his drug and alcohol use at the time.\n\nIn June, the chairmen of the three committees pursuing impeachment sent criminal referrals to the Justice Department recommending that Hunter and James Biden be charged with making false statements to Congress.\n\nOther sections of the report deal with the IRS' investigation into Hunter Biden's failure to pay taxes in 2017 and 2018, which began in 2018 during the Trump administration and continued during the Biden administration under the supervision of special counsel David Weiss. Two employees of the IRS came forward as whistleblowers to allege that the Justice Department was purposely slow-walking the investigation. Hunter Biden was offered a plea deal on federal firearms charges that fell apart in court last year, and he was later convicted on those charges at a jury trial this year. He is awaiting trial for his failure to pay taxes later this year.\n\nThe report makes no mention of the role of Alexander Smirnov, the possible Russian spy who fed false information about Hunter and Joe Biden to the FBI. Smirnov, who has also been charged with making false reports about the president's son by Weiss, is scheduled to go on trial in December.\n\n\"Although the Committees' fact-finding is ongoing amid President Biden's obstruction, the evidence uncovered in the impeachment inquiry to date already amounts to impeachable conduct. The Committees present this information to the House of Representatives for its evaluation and consideration of appropriate next steps,\" the report concludes.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was announced in September by Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., then the House speaker, and formally ratified by the House in December in a party-line vote.\n\nIt's unclear that Republican leadership would have enough votes to impeach Biden, and in any event, impeachment would be all but certain to fail to meet the two-thirds bar for conviction in the Senate. Senate Democrats, who hold a 51-49 edge, can vote to dismiss an impeachment inquiry with a simple majority.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden's family starts discussing his possible exit plan from the 2024 race\n\nWASHINGTON - Members of President Joe Biden's family have discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe overall tone of the conversations has been that any exit plan - should Biden decide to take that step, as some of his closest allies increasingly believe he will - should put the party in the best position to beat former President Donald Trump while also being worthy of the more than five decades he has served the country in elected office, these people said.\n\nBiden's family members have specifically discussed how he would want to end his re-election bid on his own timing and with a carefully calculated plan in place. Considerations about the impact of the campaign on his health, his family and the stability of the country are among those at the forefront of the discussions, the people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe prospect of Biden's considering stepping aside, much less that his family is gaming out a possible exit plan, is an extraordinary development that comes after he has repeatedly said he would not relinquish his position as the presumptive nominee of the party.\n\nBut concerns have mounted among party leaders, donors and even officials who are part of his re-election effort with every day that has passed since a devastating debate three weeks ago. At the same time, Democrats are watching Republicans rally around Trump, who just survived an assassination attempt and accepted his party's nomination Thursday night.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates denied that any such exit discussions are happening amongst the family.\n\n\"That is not happening, period,\" he said. \"The individuals making those claims are not speaking for his family or his team - and they will be proven wrong. Keep the faith.\"\n\nOn MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged that the campaign has seen some \"slippage,\" but she said it's been \"a small movement\" and insisted Biden is \"absolutely\" still in the race.\n\nRon Klain, Biden's former White House chief of staff and an adviser to him for decades, said in an interview that Biden is hearing the public and private calls for him to exit the race.\n\n\"I think he's feeling the pressure,\" said Klain, who has spoken to Biden recently. \"I want him to stay in.\"\n\nKlain's take is that it makes no sense for Biden to be pushed aside. He said some in his party underestimate Trump at their own peril and undervalue the fact that Biden is the only one who has beaten him before.\n\nBiden and the people closest to him have felt burned by efforts to push him out that they see as backhanded and disrespectful . The family is distraught and moving through the stages of anger and grief over how people they perceived to be friends have treated the president.\n\n\"There was a much more dignified way to do this if this is what they wanted,\" a Biden ally said. \"This is no way to treat a public servant who has done a lot for this country.\"\n\nDiscussions about how to game out a fitting plan for Biden to step aside have also played out among senior staff members, not just the president's family, according to a person close to the re-election effort. Bates also denied these discussions are happening.\n\nThe family members Biden has relied on most include first lady Jill Biden, his son Hunter and his sister, Valerie Owens, as well as a few longtime close aides who have been at the core of the discussions.\n\nThe conversations about Biden's political future have raged while he remains at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sidelined after he tested positive for Covid on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, some of Biden's closest aides were calling trusted allies to get a sense of where they thought his political standing is, according to a person familiar with the phone calls.\n\nA Democratic lawmaker described Biden in this moment as \"reflective.\" A third person close to Biden described the president as politically \"fighting for his life.\"\n\nThere are growing expectations among some allies that if Biden were to exit, it could be in the coming days. But they also caution that it still is up to him to make the decision and that he is not wired to quit even when he faces seemingly insurmountable adversity.\n\nAbout the possibility any announcement is imminent, a person close to the Bidens said, \"We don't even know what we're doing tomorrow.\"\n\nStill, Biden is not insusceptible to the mounting pressure from his own party, and he has said himself since the debate that he may consider leaving the race if there were no path for him to win.\n\n\"I think it's inevitable,\" a second person close to the re-election effort said of Biden's withdrawing from the race.\n\nAs reports surfaced, including from NBC News , that Biden had shown signs that he could budge from his insistence that he remain the nominee, rumors and reports - some that the president's allies flatly denied - began to fly. They included speculation about timing of a potential exit, whether Biden would immediately endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and who was on the shortlist to be her vice presidential running mate.\n\nAmong the reports: that longtime speechwriter and historian Jon Meacham was penning Biden's exit remarks.\n\nMeacham rebuffed the account.\n\n\"The report is totally false,\" he said.\n\nAmid the turmoil the Biden campaign sent out talking points to Democrats, according to a Democratic strategies: \"President Biden has not spoken to congressional leadership today. The president is his party's nominee, having won 14 million votes during the Democratic primary. He's running for re-election, and that will not change until he wins re-election.\"\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nAs many in his own party turned against him, Biden continued this week to check in with allies and gauge their sentiments.\n\n\"With all the rumors that I'm leaving, I'm not,\" Biden told the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, in a phone call Monday, Sharpton said.\n\n\"I will support whatever you decide,\" Sharpton said he told the president.\n\nSharpton said in an interview Thursday that legacy is something Biden \"has to think of\" as he contemplates his political future. \"If there's anyone that could make a comeback ... it's Joe Biden. Whether he chooses to or not, I don't know.\"\n\nSome in Biden's camp had hoped he would be able to weather the storm of pressure for him to step aside - that news events, including the Republican National Convention, would turn the national conversation away from whether and when he might end his campaign. But even the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday did little to quell the furor around Biden. If anything, Democrats have since turned up the heat.\n\nA major factor driving the private pressure on Biden is the fear among Democrats that his candidacy could rob them not only of the White House and the Senate but also of a chance to flip the House to their control. That helps explain why senior lawmakers have pushed on Biden to reconsider his decision to stay in the race.\n\n\"The House is on the brink,\" said Brian Wolff, the treasurer of the House Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting House Democratic candidates. \"These candidates don't deserve that.\"\n\nWolff said Democratic incumbents and challengers in tough races cannot risk splintering their own voter coalitions by publicly taking one side or the other as Biden considers his options.\n\n\"They can't afford to alienate the base that wants to support Biden or the base that wants someone else,\" he said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

He had also pleaded guilty to a separate federal tax evasion charge. Earlier, Biden had ruled out using his executive powers to pardon his son.\n\nAll the 1,500 offenders are \"non-violent\" and have been placed on home confinement for at least one year under the Covid-19-era CARES Act, the White House said, while adding that they had shown \"successful rehabilitation and a strong commitment to making their communities safer.\"\n\nMany of these defendants would receive lower sentences if they were tried under today's laws, policies and practices, Biden said.\n\nThe 39 pardoned individuals were all convicted of \"non-violent crimes\". They include a decorated military veteran who volunteers at a local church, a nurse who leads responses to natural disasters and an addiction counselor who works with young people.\n\nPresident Barack Obama commuted the sentences of 330 offenders in one of his final acts before leaving office in 2017, then the biggest single batch of commutations in history.\n\nThe White House said Biden is the first president to issue \"categorical pardons\" for the people convicted of the use and possession of marijuana and to former LGBTQI+ service members convicted because of their sexual orientation.\n\n\"The President has issued more sentence commutations at this point in his presidency than any of his recent predecessors at the same point in their first terms,\" the White House statement said.\n\nThere could be more to come: Biden ended his statement by promising that he would \"take more steps in the weeks ahead\" and that his administration would \"continue reviewing clemency petitions.\"\n\nBiden and aides have discussed the idea of issuing pre-emptive pardons for people President-elect Donald Trump has scorned in recent years as he has hinted about plans for retribution, two sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News.\n\nBiden leaves office on Jan. 20, 2025, with the inauguration of Trump.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden plans executive action on police reform to revive stalled issue\n\nPresident Joe Biden is planning to sign executive actions on police reform as early as this month, three people familiar with the plans said, as his administration seeks to unilaterally jumpstart an issue that's a top priority for a key constituency.\n\nThe executive actions would follow Biden's uphill battle to advance voting rights legislation, and could coincide with a similar effort by some Democratic lawmakers to revive the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which stalled on Capitol Hill after failed attempts to craft a bipartisan measure.\n\nThe focus on police reforms is part of what appears to be a last-ditch effort by the Biden administration to take action on some of the president's signature initiatives in the run-up to his State of the Union Address on March 1. In addition to voting rights and policing, the White House and congressional Democrats are considering ways to resurrect Biden's Build Back Better package, either by paring back the legislation or separating it into two bills, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe executive actions on policing are still being finalized, according to the people familiar with the plans. They did not know how the actions would differ from steps taken by the Justice Department last year when it imposed new restrictions on chokeholds and \"no-knock\" warrants.\n\nTwo people familiar with the discussions said the White House could roll out the executive actions to mark the beginning of Black History Month in February.\n\nBiden also is expected to use the moment to criticize former President Donald Trump, the people familiar with the discussions said. The president was sharply critical of Trump during a Jan. 6 anniversary speech and again on Tuesday while giving remarks on voting rights.\n\nThe White House's decision to start 2022 with major pushes for voting rights and police reform comes as Biden's support among Black voters, a voting bloc key to both his primary and general election success, appears to be at an all-time low. A new Quinnipiac poll found that 57 percent of Black voters approved of the president's job performance - down significantly from 78 percent in April, and in territory that could imperil Democrats' chances of keeping control of the House and Senate in the November midterm elections.\n\nThe White House held back on police reform executive actions in 2021 out of concern that such moves could upend bipartisan negotiations in Congress on the issue. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday, \"I think there's a recognition and a commitment by the president to deliver on what he promised.\"\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), whose support was crucial to Biden winning the Democratic nomination, is among those who have been urging the president both publicly and privately not to forget his promise upon winning the White House to have Black voters' backs. Clyburn told NBC News that he pushed Biden particularly to show new urgency on voting rights, even if it means being more aggressive with fellow Democrats, when they traveled together to South Carolina last month.\n\n\"What he's got to understand is that he's no longer a senator. He's now president. And he's got to be able to say to some of these senators, 'I know there's some things that you'd like to have my help on but let me tell you up front: I need your help too,'\" Clyburn said.\n\nClyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, said he had not heard about potential executive actions on police reform, but said he and other lawmakers were developing a strategy to force the issue by potentially attaching the George Floyd measure to \"must-pass\" legislation like government funding bills.\n\nBiden's renewed focus on voting rights, followed by expected action on police reform, is also buying the White House and congressional Democrats some time to figure out a way forward on Build Back Better, the president's social safety net and climate bill, after internal party talks collapsed in late December.\n\nRep. Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said discussions are stalled as Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., continues to oppose the bill.\n\n\"We're all familiar with what Joe doesn't want and we're less familiar with what he wants,\" Neal said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden tells Democratic lawmakers he is weighing big reforms to the Supreme Court\n\nPresident Joe Biden is preparing to endorse significant proposals to reform the Supreme Court and notified some members of Congress about his intentions last weekend, three sources familiar with the plans said Tuesday.\n\nThe proposals under serious consideration include legislation to establish term limits for justices and establishing an updated code of ethics that would be binding and enforceable, a source said. The policies, which haven't been finalized, may be rolled out in the coming weeks, which would be a new approach for a president who has long been skeptical of restructuring the Supreme Court.\n\nA White House spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nBiden told lawmakers in the Congressional Progressive Caucus during a virtual meeting Saturday that he had been consulting constitutional scholars on the matter for more than a month, according to a person familiar with the discussion.\n\n\"I'm going to need your help to and advice on how we should be doing what I'm going to be doing there. Want to make sure we have a closer working relationship, because we're in this together,\" Biden told the lawmakers, though he didn't get into specific policy substance, the source said.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported Biden's plans.\n\nTwo other sources told NBC News that Biden told the lawmakers he will come out for big reforms, without giving them details, but that members on the call understood him to be referring to term limits and ethics rules. The call took place Saturday before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nTrump T-shirts that flooded Chinese retail sites after the shooting have disappeared\n\nAmericans bombed his town. 80 years later, he's commemorating D-Day by flying an American flag\n\nAfter a devastating knee injury, gymnast Brody Malone is back and ready to medal in Paris\n\n\"Look, it's not, it's not hyperbole to suggest Trump is literally an existential threat, an existential threat to the very constitution of democracy we, we say we care about. And I mean if this guy wins, he's not, and now, especially with that Supreme Court giving him the kind of breadth of - I don't need to get into the Supreme Court right now - anyway, but I need your help,\" Biden said, according to a source who provided this excerpt.\n\nChanging the structure of the Supreme Court would require Congress to make a new law. That's extremely unlikely while Republicans control the House, as the party is pleased with the 6-3 conservative majority it has built on the high court.\n\nBut the proposals could become a useful messaging device for Biden on the campaign trail. And if Democrats sweep the election, they may have a fighting chance of passing. Democrats have rallied voters against the Supreme Court, citing unpopular rulings like the elimination of federal abortion rights and a spate of recent reports detailing apparent ethical lapses among some of the justices.\n\nLast month, Senate Democrats sought to pass Supreme Court ethics legislation but ran into Republican opposition . In the House, Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Don Beyer, D-Va., have introduced legislation that would impose 18-year term limits for future justices, ultimately creating vacancies to fill during every four-year presidential term and preventing retirements for partisan reasons.\n\nKhanna praised Biden for warming up to the idea, noting that he first introduced term limits legislation in 2020.\n\n\"Since then, we have been advocating for the president to champion this reform,\" Khanna told NBC News on Tuesday. \"It is a big step for him to now call for commonsense term limits for the court and a judicial code of ethics.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden administration looks for ways to keep TikTok available in the U.S.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration is considering ways to keep TikTok available in the U.S. if a ban that's scheduled to go into effect on Sunday proceeds, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\"Americans shouldn't expect to see TikTok suddenly banned on Sunday,\" an administration official said, adding that officials are \"exploring options\" for how to implement the law so that TikTok does not go dark on Sunday.\n\nIf the administration moves forward with any such plan, it would mean that the popular app going down would not define his last full day in office, and it would defer the issue to Donald Trump, who is inaugurated on Monday.\n\nAt the same time, Mike Waltz, the incoming national security adviser for Trump, told Fox News Wednesday that the president-elect is ready to intervene to preserve access to the Chinese-owned video app in the American marketplace. And Pam Bondi, Trump's pick for attorney general, refused to commit to enforcing the ban when asked about it during her Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\nTaken together, the moves represent parallel efforts by the rival presidents to execute an end run around Congress and the Supreme Court, which is teed up to issue a ruling on the ban at any time.\n\nStill, a White House official insisted that not enforcing the ban, if it is upheld, is not an option.\n\n\"We are not considering deferring enforcement,\" the official said. \"Statutorily, we don't believe we have the authority to do that.\"\n\nBiden and Trump's positions are reversals from their one-time support for banning the app.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on the plan.\n\nTikTok is considering its options, including the last-ditch possibility that the app goes dark on Sunday, though it could also allow the app to remain active but without future updates and bug fixes.\n\nThe law in question required ByteDance, TikTok's China-based owner, to divest from the company and find an outside buyer to take over within nine months. That window closes Sunday. The law also provided the president authority to grant a one-time 90-day extension if \" significant progress \" has been made toward that divestment.\n\nThe measure was enacted in the name of national security, as lawmakers believed Americans' data was at risk of being compromised by China, or that China could influence Americans through controlling content on TikTok. TikTok - which has long said those concerns are meritless - and some of its users sued to block the law, challenging it from a First Amendment standpoint.\n\nWithout a sale, a reprieve for TikTok would mean that those national security concerns would, at least for now, remain unresolved.\n\nBut just days ahead of the potential ban, throngs of American TikTok users have downloaded other Chinese alternatives that pose similar security issues.\n\nTrump, who tried and failed to implement a ban during his first term, vowed on the campaign trail last year to \"save TikTok.\" Biden signed the ban into law as part of a $95 billion measure providing aid to Ukraine and Israel in April. But now his White House is looking to take the teeth out of the law.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a longtime Biden ally, is among a small set of lawmakers who have appealed to the White House and the Supreme Court to stop the ban.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that President Biden will listen to the millions of voices who don't want the lights to go out on this app,\" Khanna said. \"He has the power to extend the timeline to try to have a solution that prevents the app from shutting down.\"\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also said that he has relayed his concerns about the ban to White House officials and asked them to delay it.\n\nHe said they replied that they \"would take it under consideration\" but didn't give a clear answer of what would happen.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nLate last month, Trump filed a brief with the Supreme Court urging it to hold off on implementing that part of the law, so that the incoming president could \"pursue a negotiated resolution\" to prevent a TikTok shutdown. In that brief, Trump's attorney John Sauer argued that the president-elect \"received a powerful electoral mandate from American voters to protect the free-speech rights of all Americans - including the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.\"\n\nDays later, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to ask : \"Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?\"\n\nHe attached a graphic showing his broad reach on the short-form video app, which claims 170 million U.S. users.\n\nLast week, Supreme Court justices did not appear convinced by TikTok's free speech arguments, though it could decide to temporarily block the law while still ruling against the social media company.\n\nDuring arguments , Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to Congress finding that TikTok's parent company is subject to Chinese laws requiring it to assist in intelligence gathering.\n\n\"So are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" he asked.\n\nIn addressing the free speech concerns, Roberts said that \"Congress doesn't care about what's on TikTok.\"\n\nThe law is \"not saying TikTok has to stop,\" he added. \"They're saying China has to stop controlling TikTok.\"\n\nWhile TikTok's Asia-headquarters are located in Singapore, its parent company ByteDance resides in Beijing.\n\nSome congressional Republicans who voted for the TikTok law said they expect Trump to step in and negotiate a sale to U.S. interests once he takes office.\n\n\"They have to divest by law, so Trump could play an effective role by finding a buyer ... He fancies himself as a top negotiator,\" said Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, a China hawk who was chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee when Congress passed the legislation last year. \"Otherwise, I guess it shuts down unless he can find a way to divest it.\"\n\n\"A lot of these influencers rely on TikTok,\" he continued. \"They don't want to switch over, but ByteDance is controlled out of Beijing. It's just not a threat to Congress but to our children.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said there is only one path for TikTok if it wants to continue operating in the U.S.: divestiture.\n\n\"Congress has already passed the bill,\" he said. \"What I'm hoping for is the owners of TikTok come forward and say, 'We will never share Americans' data with the Communist Party of China and here's how that will be enforced: divesting from the parent company.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Assessing The Biden Presidency\n\nBy John C. Goodman\n\nBy John C. Goodman ,\n\nContributor.\n\nOne wonders what Joe Biden's poll numbers would be if press coverage had been more accurate.\n\nIf public opinion polls are the guide, Joe Biden has been the worst president since Richard Nixon.\n\nYet New York Times economics writer Peter Coy gives Biden high marks. \"Biden's handling of the economy was good, if not great,\" he writes. After all, we have record low unemployment, moderating inflation, and economic growth. What's not to like?\n\nHere is the problem. Most of the time, presidents have only a marginal impact on the economy. Consequently, they should be judged not on what happened on their watch, but what they did or didn't do relative to what happened.\n\nEnergy . During the presidential campaign, both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris boasted that U.S. oil production was at an all-time high. Yet one of Biden's first acts as president was the cancellation of the Keystone pipeline, which would have brought oil from Canada to the U.S. He went on to pause new oil and gas leases on federal lands. In the waning days of his administration, he banned offshore drilling on large swaths of U.S. waters.\n\nSo yes, U.S. oil production is at an all-time high . But that is not because of Biden. It's in spite of Biden.\n\nTaxes . The best thing you can say about Biden's tax policy ideas is that almost none of them were enacted. When Donald Trump became president, the U.S. had one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Trump tax reform cut the top rate from 35 percent to 21 percent- resulting in more investment, more output and a larger economy . Biden proposed to cut that tax break in half . Kamala Harris at one point favored eliminating it altogether.\n\nBiden also proposed additional taxes on investment income -including unrealized capital gains. I know of no economic model that predicts the economy will get bigger when you impose taxes on capital.\n\nThe Biden plan also proposed a 12.4 percent Social Security tax on all wages above $400,000, and he repeatedly said families who earn less than that amount would be completely unaffected. However, the income threshold isn't indexed for inflation. So eventually, all families would be paying the tax, even if they had no increase in real income.\n\nTake a 20-year-old couple earning $100,000. With a 2 percent inflation rate and 2 percent productivity growth, that couple would be paying the Biden payroll tax sometime in their 50's.\n\nWorse than the ideas themselves was Biden's rhetoric. He repeatedly claimed that the wealthy do not pay their fair share. Yet the U.S. tax system is the most progressive in the world - with the top 1 percent paying 40 percent of all income taxes and the top 10 percent paying almost three fourths.\n\nBiden has repeatedly claimed that Republicans-going all the way back to Ronald Reagan-have only cut taxes for the rich. Yet the reason why we have the world's most progressive tax system-with the bottom half of the income ladder paying almost no income taxes at all - is because of Republican tax legislation .\n\nRegulation . Another impediment to a strong, vibrant economy is excessive government regulation. The Biden administration weakened the cost-benefit standard that was previously in place-making costly regulations easier to impose.\n\nWithout even counting Operation Warp Speed (which produced the Covid vaccine), University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan finds that the Trump administration reduced regulatory costs by almost $11,000 per household in present value. By contrast, the Biden-era regulations created a burden of almost $10,000 per household.\n\nHere again, the economy did well during the Biden years. But not because of Biden's policies toward business enterprise. It was in spite of them.\n\nUnions . Joe Biden boasts that he has been the most pro-union president in U.S. history. There is some truth to that. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and other Biden-era federal policies often require the use of union labor, or require paying a prevailing (union) wage, or include financial incentives to hire union labor on federal projects.\n\nBut how does that help the economy as a whole? It doesn't.\n\nA union is an attempt to monopolize the supply of labor in some sector of the economy. If successful, the union members will enjoy a monopoly wage. Yet those gains appear to be at the expense of wage income for other workers, not at the expense of capital.\n\nWhen measured correctly, labor's share of national income has been roughly constant at about 70 percent -for the last century.\n\nOver that period, union membership varie-rising to a third of the workforce in the 1950s and then falling to only 6 percent of private sector workers today. These radical changes in union membership appear to have had no impact at all on labor's aggregate income.\n\nInflation . Economists do not agree on why we had excessive inflation during the Biden presidency. I side with monetary economist Scott Sumner , who says that what we have experienced is almost totally a demand side phenomenon.\n\nThe government deposited money right into people's bank accounts. It funded those deposits by borrowing in the credit market, and the Federal Reserve bought most of that debt with newly created money. When people spent their newly acquired funds, they drove up prices.\n\nThat said, there is one thing economists are unanimous about: The Biden/Harris explanation of inflation is hogwash. There is no such thing as an economic theory of inflation based on greed. The President and the Vice President of the United States repeatedly told the public something that all economists know isn't true.\n\nHealth Care . On more than one occasion, Biden promised, \"I will never cut Medicare.\" Yet the IRA cut more than $300 billion out of the Medicare Part D program. As a result, drug insurance premiums for seniors last fall would have doubled right before the November elections had the Democrats not found a dubiously legal end run. They \"borrowed\" money from the Medicare trust fund and gave it to insurers who agreed not to raise premiums. That election-year gimmick didn't solve a problem. It merely delayed the problem.\n\nThe IRA did put a $35-a-month limit on the price of insulin, and it provided for negotiated prices for 10 drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. But the very same bill delayed for a decade a Trump regulation that would have required pharmacists to pass on manufacturer discounts to patients.\n\nThe net result: 10 percent of beneficiaries will experience lower drug costs, in most cases less than $300 a year. The remaining 90 percent will potentially pay more.\n\nBiden can rightfully claim credit for enhanced subsidies in the (Obamacare) exchanges, and that has substantially increased enrollment. But this is the wrong solution for the wrong problem.\n\nWe are over-subsidizing the healthy and under-subsidizing the sick. Half the people with individual insurance are paying no premium at all. We are literally giving the insurance away. But the out-of-pocket exposure for someone with high medical expenses is $9,200 a year and twice that for a family.\n\nNews coverage. The mainstream media routinely uses the word \"lie\" to describe even small exaggerations by Donald Trump . Yet I have never seen that word applied to Joe Biden, despite false statements about how our tax system works, how his own tax plan worked, what causes inflation, and what the IRA did to seniors. Maybe there was a Pinocchio once in a while. But never a \"lie.\"\n\nJust as they ignored the president's mental health decline, they ignored his dishonest rhetoric. One can only imagine what the poll numbers would look like had the press coverage been more accurate."

Eisenhower's warning about the \"military-industrial complex,\" that he said \"could pose real dangers for the U.S.\"\n\nBiden took aim at Big Tech, saying \"Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power,\" which came days after the president slammed Meta's decision to end fact-checking on its platforms as \"really shameful.\"\n\nThe president also warned of an \"oligarchy taking shape\" in the U.S. through the \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people,\" and said the U.S. could suffer \"dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked.\"\n\nBiden acknowledged the power of artificial intelligence in his speech, lauding it for its \"profound possibilities\" while noting that unless safeguards are put in place \"AI could spawn new threats to our rights, our way of life to our privacy, how we work and how we protect our nation.\"\n\nThough Biden did not call out any specific figures in his warning about an American oligarchy, many of the world's most wealthy billionaires such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have built their fortunes from leading large tech companies-the three will reportedly be seated together at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration Monday.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts : We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines.

His farewell speech Wednesday night came just days ahead of Trump reassuming the office after winning the 2024 election over Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic nominee in July after Biden-the oldest sitting president in history-ceded the nomination amid concerns about his age, mental acuity and his ability to beat Trump again given historically low approval ratings. By last summer, in the heat of his reelection bid, Biden's approval rating had fallen to around 38% after starting at 53% when he became president. Biden's battle against Trump ahead of the general election did not help his approval rating, with observers taking note of a poor debate performance and public appearances riddled with gaffes, silences and verbal miscues. Trump will be inaugurated Monday at noon EST as the 47th president.\n\nThe Biden administration addressed the pandemic through multiple initiatives that increased vaccinations, decreased unemployment and supported a boom in the small business sector . Among the wins the Biden administration counts are its efforts on securing a multibillion-dollar infrastructure deal , furthering clean energy initiatives , lowering drug costs and boosting semiconductor manufacturing amid a boom in artificial intelligence. Biden also claimed credit for the Gaza ceasefire deal reached Wednesday, saying the plan \"was developed and negotiated\" by his team but will be \"largely implemented\" by the Trump administration.\n\nBiden pulled the U.S. out of its long, costly war in Afghanistan by finishing an agreement made between Trump's administration and the Taliban, but the exit was sharply criticized and disastrous, with the Taliban promptly taking over the nation's capital in a withdrawal that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and hundreds of Afghan civilians. Immigration was a major pain point for Biden's presidency, as the president did not largely address record illegal border crossings into the U.S. until the final months of his presidency, when he launched a crackdown on the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the U.S.\n\nBiden's Final Labor Numbers: Lowest Unemployment Since Clinton-Marred By Inflation (Forbes)\n\nHere's Why Biden Says He Dropped Out-In First Speech Since Leaving 2024 Race (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Here's How Much Joe Biden Was Worth In 2021\n\nBy Michela Tindera\n\nBy Michela Tindera ,\n\nFormer Staff.\n\nO n the day America's first billionaire president took office, \"middle class\" Joe Biden boarded the Amtrak out of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, bound for Delaware with the kind of modest fortune you might expect from someone who had spent his adult life as an elected official: $2.5 million, mostly composed of pensions and real estate. But Biden was about to cash in. By the end of 2017, he and his wife Jill had earned $11.1 million. They raked in $4.6 million the next year, followed by $1 million in 2019 and $630,000 in 2020.\n\nThe story of how Biden became a wealthy man in the wake of his vice presidency, leveraging his fame to sell books and deliver speeches, has been told many times . But a closer look at the math prompts a question that hasn't been asked: Why isn't Biden even richer? If someone starts with a $2.5 million net worth and earns $17.3 million while the markets are raging, you'd expect him to be worth more than $8 million. So what happened to Biden's money? Well, $7 million of it covered taxes, another $1.3 million went to charity, $180,000 paid for household staff and an estimated $80,000 went toward interest on mortgages. Take those items out, though, and you're still a few million above Biden's estimated net worth.\n\nThere's a chance that Biden, who shares his fortune with his wife Jill, gave some to other family members. Or perhaps he just spent it all. In order to be worth $8 million-as an analysis of Biden's financial disclosure reports, property records and career earnings suggest he is-the president would have had to blow an average of roughly some $2,000 per day over the four years he was out of office.\n\nThe White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Joe Biden's money.\n\nYou can learn a lot about how a president might manage the country's finances by how they have handled their own. Donald Trump may have come from a party that prides itself on fiscal conservatism, but anyone with a cursory understanding of his financial history-with huge debts financing lavish developments, many of which failed-could have told you at the outset that he wasn't the sort of guy who would be likely to watch the national budget carefully. And he didn't-deficits ballooned 68% even before the pandemic, largely thanks to a massive tax cut that benefitted rich people and corporations.\n\nBiden's priorities are different. He seems determined to give money to the middle class rather than the wealthy. He has already passed a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill and just suggested a $6 trillion budget. A detailed look at his personal finances suggest that he and Trump have something in common, however. Both are people who don't mind taking on debt and enjoy spending freely. So don't be surprised if the national debt keeps soaring.\n\nB iden's grandfather was an executive with American Oil. His father tried out a number of businesses but they all failed, and the family fell on hard times. He later landed a job as a car salesman. Nonetheless, Joe Biden wasn't interested in a safe career path. As a student at the University of Delaware in the early 1960s, asked his friends a question: \"You guys could be guaranteed-upon graduation-a job at the DuPont company, with a nice starting salary and a job for life, but you would never make more than $40,000 a year (some $350,000 today). Or you could take a job at half the salary, no guarantees, but there would be no limit to the money you could make. Which would you take?\" The answer was clear for Biden. He told his friends he would take the chance.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Biden bet on himself, borrowing money from the bank that financed the cars his father sold to start his own firm in downtown Wilmington, Delaware. But he wasn't a big saver. After the firm won its first big case, Biden received a $5,000 check. He and his wife Neilia, a schoolteacher, promptly spent it on a four-poster bed, a dining set and a desk. \"The bill was substantial-maybe more than the check-but so was the furniture,\" Biden wrote in his 2007 memoir, Promises To Keep . \"This was our adventure, and Neilia was so sure of our future.\"\n\nThat future quickly included a small collection of real estate. In the span of about six months, Biden acquired three houses, including one on 80 acres of land in Maryland-where he had a grand dream to one day develop a family compound for his parents and siblings. To swing it, he borrowed some money from his father-in-law and more from banks, while he and Neilia found tenants and rented out the properties. Biden and his wife and young sons lived in a small house rent-free in exchange for managing a nearby country club pool. Even after collecting rent, money was still tight. Biden himself acknowledged in his memoir, \"I was in constant danger of falling behind.\"\n\nThat didn't stop him from dreaming even bigger. After a tragic car accident in 1972 that killed his wife Neilia and baby daughter, Biden bought a new home for him and his boys-paying $185,000 (equivalent to $930,000 today) for a 10,000-square foot DuPont mansion in Wilmington. At the time he bought it, Biden's salary as a senator was around $43,000 a year. Over the years, he refinanced the home frequently, taking on mortgages in amounts far exceeding what he originally paid for the house. Biden sold it in 1996 for $1.2 million and bought land nearby for $350,000. He built a new house on the plot, then proceeded to regularly refinance it as well.\n\nBiden put his three kids through private schools and college with the help of borrowed money. \"Home ownership is how most middle-class families save, how most middle-class families build assets and for many, it's the way you send your kid to college, borrowing against it,\" Biden explained at a 2015 event for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \"That's how I got my children to college.\" In 2001, when his daughter Ashley was a student at Tulane University, he was on the hook for at least a half dozen loans totaling more than $700,000.\n\nIf you look at these moves from a business perspective, they don't make much sense. Biden was stretching himself thin, without saving or investing much money. But if you look at them from a quality-of-life perspective, they have a little more logic to them-\"middle-class Joe\" wanted to live an upper-class lifestyle, enjoying big homes and sending his kids to pricey schools, so he borrowed big. \"What is very common in the United States today, is most people, even with large incomes, are strapped for liquidity,\" says Megan Gorman, an attorney and managing partner at a financial planning firm for high net worth individuals, who also serves as a Forbes contributor. \"When you look at the Bidens' tax returns, what you see is, a couple who over the course of their lives have accumulated things like pensions, life insurance, some savings. And it's not some big, calculated plan to be this ultra-high net worth individual.\"\n\nAfter Biden became vice president, he received some extra income to pay for his house. In a Trumpian move, he rented out a cottage on his Wilmington property for $26,400 a year, reportedly leasing it to the U.S. Secret Service in charge of protecting him.\n\nJ ust because you're tight on cash doesn't mean you're broke. When Biden left office in 2017, he was worth an estimated $2.5 million. He had a life insurance policy and a handful of retirement accounts, but the majority of his net worth came from his Delaware home and his federal pension, which guaranteed him annual income of some $160,000 for life.\n\nMore liquidity came fast, as Joe and Jill Biden started writing books and delivering speeches. The former vice president received a plum professor gig at University of Pennsylvania. With greater earnings came greater spending. In 2017, the Bidens paid $8,600 for household labor, according to their tax returns. By 2020, that number had ballooned to $95,250. A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about what sort of staff the Bidens employed. They handed out $1.3 million to more than two dozen charities, including organizations like the United Jewish Federation of Chicago and the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children. They also paid off one mortgage and two lines of credit.\n\nFollowing through on a longtime promise to his wife, Biden shelled out $2.7 million in June 2017 for a 4,800 square-foot summer home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. It turned out to be a decent investment: The house is now worth an estimated $3.4 million, up about 25% from what they paid four years ago, thanks to surging home values during the pandemic.\n\nBut the Bidens don't appear to have done much else to grow their fortune through investments. While Biden has made pledges to not invest in individual stocks as a way to avoid ethical conflicts in his job, he has also shied away from investing even in diversified mutual funds-holdings that ethics experts often recommend to avoid conflicts of interest. A 2019 financial disclosure shows that the Bidens had less than $200,000 in mutual funds held inside a variable annuity, with the remainder of their fortune sitting in cash accounts, state retirement accounts, life insurance policies and holding companies for their writing and speaking endeavors. By not participating much in the market, they missed out on stock gains that could have added millions more to their fortune.\n\nOn Biden's most recent financial disclosure report, filed in May, the president listed cash and retirement accounts worth somewhere between $1.2 million and $2.9 million. If you just take his $17.3 million of earnings and subtract all $11.8 million of known expenses-taxes, charitable deductions, housing costs and so on-that would leave you with $5.5 million. Since Biden's disclosure shows cash and retirement accounts worth $1.2 million to $2.9 million-far less than the $5.5 million figure-that suggests Biden parted with at least $2.6 million elsewhere. One possibility is gifts to his family. Federal tax laws allow couples to hand off $30,000 per year to anyone without having to report it. If Joe and Jill Biden gave the maximum to their two children, Hunter and Ashley, along with their grandchildren, that could account for over $200,000 a year. Biden also could have made additional gifts to charities outside the U.S., which would not show up on his tax returns. In 2018, for example, the Bidens donated $25,000 to a British charity tied to Prince Harry.\n\nOr maybe they just spent it all, enjoying their money without thinking too strategically about it. The Bidens installed a new pool at their Rehoboth house in 2017. Local pool professionals suggested that could cost more than $75,000. In 2019, the Washington Post reported that the Bidens were also renting a 5-bedroom mansion in McLean, Virginia for an estimated $20,000 a month.\n\nEven if the Bidens keep spending freely, they're not likely to run out of cash at any point. They could spend $2,000 a day for the next eight years and still walk away from a potential second term with more than $2 million, just like they did in 2017. Once again, they'd be in position to deliver speeches and write books, poised for yet another windfall."

      "text": "Calling It Quits: 4 Lessons From Joe Biden\n\nBy Joe Moglia\n\nBy Joe Moglia ,\n\nContributor.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JULY 14: U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the assassination attempt on ... More Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump at the White House on July 14, 2024 in Washington, DC. Biden was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nJoe Biden just did one of the hardest things a leader can do-in politics, business, or sports. It doesn't matter the arena, knowing when to call it quits is difficult. Actually doing it is even more challenging. It's hard to walk away from power, money, fame, and prestige-especially at the level of the US presidency. It requires humbleness, self-reflection, self-sacrifice, and a clear-eyed understanding of what the costs of playing for too long really are.\n\nIt's much more common to see a superstar get this equation wrong, than do it the right way.\n\nTake Mickey Mantle.\n\nIn his final years as a professional baseball player, Mantle went from one of the greatest hitters of all time-leading the major leagues in batting average, home runs, and RBIs in 1956-to batting just .237 in his final season, a performance so abysmal that it brought his career average below .300.\n\n(Original Caption) Here's Yankee slugger Mickey Mantle toting lumber in both hands after literally ... More hitting roundtrippers left and right. He drove in all the Yankee runs with three homers and a single in four trips to the plate to help the Bombers down the Detroit Tigers, 5-2. Mickey slammed the first two homers left handed and the third right handed. They came with one on in the first and with the bases empty in the fifth and eighth innings.\n\nNo one would ever deny that Mantle was one of the greatest baseball players to ever live. But his final seasons were not good, and he did a disservice to the Yankees by continuing to play past his prime.\n\nThe situation is always the same when someone sticks around too long. First, they're just not as sharp as they used to be. They strike out when they would have hit a home run a few years ago. If it goes on too long, wins turn to losses and the excuses pile up. Errors begin to outweigh great catches. It's sad when everyone else can see it except for the player himself.\n\nIt's easy for an armchair quarterback to say, \"he needs to retire already,\" but a lot harder to do it when you're in charge. Do it too late, and you drag down your team or organization. Do it too early without the right preparation-as Disney CEO Bob Iger did when he retired in 2021-and the organization can struggle with a leadership vacuum.\n\nAny leader's goal should be to step down at a high point, so the organization can keep on winning. But this requires timing, awareness, and putting the right team in place around you. It's also something that leaders have to prepare for in advance. If you start thinking that it might be time, and you haven't already created a succession plan, then it's already too late.\n\nHere are four key steps every leader needs to take to ensure they not only step down at the right time, but do it the right way too.\n\nPresident Biden did a hard thing stepping down from the top of the ticket, and there are lessons there for anyone in a leadership position. The act of knowing when to call it quits is also an act of leadership, just as much as taking actions in the job. The best leaders understand this and practice it themselves."

More the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. President Biden and Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nWhen the story of Joe Biden's four-year job market is all said and done, and written into the history books, it will be told with many superlatives. So much so, that skeptics will doubt (and possibly attempt to revise) the story. That's because it's almost too good to be true, certainly one we've never seen before. Frankly, Joe Biden built and sustained the strongest, healthiest, most resilient job market in American history.\n\nAnd December's Jobs Report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics - the last one of Joe Biden's presidency - emphatically put the exclamation point at the end of this tale: 256,000 new jobs burst onto the market while the unemployment rate fell again to 4.1%.\n\nThose are the most visible and commonly referenced measurements, but by far not the whole story. For instance, there could be several reasons for a fall or rise in the employment rate: number of workers landing jobs rises while number of workers looking remains steady, number of workers landing jobs decreases or stays steady while the number of job losses decreases even further, and so on. Most permutations, we see, have at least one caveat.\n\nNot so in December's case, and most of the last four years, for that matter. While the civilian noninstitutional population (number of adults in the workforce) grew by 175,000, the civilian labor force grew by 243,000, which it achieved by an increase of 478,000 in the employed ranks an da decrease in unemployed persons by 235,000. (Those two numbers, 243 + 235, work out neatly to 478.)\n\nJob markets, like anything else, are susceptible to variations and inconsistencies, frailties and foibles.\n\nNot so with the job market over which Joe Biden presided for the last four years. The blockbuster months were many and powerful while the \"off\" months were few and actually positive against most historic backdrops.\n\nWitness the 17 million jobs created in the last four years, second highest notched by any president save Bill Clinton - and it took Clinton two terms to do it. Biden's accomplishment was no accident. Rather, an extremely revved up start to Biden's presidency saw the American Relief Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and a climate bill that not only protects the environment but creates jobs as well. A potent mix of positive policy, skillful politics, firm resolve, and favorable conditions combined to write this chapter of history.\n\nImportant to note here is that this job market was marked not only by the number of jobs but also their quality. Once again, wages rise every month this year, finishing the year 3.9% up from last year, considerably outpacing inflation.ee\n\nSo Joe Biden saw it through to the end. He finished the race: 48 consecutive months with strong job creation and sustained low unemployment, more people working than ever before. He set all kinds of records which should do two things: (1) Validate, even for the most skeptical observer, that this was nothing less than remarkable, and (2) Hand over to the incoming president ... the greatest job market in history. What Mr. Trump does with it will soon be clear to see against such a stark background."

      "text": "Checks & Imbalances: How Joe Biden Has Become $2 Million Richer While In Office\n\nBy Zach Everson\n\nBy Zach Everson ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nToday we continue digging into the personal finances of the 2024 presidential candidates.\n\nPresident Biden is worth an estimated $10 million, up from $8 million when he took office. The increase has nothing to do with family business dealings in far-flung countries. Instead, he is getting richer by doing what a lot of 80-year-old Americans are doing: sitting on real estate. The president owns two homes in Delaware that are worth an estimated $7 million combined, $1.8 million more than they were when he took office.\n\nFor decades, the Kennedy clan has been one of America's most powerful-and most prosperous, reports Chase Peterson-Withorn. Joe Kennedy, father to President JFK, Attorney General RFK and Senator Ted, got rich speculating on stocks and investing in real estate, seeding a family fortune that Forbes last estimated to be $1.2 billion in 2015. RFK Jr., one of Joe's 29 grandchildren, is the fourth descendant to run for president -and the first to do so without the backing of the broader family. He's not putting any of his own money into his campaign, either. Asking strangers for donations on social media may not seem very Camelot, but it makes sense once you realize that RFK Jr. has inherited a lot more Kennedy cachet than actual Kennedy cash.\n\nAs a Miami City commissioner 12 years ago, Francis Suarez was worth negative $99,000, reports Kavya Gupta. A dozen years later, he sits atop an estimated $6 million fortune. How could anyone make that much money on a meager city salary? Simple: By working private-sector jobs while serving in office .\n\nFor at least 12 years, Suarez has bolstered his government pay with earnings from outside firms. As his political stature has increased, his earning power has, too. Since 2017, Suarez has received $130,600 of annual compensation as Miami's mayor, but he appears to have hauled in millions more serving as an attorney at one of the nation's top law firms, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, and also acting as a senior operating partner at a Miami private equity shop named DaGrosa Capital Partners.\n\nHunter Biden claimed federal prosecutors walked back a plea deal on tax and gun charges last week, his lawyers said in a new court filing on Sunday-as Hunter Biden's legal woes head toward a potential trial and continue to muddy his father's re-election campaign , reports Sara Dorn.\n\nThe amount Trevian Kutti donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2007 and 2008.

The asset, listed on Trump's disclosure as \"cryptocurrency wallet (Ethereum),\" appears to be connected to a collection of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, that he marketed after leaving the White House.\n\nThe CEO of Axos Financial, which replaced Deutsche Bank as Donald Trump's lender of choice after the former president left the White House, offloaded $10.7 million worth of stock in his own firm last week, according to securities filings.\n\nAxos' Gregory Garrabrants ditched 236,000 shares at prices ranging from $45.15 to $45.60 between Aug. 1 and Aug. 4.

      "text": "Biden Has Brought More People Into Government From His Nonprofits Than Trump Did From His Business\n\nBy Michela Tindera\n\nand Eric Fan\n\nBy Michela Tindera ,\n\nFormer Staff\n\nand Eric Fan ,\n\nContributor.\n\nThis story is a collaboration between Forbes and the Brown Institute for Media Innovation .\n\nD onald Trump got a lot of grief for giving his private-sector colleagues government positions. A former bodyguard turned into the director of Oval Office operations. A real estate lawyer became a Middle East diplomat. A onetime assistant took a role in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And, of course, Ivanka Trump took the title of advisor to the president.\n\nBut Joe Biden has brought even more of his colleagues into government than Trump did. While the 45 th president hired five of his former colleagues, by our count, the 46 th has welcomed in at least 27 of his. The new appointees previously worked with four Biden nonprofit organizations launched after his time as vice president-the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nUnlike the Trump hires, Biden's appointees all arrived with significant government and policy experience. \"My big objection with the Trump administration was not really that he hired people from the Trump Organization,\" says Walter Shaub, a former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. \"But more had to do with the qualifications of some of them. Whether they actually had experience relevant to what they came into government to do.\"\n\nMany of Biden's appointees are longtime aides who worked with the president when he previously held office. In general, their career paths look something like the one followed by longstanding advisor Antony Blinken. In the Obama administration, Blinken served as deputy secretary of state. During the Trump years, he cofounded consulting firm WestExec Advisors and became a managing director of the Penn Biden Center. Once Biden was back in office, Blinken took over as secretary of state.\n\nA few of the officials worked at multiple Biden organizations. Brian McKeon, for instance, served in various national security roles under Barack Obama before becoming both a senior director for the Penn Biden Center and a consultant for the Biden Foundation. When Biden became president, McKeon took a job alongside Blinken, serving as a deputy secretary of state. \"They're not at the state department because they were at Penn Biden,\" a department spokesperson said when asked about five appointees, including Blinken and McKeon. \"They are here at the state department precisely because they are some of the most experienced, knowledgeable, seasoned foreign policy hands of this generation, many of whom have worked with now-President Biden over the course of years or decades.\"\n\nWhile the appointees who came from the Trump Organization were criticized for their lack of government experience, ethics experts have different qualms with some of Biden's appointees. \"That's not uncommon for presidents to want somebody close to them that they trust,\" says Shaub. \"I think the bigger concern becomes when that makes you overlook these other kinds of connections these folks have, like Blinken's connection to WestExec.\"\n\nWestExec Advisors specializes in counseling clients using \"geopolitical and policy expertise,\" and has been criticized by Shaub and others as \"basically shadow lobbyists.\" WextExec, which has worked with firms including Blackstone, Facebook, Softbank and Uber, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmber Macdonald, now a senior presidential speechwriter, received compensation from both the Biden Foundation and the Biden Cancer Initiative through a firm she owns. In addition, she disclosed more than $5,000 of income from Giacoppa, one of two S-corporations Joe and Jill Biden used to manage book earnings and speaking fees.\n\nStill, nearly all of their paths to working with Biden's nonprofits followed time in the public sector, as the Biden administration is quick to point out. \"All of these White House staffers have years, if not decades, of experience-both within and outside of government-and are extensively qualified to be doing the work they are doing every day on behalf of the American people,\" said a White House spokesperson in an email, also noting that some of the appointees served at Biden's nonprofits on a voluntary basis, without pay. \"They bring leadership, competence and heart to their jobs every single day.\"\n\nThe pipeline between Biden's organizations and the White House is consistent with a long Washington tradition. Presidents of both parties often hire people they know, who have worked with them in previous settings. \"It's pretty typical for presidents and senior executives in government to look pretty thoroughly at their own networks in terms of filling positions that they have,\" says Max Stier, CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that helps federal agencies with hiring. \"If you also looked at other presidents, they tend to have a network that they continue to go to-like Clinton has a network of people that continues to recycle through different positions in different places.\"\n\nSo despite all the flak he received, Trump was actually following a familiar model. The main difference was that the people he knew, from decades in the real estate business, didn't have much government experience. But that shouldn't have come as much of a surprise. After all, he didn't either.\n\nMethodology: Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation and MuckRock obtained financial disclosures of 961 political appointees and nominees in the Biden administration from the Office of Government Ethics, the White House and federal agencies. Using data extracted from these disclosures, along with official biographies and press releases, the Brown Institute and Forbes identified at least 27 senior political appointees who had worked for one of four Biden nonprofit organizations - the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania."

Mark Takano , D-Calif., on Saturday argued Biden should \"pass the torch\" to Vice President Kamala Harris and suggested Harris could \"seamlessly transition into the role of our party's standard bearer.\"\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown , D-Ohio, whose third re-election bid in November is considered crucial to Democrats' efforts to hold onto a Senate majority, called on Biden to step down on Friday.\n\nBrown joins two other Democrats who spoke out about Biden as they run for re-election this year: Sen. Martin Heinrich , D-N.M., and Sen. Jon Tester , D-Mont., who is one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats (the first senator to call on Biden to stand down was Sen. Peter Welch , D-Vt.).\n\nEleven House Democrats called on Biden to step down Friday: Reps. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M. , Jared Huffman , D-Calif., Marc Veasey , D-Texas, Chuy Garcia , D-Ill., and Mark Pocan , D-Wisc., in a joint statement; Rep. Sean Casten , D-Ill.; Rep.

Betty McCollum , D-Minn., who explicitly called for Harris to replace Biden and choose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nRep. Jim Costa , D-Calif., called on Biden to drop out on Thursday, and on Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff , D-Calif., became the most high-profile House member to publicly call on Biden to drop out, telling the Los Angeles Times he has \" serious concerns \" Biden can't beat former President Donald Trump.\n\nReps. Brittany Pettersen , D-Colo., and Mike Levin , D-Calif., both publicly called on Biden to drop his bid on July 12, with both praising Biden's years of public service but saying it was time for Biden to stand down.\n\nReps. Jim Himes , D-Conn., Scott Peters , D-Calif., and Eric Sorensen , D-Ill., pushed Biden to end his campaign on July 11, issuing statements right after Biden ended a high-stakes press conference wrapping up a NATO summit, that was widely viewed as a key opportunity to stop the Democratic defections.\n\nA litany of other House Democrats have publicly urged Biden to stand down: Reps. Greg Stanton , D-Ariz., Adam Smith , D-Wash., Ed Case , D-Hawaii, Brad Schneider , D-Ill., Hillary Scholten , D-Mich., Earl Blumenauer , D-Ore., Pat Ryan , D-N.Y., Marie Gluesenkamp Perez , D-Wash., and Mikie Sherrill , D-N.J.\n\nReps. Angie Craig , D-Minn., Mike Quigley , D-Ill., Seth Moulton , D-Mass., and Raúl Grijalva , D-Ariz., have also called on Biden to stand down.\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett , D-Texas, was the first sitting Democratic lawmaker to push for Biden to step aside after the debate, explaining he \"had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum,\" but Biden instead \"failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump's many lies.\"\n\nThe Local 3000 chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers urged Biden to step down Friday, citing the \"immediate risk\" a second Trump presidency would pose for workers, The New York Times reported , noting the UFCW 3000 appears to be the first major union to stray from Biden, though it backed the campaign for Democrats to vote \"uncommitted\" in primaries in protest of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSeveral A-list celebrities have stepped up to criticize the president for staying in the race, including Biden fundraiser George Clooney , who penned an op-ed in the New York Times imploring Biden to \"save democracy\" and step away from the race. Other Hollywood figures include actor Rob Reiner , author Stephen King and heiress Abigail Disney .\n\nBillionaire Mark Pincus -who has reportedly donated more than $1 million to support Biden and the Democrats since December-is the latest well-heeled Biden supporter to urge Biden to step aside, including billionaires Christy Walton , Michael Novogratz and Reed Hastings . Mark Cuban has said Democrats should assess whether another person can step in as the nominee.\n\nMSNBC's Joe Scarborough (whose show Biden follows closely) gently suggested the morning after the debate the president should bow out of the race-though Biden later appeared on the show for a defiant phone interview. Meanwhile, The New York Times ' Editorial Board pushed Biden to leave the race the day after the debate, followed by similar calls from the editorial boards of The Chicago Tribune , The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Boston Globe . A litany of left-of-center Times opinion writers have urged Biden to step aside in recent weeks, including Biden's self-described friend Thomas Friedman , Nicholas Kristof , Ezra Klein and Paul Krugman (who called Biden \"the best president of my adult life\"). Other calls to drop out came from New Yorker editor David Remnick (who said remaining in the race \"would be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment\"), Washington Post columnist David Ignatius and Atlantic staff writer Mark Leibovich .\n\nFormer Obama advisor and CNN analyst David Axelrod called Biden's insistence on staying in the race a \"defiant delusion,\" after more gently wondering if Biden should run for reelection late last year. A group of Obama aides who host the popular podcast Pod Save America-helmed by Jon Favreau and Jon Lovett , among others-have questioned whether Biden should stay in the race (reigniting tensions between the Biden and Obama camps ). Longtime Democratic consultant James Carville says Biden \"shouldn't be\" the nominee, he told Politico. And Chandler West , a Biden-era former White House deputy director of photography, wrote on Instagram \"it's time for Joe to go,\" Axios reported , adding White House operatives have said privately for months that Biden is \"not as strong as he was just a couple of years ago.\"\n\nJulian Castro , the Obama-era secretary of housing and urban development and early 2020 Democratic primary candidate, argued Biden should \"absolutely\" take himself out of the race. Former Rep. Tim Ryan , D-Ohio, another former Biden 2020 opponent, said he believes Harris is the party's \"best path forward\" in a Newsweek op-ed . And 2020 hopeful Andrew Yang wrote in his blog Biden is \"running an unwinnable race\" and \"doing wrong by the country\" for continuing his candidacy.\n\nWhat congressional Democratic leadership will do. The party's top leaders in Congress, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have remained publicly supportive of Biden, but are reportedly working behind the scenes to push him to drop his re-election bid, multiple outlets reported this week.\n\nBiden has rebuffed the calls to step aside in the race, telling congressional Democrats in a letter earlier this month \"it's time for [discussions about his debate performance] to end.\" Biden has blamed his poor debate performance on a cold, his travel schedule and Trump's \"lies,\" and has repeatedly insisted simply had one \"bad night,\" but is fit to continue serving. Biden in recent days, however, has become receptive to the idea that he might need to bow out of the race, multiple outlets reported, with unnamed top Democrats reportedly telling Axios they expect Biden to drop out as soon as this weekend. Biden disputed those rumors Friday in a statement, announcing he would be back on the campaign trail next week after isolating in Delaware following his Wednesday COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nOther Democrats have questioned Biden's abilities without explicitly saying he should drop out. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., suggested in a July 8 letter to Biden made public Thursday by The New York Times that Biden should re-consider his bid, comparing him to a tired baseball pitcher, but stopped short of telling Biden to drop out. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., predicted earlier this month on CNN Donald Trump \"is on track . . . to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide,\" adding that \"the White House, in the time since that disastrous debate . . . has done nothing to really demonstrate they have a plan to win this election.\" Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., tweeted last week \"the narrative that the President simply had one bad debate performance reflects a continuing pattern of denial and self-delusion.\n\nCalls for Biden to drop out of the race began in the wake of his rocky debate performance against Trump last month, as he spoke softly, gave disjointed answers and often stood with a blank stare on his face and his mouth agape while Trump was speaking. The calls have grown louder over the past three weeks as his efforts to undo the damage from his debate performance are widely viewed to have fallen short-and have featured additional gaffes during high-profile public appearances, including misnaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\" and Vice President Kamala Harris as \" Vice President Trump .\"\n\nCan Democrats Replace Biden?

      "text": "George Washington Would Have Given Joe Biden's Speech\n\nBy Eli Amdur\n\nBy Eli Amdur ,\n\nContributor.\n\nA businessman passing a torch to a businesswoman.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love this country more,\" President Joseph R. Biden said to the nation last night (Wednesday) in his simple, well-crafted, elegant, stylish 12-minute talk.\n\nWith those words - and the patriotic sentiment they conveyed - President Biden placed himself in the company of the following predecessors of his: George Washington.\n\nThat's it.\n\nAnd then he proceeded to tell us directly why he was not pursuing a second term in office, with the same vision George Washington didn't. They both felt the country's best interests were served by someone else taking charge. Anyone who's ever held a position of power knows how difficult it is to cede power. It's a given.\n\nTrue, Washington served two terms, but there were no term limits then, and our first president, loved and admired by all, could have had a third term - and more - for the asking. The Colonies asked him - more than once - to assume the position of king, which he categorically refused. We rebelled against one, he reminded us.\n\nSo Washington refused to run again and when his second term expired, he demonstrated clearly that he meant it. At the inauguration of President John Adams on March 4, 1797, the platform for the dignitaries awaited the processional, and about-to-become former president Washington was shown to his seat. But he wouldn't take it because it was front and center. Said he, \"No, no. That is President Adams' seat now. I shall sit behind him.\" Like the 46 th president, our first one revered the office but loved his country more.\n\nYes, circumstances were different, but make no mistake. Each of them gave up power in the best interests of the country.\n\nBoth presidents had full awareness of the gravitas of the moment and both decided that the limitless future of this great land lay in someone else's hands. Washington knew who it was to be. Biden knew who he wanted it to be.\n\nBiden told us we're at an inflection point, \"...one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.\" Washington knew, in a more generic way, that absolutely everything he did would set precedent.\n\nThe big difference between the two, though, is this. In Washington's day, America's world was one almost entirely of promise. Today, despite all the promise we see, we live in a world of threat. The issue, as President Bident apparently sees it, is how we deal with it.\n\nAnd so, he was careful to remind us that, upon hearing the announcement of the formation of the United States of America, a citizen of the new nation approached Benjamin Franklin and asked what kind of government we have, a republic or a monarchy.\n\n\"A republic,\" answered Franklin, \"if you can keep it.\"\n\nWith that, President Joseph Biden made the personal sacrifice of passing the torch, just as President George Washington did 227 years earlier."

      "text": "Here's How Much Joe Biden Is Worth In 2023\n\nBy Zach Everson\n\nP resident Biden is worth an estimated $10 million, up from $8 million when he took office . The increase has nothing to do with family business dealings in far-flung countries. Instead, he is getting richer by doing what a lot of 80-year-old Americans are doing: sitting on real estate. The president owns two homes in Delaware that are worth an estimated $7 million combined, $1.8 million more than they were when he took office.\n\nHis most valuable property is a 4,800-square-foot summer home in Rehoboth Beach, worth an estimated $4.5 million. Biden bought it in 2017, the year he left the vice presidency and earned $11.1 million, cashing in on speeches and books. He added a pool, which may have cost as much as $75,000, in November of that year. All of this seemed like a splurge at the time, but it proved to be a wise investment. During the pandemic, homebuyers flocked to bigger properties with outdoor amenities like Biden's, seven minutes from the ocean and next to a state park loaded with biking trails. The home is now worth an estimated $4.5 million, $1.7 million more than it originally cost.\n\nThe president owns an even larger, though not-quite-as-valuable house in Wilmington's picturesque Greenville neighborhood. It started as just a piece of land, which Biden bought for $350,000 in 1996, before adding a 6,850-square-foot, colonial-style home two years later, then a 1,900-square-foot cottage in 2005. For years it was Biden's most-valuable asset, and he refinanced it repeatedly until receiving his 2017 windfall. Today the property is worth an estimated $2.5 million, $700,000 more than it was worth two years ago. Combined, Biden's two homes make up about two-thirds of his personal fortune.\n\nMiddle-class Joe, whose spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment, has long had an appreciation for some of the finer things in life. His father, Joe Sr., had a series of fledgling businesses, before finding his niche as a car dealer. When Joe Jr. got married to his first wife in 1967, his father gave him a 1967 Corvette Stingray , paying $5,600 at the time ($51,000 in today's dollars). Decent investment. The car remains in the president's garage and is worth an estimated $100,000 today.\n\nBiden's love of nice real estate goes back just as far. When he was in his mid-twenties, Biden purchased three houses and 85 acres in Maryland, hoping to one day turn it into a family compound. In the short term, he tried to make money from it, renting out the homes. Meanwhile, he and his family lived rent-free in a cottage nearby, in exchange for managing a local pool. Money was tight, he later explained in his memoir: \"I was in constant danger of falling behind.\"\n\nNonetheless, he bought an even bigger house in 1975, a 10,000-square-foot mansion that once belonged to a storied Delaware family, the DuPonts. With a courtyard, pool house, circular drive and colonnade, the home was spectacular, so much so that misinformation warriors, including former first son Eric Trump , used it to accuse Biden of corruption in the 2020 presidential race (long after Biden had sold the property). The truth of how he acquired it was more mundane: Biden took on a lot of debt. Earning around $43,000 as a U.S. senator at the time, he borrowed $160,000 to purchase the place for $185,000.\n\nHe held onto the home, and thanks to rising property values, even turned it into something of a piggy bank. When he needed cash, he refinanced the property, taking out more and more debt as the years went on. \"How did all the mainstream middle-class people get their wealth?\" Biden asked a group of mayors earlier this year, decades after he bought the DuPont mansion. \"Ninety percent of them through investing in their homes.\"\n\nThat was certainly true in his case. In 1996, he sold the mansion for $1.2 million, then plunked down $350,000 for a piece of land nearby, where he had plans to build a new home on a pond. Biden constructed two houses on the property, turning it into the Wilmington estate he owns today. He proceeded to treat it like a piggy bank, too, repeatedly refinancing over the years. After he became vice president, the Secret Service started renting the cottage , reportedly paying him $26,400 annually.\n\nOne year, his sons Beau and Hunter paid to rebuild the engine of his Corvette. But money was still a problem for the family, especially when Beau got sick with cancer, which ultimately killed him in 2015. Joe Biden contemplated selling his Wilmington home to help out with the medical bills. Barack Obama told him that if he needed extra money, he would be happy to personally cover the expenses.\n\nCash came pouring in after Biden left the White House. The former vice president earned $11.1 million in 2017, $4.6 million in 2018, $1 million in 2019 and $630,000 in 2020, the year he was elected commander in chief. Between his time as vice president and president, his net worth shot up from an estimated $2.5 million to $8 million.\n\nNow he's even richer, thanks to his real estate holdings, which have helped his net worth outpace inflation. Never much of a stock investor, Biden has plenty of cash on hand. Today, he and first lady Jill Biden have less than $310,000 invested in the market, all held in mutual funds. Much more is simply sitting in bank accounts. The president collects $400,000 a year in salary , plus about $250,000 in pension payouts.\n\nShould he want any extra liquidity down the road, Biden can always borrow against his holdings. At the end of last year, the president took out a home-equity line of credit against the Rehoboth property, allowing him to draw as much as $250,000. One asset that's off limits, though, is the Corvette. \"They tell me it's worth a lot of money,\" Biden said at a White House bill signing last year. \"But I know if I ever sell it, Beau will come down from heaven and smite me down.\""

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSince the election of Donald Trump as the 47th president on Nov. 5, the slow-building fury among Democrats against President Joe Biden has reached a fever pitch. Some have even compared him to Paul von Hindenburg, the elderly German caretaker president who agreed to elevate Adolph Hitler to power in 1933. And while he should never have made the destructive decision to run for a second term, Biden is no Hindenburg. He was a capable president who pushed major reforms through one of the most closely divided congresses in American history, and if our democratic institutions hold through 2028, his achievements will be better appreciated with time and perspective.\n\nIt seems forgotten that in the weeks after Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election, it was not clear that Democrats would hold a Senate majority at all. Pessimism about Biden's ability to govern set in quickly, and even after Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff improbably swept the double-barrel Georgia run-offs to give Democrats a 50-50 Senate \"majority\" it was not clear how much Biden would be able to get done. And I think if you had told Democrats in, say, December 2020 what Biden would be able to get through Congress , they would have been shocked-in a good way.\n\nOne roadblock, named Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), was known well in advance, but Biden quickly realized he had another \"maverick\" thorn in his side in the form of then-Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema spiked popular ideas like a hike in the minimum wage, and Manchin held up Biden's signature Build Back Better initiative for what seemed like ages and ultimately stripped a lot of crowd-pleasers out of it, including paid family and medical leave . Manchin was also directly responsible for letting the pandemic-era Child Tax Credit (CTC) expire. And while Biden never used the bully pulpit to push for it, Manchin and Sinema were the chief obstacles to any kind of filibuster carve-out for voting rights or codifying Roe after the Dobbs disaster.\n\nIn spite of all that, and even with an incredibly thin Democratic majority in the House, Biden did accomplish a lot. While Trump did nothing about infrastructure other than tweet about it, Biden signed a major bill in November 2021 that invested a trillion dollars in repairing and renewing the country's transportation infrastructure. The Inflation Reduction Act set the United States on a new green industrial trajectory that even Trump and his minions will have trouble reversing. The CHIPs and Science Act was a landmark, bipartisan effort to reshore critical manufacturing industries whose supply chain vulnerabilities had been badly exposed by the pandemic. And while it has come under significant fire because of the 2021-2022 inflation crisis, the 2021 American Rescue Plan likely helped put the United States back on track for the fastest and most robust economic recovery in the G8.\n\nBiden signed other bills that will grow in the public's esteem with time. The bipartisan 2022 reform of the Electoral Count Act was a deeply underappreciated effort to reinforce America's democratic guardrails after Trump's post-election coup attempt in 2020. That bill effectively cut the GOP's conspiracy to steal the 2024 election-which turned out not to be necessary anyway!-off at the knees. He also worked with Congress to craft a backstop to the Obergefell same-sex marriage ruling in case America's rogue Supreme Court goes after LGBTQ rights next.\n\nMAGA Republicans love their empty rhetoric about ending the \"forever wars,\" but Biden went through with it when he decisively ended America's 20-year misadventure in Afghanistan in August 2021. All people seem to remember is the messiness of the exit process , but critics on the left and right had been demanding this exact thing for years. Biden's decision to back the beleaguered Ukrainians against an unprovoked Russian onslaught preserved-at least for now-the sovereignty of an ally on the front lines again Russian President Vladimir Putin 's campaign of irredentist violence while expanding and reinforcing NATO .\n\nUnfortunately, his steadfast belief that a commitment to institutions and normalcy in the Oval Office could break the Republican Party 's MAGA fever turned out to be deeply deluded, and he failed in his central mission to turn the page on the Trump era. But Biden's basic human decency was another thing that will be much more widely appreciated as the 47th president brings his relentless circus of daily outrages, provocations and schoolyard taunts back into our lives. It was nice, for example, not to have to wake up every day and wonder if the president was about to make dick jokes at the expense of the unstable, reclusive leader of an authoritarian country with nuclear weapons aimed at our cities.\n\nDid Joe Biden have his flaws? You'll get no argument here from me and I have not been shy about pointing them out. From his refusal to extend that basic human decency to the Palestinian people to the failure to move more quickly to hold Trump accountable for his effort to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, his mistakes were not just inexplicable but highly consequential. Even his decision to choose the politically flawed Kamala Harris as his running mate and then turn the nomination over to her in July 2024 without any internal Democratic Party process will be rightly second-guessed for many years.\n\nSo yes, Biden shares some blame for the disastrous outcome of the 2024 election, but it is important for Democrats to rationally assess his presidency rather than tossing it wholesale onto the funeral pyre. To paraphrase Michael Moriarty at the end of the 1973 baseball classic Bang the Drum Slowly , Biden wasn't a bad president-no worse than most, and probably better than some.

These included details of a letter sent in 1994 to then-Senator Joe Biden , which described him as a \"traitor\" and was signed \"John F. Kennedy Jr.\"\n\nAn investigation conducted at the time found no evidence the deceased president's son sent the letter, and the document was already in the public domain due to a prior freedom of information request.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Biden via email for comment on Wednesday outside of regular office hours.\n\nPresident Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, in Dallas is one of the most well-known events in modern American history. The subsequent Warren Commission concluded the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone, though various theories alleging a wider conspiracy have remained popular with the American public.\n\nAfter it resurfaced thanks to Tuesday's document release, the letter was shared on X (formerly Twitter ) by Biden critics, including Russell Brand and Newsmax host David J. Harris Jr., where it went viral, racking up millions of views.\n\nThe records released on Tuesday included a Federal Bureau of Investigation report on a handwritten letter dated 8/26/1994, which was sent to then-Senator Biden. The letter began \"Dear Sen. Biden: You are a traitor...\" and was signed by John F. Kennedy Jr., the late president's son who died in a 1999 plane crash.\n\nComedian turned Christian commentator Russell Brand shared the letter on X, writing: \"WAIT!! Did JFK Jr. warn us that Joe Biden was a traitor to America before he was killed!?\" The post was widely shared, receiving over 65,000 likes and 2.9 million views.\n\nDavid J. Harris Jr., a host on conservative-leaning network Newsmax, also shared the letter on X, writing: \"NEW: JFK. Jr. called Joe Biden a 'traitor' in 1994. Joe was a senator then, decades before Joe Biden became President and compromised U.S. national security by assisting family members that sold foreign influence.\"\n\nBiden has consistently denied Republican claims that, as vice president, he used his office to support the business interests of his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe letter was also posted on X by \"The Redheaded libertarian,\" an account with over 860,000 followers that wrote, \"In 1994, JFK Jr issued this message to Senator Joe Biden.\"\n\nDespite what several influencers said, the alleged letter to Biden was already in the public domain.

Kennedy Jr.,\" there is no indication he was the actual author. The FBI did investigate the letter, but the case closed in December 1994 with the agency noting that \"although latent fingerprints were developed by the laboratory, there are no suspects at this time wherein latent comparisons can be made.\"\n\nThe FBI described the author as \"anonymous\" in its documentation, indicating that it did not believe Kennedy Jr. was the real author.\n\nThe files released this week didn't contain any major bombshells challenging the official account of President Kennedy's murder, though conspiracy theories will doubtless remain.\n\nIn February, Attorney General Pam Bondi released some files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, though they contained little new information, sparking a backlash from some conservatives on social media.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Joe Biden took a shot at Republican-led states in the final television interview of his presidency, saying they had \"screwed up\" their economies in recent years.\n\n\"We've invested more in red states than blue states... Red states really screwed up in terms of the way they handled their economy, and the way they handled manufacturing, and the way they handled access to supply chains,\" Biden, a Democrat, told MSNBC 's Lawrence O'Donnell when asked about his administration's economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe White House and the Trump transition team have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nBiden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan less than two months after taking office in 2021 to help the United States recover from the pandemic after the legislation was passed by Congress along party lines. It came after President-elect Donald Trump 's first administration approved more than $3 trillion in pandemic relief spending in 2020.\n\nRepublicans later blamed a surge in inflation on spending from the American Rescue Plan, citing economist Larry Summers' warning that it would cause more inflation.\n\nInflation and the economy were top concerns in the 2024 election , helping to fuel Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris .\n\nAsked how he decided to forge ahead with the spending despite warnings from Summers and others, Biden said: \"I looked at the practical need for us to instill some confidence in the American people. We can grow this economy. And one of the biggest pieces of that was to invest in America.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"absolutely convinced\" that if the American people were given \"half a shot,\" they would \"step up and get the job done.\"\n\n\"Look what they did. They stepped up in every major endeavor. I never believed we couldn't have a soft landing... inflation is down almost to 2 percent .\"\n\nBiden also acknowledged that he and his fellow Democrats had missed some opportunities to tout their accomplishments.\n\nAsked by O'Donnell if he had considered signing the stimulus checks sent under the American Rescue Plan, as Trump had done with the checks sent during his administration, Biden said: \"It did cross my mind... The mistake we made was, I think I made, was not getting our allies to acknowledge that the Democrats did this.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm not a very good huckster... that wasn't a stupid thing for [Trump] to do. It helped him a lot. And it undermined our ability to convince people that we were the ones that were getting this to them.\n\n\"Ironically, I almost spent too much time on the policy and not enough time on the politics, because, I mean, you have some senators in Congress, Democratic senators in Congress saying, 'Well, you know, Joe Biden did this'... Let people know who was responsible for this happening. But it just seems, I know it sounds so stupid to say it, almost bad taste.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X on Wednesday that Biden's legacy would \"be defined by his many failures\", including \"FUELING skyrocketing inflation through 'Bidenomics.'\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC last week that stimulus spending \"may have contributed a little bit to the inflation, but by and large, inflation was a supply-side phenomenon.\"\n\nBiden leaves office on Monday when Trump will be sworn in for a second term.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is using analysis from The Heritage Foundation to accuse Joe Biden of not physically signing several documents, including key pardons.\n\nThe Oversight Project, a branch of The Heritage Foundation-the think tank that wrote Project 2025-claims that the Biden White House used an automated signature to place Biden's name on several key documents that happen to counter Trump's agenda.\n\nAccording to the New York Post , this is corroborated by an anonymous Biden staffer who it claims took unilateral decisions on what the president was signing by affixing an auto-signature. However, per the newspaper's reporting: \"The Post is not publishing that staffer's name due to the lack of concrete evidence and refutations by other colleagues.\"\n\nThe signatures picked by The Heritage Foundation are from the National Archives. The National Archives do not display original copies of documents, but digitized versions.\n\nThese copies use a computer-generated signature for where the president signed the document, meaning that online copies of Biden's signature appear to be auto-signed, but they're not the original version.\n\nThere is photographic proof of Biden signing an executive order that The Heritage Foundation claimed was signed by autopen, several other photos which display Biden signing documents with a signature that matches his autopen signature and video footage of Biden discussing the executive orders he had signed, which counter the Trump Administration's claims that Biden was not mentally or physically present to sign executive orders.\n\nThis is the same for documents from the Trump administration that are on the National Archives site.\n\nDonald Trump is using the allegations of an autopen signature to attempt to void the pardons offered by Biden to political opponents of Trump and MAGA.\n\nEven if Biden did use an autopen, the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2005 stated: \"The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law,\" so Trump's argument is not legally valid.\n\nThe autopen allegations are also part of MAGA's larger conspiracy that claims the Biden White House was covering up for his alleged cognitive decline while in office.\n\nAutopen is an automated signature. Signature devices that do not require the signer to be physically signing the document to which their name is affixed have been around since Thomas Jefferson's time.\n\nThey are typically a robotic arm which can mimic a person's signature.\n\nIn 2025, autopens can be also be used online by signing sites such as Docusign to make it easier to sign a legal document without having to put physical pen to physical paper.\n\nSomething that is signed via autopen is no less legally binding than something that is signed physically.\n\nAccording to analysis from The Daily Mail, 25 of Trump's signatures on bills posted to the Federal Register's website from both presidential terms had the same signature.\n\nThese bills may have his auto-signature on them for the same reason as Biden, because the Federal Register is published by the National Archives, who affix autopen signatures to bills.\n\nBiden offered 11th-hour preemptive pardons to the January 6 Committee and Dr. Anthony Fauci, as well as to his own son Hunter Biden , General Mark Milley and Jerry Lundergan on January 19, before Trump took office. He said the pardons for Milley, Fauci and the January 6 Committee were there to protect them from future political retribution that Trump may take against them.\n\nNow it appears that Trump is attempting political retribution by claiming that the pardons are not real.\n\nEven though an automated signature is legally binding, per the DOJ precedent, a CNN article from 2024 displayed how much effort the Biden administration put into making sure the then-president signed bills in person, including flying bills to South Korea and St Croix.\n\nThe same article noted that Biden did use an autopen in his presidency to sign a Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) funding bill to ensure that the FAA received the $105 billion authorized to it from a bipartisan Senate bill.\n\nThe first president to experiment with an automated signature was Jefferson, who used a polygraph device to write letters simultaneously. The first president to use an automated pen for government work was Harry Truman, and the first to use an autopen for legislation was Barack Obama , who used it once.\n\nJeff Clark, leader of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, said on X : \"There is a political group that does not believe in signature verification for mail-in election ballots. Unsurprisingly, that same group is fine with one or more aides of Biden controlling an autopen of Biden's signature, despite Biden clearly having been senile for all or most of his time in office.\"\n\nDonald Trump on Truth Social : \"The \"Pardons\" that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\"\n\nThe National Archives told fact-checking site Snopes : \"At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Office of the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register.\"\n\nWhether Trump will attempt to fully remove the Biden-era pardons through his own executive orders remains to be seen. His Truth Social announcement has no legal standing, as the president cannot make legal declarations over social media.\n\nIf he does attempt to abolish the pardons via an executive order, that decision will likely end up in court.\n\nUpdates 3/17/25, 8:55 a.m. and 3/18/25, 2:12 p.m. ET: This story was updated with additional information.\n\nCorrection 3/18/25, 2:12 p.m. ET: This story previously stated there are several photos of Biden signing executive orders cited by The Heritage Project. There is photographic evidence of one of these orders being signed by Biden and several photos of him signing orders with a signature that matches his purported autopen signature.\n\nSophie Grace Clark is a Live News reporter based in London, with a focus on crime stories.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nJoe Biden is about to leave office with a series of missteps that have tainted his legacy as president, experts told Newsweek .\n\nNewsweek has contacted the White House for comment via email.\n\nBiden entered office in January 2021 with a promise to provide a sharp contrast what some perceived as a chaotic Donald Trump administration. He now risks being remembered more for actions that may have paved the way for Trump's return to the White House rather than for his achievements.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll of 1,003 U.S. adults conducted between December 2 and 18, 2024, and released on January 7, a majority (54 percent) believe Biden will be remembered as a \"below average\" (17 percent) or \"poor\" (37 percent) president.\n\nBiden's presidency has been marked by criticism, including concerns over border security, the state of the economy and his decision to run for reelection in 2024.\n\nBiden and his supporters highlight key accomplishments, such as passing the Inflation Reduction Act and improving the U.S. economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a January 15 post on X , formerly Twitter , former President Barack Obama credited Biden with helping transform a \"reeling\" economy into the world's strongest recovery and passing landmark legislation to rebuild infrastructure and address climate change.\n\nBelow, Newsweek looks at six key errors that experts say risk overshadowing Biden's achievements .\n\nBiden's decision to seek a second term despite concerns about his age and cognitive abilities-not to mention low polling numbers and voter enthusiasm-will likely linger as a painful \"what if?\" for Democrats .\n\nWhen Biden, now 82, eventually announced his decision not to seek reelection, Vice President Kamala Harris was left with just over 100 days to launch her own White House bid.\n\nChristopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, told Newsweek that if Biden had announced his decision not to run in early to mid-2023, he could have been \"heralded for statesmanship and selflessness.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders also criticized the timing , saying Biden's decision hindered the party's chances of retaining the presidency. During Wednesday's episode of the Hacks on Tap podcast, former Obama strategist David Axelrod called Biden seeking reelection a \"terrible mistake,\" adding that he may have been motivated by a belief that serving two terms is essential to be considered a great president.\n\nIn an interview with USA Today earlier this month, Biden said he could have defeated Trump again.\n\nLongstanding concerns about Biden's physical and mental fitness intensified after a poor performance in the June 2024 CNN presidential debate. Biden often trailed off mid-sentence and spoke in a strained, whispered tone, prompting questions about his health.\n\nThe debate was widely regarded as disastrous, with Democratic figures calling for Biden to withdraw from the race and suggestions the president's team failed to be forthright to voters about his health.\n\nCary Coglianese, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told Newsweek that effective communication is crucial to presidential leadership, and that Biden's performance was a \"clear mistake.\"\n\nThe U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 became a defining moment in Biden's presidency. Public opinion took a significant hit after a suicide bombing at Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 others.\n\nBefore the withdrawal, Biden's approval ratings were in the mid-50s. Following the chaotic Afghanistan exit at the end of a 20-year war, his ratings dropped below 50 percent and never recovered.\n\nThe incident became a key talking point for Republicans , with Trump frequently citing it as evidence of weak leadership.\n\nIllegal immigration at the southern border became another contentious issue. On his first day in office, Biden rolled back several of Trump's immigration policies.\n\nWhat followed was a surge in illegal migrant crossing at the U.S-Mexico border, peaking at a record-breaking 249,741 encounters in the month of December 2023.\n\nThe numbers would decline significantly by December 2024, with Customs and Border Protection reporting 47,300 illegal crossings. But the perception lingered... Borick described this lack of attention to border issues as a major misstep early in Biden's presidency .\n\nBiden grew frustrated with Attorney General Merrick Garland over the Justice Department's slow pace in prosecuting Trump's alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, according to The Washington Post .\n\nLeft-wing critics also questioned why Garland waited until November 2022 to appoint Jack Smith as special counsel. Others have said this delay ultimately led to Trump winning the 2024 election.\n\nBoth the federal 2020 case and the investigation into Trump's alleged hoarding of classified materials were dropped by Smith in the wake of the Republican 's 2024 election victory, as the DOJ has a policy of not prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\nSmith said in his report released Tuesday that there was enough evidence to secure a conviction against Trump over his actions in the run up to the January 6 attack if the case went to trial.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all the federal charges against him.\n\nHarris' election defeat was largely attributed to voter dissatisfaction with the economy under Biden's administration, such as decades-high levels of inflation and record-breaking gas prices.\n\nBiden faced criticism for failing to effectively communicate his administration's accomplishments, particularly on issues like inflation. Coglianese said that while Biden's administration characterized rising inflation as \"temporary\" or \"transitory,\" which was perhaps technically correct, voters simply saw prices increase.\n\nChristopher Borick , political science professor, told Newsweek: \"The failure to recognize the saliency of the border situation as a concern among Americans earlier in his administration was an enormous misstep. It gave Republicans a powerful issue to run on in 2024 and border images became emblematic of a weak administration.\n\n\"Not withdrawing from the race earlier was a major mistake that undermined both Biden's legacy and his party's chance to maintain the presidency. If he had stepped aside in early to mid 2023 he would have been heralded for statesmanship and unselfishness and the Democrats may have found a candidate to take on Trump in 2024.\n\n!As with the border, the chaotic withdrawal in Afghanistan provided fuel for the case that the Biden Administration lacked strength. If you look as his approval ratings it was the point where his standing declined and never really recovered.\"\n\nCary Coglianese , political science professor, told Newsweek : \"Communication and messaging are a crucial part of presidential leadership. In this respect, one could certainly point to Biden's debate performance against Trump as a clear mistake. His administration's efforts to characterize inflation as 'temporary' or 'transitory' in 2021 may have been technically correct, in the sense that the rate of inflation has come down from its heights following the pandemic. People just don't perceive inflation 'rates' as much as they do 'prices,' so inflation was never going to be temporary with respect to what people perceive most-how prices today compare with what they were before Biden became president.\"\n\nFormer Obama strategist David Axelrod speaking during an episode of Hacks on Tap podcast : \"Biden so wanted the approbation that I think he felt like to be a great president, you had to be a two-term president, or at least elected to two terms, and that was a terrible, terrible mistake. He will pay a price for that which will be beyond anything that he would have imagined. I hope that the clouds will recede in that he, like others, will be treated better by history than he is by voters right now.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden in a January 5 interview with USA Today: \"I hope that history says that I came in and I had a plan how to restore the economy and reestablish America's leadership in the world. That was my hope. I mean, you know, who knows? And I hope it records that I did it with honesty and integrity, that I said what was on my mind.\"\n\nBiden will leave office on January 20. In a September appearance on The View , Biden said he hopes to continue working on domestic policy matters with the University of Delaware's Biden Institute, and foreign policy matters with the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nJoe Biden has marked his final few weeks in office with several agenda items that will act as hurdles for Donald Trump .\n\nFrom prison reform, to oil and gas drilling and international relations, Biden has signed several executive orders and policies that oppose, and will stall, the incoming Trump administration's agenda.\n\nThe real estate mogul has promised to implement a sweeping agenda when he enters office, including undertaking mass deportations, increasing oil and gas extraction, and expanding the death penalty, as well as removing other laws and policies created during the Biden administration.\n\nLast-minute actions from Biden will make it more difficult for Trump to begin his agenda as quickly as he promised on the campaign trail.\n\nThe White House and the Trump transition team have been contacted via email for comment.\n\nJoe Biden has signed several executive orders and laws during the lame duck period of his presidency that are targeted towards halting the Trump program.\n\nIn late December, in contrast to Trump's promise to \"vigorously pursue\" death penalty cases when in office , Biden granted clemency to 37 prisoners on death row . They will still serve their life prison sentences, but no longer will be sentenced to death by the federal government.\n\nOn January 6, Biden signed an act to protect vast amounts of federal water from oil drilling . His order will protect parts of Alaska, Florida, California and the East Coast. This act was in addition to Biden declaring two parts of California as national monuments so that they can't be used for mining.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump has said these protections were \"a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices. Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nTrump's biggest agenda item is mass deportation, which Biden made more difficult to carry out via extending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) of hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. on January 10. TPS visas were set to expire in April for many thousands of people who are in the US due to upheaval in their home country.\n\nTrump has said he opposes this visa, but it will now be more difficult to remove this specific protected immigration status for people covered under the Biden-instituted 18-month extension.\n\nBiden has removed certain economic penalties on Cuba and took it off a list of state sponsors of terrorism on January 14, a move criticized by Trump's new envoy for Latin America.\n\nHe also provided $500 million in aid for Ukraine in one of his final acts in office, as well as granted permission for Ukrainians to use long range missiles supplied by the US, which stands in contrast to Trump's skepticism of foreign aid.\n\nThe president also implemented new sanctions on Russia under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), meaning they can only be removed by an act of Congress, not solely by the president .\n\nOther agenda items that Biden implemented that oppose Trump's policy ideas are extending the ability for federal employees to work from home until 2029, a move that Trump has said he will go to court to fight against. And, extending student loan forgiveness to more than 5 million Americans.\n\nBiden said in his farewell address : \"You know, it will take time to feel the full impact of all we've done together. But the seeds are planted, and they'll grow and they'll bloom for decades to come.\"\n\nTrump said : \"Fear not, these 'orders' will be terminated shortly.\"\n\nTrump may have to challenge these policies in court, or via opposing policies that will be legislated through the federal government.\n\nRepublicans control the House, Senate and White House, and the Supreme Court currently holds majority Republican-appointed judges, so it is likely that Trump challenges to Biden-era policies will all go his way.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSophie Grace Clark is a Live News reporter based in London, with a focus on crime stories.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is set to deliver a prime-time farewell address on Wednesday night.\n\nBiden's farewell address will be his last big opportunity to reach millions of Americans and speak to the rest of the world about his legacy before he leaves office on January 20.\n\nBiden's Oval Office remarks will be televised Wednesday, January 15, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday that the president would reflect on his \"50-plus years as a public official.\"\n\nBiden served as a U.S. senator from Delaware for 36 years. He had recently turned 30 years old when he took office in 1973, making him one of the youngest people to become a U.S. senator. He served in his seat until 2009 when he became the 47th U.S. vice president. He served under former President Barack Obama for two terms, and he became the 46th U.S. president in 2021 after beating then-President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nBiden was the Democrats ' top pick in the 2024 election, as he was the incumbent, before a dismal debate performance against Trump last summer. Vice President Kamala Harris subsequently became the Democratic presidential nominee and only had a few months to campaign. She lost to Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in November 2024.\n\nIn a recent USA Today interview, Biden was asked if he could have won the 2024 election had he remained in the race.\n\n\"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes, based on the polling,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if he would have had the physical strength to serve another four years, Biden said, \"I don't know.\"\n\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that only about one-quarter of Americans rated Biden as a \"good\" or \"great\" president, with less than 10 percent describing him as \"great.\"\n\nComparatively, about one-third of Americans rated Trump as \"good\" or \"great\" at the end of his term. Obama, by contrast, left office with half the population rating his presidency positively.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday that Biden \"has some thoughts on the future, not just of the country, but how this country moves forward as a leader, when you think about global events, important global issues, and certainly he will lay that out.\"\n\nTrump will be sworn in as president five days after Biden's farewell address.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nRachel Dobkin is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said on Thursday that he had congratulated President-elect Donald Trump on winning Tuesday's election against Vice President Kamala Harris .\n\n\"Yesterday, I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory, and I assured him that I direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That's what the American people deserve,\" Biden said during a speech from the White House Rose Garden.\n\nTrump, the Republican nominee, was declared the winner of the presidency by The Associated Press (AP) early Wednesday morning when he pushed over the required threshold of 270 Electoral College votes.\n\nSo far, Trump has beaten Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina and 23 Republican-leaning states. He also secured four of the five electoral votes in Nebraska and one in Maine, bringing his total to 295 Electoral College votes.\n\nBiden said he also spoke with Harris on Wednesday.\n\nHe praised his vice president's\"great character\" and said, \"Her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran.\"\n\nBiden acknowledged that for some Americans, this is a time of victory and for others, it's a time of loss. But he said, \"We accept the choice the country made.\"\n\n\"I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree. Something I hope we can do, no matter who you voted for, is see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans,\" he said.\n\nBiden promised a \"peaceful transfer of power\" between his administration and Trump's new administration. He told Americans, \"Don't forget all that we accomplished,\" adding that there are still 74 days left of his term-\"Let's make every day count.\"\n\n\"Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. We all get knocked down, but the measure of our character, as my dad would say, is how quickly we get back up,\" Biden added.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign, which referred to a statement they released Wednesday, which read: \"President Joe Biden called President Donald J. Trump to congratulate him on his victory and extended an invitation to the White House to ensure a smooth transition between the current Administration and the incoming Administration. President Trump looks forward to the meeting, which will take place shortly, and very much appreciated the call.\"\n\nThe White House was also reached by Newsweek via email for comment Thursday afternoon.\n\nHarris thanked her supporters, telling them, \"My heart is full today\" as she conceded the race to Trump on Wednesday at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington D.C.\n\nThe vice president said that she spoke with Trump earlier in the day to congratulate him on his win.\n\n\"I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,\" Harris said.\n\nTrump's communications director, Steven Cheung, said in a statement Wednesday that the president-elect acknowledged Harris \"on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.\"\n\nHarris told Americans in her concession speech that \"we must accept the results of this election.\"\n\nThe acceptance of election results and the peaceful transfer of power have been focal points of this election after Trump did not accept the 2020 election results when he lost to Biden. Instead, he tried to overturn the results, culminating in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nOn that day, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. in a failed attempt to stop Conrgess from certifying Biden's election win. The riot erupted following repeated claims from Trump that Biden's election victory was stolen via widespread voter fraud despite there being no evidence of this. Trump has never conceded the 2020 race to Biden nor stood down from his claims of election fraud.\n\nTrump gave a victory speech early Wednesday morning at the Palm Beach Convention Center in Florida, hours before the AP declared him the winner.\n\n\"We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing, look what happened, is this crazy? But it's a political victory that our country has never seen before, nothing like this,\" he said. \"I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president.\"\n\nTrump said his second term would be \"the golden age of America\" and vowed to fight for every American's future.\n\n\"And every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future, every single day I will be fighting for you with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve, he said.\n\nUpdate 11/7/24 12:44 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 11/7/24 1:08 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nRachel Dobkin is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

      "text": "Biden Rushed Out Billions for Green Energy Projects Before Trump Took Office\n\nGovernment Spending\n\nJoe Lancaster | From the April 2025 issue\n\nOn President Joe Biden's way out the door, officials in his administration were busy-not just packing up their offices, but shoveling as much money as possible before incoming President Donald Trump could get his hands on it.\n\nPer the U.S. Department of Energy's website, its Loan Programs Office (LPO) provides \"clean energy and advanced transportation technologies....with access to needed loans and loan guarantees when private lenders cannot or will not.\" As of August 2022, the LPO had loaned out only $32.7 billion, but Biden-era spending bills supercharged the office, increasing its loan authority for infrastructure projects to $400 billion. Of that total, though, $290 billion would expire in September 2026, with another $50 billion expiring in 2028.\n\nBesides, Trump is famously skeptical of green energy projects and would be unlikely to use the cash on projects favored by progressives. So in the roughly two months between Trump's election and inauguration, Biden administration officials worked diligently to approve as many projects-and spend as much taxpayer money-as possible.\n\nIn November 2024, just weeks after the election, the LPO announced \"a direct loan of up to $6.57 billion\" that would allow Rivian, a luxury electric vehicle (E.V.) manufacturer, to finish construction on its new factory in Georgia-even though that state's government previously awarded the company tax credits and incentives worth as much as $1.5 billion. Also in November, the LPO announced a loan guarantee of up to $4.9 billion for the Grain Belt Express Phase 1, a high-capacity network of power lines running from Kansas to Missouri.\n\nIn a single week in December, the LPO announced a $9.63 billion loan for BlueOval SK to build three Ford Motor Co. E.V. and E.V. battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky; a $1.25 billion loan for EVgo to expand its network of public E.V. chargers; a $1.45 billion loan to Qcells, a South Korean manufacturer building a solar panel factory in Georgia; a $7.54 billion loan to a subsidiary of Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) building an E.V. battery factory in Indiana; a $2.5 billion loan guarantee to We Energies in Wisconsin for \"a portfolio of individual projects\"; and a loan guarantee of up to $15 billion to Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), the utility that provides gas and electricity to much of California, to modernize the state's power grid.\n\nThe LPO originally planned on $30 billion for PG&E, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time, but \"the amount was cut in half, in part because of PG&E concerns about the hefty upfront payments such a large loan would have required.\" The Journal also noted that the LPO was racing to close the loan before Trump's inauguration over \"fear [that] Trump officials could curtail loans from the office.\"\n\n\"Under President Biden, the office has announced roughly $54 billion in loans or loan guarantees,\" The New York Times wrote on December 6, 2024. \"Of that, $19 billion was announced in the weeks after the election\"-and several of the loans listed above were announced after the Times ' article went to press.\n\nSpending taxpayer money to boost, prop up, or bail out private businesses is bad enough. But the accelerated timeline also increases the likelihood that some of these deals, perhaps undertaken in haste, will prove poor investments.\n\nThis was already a concern before the election, with the fund's looming expiration in 2026 and beyond. \"The pressure to beat these deadlines introduces the risk that the LPO will enter into loans it otherwise would not....because of insufficient time to conduct rigorous due diligence, to negotiate terms that could effectively mitigate the risks identified during the due diligence, and to consider alternative projects that might offer a more favorable risk profile,\" according to a November 2024 report from the Department of Energy Office of the Inspector General.\n\nRegardless of the efficacy of using public money to issue or guarantee loans to private companies, it's alarming for a presidential administration to spend its final days rushing to approve new spending just so the incoming president can't. It signals an all-too-common attitude in government that taxed money is better spent than returned to the taxpayers who provided it.\n\nThis article originally appeared in print under the headline \"Biden Rushed Billions Out Before Trump Took Office.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Did the Media?\n\nJoe Biden\n\nRobby Soave | 4.3.2025 2:52 PM\n\nTwo reporters have released a book- Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House - that shines a new light on the extent of President Joe Biden's cognitive decline over the course of his reelection campaign. Amie Parnes of The Hill and Jonathan Allen of NBC News gained access to Biden's inner circle, discovering that top officials had grave concerns about Biden's fitness for the presidency; these concerns long predated the public's own awareness of the extent of his decline.\n\nIn fact, Vice President Kamala Harris had discussed plans for what to do in the event of Biden's sudden death-i.e., which judges she would want to swear her in as president. These plans were formulated by Jamal Simmons, a communications director who departed Harris' team in January 2023 . In other words, Harris was thinking through worst-case scenarios as far back as then.\n\nYou are reading Free Media from Robby Soave and Reason . Get more of Robby's on-the-media, disinformation, and free speech coverage.\n\nΔ\n\nBy the time of Biden's disastrous July debate with Donald Trump, the president's cognitive decline was so bad that aides had to help him navigate a home where a fundraiser was being held... by placing fluorescent tape on the floor to guide him from spot to spot. Parnes and Allen confirmed this shocking detail in an interview with me on Rising .\n\nBiden \"went to a small fundraiser. Fluorescent tape on the floor to guide him where needs to go...\"\n\n\"A small place, and it's like, fluorescent tape on the floor, pointing him wear to go. In a house.\"\n\nInsane details from @RisingTheHill 's interview with @amieparnes and... pic.twitter.com/hO8LUY4teN\n\n- Robby Soave (@robbysoave) April 2, 2025\n\nThis fundraiser wasn't held in the Labyrinth of King Minos or something. It was held at the residence of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. He has a big house, to be sure-repairs and renovations to the mansion cost New Jersey taxpayers $862,000 . Nevertheless, the fact that Biden needed flashy visual cues just to survive a friendly fundraising event obviously raised serious and immediate questions about his ability to fulfill the more demanding aspects of his job.\n\nAnd yet, top Biden surrogates maintained that he was totally capable of remaining president, even after he had exited his reelection campaign. Ron Klain, Biden's former chief of staff, asserted in August 2024 that Biden was \"clearly up to the job.\"\n\n\"He's doing it every day,\" said Klain. \"He's doing it successfully.\"\n\nKlain doesn't even have the excuse that he was obligated to say something positive about Biden because he worked for him. He was out of a job at that point.\n\nWell, Klain is finally admitting the truth. He told reporter Chris Whipple, who has also released a tell-all book on the real story of the Biden campaign, that he \"wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US. 'He just became very enraptured with being the head of Nato,' he said.\"\n\nKlain scheduled a practice debate for Biden, which was supposed to run for 90 minutes, but Biden could only make it through 45 minutes, at which point \"the president's voice was shot and so was his grasp of the subject,\" writes Whipple, characterizing Klain's remarks. \"All he really could talk about was his infrastructure plan and how he was rebuilding America and 16 million jobs. He had nothing to say about his agenda for a second term.\"\n\nGiven all that, it's no wonder Biden lost. But it's also remarkable that he didn't actually resign the presidency , despite his obvious impairments. Of course, it seems that no one in his inner circle was willing to speak out about his incapacity until after it was too late.\n\nMedia reporters are certainly having a field day with all this- now. CNN's Jake Tapper has released a book on this subject: Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again . That's in addition to the books by Parnes, Allen, and Whipple. One can't help but wonder, however, why it took so long to get the real story. Maybe journalists weren't properly clued in to Biden's decline until after the debate? That's a bit hard to believe, though: At the very least, Special Counsel Robert Hur's claims some months earlier that Biden appeared to be an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" should have set off alarm bells.\n\nWatch my full interview with Parnes and Allen here.\n\nI am joined by Amber Duke to discuss Trump's deportations, the tariffs, Luigi Mangione and the death penalty, and whether Mark Zuckerberg has truly renounced his ways.\n\nNintendo has announced a live-action Legend of Zelda movie , which is theoretically exciting but could disappoint me in just about a thousand different ways. Here, let me list them.\n\nActually, Nintendo could avoid all of these potential issues by simply green-lighting the draft script I put together like a decade ago.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Biden's Infrastructure Bills Leave a Legacy of Big Spending and Little Payoff\n\nBiden Administration\n\nJoe Lancaster | 1.8.2025 4:35 PM\n\nWhen President Joe Biden vacates the White House later this month, talk will turn to his legacy: What did he accomplish in office? Which among his achievements will outlast him? Even though Biden came into office with ambitious promises, his scorecard looks unimpressive.\n\nThe 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act apportioned more than $1 trillion to a wide variety of projects deemed \"infrastructure,\" including $550 billion toward \"'new' investments and programs.\" Among its line items, the law included $7.5 billion to build electric vehicle (E.V.) chargers across the country.\n\nThe rollout was uninspiring. Under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which controls $5 billion of the $7.5 billion total, only 183 chargers have come online at 44 stations across the country, more than three years after Biden signed the bill into law. (Under federal rules , each station funded by the law is required to have at least four charging ports.)\n\nIn fairness, not all of the cash has been spent: The NEVI has only allocated $2.4 billion and awarded $520 million, as of press time.\n\nStill, it's a dispiriting result from an administration that came into office with big promises to \"build a national network of 500,000 charging stations.\"\n\nSimilarly, the 2021 infrastructure law included the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, with $42 billion to expand broadband internet access across the country. In his speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Biden equated it with the New Deal, calling the broadband expansion \"not unlike what Roosevelt did with electricity.\"\n\nBut three years after its creation, the program has disbursed no money and supplied broadband to zero households. \"Thanks to a federal affordability requirement that telecommunications companies say is too tight, many states have sparred with Washington over their funding applications, delaying the rollout,\" Politico wrote in September .\n\n\"States face a common issue - navigating the complex BEAD process,\" Misty Giles, the director of Montana's Department of Administration, testified before the House Subcommittee on Energy & Technology in September 2024. Giles called the approval process \"akin to building a plane while flying it without having the necessary instructions to be successful.\" She also said the government \"has provided either no guidance, guidance given too late, or guidance changing midstream, all with a lack of appreciation for state operations and costs and the needs of our telecommunication providers,\" creating \"a chaotic implementation environment.\"\n\nBiden's supporters would counter that while the initial rollout was underwhelming, much of this spending is designed to pay off over time: NEVI, for example, is apportioned $1 billion per year through FY 2026 when the program's funding runs out.\n\nWhen Biden exited the presidential race in July after a particularly disastrous debate performance, the Associated Press noted , \"His record includes legislation that will rebuild the country in ways that will likely be seen over the next dozen years, even if voters did not immediately appreciate it.\"\n\nBut it's clear by this point that Biden's big-spending dreams were hamstrung by bureaucracy and red tape, much of which was included in the bills themselves or in administration guidelines.\n\n\"The rules require states accepting the money to make sure providers plan for climate change, reach out to unionized workforces and hire locally,\" Politico wrote about the broadband program. \"One vague but broad provision requires low-cost options and fast connections for 'middle class families' at 'reasonable prices'\"-an unclear description that many states have struggled to implement.\n\nSimilarly, the NEVI program is remarkably complicated , and the equipment necessary to build out that many chargers is in short supply-requiring representatives from every state and territory to compete over a finite amount of resources.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) called NEVI's protracted timeline \"a vast administrative failure.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as federal programs have struggled to meet government E.V. goals, the private sector has excelled. In the three years after Biden signed the infrastructure law, Tesla Motors more than doubled its public charging stations in the U.S., going from 29,281 chargers at 3,254 stations to 62,421 chargers at 6,706 stations. (In fairness, Tesla received more than $17 million in NEVI funds as of early 2024.) Ford Motor Co. announced last year that for any motorists buying new Ford E.V.s, the company would install a charger in their home for free.\n\nWhile unlikely, it's certainly possible that with hindsight, Biden will have plenty to crow about. But when stacking up his list of accomplishments next to what the private sector has achieved in the same amount of time, there's no comparison. Private companies, largely without the benefit of taxpayer funds, outperform government grant programs at every turn.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

(AP Photo/Nathan Howard)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Lawmakers turned a Tuesday hearing on President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents into a proxy battle between the Democratic president and Republican front-runner Donald Trump, as a newly released transcript of Biden's testimony last fall showed that he repeatedly insisted he never meant to retain classified information after he left the vice presidency.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Hur , testifying for more than four hours before the House Judiciary Committee, stood steadfastly by the assessments in his 345-page report that questioned Biden's age and mental competence but recommended no criminal charges for the 81-year-old president, finding insufficient evidence to make a case stand up in court.\n\n\"What I wrote is what I believe the evidence shows, and what I expect jurors would perceive and believe,\" Hur said. \"I did not sanitize my explanation. Nor did I disparage the president unfairly.\"\n\nThe transcript of hours of interviews between Biden and the special counsel released Tuesday provide a more textured picture of the roughly yearlong investigation, filling in some of the gaps left by Hur's and Biden's accounting of the exchanges. But there was no guarantee the hearing or transcript would alter preconceived notions about the president, the special counsel who investigated him, or Trump, particularly in a hard-fought election year.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports the special counsel who handled the Biden classified documents probe appeared on Capitol Hill -- in what became a proxy campaign fight.\n\nWhile Biden was adamant that he treated classified information seriously, the transcript shows that he was at times fuzzy about dates and details and he said he was unfamiliar with the paper trail for some of the sensitive documents he handled.\n\nThe hearing played out just hours before Biden claimed the Democratic nomination and Trump became the GOP standard-bearer . The party lines calcified almost immediately over which leader meant to hang onto classified documents, or rather, who \"willfully\" retained them - and who didn't. And Hur was the rare witness vilified all around, by Republicans angry over his decision not to charge the president, and by Democrats for his unflattering commentary about Biden.\n\nRepublicans argued Biden was being given a pass by his own Justice Department and that Trump had been unfairly victimized by prosecutors. Democrats, for their part, stressed Biden's cooperation in the investigation and strongly contrasted that with the separate criminal case against Trump, who refused to return classified documents requested by the National Archives that he had at his Florida estate.\n\nDemocrats started off their questioning by hitting hard at the contrast between Biden and Trump, focusing more on the latter's criminal case. Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the ranking Democrat, asked whether Biden's willingness to comply with investigators and turn over documents contributed to the decision not to charge him.\n\n\"That was a factor in our analysis,\" Hur said.\n\nMore on the special counsel's report:\n\nBut the Democrats quickly bored into Hur, who was handpicked by Biden's own attorney general, suggesting he was a political partisan doing Republican bidding via his written slights about Biden's age and memory. Hur took issue with the characterization.\n\n\"Politics played no part whatsoever in my investigative steps, my decisions and the words that in I put in my report,\" Hur responded.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, insisted Trump was being unfairly singled out and vilified, questioning how the two cases were really all that different.\n\nRep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., called it a \"glaring double standard.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump's being prosecuted for exactly the same act that you documented Joe Biden committed,\" he told Hur.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Hur is sworn in during a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee in the Rayburn Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Nathan Howard)\n\nBut there were major differences between the two probes. Biden's team returned the documents after they were discovered, and the president cooperated with the investigation by voluntarily sitting for an interview and consenting to searches of his homes. Trump, by contrast, is accused of enlisting the help of aides and lawyers to conceal the documents from the government and seeking to have potentially incriminating evidence destroyed.\n\nHur's report cited evidence that Biden willfully held on to highly classified information and shared it with a ghostwriter, based on audio of the conversations between the two men in which Biden said he had just come across some classified documents at his home.\n\nAccording to the transcript, Biden told Hur he did not recall the exchange, or that he had actually discovered any documents. He said if he had discussed anything questionable with the ghostwriter, it was in referring to a 20-page sensitive memo he had written to then-President Barack Obama in 2009 arguing against surging troops in Afghanistan that he wanted to ensure didn't make it into publication.\n\nHur said he was aware of the need to explain in great detail why he'd decided not to charge the president and why the case didn't meet the standard for criminal charges. Such explanations are common but usually kept confidential.\n\nBut there's a tradition at the Justice Department to release such documents publicly and so as Hur was working on his report, he almost certainly would have understood that the document was going to see the light of the day.\n\n\"The need to show my work was especially strong here,\" Hur said. \"The attorney general had appointed me to investigate the actions of the attorney general's boss, the sitting president of the United States. I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why.\"\n\nHe added that \"the evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue.\"\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Az., questions Special Counsel Robert Hur during a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee in the Rayburn Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Nathan Howard)\n\nIn his interviews, Biden repeatedly told prosecutors that he did not know how classified documents ended up at his home and former Penn Biden Center office in Washington .\n\n\"I have no idea,\" he said.\n\nHe also insisted that had he known they were there, he would have returned them to the government.\n\nThe president did acknowledge that he intentionally held on to his personal diaries - which officials said contained classified information. Biden insisted were his own property, a claim also asserted by previous presidents and vice presidents, and that he had a right to keep them.\n\nHe also acknowledged that he was \"never that organized,\" as prosecutors pressed him on why some of the documents were located in different places.\n\nHur, in his report, detailed how his findings about Biden were far different from those of special counsel Jack Smith about Trump, who has been charged with willfully retaining classified documents.\n\nTrump hyped Tuesday as a \"Big day in Congress for the Biden Documents Hoax,\" while casting himself as being unfairly targeted. \"The DOJ gave Biden, and virtually every other person and President, a free pass,\" he said. \"Me, I'm still fighting!!!\"\n\nFBI agents searched Trump's Florida estate in 2022 and removed boxes of documents marked as classified after he refused multiple requests from the National Archives to return them.\n\nBiden, by his own admission in the interviews, has retained such a sprawling assortment of photos, documents and artifacts from his more than 50 years in public life that he can't keep track of everything.\n\nWhen asked if first lady Jill Biden kept her things with his, he said, \"She wants nothing to do with my filing system.\" He added, to laughs from the lawyers, \"not even kidding.\"\n\nThe transcript also offered a rare window into the mind of a sitting president, revealing his his humor and his obsessions - including his beloved Corvette and his keen interest in construction work at his home in Wilmington - as well as the rigors of the presidency and international crises.\n\nBiden first sat down with Hur during a time of crisis, one day after the devastating Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nHe entered the first day of the interview having just gotten off the phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, part of a series of calls meant to prevent the attack from spiraling into a wider regional confrontation. At multiple points, when Hur suggested a pause, Biden encouraged prosecutors to keep going, saying, \"I'll go all night if we get this done.\"\n\nBiden said that he left it to his staff to safeguard classified information that was presented to him, often leaving papers on his desk in heaps for aides to sort through and secure.\n\n\"I never asked anybody,\" Biden said. He noted that much of his staff had worked with him for years, to the point where they didn't need direction from him. \"It just - it just got done. I don't know. I can't remember who.\"\n\nConfusion over the timing of the death of Biden's adult son Beau - who died May 30, 2015 - was highlighted by Hur in his report as an example of the president's memory lapses. But the transcript shows that Hur never asked Biden about his son specifically, as a visibly angry Biden had suggested in comments to reporters the day the report was released.\n\n\"How in the hell dare he raise that,\" Biden said of Hur. \"Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business.\"\n\nDepartment of Justice Special Counsel Robert Hur is sworn in before a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Tuesday March 12, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nBut the transcript suggests that the exchange was less revealing about Biden's memory than Hur let on, and that Biden's recollection of it during his emotional White House remarks was incorrect.\n\nHur asked Biden about where he kept the things that he was \"actively working on\" while he was living in a rental home in Virginia immediately after leaving the vice presidency in January 2017. And in that context, it was Biden himself who brought up Beau's illness and death as he talked about a book he'd published later in 2017 about that painful time.\n\n\"What month did Beau die?\" Biden mused, adding, \"Oh God, May 30th.\"\n\nA White House lawyer then chimed in with the year, 2015.\n\n\"Was it 2015 he died?\" Biden asked again.\n\nBiden went on to recount in detail the story contained in his book, \"Promise Me, Dad,\" of how his late son had encouraged him to remain engaged in public life after the Obama administration ended.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker in Washington and Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

After a single term marked by ambitious plans but modest follow-through, Joe Biden is wrapping up his time in office and somewhat reluctantly shuffling off into the sunset. Despite lofty promises on everything from drug policy reform to tackling climate change, Biden's presidency has been a master class in how good intentions don't always yield good results. His domestic initiatives produced regulatory quagmires, and-despite getting out of Afghanistan-his international diplomacy grew increasingly entangled in the sorts of conflicts he once pledged to avoid. On student debt, his mouth wrote checks Congress and the courts wouldn't cash. On civil liberties, trade, the war on drugs, and Bidenomics, the American public saw mixed results and, at times, flat-out disappointment.\n\n\"I made a lot of mistakes in my career,\" Biden said in his closing remarks at the Democratic National Convention, \"but I gave my best to you.\" Was his best good enough? It wasn't good enough to pave the way for Democrats to retain the White House. With Donald Trump returning to claim the Oval Office, much of Biden's work will be soon be undone or forgotten. The man who promised in his 2020 victory speech to usher in \"a time to heal\" instead leaves a fractured and polarized landscape.

      "text": "A Decaying Joe Biden Underlines the Need for a Less Powerful Presidency\n\nBig Government\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 12.23.2024 7:00 AM\n\nObservers of the American presidency warn with increasing frequency that the office of the country's chief executive has acquired power more befitting a monarchy than a republic with elected officials. But what if the person holding that office is a placeholder for aides who cocoon the president and who really make the decisions? That is, what if all that growing power is wielded by an unelected and relatively faceless circle of advisers? That brings us to the Biden administration which, in just one term, has powerfully reinforced the argument for making the presidency much less important.\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\n\"Presidents always have gatekeepers,\" Annie Linskey, Rebecca Ballhaus, Emily Glazer, and Siobhan Hughes wrote last week for The Wall Street Journal . \"But in Biden's case, the walls around him were higher and the controls greater, according to Democratic lawmakers, donors and aides who worked for Biden and other administrations. There were limits over who Biden spoke with, limits on what they said to him and limits around the sources of information he consumed.\"\n\nIn President Joe Biden's day-to-day work, they added, several key aides to the elderly official \"were often with the president as he traveled and stayed within earshot or eye distance....They would often repeat basic instructions to him, such as where to enter or exit a stage.\"\n\nThe New York Times , which has been protective of Biden's tarnished reputation, conceded in a story by Peter Baker and Zolan Kanno-Youngs that \"time is catching up with Mr. Biden. He looks a little older and a little slower with each passing day.\" People who traveled with the president noted that he \"maintained a light schedule at times and sometimes mumbled, making him hard to understand.\"\n\nNone of this is especially surprising to the American people at this point. Even before Biden's disastrous debate performance in June, which forced him to surrender dreams of a second term, surveys found overwhelming majorities-86 percent in a February 2024 ABC News/Ipsos poll- thought he was too old to serve four more years in office . That followed special counsel Robert Hur's decision not to prosecute Biden for illegally retaining classified materials because he \"would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nThat's terribly sad. But it's also disturbing given that Biden is still the president of the United States and will remain so until Donald Trump is inaugurated next month. If Biden is too tired, forgetful, and feeble to exercise the powers of the presidency, who is making the decisions that emerge from the White House?\n\n\"It's unclear even to some inside the West Wing policy process which policy issues reach the president, and how,\" Semafor 's Ben Smith reported in July, citing \"a government official with regular access to the West Wing\" as his source. \"Major decisions go into an opaque circle that includes White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients (who talks to the president regularly) and return concluded.\"\n\nThe Times and Journal stories (Linskey and Hughes wrote an earlier take in May for the Journal on the same topic) support Smith's suggestion that policy is being crafted by obscure, unaccountable White House advisers. We've already been down that path, when Edith Wilson stepped in to act as de facto chief executive when her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, suffered a stroke. That was unacceptable and dangerous then, and it's even more so now given the greater power concentrated in the White House.\n\n\"For far too long, Americans have looked to the presidency for far too much,\" Gene Healy wrote in the new edition of his book, The Cult of the Presidency . \"No longer a limited constitutional officer charged with faithful execution of the laws, the federal chief executive has been transformed into a quasi-messianic figure, expected to create jobs, teach our children well, advance freedom worldwide, and serve as a living American talisman against hurricanes, terrorism, stock market turmoil, and spiritual malaise.\"\n\nWorse, adds Healy, \"as our politics took on a quasi-religious fervor, we've concentrated vast new powers in the executive branch\" in the form of unilateral power to wage war overseas and set policy at home through executive orders. The process has been accelerated by crises, including the 2008 financial collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch agrees.\n\n\"Since March 2020, we may have experienced the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country,\" Gorsuch wrote last year about a case that came before the court dealing with pandemic-era executive actions by the president regarding immigration. \"Executive officials across the country issued emergency decrees on a breathtaking scale.\"\n\n\"Rule by indefinite emergency edict risks leaving all of us with a shell of a democracy and civil liberties just as hollow,\" he concluded.\n\nThat's bad enough when political figures who campaigned for and won the votes to take office stretch the power of their office beyond its constitutional bounds, as presidents from both major parties have increasingly done. But now we have Joe Biden who, by all accounts, has become a figurehead in his own White House, with much of the serious work done by those around him.\n\nBiden's departure from the scene next month doesn't resolve the issue. At 78, Donald Trump is \"young\" only by comparison to the octogenarian he'll succeed. While his lapses pale by comparison to Biden's, he's had a few apparent senior moments of his own. Those could worsen over the next four years.\n\nBut even if Trump retains his health and mental faculties, the precedent of political apparatchiks nudging failing or simply weak elected officials aside in favor of their own judgment is a terrible one. Down that path lies Potemkin elections that have little to do with the people who govern the country and the policies they impose on the rest of us. We'll have rule by anonymous committees with a little democratic window dressing.\n\nAnd there's no way to guarantee that presidents won't become enfeebled or sick in the future. If they do, the power of their office will be available for the taking by ambitious White House aides. The only way to prevent the excessive power of the kingly presidency from being hijacked by those surrounding the throne is to remove its monarchical qualities.\n\nTo preserve the presidency as an office of a republic, it should be stripped of much of its power.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille. If you care about government overreach and tangible threats to everyday liberty, this is for you.\n\nΔ\n\nNEXT: Asylum Isn't As Crazy as Trump Claims\n\nJ.D.

It's worrisome that he seems to have forgotten that-or, worse, chosen to ignore it-since he's been president.\n\nIn June 2019, Biden correctly described the effects of higher taxes on imports. Donald Trump, who was president at the time, \"doesn't get the basics,\" Biden said. \"He thinks tariffs are being paid by China. Any beginning econ student...could tell you the American people are paying his tariffs.\" Around the same time, he criticized Trump's reliance on tariffs as a tool of foreign policy, saying that higher taxes on Americans was a \"shortsighted\" way to combat China's \"abuses.\" In place of his predecessor's zero-sum view on trade, Biden advocated for a \"united front of allies\" to take on China while opening up other markets.\n\nBiden's résumé seemed to confirm he had a firm grasp of trade policy. As a member of the Senate in the 1990s, Biden supported the North American Free Trade Agreement. During his time as vice president (2009-2017), Biden helped organize the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a planned-but-never-implemented 12-nation trade deal that would have lowered tariffs, increased American access to foreign goods, and boosted the economic fortunes of those other nations. The deal was also widely seen as a way to put pressure on China, which would not have been a member.\n\nTrump blew up the TPP when he took office in 2017. Disappointingly, Biden not only failed to bring it back; he also failed to undo Trump's tariff hikes.\n\nThen Biden started adding to them. In May 2024, the Biden administration announced new tariffs on steel, aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles (and the batteries used to power them), and other goods from China. In July, he hiked tariffs on some steel imported from Mexico to block steel from China that might be imported via America's southerly neighbor.\n\nIt remains true that any freshman econ student could tell Biden who would pay the cost of those tariffs. If the president needed more convincing, he could have reviewed any of the several studies published in recent years showing that Americans paid for Trump's tariff hikes.\n\nThose decisions made little economic sense and contradicted Biden's longtime record as an advocate for lowering trade barriers. They also demonstrated questionable political judgment. The president touts his bipartisan infrastructure bill as one of his top accomplishments-but insisting on Buy American policies and heightening other trade barriers means higher costs for taxpayer-funded construction projects.\n\nSimilarly, Biden pushed for a bill to help Americans afford electric vehicles, then approved tariffs to make those same cars more expensive, if they are imported from China.\n\nAt best, Biden's trade policy exhibits confusion and incoherence. At worst, he appears to be endorsing policies that he knows(or once knew) would not be in America's interest.\n\nTrade policy performance review: unacceptable; should review freshman economics\n\nThis article originally appeared in print under the headline \"Trade Policy Amnesia.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "How Obama and Biden Paved the Way for Trump's Attacks on Universities\n\nCampus Free Speech\n\nRobby Soave | 4.7.2025 8:00 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been laying siege to Columbia University, canceling $400 million in federal grants to the elite school. In exchange for having funds restored, Columbia's administration has agreed to capitulate to a list of demands relating to campus anti-Israel demonstrations: The university will ban protesters from concealing their identities with face masks, create new disciplinary bureaucracies to punish purportedly disruptive students, and even police the Middle Eastern studies department for alleged antisemitism.\n\nIt's not inherently wrong for the federal government to refrain from funding an extremely wealthy private institution of higher education, especially one with an endowment of $14.8 billion. But the Trump administration isn't trying to save money for taxpayers-it's using the money as leverage to make the university police student expression.\n\nWhile some of the protesters at Columbia illegally occupied buildings, prevented other students from attending classes, or otherwise impeded legitimate school functions in violation of campus policy, the heavy-handed measures being imposed on the university will almost certainly lead to a crackdown on nonviolent speech. Some protesters are already facing severe sanction and even deportation . There is no question that the threat of losing funds will compel Columbia's administrators to police anti-Israel expression in a manner that is careless and inconsistent with the campus's stated commitment to academic freedom.\n\nTo the extent that the Trump administration's actions have motivated this change in policy, they are drawing criticism from civil libertarians. Jonathan Zimmerman, an historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Guardian that Trump's attack on Columbia is already having a chilling effect and that he has never seen anything like it before.\n\n\"Historically, there is no precedent for this,\" said Zimmerman. \"The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.\"\n\nZimmerman's concerns about free speech are well-founded. But he is flatly incorrect to state that this has never happened before. Trump is following the exact precedent set by his two predecessors-Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nIndeed, the Biden and Obama administrations did not merely use \"money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.\" They used money as a cudgel to micromanage every university in the country .\n\nThis was done, beginning in 2011, under the auspices of Title IX, the federal statute that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. Under Obama, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) re-interpreted Title IX to require all universities that receive public funding to police sexual misconduct on campuses in a manner that violated both due process and free speech principles. These requirements were panned by organizations that work to defend such principles, including the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE). FIRE's president, Greg Lukianoff, accused the federal government of forcing universities to \"investigate harassment claims even when a reasonable person would not have found the speech objectionable, thereby weaponizing the sensitivities of the least speech-tolerant students of campus.\"\n\nAdministrators were told to take swift action against \"any unwanted conduct of a sexual nature,\" which in practice meant that students and professors faced disciplinary measures for speaking out on such subjects. One of the most iconic and well-publicized instance of this Title IX-driven censorship was the persecution of Northwestern University professor Laura Kipnis . Kipnis wrote an essay in 2015 that defended a colleague who had been accused of violating Title IX and that decried the atmosphere of paranoia that had taken hold at Northwestern. In response, she was herself accused of violating Title IX and subjected to a Kafkaesque disciplinary proceeding. As I wrote at the time:\n\nKipnis was informed that the charges existed-not what they were-via email. Norwthwestern's Title IX coordinator explained that the university would hire an outside law firm to investigate the complaints. Kipnis was not entitled to a lawyer-though she could bring a silent \"support person\"-and wouldn't be notified of the actual charges until she sat down with the investigators: either in person or via Skype. The investigators, who worked out of state, would be flown in to deal with her.\n\nAll of this occurred because a professor expressed her opinion on a matter of consequence and her critics weaponized the system to try and silence her. And Kipnis's ordeal was not unique whatsoever: Countless students and professors endured similar Kafkaesque trials.\n\nThese farcical persecutions were done at the behest of the Obama administration, in accordance with a strained legal view that federal discrimination law obliged universities to police sex-related speech. When Trump came to power in 2016, his Education Department rescinded the guidance to the universities; four years later, the Biden administration largely restored it.\n\nThe potential loss of federal funding is exactly what motivated virtually every college and university in the country that ran afoul of the OCR to fall in line and police students and professors in a manner that violated their free speech and due process rights. Virtually no university presidents stood up to the Obama and Biden administrations in the face of these threats. No elite campus behaved bravely. Not a single member of the Ivy League decided, at the administrative level, to fight back.\n\n\"People may have forgotten that the Obama and Biden administrations also 'weaponized' federal research funding by threatening to withhold funds from institutions they deemed to be out of compliance with their mandates,\" wrote Kipnis a recent post on Facebook. \"Universities were bending over for federal funds long before Trump, spending untold billions to stay on the right side of the OCR bureaucracy.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is now using antisemitic discrimination as a pretext to police campus speech, just as the previous Democratic administrations used gender-based discrimination as their pretext. It's the same bad playbook, and universities are giving it the same bad reaction: total surrender.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Many Democrats worry Biden could be stung by voter concerns over his age - at 81 he's the oldest U.S. president to hold the office - and disapproval within his party of his support of Israel's war against Hamas.\n\nWhen asked which of the two candidates had a better approach for the economy - the No. 1 concern for respondents - registered voters picked Trump 43% to 37%. Voters have been stung by several years of fast-rising consumer prices, though inflation has slowed considerably in recent months and the jobless rate has been below 4% for more than two years.\n\nThe Republican had a more significant edge - 44% to 31% - on immigration. Immigrants made up 13.9% of the country in 2022, the highest share in over a century. Trump has taken aim at immigrants in the country illegally. Trump was favored 40% to 35% on foreign conflicts and terrorism.\n\nBut Biden had the edge over Trump on responding to political extremism and threats to democracy, respondents' No. 2 concern, with registered voters picking the Democrat over Trump by 39% to 33%.\n\nTrump, who was convicted last month on criminal charges he falsified business records, is awaiting three more criminal trials, two of which are tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. Trump, who falsely claims his 2020 election defeat resulted from fraud, included the claim in a fiery speech shortly before hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nBiden also had an edge over Trump on healthcare policy - 40% to 29%. Biden was vice president in 2010 when then-President Barack Obama pushed a landmark health reform through Congress that dramatically increased access to health insurance.\n\nPrevious Reuters/Ipsos polls have shown Biden and Trump neck-and-neck in the presidential race, though a number of polls in battleground states have shown Trump ahead in recent months.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted nationwide and online, collected responses from 1,019 U.S. adults, including 856 registered voters.

      "text": "The Quiet Lawlessness of Joe Biden\n\nHe was elected to restore norms but has done more damage to the rule of law than any other president.\n\nFour years ago today, Joe Biden took the oath of office and made a series of promises : \"I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will defend America.\" Those words came just weeks after the January 6 riot at the Capitol, but the idea that Biden, the Washington mainstay, would restore the \"norms\" so often flouted by his predecessor was arguably the very reason American voters elected him in the first place.\n\nAs he's scrambled to try and salvage his legacy in recent weeks, Biden has returned to those themes. \"In the past four years, our democracy has held strong,\" he said in his farewell address last week. \"And every day, I've kept my commitment to be president for all Americans.\"\n\nNo. His \"aww shucks,\" doddering nature is effective, but Joe Biden's legacy is not the Restorer of Norms. He is leaving office quietly having caused more damage to the rule of law than arguably any single one of his predecessors.\n\nBut what about Andrew Jackson?\n\nFollowing the Worcester v. Georgia decision that acknowledged Native American tribes as distinct political entities, Jackson-responsible for the Trail of Tears-purportedly said, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.\" Well, after the Supreme Court struck down Biden's student loan \"forgiveness\" plan as unconstitutional in Biden v. Nebraska , the president tried again. \"Early in my term, I announced a major plan to provide millions of working families with debt relief for their college student debt,\" he bragged . \"The Supreme Court blocked it. But that didn't stop me.\"\n\nBut what about Abraham Lincoln?\n\nAbraham Lincoln was one of the greatest presidents in American history-if not the greatest-but he did occasionally overreach as the Civil War raged, suspending the writ of habeas corpus multiple times, ignoring a ruling from Chief Justice Roger Taney about the decision, and ordering the arrest of opponents in Congress and in the media. But then again, President Biden encouraged his Department of Justice to prosecute his political opponents, declaring from the steps of Marine One that he hoped the January 6 committee \"goes after [Trump administration officials defying subpoenas] and holds them accountable criminally\" and that his own DOJ would bring charges against them. In April 2022, the New York Times reported that Biden had grown \"frustrated\" with Attorney General Merrick Garland's \"deliberative approach\" and that he had \"confided to his inner circle that he believed former President Donald J. Trump was a threat to democracy and should be prosecuted.\" Once Trump was eventually indicted, Biden taunted his opponent about his limited ability to campaign against him: \"I hear you're free on Wednesdays.\"\n\nBut what about Woodrow Wilson?\n\nAfter all, President Wilson infamously resegregated the federal government and enforced the Sedition Act of 1918 to jail thousands of his critics. Hard to beat that one. But Biden did try his best to silence his critics-or at least erase their criticisms-by unleashing his staff to threaten and bully social media companies in an effort to prevent Americans from straying from his political orthodoxy. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Joe Rogan last week that \"these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and, like, scream at them and curse\" to take things down that were, in fact, true. As Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito recounted in Murthy v. Biden :\n\nFor months in 2021 and 2022, a coterie of officials at the highest levels of the Federal Government continuously harried and implicitly threatened Facebook with potentially crippling consequences if it did not ... crack down on what the officials saw as unhelpful social media posts, including not only posts that they thought were false or misleading but also stories that they did not claim to be literally false but nevertheless wanted obscured.\n\nBut what about Franklin Roosevelt?\n\nAfter the Supreme Court struck down several of his New Deal initiatives, a frustrated FDR threatened to add justices to the court with the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. Feeling pressured by far-left critics of the court, Biden created a Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States after he agreed that the court was \"getting out of whack.\" The Commission's report studied Democratic legislation to pack the court and strip it of jurisdiction to hear cases that could undermine his administration's priorities. Threatening to destroy the political independence of the Supreme Court unless its justices rule the right way didn't work for FDR, and it didn't work for Biden either.\n\nBut what about Barack Obama?\n\nDespite his constitutional duty to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" President Obama put out memos announcing his decisions not to enforce laws he disagreed with-like marijuana and immigration enforcement. So did Biden, making clear last week his administration would not enforce the TikTok ban that he himself signed into law just months earlier-not because he disagreed with it, but because he didn't want to be on the hook politically for shutting down the app that is so popular with young people.\n\nBut what about George W. Bush?\n\nBush famously signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act into law while publicly stating the legislation presented \"serious constitutional concerns.\" But Biden repeatedly told the American people that he did not have the power as president to issue an eviction moratorium, disburse blanket \"forgiveness\" of student loan debt, or tackle climate change -only to forge ahead with all three and criticize the Supreme Court in the most strident and partisan terms when justices struck them all down.\n\nAnd of course, but what about Donald Trump?\n\nThere is no minimizing how Trump handled his 2020 election loss-attempting to undermine and overturn the results to stay in power. Biden, to his credit, has done nothing of the sort this time around, inviting Trump to the White House and emphasizing the importance of a peaceful transfer of power. But that all played out against the backdrop of Biden trying to rig an election in his own way, hiding his deteriorating mental acuity from the American people-and even leaders of his own party-in an effort to secure reelection based on a facade. In a recent interview with USA Today , Biden conceded that he \"[didn't] know\" if he had the \"vigor\" to serve another four years.\n\nHe did this by hiding his condition and blackballing anyone who questioned his competency. Trump infamously attacked special counsel Robert Mueller throughout the course of the Russia investigation. And after special counsel Robert Hur released his report declining to charge Biden for the mishandling of classified documents-in large part because Hur did not believe a jury would convict a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\"-Biden accused Hur of callously asking him when his son died. \"How in the hell dare he raise that?\" the president bellowed , allowing his staff and block Hur from various employment opportunities. But in actuality, it was Biden who brought up Beau-not Hur. More to the point, the transcript also showed Biden asking his attorney \"in 2009, am I still vice president?\"\n\nTrump has also been undermining the rule of law for years, repeatedly and emphatically deriding the justice system as \"rigged.\" And yet, how else can we describe Biden's handling of his son's criminal prosecution this past year? He pointed to Hunter's indictment as proof that Americans should trust our legal system, even saying after his son's conviction-related to a firearm restriction Biden supports -that he would \"abide by the jury decision\" and \"not pardon him.\" Yet weeks after the election, the pardon came nonetheless -not because he was a devoted father but because he'd \"watched [his] son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.\" He claimed \"no reasonable person\" could conclude this wasn't a politically motivated case-despite the fact that Hunter was prosecuted by Biden's own Justice Department.\n\nIt was all a lie. As the judge overseeing the tax case pointed out, \"The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States ... but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history.\"\n\nBiden's attempt to rewrite history with respect to the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) last week is a fitting capstone on his lawless presidency. Congress first sent the ERA to the states for ratification in 1972 with a seven-year deadline, but it didn't receive the requisite support until January 2020 -decades beyond the congressionally mandated deadline and after several original states had voted to de-ratify the amendment.\n\nThe archivist of the United States didn't accept the belated ratification as a legitimate development, and neither has any federal court that has considered the question. The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg (one of the earliest and strongest proponents of the ERA) didn't accept it, and neither did Joe Biden for the first 1,457 days of his presidency- until it became a question of his legacy. Then, he decided he could simply \"affirm what [he] believe[s]\" and announce that the Constitution had been amended, concerns about precedent be damned.\n\nAs we enter a second Trump administration, there is plenty of concern about the institutional havoc the president-elect could wreak. Might he try to run for an unconstitutional third term ? Ignore the Supreme Court if it declares his immigration enforcement actions to be unlawful? Threaten TV networks with onerous regulations and investigations if they air or refuse to censor criticisms of his administration? Refuse to enforce a law passed by Congress that criminalizes fraudulent memecoins or appropriates money for military equipment to Ukraine?\n\nBut while these folks were worried about what violations Trump might commit, Biden was actually committing them. He may have been less upfront about his lawlessness than his predecessor, but he did significant damage to our constitutional order and the rule of law in the name of appeasing political supporters and attacking political opponents.\n\nThat's Biden's legacy-a quiet lawlessness that should live in infamy.\n\nSarah Isgur is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in northern Virginia.

      "text": "History Will Not Have Mercy on Joe Biden\n\nThe defining qualities of Joe Biden the political man were arrogance and dishonesty.\n\nPresident Joe Biden- forgotten but not gone as Jim Geraghty so nicely put it over at National Review -is a much-reduced figure, and one naturally wants to be charitable toward him as his failure as a politician and his failure as a father are fused together in the waning days of his presidency, a period dominated by his dishonest and impolitic pardon of his son Hunter, who was duly convicted of tax and gun offenses in a case brought not by some overreaching political enemy but by Biden's own Justice Department.\n\nCharity is a virtue. But, as journalists refresh their pre-writes of the president's obituary (and I do not mean the political one) and the historians begin their first drafts in earnest, honesty is a superseding virtue. There is simply no way to tell the truth about Joe Biden's life and career without kicking him while he is down-it is not like he is about to get back up and make of himself a more sportsmanlike target.\n\nThe defining qualities of Joe Biden the political man were arrogance and dishonesty, compounded by stupidity. That Biden lasted as long in politics as he did-he first was elected to the Senate the year your gray-bearded correspondent was born-and that he rose as high as he did is an indictment of the state of Delaware, the Democratic Party, and the American electorate, which was wise to choose Biden over Donald Trump in 2020 but foolish to put itself in such a dilemma to begin with.\n\nBiden will forever be paired with Trump in the history books and will be the smaller figure-Shemp to Trump's Curly. But there is a certain justice in that: Biden became vice president in part because Barack Obama believed, with good reason, that Biden, having already failed in more than one presidential campaign, was unlikely to ever be a serious contender for the big chair. No, Biden managed to become president due almost entirely to the fact that he was not Donald Trump-a figure whom he, perversely enough, resembles in many important ways: Both are East Coast white men born to prosperous (the Trumps much more so than the Bidens, of course) families in the 1940s, both are habitual liars and serial fabulists, both are plagiarists, both substitute insult for argument, both are intellectual mediocrities, neither speaks a foreign language or ever has uttered an original thought in English, each believes that his surname carries some sort of incantatory power , both embrace economic nationalism of a particularly ham-fisted and superficial kind, both abstain from alcohol, both have embarrassing adult children in their 40s and 50s who require more hand-holding than you'd think, and both revel in the abuse of presidential powers.\n\n(Jill Biden's ex-husband reports, in some detail, that Biden also resembles Trump in the matter of adultery , a claim the Bidens deny.)\n\nIf you need someone to accommodate your whataboutism here, I am happy to oblige: Yes, I think Donald Trump is the worse of the two by a nontrivial margin and would have preferred that the voters in November had elected Kamala Harris, a deranged hippopotamus, or an egg-salad sandwich rather than Trump. I also wish that my dachshund would not express joy and surprise by becoming incontinent, the difference being that there is some hope that a dachshund can be trained while voters heroically resist learning their lessons no matter how many times history rubs their collective nose in it.\n\nMy only personal memory of Joe Biden was watching him on the train, an affectation that was part of his Scranton-lunchbucket routine. His minders taped off about half of a first-class car, and a dozen or more Secret Service agents and other minions would swarm the platform every time the train came to a stop, as Biden-and this was a decade ago, well before he was elected president-sat there looking terrified and confused, lost as last year's Easter Eggs. It was a lot of dog-and-pony show business to allow a vice president to pretend that he was a regular guy, or maybe to accommodate a graybeard loon already entering his second childhood and indulging his love of choo-choos. It was a contemptible little spectacle.\n\nBiden fancies himself a foreign-policy man, a man of diplomacy, and here the history books will probably all cite former Defense Secretary Robert Gates : \"He has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\" One could go through the greatest hits: Biden's despicable performance in the Clarence Thomas confirmation fiasco, his batty racial politics (\" You ain't black !\" \" Put y'all back in chains !\" \" Jim Crow 2.0! \"), his creepy handsiness , his administration's bizarre if maybe not technically criminal coddling of Iran , his reality-proof incompetence in the face  of persistent corrosive inflation, his lawlessness on student loans , his stupidity on uranium , allowing the chaos at the border to fester and intensify, hobbling Ukraine at every turn until forced to relent, etc.\n\nBut what sticks in my mind about Biden is his slander of an obscure nobody, truck driver Curtis Dunn, whom he spent years lying about. Dunn was the other driver in the accident in which Biden's first wife and his infant daughter died, an accident investigators at the time said was almost certainly caused by Mrs. Biden, who apparently pulled into oncoming traffic with the baby in her lap. Biden repeatedly claimed that Dunn was a drunk driver, a menace \"who drank his lunch,\" even though there was absolutely no evidence that this was true. It was, politically speaking, a better story, and Biden has always put his own selfish, greasy little interests ahead of those of ordinary people in the real world.\n\nBiden is a failed politician. The only thing he had going for him was that he had denied Donald Trump a second term, and, now, he has given that second term to Trump at a time when the once and future president is even more dangerous and depraved than he was in 2020. Biden's final significant act in office will have been going back on his word and pardoning his impenitent, drug-addled, pocket-lining miscreant of a son-who isn't the only Biden who traded on the family name for personal enrichment. Biden could have protected his son from whatever it is that Kash Patel might get up to as head of the FBI without vacating the legitimate tax and firearms convictions that have already been handed down, but, as it turns out, his \"word as a Biden\" has the same value as an IOU signed by Donald Trump.\n\nThe matter will soon be in the hands of the obituarists and historians, and, soon enough, in the purview of a higher Authority than these. I hope that God will have mercy on Joe Biden-history will not.\n\nKevin D. Williamson is national correspondent at The Dispatch and is based in Virginia.

      "text": "Joe Biden's Legacy of Failure\n\nHe was elected in 2020 to put an end to Trump's movement. It's bigger than ever.\n\nWhen Joe Biden took his oath of office in January 2021, he outlined a bold vision for his presidency. \"Together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear,\" he said on the steps of the U.S. Capitol which, just days before, had been swarmed by protesters rioting in the name of Donald Trump. \"May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us, and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. We met the moment. Democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived.\"\n\nNearly four years later, Biden's single term is limping to an end, with the president-dogged by concerns about his age and mental acuity that eventually forced him to end his reelection bid- more unpopular than he's ever been, increasingly out of view , and widely considered the primary culprit in Democrats' post-election autopsies . His recent decision to issue a sweeping pardon to his son Hunter-after repeatedly pledging not to do so-led several prominent Democrats and media allies to accuse him of selfishness and putting \" personal interest ahead of duty \" in a way that will \" tarnish his reputation .\"\n\nThere are plenty of specific examples of Biden's failures, to be sure. Persistent inflation made worse by excessive federal spending that even some Democratic economists warned would overheat the economy. The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan , pushed through despite the admonitions from top military leaders. A lack of urgency about illegal immigration. His disinterest in even trying to unify a divided country. His decision-after implying in 2020 he'd be a \"bridge\" candidate-to launch a quixotic reelection bid when his advanced age and mental decline were all too apparent in private and in public.\n\nBut even setting all that aside, Biden's presidency has been an unmitigated disaster on its own terms: His entire raison d'être was to keep Trump-and Trumpism-from returning to the Oval Office. \"If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running,\" the president told donors a year ago this week. \"We cannot let him win.\"\n\nTwelve months and one belated switcheroo atop the ticket later, Democrats are staring at four more years of Trump and a generation of Republican politics shaped in his image-a reality that nominating and electing Biden in 2020 was supposed to prevent. Instead, so much of what they feared would happen had Trump won a second term in 2020 threatens to come to pass: A GOP president with authoritarian instincts, more knowledgeable in the position and unconstrained by a quest for reelection, moving forward with alacrity on a conservative populist agenda without regard for the norms and strictures of constitutional governance.\n\nTo be sure, Democrats looking for silver linings can still find them in the big-government legislative agenda that defined Biden's single term in office. The president signed into law $1.2 trillion in infrastructure spending, hundreds of billions of dollars for semiconductor manufacturing and high-tech research, and the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" supposedly to aid in the economic recovery by way of energy subsidies and expanding federal health-care programs. These are progressive achievements any Democratic president might be proud of, Democratic defenders of Biden's tenure say.\n\nBut discarding the partisan blinders, Biden's term in office looks less like one of progressive success and more like one of missed opportunities for building a lasting bulwark against the excesses of Trump and Trumpism. An alternative path for the president might have involved treating Trump less like a vanquished foe and temporary aberration and more like an ongoing civic emergency. In this parallel universe, the Biden administration would have prioritized restoring and bolstering the norms of our liberal democracy: the rule of law, the system of checks and balances, the separation of powers. Biden might have done this even-or especially-at the expense of the progressive laundry list of projects and proposals that Democrats so often take for granted.\n\nInstead, Biden often thumbed his nose at norms when they clashed with his party's agenda.\n\nHe called for doing away with the Senate's filibuster rules to pass a codification of abortion rights. He used executive action and an exceedingly expansive reading of existing law to grant broad forgiveness of student loans, only for the Supreme Court to repeatedly reject that reading and strike down the administration's multiple attempts to implement it. And while Biden supported updates to the two laws governing presidential transition and the counting of electoral votes to avoid a repeat of the failed effort to overturn the 2020 election, other loopholes to procedural aspects of the executive branch have gone untouched.\n\nAs Jack Goldsmith, the former George W. Bush-era assistant attorney general and conservative legal scholar, recently argued , there are plenty of vulnerabilities in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act that presidents of both parties have temporarily taken advantage of to get around the Senate's advice and consent powers on executive branch appointments. Goldsmith noted that he and Bob Bauer, a Democratic lawyer who served as Barack Obama's White House counsel and advised Biden , made proposals to shore up those vulnerabilities that \"went nowhere\" during the past four years.\n\nAnd Biden's unconditional pardon for his son Hunter-who was convicted earlier this year on federal gun charges and pleaded guilty to federal tax charges-is the coup de gr â ce for the president's misreading of his mandate from voters, which was far narrower than he was led to believe : restore normalcy to the White House. The reaction from elected Democrats is instructive.\n\n\"President Biden's decision put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans' faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all,\" Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado tweeted .\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who just won a close reelection to her seat in Washington state, was arguably even blunter. \"President Biden's pardon of his son confirms a common belief I hear in Southwest Washington: that well-connected people are often gifted special treatment by a two-tier justice system,\" she said . \"The President made the wrong decision. No family should be above the law.\"\n\nThese responses seem to anticipate the need congressional Democrats will have long after Biden has departed public life to oppose Trump with authority and credibility-assets the president had squandered as his term went on.\n\nIt's worth recalling that the premise of Biden's 2020 White House run was to restore a certain functional and moral order to the chief executive. \"Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation,\" Biden said in the speech to the virtual Democratic National Convention that year. \"He's failed to protect us. He's failed to protect America. And, my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable.\"\n\nOver the next four years, will Democrats come to a similar realization about Trump's successor?\n\nMichael Warren is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Assessing Claims About Job Growth Under Joe Biden\n\nThese claims fail to mention the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on job creation.\n\nWith the Biden administration now days away from handing over the White House keys to President-elect Donald Trump, supporters of the president have taken to social media to tout job growth during his four-year term.\n\nGuy Kawasaki, an author and former tech industry venture capitalist, claimed that the number of jobs created under the Biden administration totaled more than under the previous three presidential administrations combined. \"Joe Biden's administration helped to create 16.6 million jobs,\" Kawasaki shared on Threads , BlueSky , and LinkedIn . \"More than the administrations of Trump, Obama, and George W. [Bush.] Remember 16.6 million four years from now.\"\n\nA popular left-wing X account, \"Protect Kamala Harris\"-which has no affiliation with the vice president-made a similar claim comparing percent change in job growth in the Biden and first Trump administrations. \"Donald Trump ended his Presidency with 0.5% less jobs than when Barack Obama left office,\" the account tweeted . \"Joe Biden is ending his Presidency with 11.25% more jobs than when Donald Trump left office.\"\n\nThe claim that more jobs were added during the Biden administration than during the presidencies of Trump, Obama, and Bush is true but missing context. Meanwhile, \"Protect Kamala Harris\" account's claim is mostly true-slightly understating the percent change in job loss under the Trump presidency-but similarly missing context. The posts all ignore the economic Black Swan event that was COVID-19. The pandemic jolted job growth measurements with a steep and sudden drop-a net loss of 20 million jobs in the one-month span from March to April 2020-when state governments implemented shutdowns. Jobs lost during the COVID-19 pandemic largely recovered under the Biden presidency once the economy got rolling again. So, while it is true that the economy added 16.6 million jobs under the Biden administration-a percent gain of 11.6 percent-most of those represent people returning to or finding new work postpandemic.\n\nAs noted in a previous Dispatch Fact Check from June ,\n\nBiden's employment growth numbers benefit from the fact that he took over as president when employment was in a deep but temporary valley. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculated that the economy lost 21.4 million jobs in March and April of 2020 due to COVID-19 shutdowns, and when Biden took office the country still had almost 9.4 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic. When compared to employment trends before the pandemic, however, only about 6.2 million jobs have been added to the economy on net during Biden's time in office.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump entered office in January 2017 with the U.S. economy's nonfarm jobs totaling 145.6 million, and left office four years later in the midst of the pandemic with 142.9 million recorded nonfarm jobs, per Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) . So Trump left the White House with about 1.9 percent fewer jobs than when he entered-more than the 0.5 percent loss claimed online-but excluding the final months of his presidency and before the onset of COVID-19 tells a different story. In February 2020-the last month before pandemic-induced health concerns and restrictions caused job growth to turn negative-there were 152.3 million nonfarm jobs recorded, a net increase of 6.7 million jobs from January 2017 and a percent gain of 4.6 percent.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Impeach Joe Biden ... Seriously\n\nThe president's pardon of his son could be a time for Congress to check the political power of his office.\n\nDear Reader (including those of you who opted for expedited delivery) ,\n\n(Before we get to the good stuff, I want to let you know there's an announcement at the end for Premium Dispatch Members and our first Premium Townhall. Details after the \"news\"letter.)\n\nIn a much healthier republic, Congress would impeach Joe Biden for pardoning his son.\n\nIf you'll forgive just a soupçon of Swiftian excess, I think the case that Congress should impeach Biden is quite strong.\n\nLet me set the table for a moment. It is true that the president's pardon power is pretty much absolute-save for the fact that he can only pardon federal crimes and can't pardon impeachable offenses. This in turn leads many people to think the president can't be impeached for bad pardons. But this is wrong. Congress' power to impeach and remove is pretty much as absolute as the president's power to pardon. Lawyers, partisans, and pundits routinely deny this when they don't want a particular president impeached (and often agree with this when they do want a particular president impeached). They claim that a president has to commit a \"high crime\" or \"misdemeanor\" to commit an impeachable offense, and since the president has the authority to pardon whomever he wants, and for any reason, he can't be impeached for using his constitutional authority.\n\nI'm not going to get into the weeds about what high crimes and misdemeanors are, because it doesn't really matter save to say that, as a practical matter, they are whatever Congress decides they are. No court will ever overturn a congressional impeachment and removal, so even if Congress is wrong in some cosmic sense, it still has the final say.  Similarly, presidents have the final say on pardons.\n\nIndeed, if a president sold a pardon for cold hard bitcoin and got caught, the president could be impeached and removed for it (and should be!) but the pardon he sold would stand because pardons are not reviewable by courts or Congress. (If memory serves, when my friend Andy McCarthy was still at the Department of Justice and looked at Bill Clinton's last-minute pardon of Marc Rich, he concluded that even if Rich explicitly bought the pardon-not a huge if-the pardon would stand.).\n\nBut, again, that doesn't mean a president cannot be impeached for an improper pardon. Don't take my word for it.\n\nAt the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, George Mason argued against the sweeping nature of the proposed pardon power in the United States' new Constitution:\n\nNow, I conceive that the President ought not to have the power of pardoning, because he may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself. It may happen, at some future day, that he will establish a monarchy, and destroy the republic. If he has the power of granting pardons before indictment, or conviction, may he not stop inquiry and prevent detection?\n\nJames Madison, the chief author of the Constitution, had a ready rejoinder:\n\nThere is one security in this case [of a power-abusing pardon] to which gentlemen may not have adverted: if the President be connected, in any suspicious manner, with any person, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives can impeach him; they can remove him if found guilty; they can suspend him when suspected, and the power will devolve on the Vice-President.\n\nNow, I don't have a Federalist Society decoder ring or anything, but if James Madison defended the Constitution's pardon power-at a convention to ratify it!-by saying that crappy pardons are grounds for impeachment, then I think I'm right and every TV lawyer talking out of his Dershowitz saying otherwise is wrong.\n\nThe question is, therefore, does the Hunter Biden pardon qualify as the kind of thing Madison had in mind? On its face, I think it does. I don't want to use up a lot of space explaining why, for reasons I'll get to in a second. But I think it's worth noting that Mason's concern that a president might set up a monarchy is relevant here. If presidents are granted the objectively kingly power to immunize others against the law on their own behalf, we are well down the road to a quasi-monarchy already. If illegal acts are suddenly legal when done on behalf, or for the benefit of, a president, we no longer have a nation of laws. When Biden named Merrick Garland as his attorney general, he said :\n\nI made it clear from the moment I entered this race that what I believe was at stake. I said there was nothing less at stake than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, what we believe, what we will be. At the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held, where our government of laws, not of men, not of the people, of laws.\"\n\nThere was no asterisked footnote saying, \"unless it's my son and erstwhile business partner.\"\n\nNow, the reason I don't want to belabor the point of whether Hunter's pardon falls into the kind of scenario Madison envisioned is because it just doesn't matter. What I mean is, if Congress decides that it does, then it does. Period.\n\nWhich brings me to the argument for why Congress should impeach Biden for it. First of all, who among us wouldn't celebrate having the first black-Asian-female president for five minutes or so?\n\nBut more importantly, it would be an act of civic hygiene. Congress would assert its primacy and send a clear signal that the sort of corrupt self-dealing that both Democrats and Republicans claim to loathe is no longer acceptable.\n\nWhat's really interesting is how Republicans, who have been ravenously hungry to impeach Biden for four years, seem to have lost their appetite entirely. I mean, Donald Trump reportedly used to hector Republicans about when-and how many times-they were going to impeach Biden.\n\nRepublicans have introduced 15 impeachment resolutions against Biden. His release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? Impeachable! His mishandling of the border? Impeachable! Extending the COVID eviction moratorium? Impeachable! And, most relevant, covering up his shady dealings with his brother and Hunter? Impeachable, baby!\n\nBut now that Joe has issued a blanket pardon of Hunter? No articles of impeachment. In fairness, there is chatter about impeaching him.\n\nBut here's why I think they won't do it. And it's not because of their abiding interest in norms or fairness. They don't want to lay down the precedent that such abuse of power is impeachable, because Trump wants that power for himself.\n\nAnd that's precisely why Democrats should take the lead in the effort to impeach Joe Biden. Politically, it would be wildly messy, obviously. But, ultimately, I think it would be good for the Democrats. With this one cool trick, they could erase the enormous damage they've done to themselves and punish Biden for screwing them so thoroughly.  More importantly, they'd lay down a marker that Trump cannot rely on formal arguments of presidential authority to defend corrupt but technically legal abuses of power.\n\nAndy McCarthy wrote back in 2018 that, \"we've become such a litigious society we fail to recognize that the Constitution mainly relies on political checks, not judicial ones.\" Sacrificing Biden for the sake of even partially restoring those political checks is a small price to pay-even if it's \"unfair\" to Biden.\n\nWhich brings me to the much-discussed internal discussions inside the Biden administration to offer blanket preemptive pardons to a slew of people Trumpers would like to legally prosecute or persecute.\n\nNick Cattogio does an excellent job running through the pros and cons of what I still consider to be an absolutely horrendous idea. Again, if you share Mason's concern about the destruction of the republic, I can think of no better way than establishing the precedent that presidents can and should issue blanket and sweeping pardons to allies, aides, business partners, and family members for any wrongdoing even before they've been charged with anything. And I say that fully acknowledging that there's plenty of reason to believe-or at least worry-that the next administration will be outrageously and performatively vindictive against lots of innocent people.\n\nI think where I differ with Nick is that he's more despairing of the republican virtue of the American electorate than I am. \"If most voters cared about Trump's illiberalism,\" Nick writes, \"America wouldn't have reelected a coup-plotter on the off chance that he'll bring the price of eggs down by a quarter.\" I take his point, and I don't dismiss it, even if I think it's overstated.\n\nBut this leaves out the fact that, by his own framing, \"most\" of Trump's voters voted for the price of eggs to drop-and not to provide a steady stream of content for the Charlie Kirk podcast.\n\nAnd that's why I think he gives short shrift to the very real possibility-I would argue the very strong probability -that a Trump administration consumed by its political vendettas would be bad for Donald Trump and his presidency.\n\nAgain, I want to be clear: I think a \"retribution\" campaign against Kash Patel's enemies list and the \"Deep State\" would almost certainly be a grotesque, probably impeachable, abuse of power. I don't think Liz Cheney or Mitt Romney- or even Sarah Isgur -did anything wrong. And I would be enraged by a punitive campaign against them.\n\nBut as unfair as it would be to them, I don't think that unfairness would work to Donald Trump's benefit. And trying to preempt it wouldn't necessarily work to the country's benefit, or the Democrats'.\n\nI get that a lot of people think Trump has a \"mandate\" to do all of the stuff that makes the Bannonites tumescent. He campaigned on retribution, they note, so therefore he has every right to pursue retribution. I get the political logic of that, but it's also really stupid.\n\nNick has argued very persuasively, albeit dyspeptically,  that the American voters should get Trumpism \" good and hard .\" There's a Burkean element to that argument. \"Example is the school of mankind and he will learn at no other.\" You want Trump unplugged, well here. Let's see how you like it.\n\nThat argument applies to the Patelian (as in Kash) jihad, too. An electorate that voted for lower egg prices, may not find a steady stream of bogus prosecutions-and the political and legal chaos that will result-a satisfactory substitute.\n\nFor starters, let's assume there's no evidence that the people on Patel's enemy list actually committed serious crimes because, you know, they didn't commit serious crimes. That means they would be revealed as victims of a witchhunt, as the Trumpers like to say. For Liz Cheney and some of the other politicians, that could likely improve their political prospects. But it would certainly give them enormous platforms: Media coverage, fundraising, etc., would go to 11. Personally, I'm hoping there will be a serious effort to create a legal defense fund, so that Cheney et al. aren't drowned in legal fees. But ultimately, the courts would likely be inhospitable to a hackish MAGA effort, even if laundered through the DOJ (amid many resignations and scandals as AG Bondi and FBI Director Patel try to make it all work). And the Trump administration would look ridiculous, and Trump would look unconcerned with the concerns of the people who voted for him.\n\nThink of it this way: Trump's ideas about trade are preposterous. Letting him have all the tariffs he wants is the quickest way to (re)learn that lesson. Lots of Trump-aligned wonks are quietly trying to work out ways to make Trump's trade policies less damaging, and that is the responsible thing to do, of course.\n\nBut the difference between tailoring tariffs to be less economically damaging and issuing blanket preemptive pardons is that issuing blanket preemptive pardons would not be the responsible thing to do for the reasons I've suggested.\n\nMore to the point, it would be a gift to Trump. Trump cares more about talking points than facts. For all his talk about how he got rid of NAFTA he didn't actually get rid of NAFTA  -he modestly tinkered with it and gave it a new name. He didn't care about an actual investigation into Biden's vice presidential dealings with Ukraine or actual evidence that the 2020 election was stolen. He just wanted press releases that let him make his claims. He doesn't really want capable, swamp-draining reformers, he wants good talking heads on TV.\n\nIf you take Liz Cheney and all of those people off the board preemptively, you give Trump cover to say Democrats rigged the system again and deprived the American people of the opportunity to get justice for the so-called crimes Cheney, Isgur, and Anthony Fauci committed. You're saving Trump from himself. You're giving him the excuse he needs to tell the Bannonites he can't do show trials as promised while simultaneously tainting the innocent with the implication of guilt. It's the best of both worlds for Trump, because you're giving him the talking points while denying him the ability to follow through on any of his promises.\n\nWorse, you will have established the precedent that presidents can issue pardons for future crimes committed on the president's behalf. That's a precedent that Donald Trump will surely be grateful for. Indeed, I fear the Hunter Biden pardon-and these insipid \"discussions\"-has already done exactly that. Which is another reason to impeach Joe Biden.\n\nI'm open to some new argument that Biden doesn't deserve to be impeached-but I'm not sure that deserve has anything to do with it.\n\nAttention Premium Members: (and those of you on the fence about becoming premium members): We're hosting our first Premium Town Hall on Tuesday, December 10 at 8 p.m. ET.

      "text": "Impeach Joe Biden ... Seriously\n\nThe president's pardon of his son could be a time for Congress to check the political power of his office.\n\nDear Reader (including those of you who opted for expedited delivery) ,\n\n(Before we get to the good stuff, I want to let you know there's an announcement at the end for Premium Dispatch Members and our first Premium Townhall. Details after the \"news\"letter.)\n\nIn a much healthier republic, Congress would impeach Joe Biden for pardoning his son.\n\nIf you'll forgive just a soupçon of Swiftian excess, I think the case that Congress should impeach Biden is quite strong.\n\nLet me set the table for a moment. It is true that the president's pardon power is pretty much absolute-save for the fact that he can only pardon federal crimes and can't pardon impeachable offenses. This in turn leads many people to think the president can't be impeached for bad pardons. But this is wrong. Congress' power to impeach and remove is pretty much as absolute as the president's power to pardon. Lawyers, partisans, and pundits routinely deny this when they don't want a particular president impeached (and often agree with this when they do want a particular president impeached). They claim that a president has to commit a \"high crime\" or \"misdemeanor\" to commit an impeachable offense, and since the president has the authority to pardon whomever he wants, and for any reason, he can't be impeached for using his constitutional authority.\n\nI'm not going to get into the weeds about what high crimes and misdemeanors are, because it doesn't really matter save to say that, as a practical matter, they are whatever Congress decides they are. No court will ever overturn a congressional impeachment and removal, so even if Congress is wrong in some cosmic sense, it still has the final say.  Similarly, presidents have the final say on pardons.\n\nIndeed, if a president sold a pardon for cold hard bitcoin and got caught, the president could be impeached and removed for it (and should be!) but the pardon he sold would stand because pardons are not reviewable by courts or Congress. (If memory serves, when my friend Andy McCarthy was still at the Department of Justice and looked at Bill Clinton's last-minute pardon of Marc Rich, he concluded that even if Rich explicitly bought the pardon-not a huge if-the pardon would stand.).\n\nBut, again, that doesn't mean a president cannot be impeached for an improper pardon. Don't take my word for it.\n\nAt the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, George Mason argued against the sweeping nature of the proposed pardon power in the United States' new Constitution:\n\nNow, I conceive that the President ought not to have the power of pardoning, because he may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself. It may happen, at some future day, that he will establish a monarchy, and destroy the republic. If he has the power of granting pardons before indictment, or conviction, may he not stop inquiry and prevent detection?\n\nJames Madison, the chief author of the Constitution, had a ready rejoinder:\n\nThere is one security in this case [of a power-abusing pardon] to which gentlemen may not have adverted: if the President be connected, in any suspicious manner, with any person, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives can impeach him; they can remove him if found guilty; they can suspend him when suspected, and the power will devolve on the Vice-President.\n\nNow, I don't have a Federalist Society decoder ring or anything, but if James Madison defended the Constitution's pardon power-at a convention to ratify it!-by saying that crappy pardons are grounds for impeachment, then I think I'm right and every TV lawyer talking out of his Dershowitz saying otherwise is wrong.\n\nThe question is, therefore, does the Hunter Biden pardon qualify as the kind of thing Madison had in mind? On its face, I think it does. I don't want to use up a lot of space explaining why, for reasons I'll get to in a second. But I think it's worth noting that Mason's concern that a president might set up a monarchy is relevant here. If presidents are granted the objectively kingly power to immunize others against the law on their own behalf, we are well down the road to a quasi-monarchy already. If illegal acts are suddenly legal when done on behalf, or for the benefit of, a president, we no longer have a nation of laws. When Biden named Merrick Garland as his attorney general, he said :\n\nI made it clear from the moment I entered this race that what I believe was at stake. I said there was nothing less at stake than who we are as a nation, what we stand for, what we believe, what we will be. At the center of that belief is one of the oldest principles this nation has long held, where our government of laws, not of men, not of the people, of laws.\"\n\nThere was no asterisked footnote saying, \"unless it's my son and erstwhile business partner.\"\n\nNow, the reason I don't want to belabor the point of whether Hunter's pardon falls into the kind of scenario Madison envisioned is because it just doesn't matter. What I mean is, if Congress decides that it does, then it does. Period.\n\nWhich brings me to the argument for why Congress should impeach Biden for it. First of all, who among us wouldn't celebrate having the first black-Asian-female president for five minutes or so?\n\nBut more importantly, it would be an act of civic hygiene. Congress would assert its primacy and send a clear signal that the sort of corrupt self-dealing that both Democrats and Republicans claim to loathe is no longer acceptable.\n\nWhat's really interesting is how Republicans, who have been ravenously hungry to impeach Biden for four years, seem to have lost their appetite entirely. I mean, Donald Trump reportedly used to hector Republicans about when-and how many times-they were going to impeach Biden.\n\nRepublicans have introduced 15 impeachment resolutions against Biden. His release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? Impeachable! His mishandling of the border? Impeachable! Extending the COVID eviction moratorium? Impeachable! And, most relevant, covering up his shady dealings with his brother and Hunter? Impeachable, baby!\n\nBut now that Joe has issued a blanket pardon of Hunter? No articles of impeachment. In fairness, there is chatter about impeaching him.\n\nBut here's why I think they won't do it. And it's not because of their abiding interest in norms or fairness. They don't want to lay down the precedent that such abuse of power is impeachable, because Trump wants that power for himself.\n\nAnd that's precisely why Democrats should take the lead in the effort to impeach Joe Biden. Politically, it would be wildly messy, obviously. But, ultimately, I think it would be good for the Democrats. With this one cool trick, they could erase the enormous damage they've done to themselves and punish Biden for screwing them so thoroughly.  More importantly, they'd lay down a marker that Trump cannot rely on formal arguments of presidential authority to defend corrupt but technically legal abuses of power.\n\nAndy McCarthy wrote back in 2018 that, \"we've become such a litigious society we fail to recognize that the Constitution mainly relies on political checks, not judicial ones.\" Sacrificing Biden for the sake of even partially restoring those political checks is a small price to pay-even if it's \"unfair\" to Biden.\n\nWhich brings me to the much-discussed internal discussions inside the Biden administration to offer blanket preemptive pardons to a slew of people Trumpers would like to legally prosecute or persecute.\n\nNick Cattogio does an excellent job running through the pros and cons of what I still consider to be an absolutely horrendous idea. Again, if you share Mason's concern about the destruction of the republic, I can think of no better way than establishing the precedent that presidents can and should issue blanket and sweeping pardons to allies, aides, business partners, and family members for any wrongdoing even before they've been charged with anything. And I say that fully acknowledging that there's plenty of reason to believe-or at least worry-that the next administration will be outrageously and performatively vindictive against lots of innocent people.\n\nI think where I differ with Nick is that he's more despairing of the republican virtue of the American electorate than I am. \"If most voters cared about Trump's illiberalism,\" Nick writes, \"America wouldn't have reelected a coup-plotter on the off chance that he'll bring the price of eggs down by a quarter.\" I take his point, and I don't dismiss it, even if I think it's overstated.\n\nBut this leaves out the fact that, by his own framing, \"most\" of Trump's voters voted for the price of eggs to drop-and not to provide a steady stream of content for the Charlie Kirk podcast.\n\nAnd that's why I think he gives short shrift to the very real possibility-I would argue the very strong probability -that a Trump administration consumed by its political vendettas would be bad for Donald Trump and his presidency.\n\nAgain, I want to be clear: I think a \"retribution\" campaign against Kash Patel's enemies list and the \"Deep State\" would almost certainly be a grotesque, probably impeachable, abuse of power. I don't think Liz Cheney or Mitt Romney- or even Sarah Isgur -did anything wrong. And I would be enraged by a punitive campaign against them.\n\nBut as unfair as it would be to them, I don't think that unfairness would work to Donald Trump's benefit. And trying to preempt it wouldn't necessarily work to the country's benefit, or the Democrats'.\n\nI get that a lot of people think Trump has a \"mandate\" to do all of the stuff that makes the Bannonites tumescent. He campaigned on retribution, they note, so therefore he has every right to pursue retribution. I get the political logic of that, but it's also really stupid.\n\nNick has argued very persuasively, albeit dyspeptically,  that the American voters should get Trumpism \" good and hard .\" There's a Burkean element to that argument. \"Example is the school of mankind and he will learn at no other.\" You want Trump unplugged, well here. Let's see how you like it.\n\nThat argument applies to the Patelian (as in Kash) jihad, too. An electorate that voted for lower egg prices, may not find a steady stream of bogus prosecutions-and the political and legal chaos that will result-a satisfactory substitute.\n\nFor starters, let's assume there's no evidence that the people on Patel's enemy list actually committed serious crimes because, you know, they didn't commit serious crimes. That means they would be revealed as victims of a witchhunt, as the Trumpers like to say. For Liz Cheney and some of the other politicians, that could likely improve their political prospects. But it would certainly give them enormous platforms: Media coverage, fundraising, etc., would go to 11. Personally, I'm hoping there will be a serious effort to create a legal defense fund, so that Cheney et al. aren't drowned in legal fees. But ultimately, the courts would likely be inhospitable to a hackish MAGA effort, even if laundered through the DOJ (amid many resignations and scandals as AG Bondi and FBI Director Patel try to make it all work). And the Trump administration would look ridiculous, and Trump would look unconcerned with the concerns of the people who voted for him.\n\nThink of it this way: Trump's ideas about trade are preposterous. Letting him have all the tariffs he wants is the quickest way to (re)learn that lesson. Lots of Trump-aligned wonks are quietly trying to work out ways to make Trump's trade policies less damaging, and that is the responsible thing to do, of course.\n\nBut the difference between tailoring tariffs to be less economically damaging and issuing blanket preemptive pardons is that issuing blanket preemptive pardons would not be the responsible thing to do for the reasons I've suggested.\n\nMore to the point, it would be a gift to Trump. Trump cares more about talking points than facts. For all his talk about how he got rid of NAFTA he didn't actually get rid of NAFTA  -he modestly tinkered with it and gave it a new name. He didn't care about an actual investigation into Biden's vice presidential dealings with Ukraine or actual evidence that the 2020 election was stolen. He just wanted press releases that let him make his claims. He doesn't really want capable, swamp-draining reformers, he wants good talking heads on TV.\n\nIf you take Liz Cheney and all of those people off the board preemptively, you give Trump cover to say Democrats rigged the system again and deprived the American people of the opportunity to get justice for the so-called crimes Cheney, Isgur, and Anthony Fauci committed. You're saving Trump from himself. You're giving him the excuse he needs to tell the Bannonites he can't do show trials as promised while simultaneously tainting the innocent with the implication of guilt. It's the best of both worlds for Trump, because you're giving him the talking points while denying him the ability to follow through on any of his promises.\n\nWorse, you will have established the precedent that presidents can issue pardons for future crimes committed on the president's behalf. That's a precedent that Donald Trump will surely be grateful for. Indeed, I fear the Hunter Biden pardon-and these insipid \"discussions\"-has already done exactly that. Which is another reason to impeach Joe Biden.\n\nI'm open to some new argument that Biden doesn't deserve to be impeached-but I'm not sure that deserve has anything to do with it.\n\nAttention Premium Members: (and those of you on the fence about becoming premium members): We're hosting our first Premium Town Hall on Tuesday, December 10 at 8 p.m. ET.

      "text": "Is Joe Biden Too Senior of a Statesman?\n\nSome Democrats worry while others brush the question off.\n\nJoe Biden's most formidable opponent in 2024 may be himself. That's how many Democrats see it.\n\n\"Do I wish he was younger? Yeah, I do,\" said a supportive House Democrat who represents a battleground district.\n\nAs the 80-year-old president of the United States begins his reelection bid, Democratic insiders say they aren't fretting any more than usual about the myriad political challenges Biden faces, such as a volatile national economy or his underwater job approval. It's Biden's advanced age that concerns many in his party.\n\nDemocrats don't buy into Republican taunts that Biden is cognitively or physically impaired and being ordered around by senior staff. And they say they are confident the president can do his job and campaign for a second term without the \"benefit\" of a pandemic to keep him off the trail for extended periods, as was the case in 2020.\n\nBut Democrats say they worry because at Biden's age, anything can happen, even to people who don't occupy the most mentally taxing job on the planet.\n\n\"His biggest issue will be his health. If he has a health scare, that's going to create anxiety for people and they're going to want another option,\" said a Democratic operative in a red state, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nPrivately, even some Democrats in Biden's orbit share the concern. One party operative who served as a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said some fear exists that Biden could experience a health episode in the few months preceding the general election that could require him to be replaced on the ticket.\n\nWhile other elected Democrats, party operatives, and grassroots activists who worry tend to discuss their trepidation in hushed tones, Biden himself appears to recognize the nagging unease about his age.\n\n\"One of the things people are going to find out-they're going to see a race and they're going to judge whether or not I have it or don't have it,\" Biden said Wednesday during a White House news conference one day after announcing his reelection bid. \"I respect them taking a hard look at it; I take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run. I feel good, I feel excited about the prospects.\"\n\nPlenty of Democrats quite younger than the president dismiss hand-wringing about his age as unjustified.\n\n\"I fundamentally have no concerns because I've been in meetings with the president and he unquestionably has the mental capacity to lead our country,\" said Rep. Ritchie Torres, 35, of New York. Added a second House Democrat, in his 40s: \"He rides his bike. He tries to take care of himself. He's had a good first term. Very good, actually. Let him do his thing.\"\n\nSome of Biden's biggest supporters are frustrated on his behalf by the persistent questions about his age, including Democratic operatives aiding the reelection effort. They point to key legislative accomplishments: a bipartisan infrastructure bill sought after by Donald Trump but never realized; a bipartisan package to spur domestic microchip manufacturing; and trillions of dollars for social programs prioritized by grassroots liberals. And they are especially quick to highlight Biden's robust travel schedule.\n\nFrom January 4 through March 14, the president traveled outside of Washington 21 times. Not counting the eight stops in either the D.C. metropolitan area, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania or Virginia, Biden made 10 trips across the continental United States, from the West Coast, to the Midwest, to the Southeast, plus foreign journeys to Mexico, Poland and war-torn Ukraine. His trip to Kyiv from Poland required a grueling, 20-hour round-trip train ride.\n\nHow does that compare to past presidents? Democrats point out that during a similar period in 2011-January 12 through March 14- a 49-year-old Obama left Washington just 13 times, and five of those trips were to communities in metropolitan D.C., Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania. The rest of the 44th president's eight stops were in states across the country. Biden was the vice president during Obama's two terms.\n\nThe Biden campaign is confident carrying out normal presidential duties will quell concerns about his age. \"The most important thing for the president to do right now is to be the president,\" a knowledgeable Democratic insider said. \"It presents a strong foil to the Republican primary.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is an age factor there. But look what he's doing. Look how he's out there,\" said Biden ally Doug Jones, the Democratic former senator from Alabama. \"It just doesn't seem to affect him one bit.\" Meanwhile, the White House is practically daring Republicans to make Biden's age a line of attack in the upcoming campaign.\n\n\"They attacked him for his age before he beat them in 2020,\" deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said. \"They did the same before he beat them in 2022. They even tried it when he got the better of them in the State of the Union about Social Security and when he showed high endurance in a war zone. I'm not sure what they think they're accomplishing.\"\n\nBiden's distinction as the oldest White House occupant in history caused considerably more grumbling on the left last year. The Democratic party was expecting a drubbing in the midterm elections, a historical regularity for first-term presidents. Nervous Democrats were attributing the party's struggles to Biden's age, making it known they preferred new leadership atop the 2024 ticket.\n\nBut Democrats performed well in critical battleground states last November, growing their Senate majority, narrowly losing the House and winning governor's races in Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania in what amounted to a third consecutive disappointment for the Republicans in a national election. Biden followed that up with a rousing State of the Union address and active foreign trips to Ukraine and Ireland. In toto, it was enough to assuage many previously angst-ridden naysayers.\n\n\"There's always a ton of anxiety amongst the president's party leading into the midterms,\" said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. \"At this point, I think it's really rather clear that he's the best, strongest candidate we have.\"\n\nSmith's conclusion is backed up by some evidence. In a YouGov poll conducted for The Economist , Biden's favorability and job approval ratings among Democrats were both 86 percent. And in polls gauging a hypothetical Biden-Trump rematch where Biden leads, the Democratic president has a higher share of the vote than Trump has in polls where the Republican frontrunner leads. That is a crucial metric .\n\nBut worrisome signs remain for the president. To begin with, Trump was running neck-and-neck with Biden nationally in the RealClearPolitics average despite political and ethical baggage-and despite polling that shows Trump to be even more unpopular than Biden. (When it comes to how old they are, some of these same polls show voters concerned about both candidates. Trump will be 77 in June.)\n\nAccording to an NBC News poll fielded in April, prior to Biden's reelection launch, \"70 percent of all Americans-including 51 percent of Democrats-believe he should not run for a second term. Forty-eight percent of them cited the president's age as a \"major reason\" for disapproving of his 2024 campaign; an additional 21 percent said it was a \"minor reason.\" In other words, while many Democrats are content with Biden as their nominee, voters generally remain skeptical.\n\nThat could matter if Trump is defeated in the GOP primary by a younger rival; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is 44 and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is 51, for instance. Even silver-haired former Vice President Mike Pence, 63, would look youthful next to Biden.\n\n\"If it's a generational fight, campaigns are about the future,\" Democratic strategist Dane Strother said. \"That could be a problem.\"\n\nDavid M.

      "text": "Biden Family Responds to President's Withdrawal From 2024 Race\n\nMembers of President Joe Biden's family said they are proud of him after he announced on Sunday he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe president issued a statement on X announcing that it is \"in the best interest of my party and the country\" to suspend his reelection campaign, with just a few months to go before the November general election.\n\nShe said that President Biden has \"had a material impact on literally every single major issue that our country and world has faced for 50 years.\"\n\nThe president's son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted last month on felony gun charges, has not yet publicly released a statement about his father's decision. The Epoch Times contacted a representative for the younger Biden for comment Sunday.\n\n\"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,\" the Clintons wrote, adding, \"Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her. America's future depends on it.\"\n\nFormer President Trump also reacted to the announcement that his rival was dropping out of the race. He encouraged voters cast their ballots for him in November to \"remedy the damage\" that was done, while criticizing the president's record.\n\nAt the same time, several top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), suggested that President Biden step down from office immediately.\n\nSunday's announcement marks yet another seismic shift in the 2024 presidential race, coming just over a week after former President Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. The former president, during the Republican National Convention, accepted his party's nomination on July 18.\n\nPresident Biden made his announcement about a month before the start of the Democratic National Convention, which will be held between Aug. 19 and Aug. 22 in Chicago. During that event, Democratic Party delegates will officially nominate a candidate to run in November.\n\nIn his announcement, President Biden said that \"it has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nHis statement added that he will address the nation later this week about his decision."
