      "text": "Biden must use 'preemptive pardons' to protect these 6 people Trump singled out: columnist\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) has been warning that Pam Bondi - former Florida attorney general and President-elect Donald Trump's new nominee for U.S. attorney general - will likely be all in on Trump's \"revenge\" campaign if confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nKlobuchar, during a late November interview, told ABC News, \"Does it concern me that revenge would be part of her mission? Of course it does.\"\n\nDuring an August 2023 appearance on Fox News , Bondi threatened, \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted... The investigators will be investigated.\"\n\nJournalist Eleanor Clift shares Klobuchar's concerns . Her solution: President Joe Biden must exercise his \"preemptive pardon\" powers while he still has a chance.\n\nIn a November 26 opinion column for the Daily Beast , Clift argues, \" Trump knows how the game works, and he's been upfront for months about using every lever of government to seek retribution from those who he believes wronged him. His choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi, is an election denier who should be disqualified on that alone. Instead, she is expected to lead the charge purging the DOJ of anyone who worked on prosecuting Trump, while also wasting taxpayer money to dig up alleged fraud from the 2020 election.\"\n\nClift continues , \"Trump has threatened many of his adversaries, and he will soon have the power to make good on his threats. President Biden must act and use his pardon power to safeguard a lengthening list of people who are on the receiving end of Trump's threats. They will say they've done nothing wrong, and they're right. Preemptive pardons are problematic, a get-out-of jail free card when you haven't committed a crime. But they're needed now that President-elect Trump is gearing up his revenge tour.\"\n\nClift cites special counsel Jack Smith as a likely target of Trump's \"revenge\" campaign.\n\n\"Before he leaves office, Biden should pardon Liz Cheney, a profile in courage who we haven't heard from since the election, and Nancy Pelosi, another unafraid leader and favorite target of Trump,\" Clift argues. \"Then, the two generals deserve pardons: Mark Milley, who said he fears being recalled into service so Trump can court-martial him, and John Kelly, Trump's longest serving chief of staff who said Trump is a fascist.\"\n\nClift adds , \"Also in the crosshairs are Adam Kinzinger, the former GOP congressman who served on the 1/6 committee, and Senator-elect Adam Schiff, who oversaw Trump's impeachment and is the butt of Trump's nasty nicknames.\"\n\nEleanor Clift's full Daily Beast column is available at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "'Red herring': Legal experts scoff at 'absurd' Trump claim about Biden pardons\n\nDonald J. Trump\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump claimed in a social media post late Sunday night that former President Joe Biden's eleventh hour pardons for numerous officials are no longer valid - a power not granted to Trump in the Constitution.\n\nTrump wrote on his platform Truth Social that Biden's sweeping preemptive pardons are \"are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\"\n\nWithout citing any evidence, Trump also alleged Biden \"did not know anything about\" the pardons.\n\nJust hours before leaving office, Biden pardoned lawmakers who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, as well as former high-ranking health official Dr. Anthony Fauci, who steered the United States through the COVID-19 pandemic, and retired Gen. Mark Milley, former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nBiden also pardoned several members of his own family just before his term expired. The White House released Biden's statements regarding his Jan. 20 pardons.\n\nThe Autopen is a device that replicates signatures and was used by former President Barack Obama in 2011 to sign an extension of the Patriot Act.\n\nExperts say the debate over the use of the Autopen was settled in a 2005 opinion from the White House Office of Legal Counsel that stated a president may direct a subordinate to affix his or her signature to a bill using the mechanism.\n\nDavid Super, who focuses on constitutional and administrative law at Georgetown University, said Trump's Autopen argument is \"absurd.\"\n\n\"But even if it wasn't, the Constitution does not require signatures for pardons. It simply says the president has the power to pardon,\" Super said.\n\n\"So if President Biden wanted to simply verbally tell someone they're pardoned, he could do that. It wouldn't have to be in writing at all. Administratively, of course, we want things in writing. It makes things a lot simpler, but there's no constitutional requirement,\" he said.\n\nThe right-wing Heritage Foundation posted a graphic on the social media platform X on March 10 and 11, claiming the foundation's \"Project Oversight\" uncovered the exact same signature on a number of Biden's pardons.\n\nFox News also claimed on March 9 that Biden's exact same signature was found by Heritage on numerous documents from 2022 and 2024 that were published in the Federal Register.\n\nThe National Archives said in a statement that all signatures on official documents published in the Federal Register come from \"one graphic file,\" according to Snopes .\n\nKermit Roosevelt, constitutional law expert at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Autopen argument is a \"red herring.\" Trump's other suggestion, that  Biden didn't know about the pardons, would essentially make them invalid.\n\n\"If the president doesn't know that something was done, then it's not a valid official act,\" Roosevelt said. \"But I highly doubt that that happened. I know of no reason to think that that did happen.\"\n\n\"I mean, it is sort of characteristic of Trump to make insinuations and raise questions without any evidence, and then the White House says he's just asking questions,\" Roosevelt said. \"I don't think that's a great way to govern.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday that Trump was \"raising the point that did the president even know about these pardons? Was his legal signature used without his consent or knowledge?\"\n\n\"I think it's a question that everybody in this room should be looking into,\" Leavitt said, citing the New York Post as a source.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a question about the Trump administration's use of the Autopen.\n\nJennifer Shutt contributed to this report.\n\nLast updated 6:35 p.m., Mar. 17, 2025\n\nOhio Capital Journal is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "Who exactly is trying to push Biden out?\n\nAt a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, last Friday, President Biden said, \"Some folks ... are trying to push me out of the race.\"\n\nTo whom was Biden referring?\n\nCertainly not to Trump or the Republicans, who have been uncharacteristically silent about the whole question of whether Biden should drop out. They couldn't push him out of the Democratic race anyway.\n\nNor was he referring to Democrats in Congress. Almost all have been publicly supportive of Biden. Only eight House Democrats out of 213 have called for him to drop out, and only one Senate Democrat has gone that far.\n\nWas Biden referring to the leaders of the Democratic Party? Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Senate majority leader and House Democratic leader, respectively, have been supportive of Biden, at least in public.\n\nREAD: Pelosi hints at something big coming\n\nHe couldn't have been talking about the Democratic National Committee. Not a single DNC member has called for Biden to exit the race.\n\nWas Biden talking about the elite punditry on cable TV and on the op-ed pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post - almost all of whom have called for Biden to drop out?\n\nDoubtful. The chattering class has little or no influence on the preferences of average voters. How many people at that Wisconsin rally read opinion pieces in The New York Times ?\n\nDid Biden have in mind some collection of gray-bearded leaders of America - a group of unofficial elder statesmen, perhaps including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, whose counsel carries extraordinary influence behind the scenes?\n\nThere is no longer any such group. (I recall a time decades ago when a few old Democratic fixers such as Lloyd Cutler, held significant sway behind the scenes of official Washington. Not any more.)\n\nBut there is one small group of people in America with the power to push Joe Biden out of the race. Who are they? The major donors to the Democratic Party.\n\nThey're the ones Biden is angry with.\n\nOn Monday morning, Biden called into MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and railed against the big-ticket donors who have been pushing him to withdraw.\n\n\"I'm getting so frustrated with the elites ... the elites of the party,\" he said on the air. \"I don't care what the millionaires think.\"\n\nBingo. It was the first time any modern president has admitted that the elites of the party are the millionaires (and billionaires) who fund it, which gives them extraordinary political power - perhaps enough to push Biden out of the race.\n\nIn truth, the Democratic Party is little more than a national fundraising machine, as is the GOP.\n\nI'm not faulting Biden for expressing his frustration with the party's big money elite. He's simply stating the truth. America's donor class has become extraordinarily powerful, in both parties.\n\nBiden and his top aides aren't hiding this reality. To the contrary, they're actively portraying the effort to remove him as driven by the party's wealthy elite.\n\nThis may be an exaggeration. The polling data I've seen suggests that concerns about Biden's age and evident decline worry a wide swath of the public.\n\nBut Biden is trying to persuade the party's major donors of his viability. Soon after Biden shared with the hosts of \"Morning Joe\" his frustrations with the moneyed elite of the party, he held a Zoom call with that very same elite.\n\nIn that call, according to The New York Times , he told them that they had to shift the focus of the campaign away from him and onto Trump.\n\nTelling them to shift their focus seemed further evidence that, at least in Biden's mind, the party's biggest donors were responsible for focusing on Biden's debate stumbles in the first place. And it was they who must shift their focus back to Trump.\n\nI just read a New York Times op-ed by actor George Clooney, who calls for Biden to drop out. I'm not aware of any special political expertise Clooney brings to the table, except for what he states in the very first paragraph of his op-ed: \"I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history,\" he writes. \"Last month I co-hosted the single largest fundraiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election.\"\n\nI guess that makes Clooney's view highly relevant.\n\nOver the last week and a half, I've been immersed in countless discussions about whether Biden should drop out of the race. I expect you have as well.\n\nBut those discussions are irrelevant. You and I aren't going to persuade Biden to stay in the race or to drop out.\n\nOnly one group is going to persuade him - the Democratic Party's biggest donors. If they decide to stop funding the Biden campaign, Biden has no chance of winning.\n\nIt's now becoming a game of chicken. If the biggest donors stop funding Biden and Biden stays in the race notwithstanding, he clearly loses. Yet so do we all.\n\nBiden's efforts over the last few days confirm much of what I've increasingly observed over the years. The real political power in America, regardless of party, lies in the hands of big money.\n\nNOW READ: Yellow journalism exposed: The unfair targeting of Biden's flaws vs Trump's crimes\n\nRobert Reich is a professor of public policy at Berkeley and former secretary of labor.

      "text": "Biden's pardon of his son draws blowback from Republicans - and a few Democrats\n\nWASHINGTON - President Joe Biden's decision to pardon his son from federal gun and tax crimes -and any other offenses over a nearly 11-year period - has drawn outrage from Republicans, while only a few Democrats have criticized the outgoing president for establishing a potential precedent for the incoming GOP administration.\n\nIn a lengthy Sunday night statement, Biden laid out his reasoning for reversing his long-stated position that he would not give his son a pardon. He argued that Hunter Biden was unfairly targeted by Republicans and noted that investigations began in December 2020, shortly after Biden won the presidential election.\n\nThe pardon would cover offenses which Hunter Biden \"has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024,\" the executive grant of clemency signed by Biden said.\n\n\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son - and that is wrong,\" Biden said.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to his social media site, TruthSocial, where he called the move  \"an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"\n\nTrump questioned whether Biden's pardon would include the 29 inmates held in the District of Columbia jail for offenses related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Of those, 27 are charged with assaulting law enforcement after Trump riled up his supporters to overturn the presidential election he lost.\n\n\"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\" Trump wrote.\n\nWith the move, Biden joined Trump and former President Bill Clinton in pardoning family members.\n\nBiden has one of the lowest clemency rates compared to prior presidents. There are currently more than 10,500 petitions for clemency that were submitted to the White House, according to recent Department of Justice clemency statistics.\n\nTrump granted 143 pardons during his first term and so far Biden has granted 26 pardons , including his son's. Former President Barack Obama granted 212 pardons.\n\nAdvocates and Democrats have pressed Biden to exert his clemency powers on behalf of the 40 men on federal death row before his term expires in January. The push comes as Trump is set to return to the White House. The former president expedited 13 executions of people on federal death row in the last six months of his first term.\n\nThe co-executive directors of Popular Democracy in Action, a progressive advocacy group, Analilia Mejia and DaMareo Cooper, said in a joint statement that Biden should \"provide the same compassion he gave his son and pardon the 10,000 clemency petitions on his desk.\"\n\n\"The President has the power to provide clemency to thousands of people who have been wronged by the laws governing the judicial system and the political considerations that engendered them,\" they said.\n\nHunter Biden's federal charges stem from a 2018 gun purchase. He lied on a form by checking a box that affirmed he was not using illegal drugs, but he did then use drugs while owning the firearm.\n\nA federal jury convicted him in June and the gun charges carried a possible prison sentence.\n\nHunter Biden also pleaded guilty to separate federal tax charges in California.\n\nOver the course of Biden's presidency, House Republicans have held hearings and inquiries into the finances of the Biden family, focusing on Hunter Biden in an attempt to broadly stick corruption charges to the president. No evidence has shown any wrongdoing by the president.\n\nBut the pardon gave fresh ammunition to Biden critics, who noted it contradicted what the president had long promised.\n\nHouse Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chair James Comer, Republican of Kentucky, in a statement said Sunday that Biden \"has lied from start to finish about his family's corrupt influence peddling activities.\"\n\n\"The charges Hunter faced were just the tip of the iceberg in the blatant corruption that President Biden and the Biden Crime Family have lied about to the American people,\" Comer said. \"It's unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability.\"\n\nMany Republicans criticized Biden for reversing his long-standing stance that he would not pardon his son.\n\n\"President Biden insisted many times he would never pardon his own son for his serious crimes,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, said on social media. \"But last night he suddenly granted a 'Full and Unconditional Pardon' for any and all offenses that Hunter committed for more than a decade! Trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it.\"\n\nDemocrats in Congress have largely remained silent about the pardon, but some, including Ohio's Greg Landsman and Arizona's Greg Stanton, criticized the move.\n\n\"As a father, I get it,\" Landsman wrote on social media. \"But as someone who wants people to believe in public service again, it's a setback.\"\n\nStanton in a social media post wrote that while he respected Biden, \"I think he got this one wrong.\"\n\n\"This wasn't a politically-motivated prosecution,\" he said. \"Hunter committed felonies, and was convicted by a jury of his peers.\"\n\nColorado U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet wrote on social media that \"President Biden's decision put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans' faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all.\"\n\nMichigan U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote on social media that the president's decision to pardon his son was wrong.\n\n\"A president's family and allies shouldn't get special treatment,\" Peters said. \"This was an improper use of power, it erodes trust in our government, and it emboldens others to bend justice to suit their interests.\"\n\nOn CNN, Maryland U.S. Rep. Glenn Ivey said that he had \"mixed views\" about the pardoning.\n\n\"I know that there was a real strong sentiment in, you know, wanting to protect Hunter Biden from unfair prosecution,\" he said. \"But this is going to be used against us when we're fighting the misuses that are coming from the Trump administration.\"\n\nTrump himself granted controversial pardons, including of Paul Manafort, a former campaign official who was convicted of tax and bank fraud and alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHe also pardoned Roger Stone, who was convicted on charges of lying to Congress about his knowledge of Russian efforts to discredit former first lady and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nTrump also pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, who was charged with tax evasion and retaliating against a federal witness, who was the elder Kushner's brother-in-law. Trump on Saturday announced his intent to appoint Kushner as the next U.S. ambassador to France.\n\nLast updated 3:57 p.m., Dec. 2, 2024\n\nNew Jersey Monitor is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "'Go kick some coal': Joe Manchin pummeled for suggesting Biden should also pardon Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who prides himself on being an institutionalist, repeatedly insisted that he would not grant his son, Hunter Biden, a pardon for any of the federal criminal charges he was charged with.\n\nBut that was before Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. And with Trump's second presidency only one month and half away, President Biden changed his position and granted his son a full pardon in early December.\n\nThe president's move has drawn criticism from both Republicans and fellow Democrats. Centrist Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, now an independent, argued that if the president was going to grant his son a pardon, he should pardon Trump as well for the federal indictments he has faced - an argument that has drawn some scathing reactions on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFormer MSNBC host Keith Olbermann angrily tweeted , \"A difficult legacy, @Sen_JoeManchin? Yours is as a Vichy pseudo-Democrat. To hell with you.\"\n\nJournalist Wajahat Ali posted , \"Sail your house boat into the sun, Joe Manchin. Go kick some coal.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju noted that three-term centrist Sen. Jon Tester (D-Montana), who was voted out of office in November, had a \"different approach than Manchin.\"\n\nRaju wrote , \"Asked Tester about Biden pardoning his son: 'I'm one month from getting the fuck out of here,' he told me with a smile. 'Ask somebody who counts.'\"\n\nFormer Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-New York) argued that Manchin was mixing apples and oranges, tweeting, \"The usual suspects are clutching their pearls again. Senator Manchin says President Biden should pardon Donald Trump for fairness. But Hunter Biden's crimes would never have been charged were he not the president's son, and voters just pardoned Trump - a career criminal - last month.\"\n\nThe conservative group Republicans Against Trump observed , \"Sen. Joe Manchin says that President Biden should've pardoned Donald Trump alongside his son Hunter for 'balance.'\"\n\nDemocratic activist Pat Fuller wrote , \"I have resisted criticism of Joe Manchin for years because he at least voted with Democrats the majority of time. But, his suggestion that Biden pardon Trump is just a bridge too far. It's reprehensible!\"\n\nAnother Democratic activist, Ellsworth Green, tweeted , \"Manchin Urges Biden to Pardon Trump for 'Balance'??? Ain't that some serious s---??? Manchin has now proven he is being paid by Putin!!!!!! He has been a real pain in the ass to Biden all those years and now he wants something??? For Trump?

One of the individuals whose sentence was commuted was Billie Jerome Allen , who has spent more than half of his life on federal death row after being convicted at 19 years old of a crime he says he did not commit.\n\n\"These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my administration has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder,\" said Biden.\n\nThe president added that he is \"more convinced than ever\" that the U.S. must \"stop the use of\" capital punishment at the federal level.\n\n\"In good conscience,\" Biden said, \"I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\"\n\nChris Geidner, publisher of Law Dork , noted Monday that the commutations \"show a different man at the end of his time in elected office than the one who supported greatly expanding the federal criminal justice system during his decades in the Senate.\"\n\n\"It is a record that led to much skepticism when, as a candidate for president in 2020, Biden pledged to eliminate the federal death penalty,\" Geidner added.\n\nThe president's latest use of his clemency power in the waning days of his White House term came after a monthslong pressure campaign by principled opponents of the death penalty, including progressive lawmakers , human rights organizations , religious leaders , and former federal judges .\n\nAnthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, applauded Biden's move Monday as \"a historic and courageous step in addressing the failed death penalty in the United States-bringing us much closer to outlawing the barbaric practice once again.\"\n\n\"By commuting the sentences of 37 individuals on death row, President Biden has taken the most consequential step of any president in our history to address the immoral and unconstitutional harms of capital punishment,\" said Romero. \"President Biden's actions also remove 37 individuals out of harm's way-as President-elect Trump has a proven penchant and track record of conducting rushed executions. In the last six months of his first term, President Trump executed 13 individuals-more than any administration in 120 years.\"\n\n\"The ACLU is proud to join countless advocates and civil and human rights organizations in thanking President Biden for his leadership and commitment to the highest principles of justice and humanity,\" Romero added.\n\nThe Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) said Monday that Biden's move \"marks what could become a turning point in the history of capital punishment in the United States.\"\n\n\"Thirty years ago, then-Sen. Joe Biden championed the death penalty and took personal credit for dramatically expanding the number of crimes for which the death penalty could be imposed,\" the group said in a statement. \"However, over the last three decades, troubling errors have emerged surrounding the use of capital punishment. Scores of wrongful convictions of innocent people, dramatic evidence of racial bias, and sometimes torturous executions have come to define the death penalty.\"\n\n\"There are now 200 people who have been proved innocent and released after being sentenced to death in the United States, some facing execution for decades before their exoneration,\" EJI added. \"For every eight people executed in the last 50 years, one innocent person has been identified and set free. It is a shocking rate of lethal error that would likely be unacceptable in any other area of public safety, public health, or government oversight.\""

The aide stressed that even though they had no direct contact with the president and couldn't speak to concerns about his health, they were alarmed by the possibility of consequential decisions \"being made without him.\"\n\n\"I'm talking to you because I'm incredibly upset and scared for the country and I would like to do what I can,\" the aide told Smith. The aide said the exception to their claims was foreign policy, suggesting the administration had a more inclusive approach on issues pertaining to Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nOthers in the administration pushed back in the aide's claims, however. Deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, who oversees policy, stressed that Biden \"is in the middle of everything\" and \"signs off on everything.\"\n\n\"Many of us have sat with him as he's made hundreds of decisions,\" Reed said. \"Nobody has the authority to freelance. Not [White House Chief of Staff] Jeff [Zients], not [former White House Chief of Staff] Ron [Klain], not anybody.\"\n\nOther top Biden staffers also countered the aide's claims of Biden not being privy to major decisions. White House Economist Jared Bernstein told Semafor that the president \"makes decisions on everything from student debt relief to 301 tariffs to housing policy,\" and Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi assured the publication that Biden is \"sweating every relevant detail.\"\n\n\"This single source's claim is directly contradicted by a large body of (even critical) reporting about the policy process, which has continually stressed President Biden's direct involvement in every major decision,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told Semafor in an emailed statement.\n\nThe source's concern about Biden not having full input on decisions could be seen as an extension of concerns about the 81 year-old president's cognitive health after his disastrous debate with former President Donald Trump last week. The fallout from the debate began with an editorial by the New York Times calling on Biden to withdraw from the race, which was soon echoed by others both within the media commentariat and from Democrats in Congress .\n\nAn emerging consensus in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris taking Biden's place at the top of the ticket has emerged from both the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and from more establishment-leaning voices. Progressive commentator Mehdi Hasan called on Biden to officially endorse Harris as his successor in an op-ed for the Guardian, and major Democratic donor Reed Hastings - the co-founder of Netflix - also recently opined that Biden is no longer the best candidate to face off against Trump this fall."

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter , sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family.\n\nThe Democratic president had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. The move on Sunday night comes weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House.\n\nIt caps a long-running legal saga for the younger Biden, who publicly disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020 - a month after his father's 2020 victory - and casts a pall over the elder Biden's legacy.\n\nBiden, who time and again pledged to Americans that he would restore norms and respect for the rule of law after Trump's first term in office, ultimately used his position to help his son, breaking his public pledge to Americans that he would do no such thing.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversed his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for his family's benefit. Here's what to know.\n\nIn a statement released Sunday evening, Biden said, \"I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nThe president's sweeping pardon covers not just the gun and tax offenses against the younger Biden, but also any other \"offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\"\n\nIn June, Biden categorically ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son, telling reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case, \"I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.\"\n\nAP correspondent Jennifer King reports on President Biden's move to pardon Hunter Biden.\n\nAs recently as Nov. 8, days after Trump's victory, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, \"We've been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.\"\n\nThe elder Biden has publicly stood by his only living son as Hunter descended into serious drug addiction and threw his family life into turmoil before getting back on track in recent years. The president's political rivals have long used Hunter Biden's myriad mistakes as a political cudgel against his father: In one hearing, lawmakers displayed photos of the drug-addled president's son half-naked in a seedy hotel.\n\nHouse Republicans also sought to use the younger Biden's years of questionable overseas business ventures in a since-abandoned attempt to impeach his father, who has long denied involvement in his son's dealings or benefiting from them in any way.\n\n\"The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,\" Biden said in his statement. \"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.\"\n\n\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,\" Biden added, claiming he made the decision this weekend.\n\nThe president had spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, with Hunter and his family, and departed for Angola later Sunday on what may be his last foreign trip as president before leaving office on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nHunter Biden was convicted in June in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when , prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.\n\nHe had been set to stand trial in September in the California case accusing him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. But he agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges in a surprise move hours after jury selection was set to begin.\n\nDavid Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who negotiated the plea deal, was subsequently named a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to have more autonomy over the prosecution of the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden said he was pleading guilty in that case to spare his family more pain and embarrassment after the gun trial aired salacious details about his struggles with a crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe tax charges carry up to 17 years behind bars and the gun charges are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though federal sentencing guidelines were expected to call for far less time and it was possible he would have avoided prison time entirely.\n\nHunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month in the two federal cases, which the special counsel brought after a plea deal with prosecutors that likely would have spared him prison time fell apart under scrutiny by a judge. Under the original deal, Hunter was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and and would have avoided prosecution in the gun case as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled last year when the judge raised concerns about unusual aspects of the deal. The younger Biden was subsequently indicted in the two cases.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team this weekend released a 52-page white paper titled \"The political prosecutions of Hunter Biden,\" describing the president's son as a \"surrogate to attack and injure his father, both as a candidate in 2020 and later as president.\"\n\nThe younger Biden's lawyers have long argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict the president's son amid heavy criticism by Trump and other Republicans of what they called the \"sweetheart\" plea deal.\n\nRep. James Comer, one of the Republican chairmen leading congressional investigations into Biden's family, blasted the president's pardon, saying that the evidence against Hunter was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability,\" Comer said on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBiden is hardly the first president to deploy his pardon powers to benefit those close to him.\n\nIn his final weeks in office, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in law, Jared Kushner, as well as multiple allies convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Trump over the weekend announced plans to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. envoy to France in his next administration.\n\nTrump, who has pledged to dramatically overhaul and install loyalists across the Justice Department after he was prosecuted for his role in trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election, said in a social media post on Sunday that Hunter Biden's pardon was \"such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice.\"\n\n\"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\" Trump asked, referring to those convicted in the violent Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.\n\nHunter Biden said in an emailed statement that he will never take for granted the relief granted to him and vowed to devote the life he has rebuilt \"to helping those who are still sick and suffering.\"\n\n\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction - mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,\" the younger Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team filed Sunday night in both Los Angeles and Delaware asking the judges handling his gun and tax cases to immediately dismiss them, citing the pardon.\n\nA spokesperson for Weiss did not respond to messages seeking comment Sunday night.\n\nNBC News was first to report Biden was expected to pardon his son Sunday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Josh Boak in Nantucket, Massachusetts, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

There was a jarring burst of inflation and now global conflict with Russia invading Ukraine, as well as the persistent threat to democracy he felt Donald Trump posed.\n\nHow could Biden possibly heal that collective trauma?\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden speaks at a news conference following the NATO Summit in Washington, Thursday, July 11, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\n\"Be confident,\" he said emphatically in an interview with The Associated Press . \"Be confident. Because I am confident.\"\n\nBut in the ensuing two years, the confidence Biden hoped to instill steadily waned. When the 81-year-old Democratic president showed his age in a disastrous debate against Trump in June , he lost the benefit of the doubt and on Sunday withdrew as his party's nominee.\n\nIn the aftermath of the debate, Democrats who had been united in their resolve to prevent another Trump term suddenly fractured, and Republicans, beset by chaos in Congress and the former president's criminal conviction, improbably coalesced in defiant unity.\n\nBiden never figured out how to inspire the world's most powerful country to believe in itself, let alone in him.\n\nHe lost the confidence of supporters in the 90-minute debate with Trump, even if pride initially prompted him to override the fears of lawmakers, party elders and donors who were nudging him to drop out. Then Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, and, as if on cue, pumped his fist in strength. Biden, while campaigning in Las Vegas, tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday and retreated to his Delaware beach house to recover.\n\nWhat to know :\n\nThe events of the last three weeks led to an exit Biden never wanted, but Democrats felt it was essential to maximize their chance of winning in November.\n\nBiden seems to have badly misread the breadth of his support. While many Democrats had deep admiration for the president personally, they did not have the same affection for him politically.\n\nDouglas Brinkley, a historian at Rice University, said Biden arrived as a reprieve for a nation exhausted by Trump and the pandemic.\n\n\"He was a perfect person for that moment,\" said Brinkley, noting that Biden proved in era of polarization that bipartisan lawmaking was still possible. Yet voters viewed him as a placeholder, and he could never transcend the text of his speeches to visually \"embody the spirit of the nation with a sense of verve, energy and optimism.\"\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden, right, and Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, participate in a presidential debate hosted by CNN, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File)\n\nAs his reelection campaign entered its final days, Biden was still trying to prove himself and rally voters around fears that Trump would doom American democracy.\n\nThere was never a \"Joe Biden Democrat\" like there was a \"Reagan Republican.\" He did not have adoring, movement-style followers, as did Barack Obama or John F. Kennedy. He was not a generational candidate like Bill Clinton. The only barrier-breaking dimension to his election was the fact that he was the oldest person ever elected president.\n\nWhile he contemplated being in the Oval Office repeatedly from his perch as a senator from Delaware, voters rejected him again and again.\n\nHis first run for the White House, in the 1988 cycle, ended with self-inflicted wounds stemming from plagiarism, and he didn't make it to the first nominating contest. When he ran in 2008, he dropped out after the Iowa caucuses, where he won less than 1% of the vote. In 2016, Obama counseled him not to run, even though he was Obama's vice president. A Biden victory in 2020 seemed implausible when he finished fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire before a dramatic rebound in South Carolina.\n\nHe won the nomination and then did something rare in American politics: He defeated an incumbent president, Trump, who had been a catalyst for a seething sense of polarization. He then had to withstand the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who falsely claimed that the 2020 election had been stolen.\n\nFILE - Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., is shown on NBC's \"Face the Nation,\" in Washington, April 29, 1984. (AP Photo, File)\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Obama, said history would treat Biden kinder than voters had, not just because of his legislative achievements but because he defeated Trump.\n\n\"His legacy is significant beyond all his many accomplishments,\" Axelrod said. \"He will always be the man who stepped up and defeated a president who placed himself above our democracy.\n\n\"That, alone, is an historic accomplishment.\"\n\nBut Biden could not overcome his age. And when he showed frailty in his steps and his speech, there was no foundation of supporters that could stand by him. It was a humbling end to a half-century career in politics, yet hardly reflective of the full legacy of his time in the White House.\n\nHis record includes legislation that will rebuild the country in ways that will likely be seen over the next dozen years, even if voters did not immediately appreciate it.\n\n\"It takes time for it to happen,\" Biden told BET News on Tuesday. But in that same interview, he also demonstrated why the calls for him to step aside had grown so much louder: He was unable to recall the name of his defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, referring to him as the \"Black man.\"\n\nThose recent episodes stand in stark contrast to a list of accomplishments most presidents would envy and use as a sturdy foundation for reelection. The optimism about the country's future that Biden says drove him might materialize following his departure from the national stage.\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden speaks during an event on COVID-19 vaccinations and the response to the pandemic, on the White House campus, March 29, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nHarvard University economist Jason Furman, a top aide during the Obama administration, said Biden \"came into office when the economy was in the throes of COVID and helped to oversee the transition out of it to an economy that is now growing faster than any of its peer economies, with less inflation than they have.\"\n\nFurman noted that Biden increased spending to make longer-term investments in the economy while keeping Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve chairman, giving the Fed cover to hike rates and bring down inflation without disrupting the labor market.\n\nIn March 2021, Biden launched $1.9 trillion in pandemic aid, creating a series of new programs that temporarily halved child poverty, halted evictions and contributed to the addition of 15.7 million jobs. But inflation began to rise shortly thereafter. Biden's approval rating as measured by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research fell from 61% to 39% as of June.\n\nHe followed up with a series of executive actions to unsnarl global supply chains and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package that not only replaced aging infrastructure but improved internet access and prepared communities to withstand climate change.\n\nBut the infrastructure bill also revealed the challenge Biden faced in getting the public to recognize his achievement because many of the projects will take decades to complete.\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden speaks about manufacturing jobs and the economy at SK Siltron CSS, a computer chip factory in Bay City, Mich., Nov. 29, 2022. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nIn 2022, Biden and his fellow Democrats followed up with two measures that reinvigorated the future of U.S. manufacturing.\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act provided $52 billion to build factories and create institutions to make computer chips domestically, ensuring that the U.S. would have access to the most advanced semiconductors needed to power economic growth and maintain national security. There was also the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided incentives to shift away from fossil fuels and enabled Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\n\nBiden also sought to compete more aggressively with China and rebuild alliances such as NATO. He completed the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that resulted in the death of 13 U.S. service members, an effort that was widely criticized. The president also faced criticism over his handling of the southern border with Mexico as illegal border crossings led to concerns about his handling of immigration.\n\nHe also found himself embroiled in a series of global conflicts that exposed further domestic divisions.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 worsened inflation as Trump and other Republicans questioned the value of military aid to the Ukrainians. Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel sparked a war that showed divisions within the Democratic party over whether the United States should continue to support Israel as tens of thousands of Palestinians died in months of counterattacks.\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden walks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral on a surprise visit, Feb. 20, 2023, in Kyiv.

He hewed to the ideal of bipartisanship even when Democrats broke with the GOP.\n\nAnd yet, just days before he dropped out of the race, Biden felt that his work was not done and his legacy incomplete.\n\n\"I've got to finish this job,\" he told reporters after a NATO summit.\n\nBut the size of the stakes and the fear of a Biden loss resulted in a bet by Democrats that the tasks he began could best be completed by a younger generation.\n\n\"History will be kinder to him than voters were at the end,\" Axelrod said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nLAVEEN VILLAGE, Ariz. (AP) - President Joe Biden on Friday formally apologized to Native Americans for the \"sin\" of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \"blot on American history\" in his first presidential visit to Indian Country.\n\n\"It's a sin on our soul,\" said Biden, his voice full of anger and emotion. \"Quite frankly, there's no excuse that this apology took 50 years to make.\"\n\nIt was a moment of both contrition and frustration as the president sought to recognize one of the \"most horrific chapters\" in the national story. Biden spoke of the abuses and deaths of Native children that resulted from the federal government's policies, noting that \"while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing\" and that great nations \"must know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are.\"\n\n\"I formally apologize as president of United States of America for what we did,\" Biden said. The government's removal of children from their Native American community for boarding schools \"will always be a significant mark of shame, a blot on American history. For too long, this all happened with virtually no public attention, not written about in our history books, not taught in our schools.\"\n\nDemocrats hope Biden's visit to the Gila River Indian Community's land on the outskirts of Phoenix's metro area will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. The moment gave Biden a fuller chance to spotlight his and Harris' support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020.\n\nThe race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to improve turnout among bedrock supporters.\n\n\"The race is now a turnout grab,\" said Mike O'Neil, a non-partisan pollster based in Arizona. \"The trendlines throughout have been remarkably steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow margins.\"\n\nBiden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July.\n\nBut analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native American voters - a group that has trailed others in turnout rates.\n\nIn 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nBiden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would visit Indian Country.\n\nFor decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate children into white society, according to the White House. Not everyone saw the apology as sufficient.\n\n\"An apology is a nice start, but it is not a true reckoning, nor is it a sufficient remedy for the long history of colonial violence,\" said Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People's Law Project and Sacred Defense Fund.\n\nAt least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in 1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for a U.S. government apology.\n\nAt least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them.\n\n\"President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,\" said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. \"I do think that will reflect well on Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.\"\n\nDemocrats have stepped up outreach to Native American communities.\n\nBoth Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz , met with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee recently launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska through digital, print and radio ads.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ruben Gallego , who is locked in a competitive race with Republican Kari Lake for Arizona's open Senate seat, has visited all 22 of Arizona's federally recognized tribes.\n\nHarris started a recent campaign rally in Chandler, near where the Gila River reservation is located, with a shoutout to the tribe's leader. Walz is scheduled to go to the Navajo Nation in Arizona on Saturday.\n\nThe White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years.\n\nThe president designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in Nevada and Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.\n\nIn addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and more.\n\nBiden picked former New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as his Interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.\n\nShe, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government's boarding school policies that led Biden to deliver the formal apology.\n\nThom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University, said both Harris' and Trump's campaigns - and their allies - have put a remarkable amount of effort into micro-targeting in Arizona.\n\n\"They are pulling out every stop just to see if they could wrangle a few more votes here and there,\" Reilly said. \"The Indian community is one of those groups that Harris is hoping will overperform and help make the difference.\"\n\n___\n\nBoak reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden on Sunday urged Americans to reject political violence and recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully, saying the upcoming presidential election will be a \"time of testing\" in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump .\n\nIn a prime-time national address from the Oval Office, Biden said political passions can run high but \"we must never descend into violence.\" The president said his party and the Republicans can compete forcefully over different policy visions - but must do it in a civil fashion.\n\n\"All of us now face a time of testing as the election approaches,\" Biden said. \"There is no place in America for this kind of violence - for any violence. Ever. Period. No exception. We can't allow this violence to be normalized.\"\n\nBiden spoke for six minutes in his third address to the nation since Saturday evening's attack by a shooter that left Trump with a bloodied ear, killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others. His warning came hours after FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents have seen increasingly violent rhetoric online since the attack at the Trump rally.\n\nPresident Biden says America must not go down the road of political violence, in an address to the nation after the attempted killing of GOP rival Donald Trump. AP correspondent Sagar Meghani reports.\n\nSince the shooting, the president and his team had been grappling with how to calibrate the political path forward after the weekend attack targeting the very person Biden is trying to defeat in November's election . Biden sharply condemned the attack, but indicated he plans to continue to press his campaign agenda and has \"no doubt\" Republicans will do the same when they open the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nWhat to know :\n\nHe emphasized that said those disagreements must remain peaceful.\n\n\"We can do this,\" Biden pleaded, saying the nation was founded on a democracy that gave reason and balance a chance to prevail over brute force. Biden also warned that political tensions were being inflamed by a balkanized media environment and exploited by American enemies.\n\n\"Here in America we need to get out of our silos, where we only listen to those with whom we agree, where misinformation is rampant, where foreign actors fan the flames of our division to shape the outcomes consistent with their interests, not ours,\" Biden said.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Biden was briefed in the White House Situation Room and condemned the attempted assassination of Trump as \"contrary to everything we stand for as a nation.\" He said he was ordering an independent security review of how such an attack could have happened.\n\nThe president said he has also directed the U.S. Secret Service to review all security measures for the RNC. Hours later, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, the Secret Service's coordinator for the convention, said the weekend attack against Trump did not warrant any changes to the agency's security plan for the event and officials \"are fully prepared.\"\n\nBiden promised a \"thorough and swift\" review and asked the public not to \"make assumptions\" about the shooter's motives or affiliations.\n\nThe president said he and first lady Jill Biden were praying for the family of Corey Comperatore , a former fire chief who was shot and killed during the Trump rally Saturday night in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"He was protecting his family from the bullets,\" Biden said. \"God love him.\"\n\nThe president also said he'd had a \"short but good conversation\" with Trump in the hours after the shootings and said he was \"sincerely grateful\" that the former president is \"doing well and recovering.\"\n\nTrump, who has called for national resilience since the shooting, posted on his social media account after Biden's remarks, \"UNITE AMERICA!\"\n\nBiden, who has set out to brand Trump as a dire threat to democracy and the nation's very founding principles, put a temporary pause on such political messaging after the shooting. Shortly after Saturday night's attack, Biden's reelection campaign froze \"all outbound communications\" and worked to pull down its television ads.\n\nThe president also postponed a planned trip to Texas on Monday, where he was to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library. An NBC News interview between Biden and anchor Lester Holt will now occur at the White House, instead of in Texas, as initially planned.\n\nBiden's campaign said that, after the NBC interview airs on Monday night, the Democratic National Committee \"will continue drawing the contrast\" with Trump over the course of the GOP convention. It was unclear when campaign ads will resume.\n\nBiden still plans to make a planned trip to Las Vegas, which will include a campaign event Wednesday. Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her planned campaign trip to Florida on Tuesday, where she had been set to meet with Republican women.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, arrived Sunday evening in Milwaukee for the Republican convention, where criticism of Biden and the Democrats is sure to be searing.\n\nThe weekend developments were only the latest upheaval in a campaign that has been extraordinarily topsy-turvy in recent weeks .\n\nBiden's shaky debate performance on June 27 so spooked his own party that some top surrogates and donors turned on him, and nearly 20 Democratic members of Congress called on the president to leave the race outright. Facing mounting questions about whether he was fit for a second term, Biden and his top advisers have been scrambling to salvage his campaign by adding events around the country and more aggressively criticizing Trump.\n\nSaturday's attack upended - at least temporarily - that counteroffensive. The campaign hoped that Sunday's Oval Office address let Biden further drive home his point about unity while demonstrating leadership that could assuage nervous critics within his own party.\n\n\"We'll debate and we'll disagree, that's not going to change,\" Biden said in his afternoon remarks. \"But we'll not lose sight of who we are as Americans.\"\n\nBiden tied Saturday's shooting to other incidents of political violence, from the 2017 death of a counterprotester at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, to the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, by Trump supports seeking to prevent the certification of the Electoral College count.\n\nAlthough investigators are still in the early stages of determining what occurred and why, some Biden critics were calling out the president for telling donors in a private call Monday that \"it's time to put Trump in the bullseye.\"\n\nA person familiar with those remarks said the president was trying to make the point that Trump had gotten away with a light public schedule after last month's debate while the president himself faced intense scrutiny. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to more freely discuss private conversations.\n\nIn the donor call, Biden said: \"I have one job and that's to beat Donald Trump. ... I'm absolutely certain I'm the best person to be able to do that.\"\n\nHe continued: \"So, we're done talking about the debate. It's time to put Trump in the bullseye. He's gotten away with doing nothing for the last 10 days except ride around in his golf cart, bragging about scores he didn't score. ... Anyway I won't get into his golf game.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - For more than two weeks now, the Democratic Party has been mired in crisis. And yet there is no sign that the threat to Joe Biden's reelection is nearing a conclusion, as the president digs in and a growing chorus of Democratic officials, donors and strategists calls for him to step aside.\n\nDonors and high-profile endorsers are repudiating Biden, morale inside and outside the campaign is weak, and some top Democrats are pondering whether to make a move against the embattled president. One of Biden's allies privately described a cycle of alternating hope and despair in the style of the movie \"Groundhog Day.\"\n\nThe extraordinary intra-party debate still rages 15 days after Biden's disastrous debate performance , with the president's Thursday news conference doing little to quell fears about his prospects against Republican Donald Trump. Another five Democratic members of Congress called on Biden to step aside in the hours since the president's high-profile press conference, bringing to nearly 20 the total number of Democratic U.S. representatives and senators publicly pushing Biden to leave the race.\n\nBiden's acknowledgment Thursday that delegates were free to vote their conscience at the party's August convention - or in a virtual roll call vote that could come much sooner - sparked a new wave of urgent conversations among Democratic officials on Friday.\n\n\"I'm in that box of delegates who are really reconsidering if they're going to cast their vote for President Biden,\" said Joe Salazar, a Democratic National Committee member from Colorado.\n\nBiden insists he will not step down. And indeed, other delegates say they're firmly behind the president .\n\nThe president's team is aggressively pushing back against a collection of new data shared among Democratic officials in recent days arguing that he's now at a considerable disadvantage in his bid to defeat Trump in November. In fact, fear is pervasive among donors and strategists working on House and Senate races that Biden's weak standing could undermine the party's outlook even in blue states.\n\nHours after his campaign issued a new strategy memo announcing a renewed focus on three pivotal Midwestern states - the so-called \"Blue Wall\" that has long been must-win for Democrats - one of the campaign's field organizers in Wisconsin quit.\n\nThe lower-level staffer's departure, announced during an internal staff conference call Thursday, was attributed directly to post-debate frustration, according to two people familiar with the matter granted anonymity to share details of the private discussion. A Biden campaign spokesperson confirmed the staff departure.\n\nWhile one person leaving a campaign of more than 1,000 people isn't proof of a larger exodus, other signs of trouble continued to pop up.\n\nOne lawmaker, Rep. Mike Levin of California, told Biden directly on Friday that he should step down in a virtual call hosted for members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nThe call began with Biden soliciting feedback on how to appeal to the Hispanic vote and what campaign events he should join over the next few months. When the call was opened to questions, Levin raised his hand to give Biden a talk about his Southern California district, with voters telling him that the president should not be on top of the party's ticket for 2024.\n\nLevin, according to two of the people, then encouraged the president to listen to those constituents and step down.\n\n\"I have deep respect for President Biden's five-plus decades of public service and incredible appreciation for the work we've done together these last three and a half years,\" the lawmaker said in a statement. \"But I believe the time has come for President Biden to pass the torch.\"\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a letter to his caucus on Friday describing a private meeting he had the night before with Biden. Notably, he did not include any endorsement of the president in the brief letter.\n\n\"In my conversation with President Biden, I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the caucus has shared in our recent time together,\" Jeffries wrote.\n\nA private debate is playing out among the party's donor class in particular, which is far from united on whether Vice President Kamala Harris should inherit the nomination should Biden ultimately step aside, according to conversations with more than a half-dozen donors granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nSome donors believe Biden still offers the best chance of defeating Trump, despite Democratic voters expressing widespread doubts in polling about his age and readiness.\n\nThat's even as fundraisers are being canceled and some larger donors refuse to fund any Democratic campaigns until Biden is no longer the nominee. Others are putting money behind political action committees aimed at supporting down-ballot candidates who have openly called for Biden to step aside.\n\nOthers would prefer an open convention that would allow hundreds of delegates gathered in Chicago next month to select the nominee from a collection of top-tier prospects that also includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, among others.\n\nBut Harris, who is the first woman, Black woman and person of Asian descent to serve as vice president, commands deep loyalty from key Democratic constituencies. Even if donors persuaded someone to run in a potential open primary, that candidate would be in a position of challenging and trying to sideline someone who has set those historic firsts.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign is in a position of implicitly undercutting Harris' prospects to protect Biden's.\n\nBiden's campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon released a memo Thursday conceding \"increased anxiety\" within the party, although she suggested that movement against the president, \"while real, is not a sea-change in the state of the race.\"\n\nAnd O'Malley Dillon wrote that there is \"no indication that other Democratic candidates would outperform the president against Trump.\"\n\nSalazar, the DNC member from Colorado, declined to say whether there was an organized effort among delegates to rally behind another presidential nominee when asked. But he criticized DNC leadership in Washington for declining to answer key logistical questions about how or when delegates could nominate a Biden replacement should they wish to.\n\nBiden's nomination could be sealed in a matter of days due to a virtual roll call that would make him the nominee well before the convention opens Aug. 19. The DNC originally set up the virtual roll call to preempt an Ohio ballot requirement that could have kept Biden off the ballot there.\n\nOhio has since changed its law. But despite numerous inquiries from The Associated Press and other media, the DNC won't say whether it will keep the virtual roll call or when it will hold it.\n\nThe virtual vote to make Biden the nominee could be as soon as July 19, Salazar said, although a DNC spokesperson said the vote could not take place before July 21.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's fundraising is surging. And the presumptive Republican nominee has only just begun to spend on television advertising, while Biden has poured tens of millions of dollars into battleground-state advertising in recent months.\n\nBiden's allies are hoping for a respite in the coming days with the Republican National Convention opening Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said the GOP was prepared to win this fall regardless of whether Biden steps out of the race or not.\n\n\"I think if Kamala Harris steps in, she is going to run on the exact same platform that Joe Biden has been running on, and it is a failed platform based on failed policies that have really hurt American families,\" he said. \"The Democratic Party is in complete disarray.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Will Weissert, Brian Slodysko, Mike Balsamo and Colleen Long in Washington contributed.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Biden has tried to defend his feeble and tongue-tied performance in the June 27 debate against Republican Donald Trump as an outlier rather than evidence that at 81 he lacks the vigor and commanding presence that the public expects from the commander in chief.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's news conference is projected onto a screen inside the media center on the final day of the NATO Summit in Washington, Thursday, July 11, 2024. (Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nHe made at least two notable flubs, referring at an event beforehand to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin\" and then calling Kamala Harris \"Vice President Trump\" when asked about her by a reporter. But he also gave detailed responses about his work to preserve NATO and his plans for a second term. And he insisted he's not leaving the race even as a growing number of Democratic lawmakers ask him to step aside.\n\nHere are some highlights from the press conference:\n\nIn remarks, President Biden mistakenly switches the Ukrainian and Russian presidents.\n\nPerhaps Biden's biggest slip-up in the press conference came early on when he referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as \"Vice President Trump,\" in saying he picked her because he believed she could beat Trump.\n\nEven before the news conference, Biden had bungled an important name at the NATO summit and instantly lowered expectations for his performance.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,\" Biden said as he was introducing Ukrainian President President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is most definitely not Russian President Vladimir Putin. The gaffe immediately prompted gasps, as Biden caught himself and said to Zelenskyy: \"President Putin? You're going to beat President Putin.\"\n\nBut he was defiant when a reporter brought up his reference to \"Vice President Trump\" and noted the presumptive Republican nominee's campaign was already promoting the slip-up. \"Listen to him,\" he said, before walking off the stage.\n\nOne House Democrat, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, issued a statement minutes later calling on the president to withdraw.\n\nIn announcing a compact that would bring together NATO countries to support Ukraine, President Joe Biden referred to the nation's leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as \"President Putin.\"\n\nIt's a delicate dance between the president and vice president, with many Democrats openly pining for Harris to replace Biden on the ticket. Biden didn't acknowledge that tension, but only brought Harris up in response to pointed questions about whether he believed she had the capability to replace him.\n\n\"I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be president,\" Biden said, citing Harris' resume from prosecutor to the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut in response to a later question he acknowledged he'd moved on from his 2020 campaign promise to be a \"bridge\" to a new generation of Democrats. \"What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited,\" he said, without a word about his vice president.\n\nRepeatedly, he said, \"I've got to finish this job.\"\n\nThe press conference ended with Biden being asked directly whether he'd step down for Harris if he saw polling showing she had a better chance of beating Trump. \"No, unless they come back and said there's no way you can win,\" Biden responded. Then he added, in a stage whisper, \"No poll's saying that.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at a news conference Thursday July 11, 2024, on the final day of the NATO summit in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nBiden tried to make the case that what he's doing matters more than how he talks about it.\n\nHe praised the just finished NATO summit as elevating America's standing. \"Have you ever seen a more successful conference?\" Biden said to a group of reporters who often only got to see the conference during prepared remarks.\n\nHe drilled down on how inflation has eased from its 2022 peak as he reeled off stats such as the creation of 800,000 manufacturing jobs under his watch, saying that world leaders would want to trade their own economies for what United States has. He also said he would cap how much rent could grow for tenants of landlords who are part of a tax-credit program for low-income housing.\n\nIt's the same pitch Biden has made in stump speeches without necessarily doing much to move his own popularity. His team believes it will sink in if repeated constantly.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at a news conference following the NATO Summit in Washington, Thursday, July 11, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nBiden kicked off the press conference by talking at length about NATO and its value to the United States - one of his strongest political issues against Trump, who has been openly skeptical of the alliance and once suggested he'd encourage Russia to attack NATO members whom he considered delinquent.\n\nBiden tied himself to an American tradition stretching \"from Truman to Reagan to me\" of defending NATO. \"Every American must ask herself or himself, is the world safer with NATO?\" he asked.\n\nLater, to assure a European journalist asking about governments on that continent worrying Trump could win, Biden launched into a detailed recounting of how he helped shepherd Finland into the alliance. After that, he went into detail about how to push back against China for supporting Russia during its war against Ukraine and contended he will continue to be able to deal with Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nOverall, Biden spoke forcefully and fluently about foreign policy, one of his favorite subjects. But the news conference's focus wasn't really foreign policy, it was reassuring Democrats and the world that Biden is still able to be president and beat Trump.\n\nThat shows how even Biden's strengths are being overshadowed by questions about his capabilities.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's news conference is projected onto a screen inside the media center on the final day of the NATO Summit in Washington, Thursday, July 11, 2024. (Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nEvery politician has a stock set of lines. And whenever Biden could, he went back to his favorite talking points. It was a way to answer the question without necessarily needing to say anything spontaneous or new.\n\nHe went after trickle-down economics, borrowing a line about his father never benefiting much from tax cuts aimed at the wealthy (\"I don't remember much trickling down to his kitchen table\"). He hailed Delaware for leading the country in corporations. He said he's the \"most pro-union labor president in history.\" He explained his decision to run for a second term with a variation on his \"finish the job\" catchphrase. He went into his standard spiel about computer chips.\n\nWith no time limit on his answers like he faced at the debate, Biden went on for several minutes at a time telling stories about his interactions with foreign leaders and making the case for his reelection.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at a news conference Thursday July 11, 2024, on the final day of the NATO summit in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nThere were few fireworks in Biden's answers -- with the highly anticipated event at times coming across as more of a think tank lecture than an effort to grab voters' attention. He went into granular detail on geopolitics and rattled off numbers - asking at one moment, though, to not be held to the precise figure.\n\nWhile it didn't erase the stumbles and blank stares from the debate, it showed that he could engage with reporters' questions on a range of issues without losing focus.\n\nThere was still regular coughing and throat clearing. And at times he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper that evoked the rasp of his voice on debate night.\n\nOverall, his presentation was a reminder that people are focused on him now with an almost clinical eye toward possible slip-ups and mistakes, the kind of pressure that is unlikely to go away for as long as Biden insists he'll stay in the race.\n\n___\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nIt's Day 2 of the DNC, and there are 76 days until Election Day. Here's what to know:\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Delegates at the Democratic National Convention voted Monday night to approve their 2024 party platform , which lays out familiar priorities for the party but wasn't updated to reflect that President Joe Biden is no longer running for reelection.\n\nThe largely ceremonial vote at Chicago's convention signaled the party coalescing around a singular vision for the next four years - though a somewhat outdated one, as Vice President Kamala Harris has only outlined a few of her own specific policy positions since she took over the Democratic presidential ticket last month. The platform makes repeated reference to Biden's \"second term\" despite the president's decision a month ago to no longer seek one.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson attend Day One of the Democratic National Convention, at the United Center, Monday, Aug. 19, 2024 in Chicago. (Mike Segar/Pool via AP)\n\nThe Democratic National Committee said the more than 90-page document \"makes a strong statement about the historic work that President Biden and Vice President Harris have accomplished hand-in-hand, and offers a vision for a progressive agenda that we can build on as a nation and as a Party as we head into the next four years.\"\n\nRegina Romero, the mayor of Tucson, Arizona, and co-chair of the convention platform committee, told delegates that the platform was passed \"prior to the president passing the torch in an act of love and patriotism.\" She said that the platform nonetheless included input from all corners of the party and has a \"forward-looking vision for our party that echoes the voice of all.\"\n\n\"Vice President Harris is now carrying the torch,\" Romero said.\n\nMitch Landrieu, a former Biden senior adviser for infrastructure projects and another platform committee co-chair, said it \"makes a strong statement about the historic work that President Biden and Vice President Harris have accomplished\" while also representing \"a bold vision for our future.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, center, met with supporters on the tarmac while arriving at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Sunday, Aug. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nThe platform was approved on the floor by a voice vote.\n\nThe convention's platform committee voted to approve the platform on July 16, days before Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris on July 21. As a result, the document repeatedly refers to Biden's second term and his administration's accomplishments. It mentions Harris' work as vice president but does not describe her candidacy or go into detail on her views on key issues.\n\n\"President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job,\" it states, a sentiment that is now out of date.\n\n▶ Follow the AP's live coverage and analysis from the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\n\nRepublican former President Donald Trump's campaign has sought to tie Harris to Biden, arguing that his policies on the economy and other key issues are deeply unpopular. In a statement released shortly before the convention vote, it said, \"There is no daylight between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. The proof? The DNC just released Kamala's party platform, and it includes at least (asterisk)nineteen(asterisk) mentions of 'Biden's second term.'\"\n\nHarris has indeed talked generally about supporting the Biden administration's key goals, which are more or less endorsed in the platform as written. It calls for restoring abortion rights nationwide, continuing to advance green energy initiatives that can create jobs and help slow climate change, capping low-income families' child care costs and urging Congress to approve a pathway to U.S. citizenship for \"long-term\" people in the country illegally.\n\nThe platform also says Israel's right to defend itself is \"ironclad\" while endorsing the Biden administration's efforts to broker a lasting cease-fire deal that could suspend the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza .\n\nProtesters march passed a police line prior to the start of the Democratic National Convention Sunday, Aug. 18, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nHarris laid out a string of new economic proposals last week but otherwise hasn't released a detailed list of her policy positions since taking over the top of the Democratic ticket. Her campaign aides have suggested she no longer adheres to some of the more liberal positions she took during her first run for president in 2020, including endorsing a ban on hydraulic fracturing.\n\nIn any event, candidates are not bound to adhere to their party's platform and often don't. What the platforms spell out usually has little effect on the race and is unlikely to have much impact on Election Day this cycle.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nFollow AP's live coverage of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - At 1:45 p.m. Sunday, President Joe Biden's senior staff was notified that he was stepping away from the 2024 race . At 1:46 p.m., that message was made public.\n\nIt was never Biden's intention to leave the race: Up until he decided to step aside Sunday, he was all in.\n\nHis campaign was planning fundraisers and events and setting up travel over the next few weeks. But even as Biden was publicly dug in and insisting he was staying in the race, he was quietly reflecting on the disaster of the past few weeks, on the past three years of his presidency and on the scope of his half-century career in politics.\n\nIn the end, it was the president's decision alone, and he made it quietly, from his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sick with COVID-19, the first lady with him as he talked it through with a small circle of people who have been with him for decades.\n\nWhat to know :\n\n\"This has got to be one of the hardest decisions he's ever made,\" said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., the president's closest ally in Congress, who spoke with him Sunday. \"I know he wanted to fight and keep going and show that he could beat Donald Trump again, but as he heard more and more input, I think he was wrestling with what would be the best for the country,\" Coons said in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nThis story is based on interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with the president's thinking over the past few weeks, days and hours as he made his decision. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to talk about private discussions.\n\nThe White House is seen, Sunday July 21, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nIt wasn't until Saturday evening that Biden began to come to the conclusion that he would not run for reelection. He started writing a letter to the American people.\n\nBiden had been off the campaign trail for a few days, isolated because of COVID-19, when it all started to deeply sink in - his worsening chances of being able to defeat Donald Trump with so much of his party in open rebellion, seeking to push him out of the race - not to mention the persistent voter concerns about his age that were only exacerbated by the catastrophic debate.\n\nBiden was at his beach home with some of his and Jill Biden's closest aides: chief strategist Mike Donilon, counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti, White House deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini, and Anthony Bernal, senior adviser to the first lady.\n\nBy Sunday, his decision crystallized. He spoke multiple times with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would endorse. He informed White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, and his longtime aide and campaign chairwoman Jen O'Malley Dillon.\n\nWhat to know about the 2024 election:\n\nNews outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP .\n\nA small group of senior advisers from both the campaign and the White House were assembled for the 1:45 p.m. call to relay Biden's decision, while his campaign staff released the social media announcement one minute later.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden wrote.\n\nJust about a half-hour later came his public vote of support for Harris. It was a carefully choreographed strategy meant to give the president's initial statement full weight, and to put a period on the moment before launching forward into the next step.\n\n\"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" Biden said in another post on X. \"Democrats - it's time to come together and beat Trump.\"\n\nElizabeth Alexander, Jill Biden's communications director, said, \"down to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose.\n\n\"She's his biggest believer, champion, and always on his side, in that trusted way only a spouse of almost 50 years can be,\" Alexander said.\n\nIt's not like things had been going great before the June 27 debate. In an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research , fully 77% of U.S. adults said Biden was too old to be effective for four more years. Not only did 89% of Republicans say that, but so did 69% of Democrats.\n\nAnd it hadn't gotten any better by April, when more than half of U.S. adults thought Biden's presidency hurt the country on issues like the cost of living and immigration.\n\nBut Biden had insisted - to himself, to the nation, to his supporters - that he would be able to bring voters around if he got out there, told people about his record, explained it to them. Talked to them. Looked them in the eye.\n\nHe had a lifetime of experience that told him that if he stuck to it, he'd overcome. His campaign was so confident, in fact, that they arranged to go around the Commission on Presidential Debates to set up a series of faceoffs with Trump under a new set of rules.\n\nThat produced the June 27 debate that set Biden's downfall in motion. Biden gave nonsensical answers, trailed off mid-sentence and appeared to stare blankly in front of an audience of 51 million people. Perhaps most distressing to other Democrats, Biden didn't go after Trump's myriad falsehoods about his involvement in the violence around the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, abortion rights or immigration.\n\nBiden and his team blamed the night on so many different things. He had a cold. He was jet-lagged. He needed to get more sleep. That night opened the door for his party to push him out.\n\nPublicly and privately Biden was fighting to stay in the race. He was working to convince voters that he was up for the task for another four years. He was frustrated by the Democrats coming out publicly against him, but even angrier about the leaks and anonymous sources relaying how even former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi were working to get him to drop out.\n\nIt looked like he'd won out a couple times; the chorus of naysayers seemed to die down. He had some well-received speeches mixed with so-so TV interviews and a day featuring an extended news conference in which he displayed a nuanced grasp of policy but also committed a few gasp-inducing gaffes.\n\nBut the doubts didn't go away.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer eventually invited top Biden staff to a meeting on July 11 to talk about their concerns. It didn't go well. Senators expressed their concerns, and almost none of them said they had confidence in the president. But even afterwards, Schumer was worried it wasn't getting to Biden.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Schumer called Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Obama. Schumer decided that day to request a meeting with Biden.\n\nAt a July 13 meeting in Rehoboth, Schumer told Biden he was there out of love and affection. And he delivered a personal appeal focused on Biden's legacy, the country's future and the impact the top of the ticket could have on congressional races - and how that could potentially affect the Supreme Court. That same day came the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.\n\nSchumer told the president he didn't expect him to make an immediate decision, but he hoped Biden would think about what he said, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nBiden responded, \"I need another week,\" and the two men hugged.\n\nLaw enforcement blocks off a street near President Joe Biden's beach house, Sunday, July 21, 2024, in Rehoboth Beach, Del. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nIt was full steam ahead until Biden pulled the emergency brake.\n\nThe president had lost his voice, but he was recovering well and his doctor had sent an update to the public shortly before 1 p.m. on his condition. His small circle decided to post the statement on X on Sunday, rather than let it leak out for days before he was prepared to address the nation, which he is expected to do sometime early this week.\n\nMuch of his campaign was blindsided, and it was clear by how little had changed after he dropped out. For hours after the announcement, Biden's campaign website reflected that he was still running and KamalaHarris.com still redirected to Biden's page.\n\nEven Harris' statement announcing her intent to succeed Biden was sent from \"Joe Biden for President.\"\n\nAfter the public announcement, Zients held a senior staff call, and sent out an email, and spoke with members of Biden's Cabinet, emphasizing to them that nothing had changed when it came to the business of governing and that the administration still had a lot of work to do, according to two people with knowledge of the message. And the president was also making personal calls.\n\n\"Team - I wanted to make sure you saw the attached letter from the President,\" Zients wrote in the staff email. \"I could not be more proud to work for President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the American people - alongside all of you, the best White House team in history. There's so much more to do - and as President Biden says, 'there is nothing America can't do - when we do it together.'\"\n\nVermont Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat who had called for Biden to bow out, was gardening with his wife when the news broke, and said he was momentarily \"stunned.\" Senators texted each other questioning if it was really happening.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal was at an event in his state, and there was spontaneous applause when it was announced to the crowd that Biden wouldn't run, he said.\n\nThere was a sense of excitement and energy in the crowd \"that has been completely lacking,\" Blumenthal said.\n\n\"It was also, let's be blunt, a sense of relief,\" he said. \"And a sense of reverence for Joe Biden.\"\n\nBy Sunday evening, Biden for President had formally changed to Harris for President.\n\nO'Malley Dillon told campaign staff their jobs were safe, because the operation was shifting to a campaign for Harris.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Farnoush Amiri and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A rapidly growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers called Friday for President Joe Biden to drop his reelection bid, even as the president insisted he's ready to return to the campaign trail next week to counter what he called a \"dark vision\" laid out by Republican Donald Trump.\n\nAs more Democratic members of Congress urged him to drop out - bringing the total since his disastrous debate against Trump to nearly three dozen - Biden remained isolated at his beach house in Delaware after being diagnosed with COVID-19. The president, who has insisted he can beat Trump, was huddling with family and relying on a few longtime aides as he resisted efforts to shove him aside.\n\nLate Friday, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is in a tough race for reelection, called for Biden to step aside.\n\nBrown said in a statement that he agrees with \"the many Ohioans\" who have reached out to him. \"I think the president should end his campaign,\" he said.\n\nAnd in a statement later Friday, Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky., also called on Biden to drop out while saying, \"there is no joy in the recognition he should not be our nominee in November. But the stakes of this election are too high.\"\n\nBiden said Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention showcased a \"dark vision for the future.\" The president, seeking to move the political conversation away from his fate and onto his rival's agenda, said Friday he was planning to return to the campaign trail next week and insisted he has a path to victory over Trump, despite the worries of some of his party's most eminent members.\n\n\"Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,\" Biden said. \"The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, his campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillion, acknowledged \"slippage\" in support for the president but insisted he's \"absolutely\" remaining in the race and the campaign sees \"multiple paths\" to beating Trump.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do to reassure the American people that, yes, he's old, but he can win,\" she told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" show. She said voters concerned about Biden's fitness to lead aren't switching to vote for Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic National Committee's rulemaking arm held a meeting Friday, pressing ahead with plans for a virtual roll call before Aug. 7 to nominate the presidential pick, ahead of the party's convention later in the month in Chicago.\n\n\"President Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership and not be battling leaks and press statements,\" Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, Biden's closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, told The Associated Press.\n\nIt's a pivotal few days for the president and his party: Trump has wrapped up an enthusiastic Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday. And Democrats, racing time, are considering the extraordinary possibility of Biden stepping aside for a new presidential nominee before their own convention.\n\nAmong the democrats expressing worries to allies about Biden's chances were former President Barack Obama and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who has privately told Biden the party could lose the ability to seize control of the House if he doesn't step aside.\n\nNew Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich called on Biden to exit the race, making him the third Senate Democrat to do so.\n\n\"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\" said Heinrich, who's up for reelection.\n\nAnd Reps. Jared Huffman, Mark Veasey, Chuy Garcia and Mark Pocan, representing a wide swath of the caucus, together called on Biden to step aside.\n\n\"We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy,\" they wrote.\n\nSeparately, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois wrote in an op-ed that with \"a heavy heart and much personal reflection\" he, too, was calling on Biden to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nCampaign officials said Biden was even more committed to staying in the race. And senior West Wing aides have had no internal discussions or conversations with the president about dropping out.\n\nOn Friday, Biden picked up a key endorsement from the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. CHC BOLD PAC said the Biden administration has shown \"unwavering commitment\" to Latinos and \"the stakes couldn't be higher\" in this election.\n\nBut there is also time to reconsider. Biden has been told the campaign is having trouble raising money, and key Democrats see an opportunity as he is away from the campaign for a few days to encourage his exit. Among his Cabinet, some are resigned to the likelihood of him losing in November.\n\nThe reporting in this story is based in part on information from almost a dozen people who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive private deliberations. The Washington Post first reported on Obama's involvement.\n\nBiden, 81, tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling in Las Vegas earlier this week and experienced \"mild symptoms\" including \"general malaise\" from the infection, the White House said.\n\nWhite House doctor Kevin O'Connor said Friday that the president still had a dry cough and hoarseness, but that his COVID symptoms had improved.\n\nBiden noted his illness while making a joke about Trump on social media Friday night, posting: \"I'm stuck at home with COVID, so I had the distinct misfortune of watching Donald Trump's speech to the RNC. What the hell was he talking about?\"\n\nIn Congress, Democratic lawmakers have begun having private conversations about lining up behind Harris as an alternative. One lawmaker said Biden's own advisers are unable to reach a unanimous recommendation about what he should do. More in Congress are considering joining the others who have called for Biden to drop out. Some prefer an open process for choosing a new presidential nominee.\n\n\"It's clear the issue won't go away,\" said Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, the other Senate Democrat who has publicly said Biden should exit the race. Welch said the current state of party angst - with lawmakers panicking and donors revolting - was \"not sustainable.\"\n\nHowever, influential Democrats including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are sending signals of concern.\n\n\"There is of course work to be done, and that in fact is the case because we are an evenly divided country,\" Jeffries said in an interview on WNYC radio Friday.\n\nBut he also said, \"The ticket that exists right now is the ticket that we can win on. ... It's his decision to make.\"\n\nTo be sure, many want Biden to stay in the race. But among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll . That sharply undercuts Biden's post-debate claim that \"average Democrats\" are still with him.\n\nAmid the turmoil, a majority of Democrats think Vice President Kamala Harris would make a good president herself.\n\nA poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do a good job in the top slot. About 2 in 10 Democrats don't believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don't know enough to say.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan, Ellen Knickmeyer in Aspen, Colorado, Steve Peoples in Milwaukee, and Josh Boak, Will Weissert, Mary Clare Jalonick, Seung Min Kim and Stephen Groves in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\nLUANDA, Angola (AP) - President Joe Biden arrived for his long-awaited first presidential visit to sub-Saharan Africa on Monday to the cheers of thousands in Angola, where he will highlight an ambitious U.S.-backed railway project meant to counter China's influence on the continent of over 1.4 billion people.\n\nBiden's three-day visit to Angola will focus largely on the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles , electronic devices and clean energy technologies.\n\nBiden's trip comes weeks before Republican Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, finally delivering on Biden's pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa. On his way to Angola, he stopped in the Atlantic Ocean island nation of Cape Verde for a brief, closed-door meeting with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva.\n\nBiden plans to meet with Angolan President João Lourenço in the capital, Luanda, where crowds lined the streets for his arrival, and visit the National Slavery Museum. He also will travel to the Atlantic port city of Lobito for a look at the rail project. He will announce new developments on health, agribusiness and security, White House officials said.\n\nBiden had been expected to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022. The trip was pushed back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among some Africans that their continent is still low priority for Washington.\n\nThe last U.S. president to visit sub-Saharan Africa was Barack Obama in 2015. Biden did attend a United Nations climate summit in Egypt in North Africa in 2022.\n\n\"I just kind of push back on the premise that this is some Johnny-come-lately trip at the very end,\" national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on board Air Force One on the way to Angola, noting that top administration officials had visited Africa, including Vice President Kamala Harris. \"This is something he (Biden) has been focused on since he became president of the United States.\"\n\nCritical minerals are a key field for U.S.-China competition, and China has a stranglehold on Africa's critical minerals.\n\nThe U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China's Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy.\n\nThe Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president's signature initiatives, yet Lobito's future and any change in U.S. engagement with the continent depends on the incoming administration of President-elect Trump.\n\n\"President Biden is no longer the story,\" said Mvemba Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \"Even African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe U.S. has committed $3 billion to the Lobito Corridor and related projects, administration officials said, alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.\n\n\"A lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\" said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.\n\nHe called it a flagship for the G7's new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China's Belt and Road.\n\nMany are optimistic that the Lobito project, which won't be complete until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration. Blunting China has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump's to-do list.\n\n\"As long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it's going to keep being funded,\" said Christian-Géraud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nKirby said the Biden administration hopes Trump and his team see the value in Lobito but \"we are still in office. We still have 50 days. This is a key major development not just for the United States and our foreign policy goals in Africa, but for Africans.\"\n\nThe Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola's port of Lobito, strengthening a route west for Africa's critical minerals. It also ultimately aims to extend from Zambia and Congo to Africa's east coast through Tanzania and be a coast-to-coast rail link.\n\nWhile Biden's administration called it a \"game-changer\" for U.S. investment in Africa, it's little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, with China dominant in mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world's cobalt , with most heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe rely on.\n\nMichelle Gavin, a former adviser on Africa to Obama, said the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend.\n\nThe Lobito Corridor was \"not just about trying to blunt China, but trying to imagine, OK, what does it look like if we actually were to show up in a more serious way?\" she said. \"It's one project. It's one good idea. And I'm very glad we're doing it. It's not enough.\"\n\nLobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola's long and strong ties with Beijing .\n\nThe Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola , turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola's civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year.\n\nThe visit will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America's value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden's trip to criticize the Lourenço government's authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while laws have been passed that severely restrict freedoms, according to rights groups.\n\n___\n\nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThis morning, the White House announced that President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 men on federal death row to life without parole. The historic move came shortly after a batch of pardons and commutations for hundreds of people convicted of nonviolent crimes, as well as Biden's pardon of his own son. In his official statement, Biden emphasized that \"I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss.\" But he said that his conscience and experience made him \"more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level.\"\n\nThe political wisdom of Biden's lame-duck pardons and commutation jubilee is unclear. It seems likely to me that Republicans will use the details of death-row prisoners' crimes to tar Biden and the Democrats as vaguely approving of torture and murder. Biden himself seemed prepared for that eventuality in his statement, and the recriminations have already begun, despite the fact that life without parole is still a severe punishment: Fair enough; these prisoners' crimes were to a person evil and left scores of families with holes in their lives. Nevertheless, the moral wisdom of Biden's decision is compelling to me. Biden's legacy may be tied up in allegations of corruption and the evident cover-up of his waning health, but he has also secured a place in history as a president of certain mercies, all of which speak of the restraint a sovereign owes his people.\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: In praise of mercy\n\nBiden's decision was a direct response to Donald Trump's 2020 federal execution spree, wherein then-Attorney General Bill Barr directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to resume executions after a 17-year hiatus, then oversaw the deaths of 13 prisoners in six months. Activists and advocates have recently focused on persuading the president to prevent another round of executions on Trump's watch. In emailed remarks, Ruth Friedman, director of the Capital Federal Habeas Project, explained that \"numerous groups and individuals representing a wide array of viewpoints have been calling on the President to take this important step,\" adding that \"there was also a formal clemency application process through the Office of the Pardon Attorney in many cases, and that process includes communications between the DOJ and a range of stakeholders on all sides of the case.\" Among those urging Biden to commute these sentences were the American Civil Liberties Union, Equal Justice USA, the Innocence Project, the Catholic Mobilizing Network, and Pope Francis.\n\nNot every person on federal death row received a commutation. Those who did not were: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombers of 2013; Robert Bowers, the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue shooter; and Dylann Roof, the gunman responsible for the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre that left nine dead. Each case was related to terroristic violence and targeted mass murder. Despite Attorney General Merrick Garland imposing a moratorium on federal executions in 2021, lawyers representing the Department of Justice still defended these death sentences in court; in that respect, it was not surprising that Biden would leave them off of his commutation list. Still, their cases may be tied up in court for the duration of Trump's term, meaning he will likely be unable to execute any of those three in the coming years.\n\nMark Osler: The forgotten tradition of clemency\n\nThe commutations will, then, effectively end the federal death penalty for a generation. \"If you cannot end the death penalty legislatively, this is the way you end it in practice,\" Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project, told me. \"Death-penalty abolitionists will have to hope that by the time the next set of cases makes it to death row and through the appeals process, that there's a new Congress and a differently constituted Supreme Court that will take a serious look at the constitutionality and desirability of the death penalty.\" Dunham added that Biden's moral leadership could enable governors in the country weighing their own commutations, such as Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Governor Gavin Newsom of California.\n\nThe decision sparked relief and gratitude not only for the men of federal death row, but also for members of the public who had urged Biden to commute. Donnie Oliviero, a police officer from Columbus, Ohio, whose partner had been killed by Daryl Lawrence, one of the men whose sentence was commuted by Biden, said in a statement provided after the fact that \"putting to death the person who killed my police partner and best friend would have brought me no peace. The President has done what is right here, and what is consistent with the faith he and I share. Thank you, Mr. President.\" Gary Mohr, the former director of the Ohio Department of Corrections, added that he was \"so grateful to President Biden for taking this step to ensure no federal correctional professionals will face the harm of participating in executions for the foreseeable future.\" For these men, as well as scores of others both on the row and off, Biden has brought about a fraction of peace on Earth, a measure of mercy mild-and a welcome hallelujah."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nIt was a very hard thing for President Joe Biden to do, and it was the right thing for him to do.\n\nBiden announced today that he would step aside as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIn a letter to the nation, America's 46th president said, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President.\"\n\nThe decision by the 81-year-old Biden was very nearly inevitable, as his chances to defeat Donald Trump collapsed and the odds of a Republican landslide victory increased, but its announcement was nevertheless a stunning moment. In an instant, Democrats were liberated from an issue, Biden's age, that had hung like a millstone around their necks. This will unleash an enormous amount of energy within the party. What was looking like a rout is now a race.\n\nThere will be plenty of commentary on what this means for both parties. But I find my thoughts this afternoon going to President Biden and his family-and to this agonizing denouement for a man who was first elected to public office more than half a century ago, at the age of 29.\n\nBiden was clearly reluctant to make this decision; it was in many ways forced upon him, and by a particularly painful process. The party he loved and to which he has dedicated his entire adult life turned on him, including former colleagues and trusted friends. They were right to urge Biden to step aside-it had to be done, and those in Biden's party took no delight in doing it-but from the president's perspective, this felt like a betrayal.\n\nI imagine this triggered Biden's insecurities, the sense that he was never taken as seriously as he should have been. He has created a narrative about himself, and not without reasons, as Comeback Joe. His political career was declared finished multiple times, including in 1987, when he withdrew from the presidential campaign because he was caught plagiarizing the life story of Neil Kinnock; in 2016, when President Barack Obama pushed his own vice president aside in favor of Hillary Clinton; and in 2020, when his campaign was flat on its back until it was resurrected in South Carolina. So it's not surprising that Biden, facing the worst crisis of his political life, would tell himself that this is just another obstacle to overcome, another chance for the scrappy kid from Scranton to prove the experts wrong, and in doing so, it would only add to his legend.\n\nBut this is different. This is a story without a comeback. Persistence, determination, and grit have nothing to do with this. Biden is in the midst of a rapid and irreversible physical and mental decline. This was evident even before the June 27 debate with Trump, but on the CNN stage in Atlanta, his debilities were on excruciating display. Many Americans, including those who have been most supportive of Biden, felt that night should never have been allowed to happen; that those who loved him should have protected Biden from the unforgiving glare of the spotlight; that Biden in this state should have been seen only within the privacy of family, not broadcast to the world.\n\nHis public appearances since then haven't been quite as bad as what we saw on the debate stage, but they have been bad enough.\n\nBiden's withdrawal, then, wasn't simply necessary because he had lost the confidence of the country and even his own party. For him to agree to step aside means, on some level at least, he is acknowledging that he is entering a difficult final chapter of his life. There is grief in that. Coming to that point will of course stir up powerful emotions-denial, anger, bitterness that those he trusted have betrayed him. That isn't true, but it feels true to him, as it might to many of us.\n\nComing to terms with mortality is never easy. We rage against the dying of the light . Many elderly people face the painful moment of letting go, of losing independence and human agency, when they are told by family they have to give up the keys to the car; Biden was told by his party to give up the keys to the presidency. Of course this proud man would fight to hang on.\n\nBut in the end, and to his credit, Joe Biden got to where he needed to be, and not a moment too soon. Staying in the race would have been an act of monumental selfishness. As it is, what he did will be seen as an act of impressive selflessness.\n\nIt's not clear whether Trump can be beaten. Democrats have dug themselves into a deep hole. But at least they now have a fighting chance."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nWe were reminded yet again this past weekend that Joe Biden might be in deep electoral trouble. Once again, hands were wrung.\n\nThis latest bout of alarm was occasioned by a New York Times /Siena College poll showing that only 23 percent of Democratic-primary voters said they are enthusiastic about President Biden's candidacy. Forty-five percent said Biden should not be the party's nominee. And Donald Trump led by five points in a head-to-head matchup.\n\nYes, voters overwhelmingly believe that Biden is too old to be running for another term. He looks old, walks old, and seems not as sharp as he once was. This is not a new story. The premise has been challenged vigorously by the White House-to no avail.\n\nBut there might be more to voters' acrimony toward Biden than just his age. In speaking with Democrats about the president's reelection chances, I often pick up a sharp tone that goes beyond resignation. It sounds more like rage.\n\nSenior citizens are not unpopular, per se. Biden himself was relatively well liked into his 70s, even among those who were not eager to vote for him. Some Democrats might have preferred Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders in past elections, but Biden still inspired a certain fondness.\n\nHelen Lewis: Biden's age is now unavoidable\n\nDemocrats were grateful that he was willing to run against, and able to defeat, Trump in 2020. It's not at all clear that the likes of Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Pete Buttigieg could have pulled that off. Many voters appreciated the relative normalcy Biden brought to the White House after the bedlam of Trump. This gratitude was reflected in the sturdy approval ratings Biden received in the first six months of his term.\n\nBut those numbers have since plummeted. From the high 50s (in early 2021) to the low 40s (in much of 2022 and 2023) to the 30s (36 percent in the Times /Siena poll). Biden's team has expressed bewilderment over this decline, which has coincided with an improved economy. Many pollsters pin the reversal on the bloody U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. But that does not account for Biden's steadily falling fortunes long afterward.\n\nAs a general rule, voters tend not to appreciate late-career politicians when they're trying to stick around. Hillary Clinton was among the most admired leaders in America when she left her post as secretary of state, in early 2013. That esteem eroded considerably when she started seeking a promotion in 2015. Perhaps Biden's turnabout owes to a similar phenomenon: Voters preferred his presidency as a farewell tour more than an endurance run.\n\nEven many of Biden's biggest defenders say privately that they didn't expect him to run again. Biden himself suggested as much. \"Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,\" Biden said at a March 2020 campaign rally in Detroit. He called himself a \"transition candidate.\" Sarah Longwell, the Bulwark publisher who has conducted focus groups across the political spectrum, told me last September: \"It seems pretty implicit in the way voters talk that they didn't expect him to be a two-term president.\"\n\nRead: So much for Biden the bridge president\n\nI'm struck when I speak with exasperated Biden voters by how often they bring up the \"bridge\" quote and the \"transition candidate\" line. This suggests that they viewed their past support for Biden as an emergency proposition-and that his ongoing presence violates an implied bargain. Sure, politicians are always trying to keep their options open. But you can understand how voters might feel bait-and-switched by Biden's refusal to go away.\n\nIt's easy to sympathize with an old-timer reluctant to give up something he loves. In Biden's case, though, the stakes are potentially catastrophic. By running again-despite his age, despite his low approval ratings, despite his poor showing in the polls against Trump-Biden could be engaging in one of the most selfish, hubristic, and potentially destructive acts ever undertaken by an American president. If he winds up losing, that's all anyone will remember him for. Bill Maher has said Biden could go down as the \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the presidency.\" Or of democracy.\n\nLarge majorities of Americans don't want to see Trump back in the White House. Many are terrified at the prospect-with extremely good reason. Biden has put them in an incredibly dangerous position. But the more unpopular Biden becomes, the more stubborn he appears.\n\nJonathan V. Last: Biden is still the Democrats' best bet for November\n\nMany of Biden's defenders say it's too late to do anything about this predicament. \"Democrats are increasingly getting very, very vocal in their defense of Biden,\" the Brookings Institution's Elaine Kamarck, a member of the Democratic National Committee, told The New York Times recently. \"The guy's a good guy. He's not senile. He's made good choices. The economy's the best economy in the world. I mean, shut up. Let's get behind this guy.\"\n\nI'm no political-messaging expert, but the shut-up-and-get-behind-this-guy approach seems a tad off-putting. Maybe it is too late to do anything. Or is it, really? The persistence of the question signals an enduring market for a better option. At the very least, voters seem less than thrilled with this situation. A lot of them blame Biden for it.\n\nThe plane has taken off. It is clearly sputtering. The pilot is not saying much. When he does, he sounds shaky. He is not inspiring confidence. A solid majority of passengers would much rather someone else were at the controls. They have voiced this concern repeatedly. (For the record, the Federal Aviation Administration's compulsory retirement age for commercial pilots is 65.)\n\nBut the flight attendants keep telling us it's too late. The plane's already in the air. And this is the only captain we have available. Trust us, in private he's in peak form. He's not senile .\n\nPlease remain seated, and keep your seat belts fastened."

      "text": "'I Think It's Happening'\n\nThe lone senator who has called on Biden to withdraw is growing confident that the president will leave the race.\n\nNearly from the moment President Joe Biden walked off the Atlanta debate stage three weeks ago, Senator Peter Welch of Vermont has been trying-first gently, then much more directly-to get him to end his reelection bid. He now believes that effort is working.\n\n\"I think it's happening,\" he told me by phone this morning. More than 20 House Democrats have publicly pushed Biden to withdraw. For now, Welch is the only senator calling for him to step aside. But the party is rapidly turning against Biden.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee yesterday paused plans to nominate him early by virtual roll call, and last night, reports emerged that a trio of party leaders-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi-each told Biden in separate private conversations that his nomination would jeopardize the Democrats' chances to win this fall. Former President Barack Obama, perhaps Biden's most helpful ally to this point, has reportedly told Democrats that Biden needs to reconsider his candidacy. Shortly before I spoke with Welch this morning, a House Democrat told me, on the condition of anonymity, that party leaders were encouraging members to go public with their concerns about Biden's viability.\n\nRead: The end of Biden's candidacy approaches\n\nBiden, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 yesterday, has insisted that he won't quit the race. But Welch thinks this could change soon. \"The evidence that he's looking for about his prospects is starting to come in and become irrefutable,\" Welch said. \"So he'll have to weigh that and make the decision that he thinks is in the best interest of the country. I'm confident he will. And I think that decision is that he steps aside.\"\n\nIf Biden does withdraw, Welch told me he does not want the president to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. An open process to determine the Democratic nominee, he said, would be better. \"I don't want a coronation of anyone,\" Welch said. \"I don't think that would sit well with Democrats.\"\n\nOur conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nRussell Berman : You are still the only senator who has called on President Biden to step aside. What needs to happen right now?\n\nSenator Peter Welch : I think it's happening, actually. You're seeing more and more concern by loyal Democrats, longtime supporters of the president. You're seeing a poll recently that only one-third of Democrats believe he should stay in the race. You're seeing more private and public expressions of apprehension about what awaits us if we don't change our candidate.\n\nThe trajectory of this has just gotten more intense since the debate, and day by day, I think the pressure is ramping up, because the evidence is continuing to come out that not only do we have a very significant prospect of losing the presidency, but it could do real damage to our prospects to take the House and maintain the Senate.\n\nBerman : It sounds like at this moment you are confident the Democrats will nominate someone other than Joe Biden?\n\nWelch : I strongly believe that's in our best interest. This is something that I've always felt is true about Joe Biden: When he's had to make difficult decisions, whether it was at some personal or political expense and challenge for him, at the end of the day, he's always made that decision on the basis of what's best for the country.\n\nHe is a very, very determined person, and his determination has been a reason he's been so resilient. So I'm not surprised that he's hanging in the way he is. He's faced adversity in the past and overcome it, but I think that the evidence that he's looking for about his prospects is starting to come in and become irrefutable. So he'll have to weigh that and make the decision that he thinks is in the best interest of the country. I'm confident he will. And I think that decision is that he steps aside.\n\nRead: Biden has failed to halt the revolt\n\nBerman : Did you hear from either close Biden aides or other senators after you made your call for him to step aside?\n\nWelch : Well, I didn't hear from the Biden campaign, but we gave them a heads-up. But my colleagues share my concern. Each of us has to make their own decision about how to express that, whether publicly or privately. Each of us has had to wrestle with the question of which uncertainty is less risky, the uncertainty of winning if we stick with Biden or the uncertainty of what happens if we have to get a new nominee. And of course, there's deep affection in the Senate in particular for Joe Biden, personally and politically. But what I do know is that there's widespread concern among all of us about his prospects and about what that'll do to our prospects of keeping the Senate Democratic.\n\nBerman : About 20 Democrats in the House have publicly called on Biden to step aside. As of this hour, you are still the only one to do so in the Senate, although some others have expressed their concerns. Why is it that no other senators have taken that step?\n\nWelch : I can tell you why I did. My view was that the debate profoundly changed the dynamic of the race in ways that are very adverse to our prospects. As time has gone on, there's more expression from Democrats [asking] Why is Biden stubbornly hanging on, given the age issue and given the poll numbers? I saw it getting worse, not better, and that's why I acted. My colleagues saw the same thing we all saw. They all have to make their own judgments. Many of them have close personal connections to President Biden, and it causes them to want to be extraordinarily respectful to him personally and also his political accomplishments. I think people are assessing the risk. There is a risk in changing our nominee, but there's also a risk in keeping our nominee. But what I'm getting a sense of is there's more significant expressions, even if in private, of candid, gloomy assessments of our prospects with President Biden staying at the top of the ticket.\n\nBerman : Let's say he does step aside. What should happen immediately next?\n\nWelch : An open process to allow delegates to make the decision about who the candidate will be. We've got good candidates. Our goal has to be to pick the candidate who is the strongest candidate to beat [former President Donald] Trump. That's our goal, and that should be our guide. And we've got a number of people, in my view, that could fit that bill.\n\nBerman : It sounds like you would not want Biden to step aside and then wholeheartedly endorse Vice President Harris. You don't want there to be a coronation of her?\n\nWelch : I don't want a coronation of anyone. It's not about a coronation of the vice president. It's to make our candidate the strongest possible candidate. I do think that even though it'll be a truncated process, those candidates should go through that process. We have never had a coronation. So I don't think that would sit well with Democrats, and I think that all the folks who are mentioned are better served. Their strength in their campaign is better served if the nomination results from an open process.\n\nBerman : Besides Harris, who would you want to see put their hat into the ring?\n\nWelch : I'm not going to say at this point. We've got to get through this first. We all know who the names are. There are so many good folks out there.\n\nBerman : If it is Harris, do you think she can beat Trump and have a better chance than Biden?\n\nWelch : I do."

      "text": "Hunter Biden Was Unfairly Prosecuted\n\nHis father did the right thing.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nCritics have argued that President Joe Biden's pardon of his son Hunter was political nepotism-bad for the country, selfish, the height of privilege. But the actual story is the very opposite of nepotism: Hunter Biden was treated worse than an ordinary citizen because of his family connections. It's good for the country when the president acts against injustice; President Biden rightly condemned the injustice of his son's prosecution. His pardon was necessary to prevent Donald Trump's Justice Department from targeting Hunter for years to come.\n\nI worked as a federal criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for 12 years, during which time I supervised and prosecuted many gun and tax cases. President Biden argues that the gun and tax charges Hunter was convicted of should never have been brought. I agree. When I served as deputy chief for the Southern District of New York's Criminal Division, my job was to approve charging and non-prosecution decisions on gun and tax cases. I would not have approved the felony gun and tax charges brought against Hunter Biden; such charges are rarely-if ever-brought in similar circumstances.\n\nProsecutors charged Hunter with lying about his drug addiction when he purchased a firearm, and with possessing that firearm while he was a drug addict. They were wrong to do so. As a first-time offender with no criminal record or history of violent behavior who possessed a gun for only 11 days and didn't use it, he did not pose a public-safety risk to warrant federal gun charges. The public interest is served by treating addiction, not weaponizing it. In a gross display of addiction-shaming, prosecutors used Hunter's own words from his memoir about overcoming drug addiction against him at trial. They forced his former romantic partners to testify and dredge up details of his addiction. The prosecution's trial presentation was cruel and humiliating.\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: Any parent would have done the same\n\nNor should prosecutors have charged Hunter with failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes during the period when he suffered from drug addiction. The IRS's primary goal-to recover unpaid taxes-was satisfied when Hunter fully repaid the taxes he owed with interest and penalty. Felony tax charges are unwarranted here given that the tax amount is not exorbitant, his nonpayment occurred while he was using illegal drugs, and he fully repaid his taxes. A civil resolution or tax-misdemeanor charges would have been appropriate.\n\nNotably, there had been a fair non-felony plea deal between Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss and Hunter, but congressional Republicans worked to crush it. They opened an investigation into the DOJ's plea negotiations, held hearings with testimony from IRS case agents and prosecutors, and attempted to intervene in the case before the plea. Amid intense political pressure from Republicans, Weiss killed the deal, requested and obtained special-counsel status, and charged Hunter with gun and tax felonies. As President Biden stated in announcing Hunter's pardon, a number of his opponents in Congress took credit for bringing political pressure on the process. President Biden is correct that Hunter was treated differently; most criminal defendants do not have members of Congress interfering in their cases to lobby for harsher treatment. That is not how our criminal-justice system is supposed to work.\n\nIf there were reason to believe that Hunter had committed any of the more serious crimes that reportedly were under investigation-bribery, money laundering, or illegal foreign lobbying, I would be far less sympathetic to the president's pardon. But Hunter was never charged with these more serious offenses. Weiss investigated Hunter for six years; that's an unusually long time for a criminal investigation focused on one individual. If after six years Weiss still does not have a real case against Hunter, then it doesn't exist. (Complicating matters is the fact that this past February, Weiss charged Alexander Smirnov-a former FBI informant and the GOP's star witness against Hunter-for falsely accusing President Biden and Hunter of receiving bribes from Ukrainian businessmen.)\n\nJonathan Chait: Biden's unpardonable hypocrisy\n\nThe absence of a credible case against Hunter does not mean that a Trump DOJ wouldn't bring bogus charges against him. During his campaign, Trump vowed that, if elected, he would appoint a special prosecutor to \"go after\" \"the Biden crime family.\" In nominating Pam Bondi for attorney general and Kash Patel for FBI director, Trump has further signaled how serious he is about using the DOJ as an instrument of personal revenge. At the 2020 Republican convention, Bondi argued that President Biden and his son were corrupt. Recently, Patel proposed using the law \"criminally or civilly\" against Trump's political rivals. When he announced the pardon, President Biden stated, \"In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me-and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\" He's right.\n\nNow is not the time to cling to norms that Trump is poised to shatter. Political prosecutions are coming, and I fear that our democratic institutions will not withstand them.\n\nThat's why President Biden's pardon should not be his last. President Biden should use his pardon power to protect others from political prosecution just as he used it to protect his son. He should condemn Trump's plan for political prosecutions. He should pardon Trump's political enemies preemptively to stymie the Trump DOJ's politically motivated investigations. In particular, public servants who have drawn Trump's ire for doing their job should not have to spend precious time and money defending themselves against Trump's lies. Nor should they have to endure the reputational hit, the safety risk, or the emotional toll of political prosecutions. President Biden alone has the power to stop other needless political prosecutions before they begin. He should use it."

      "text": "Biden Must Resign\n\nIf the president wants to protect American democracy, he should hand over his office to Kamala Harris.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nJoe Biden must resign the presidency. The last person to do so was Richard Nixon, who left in disgrace after abusing the powers of his office. Nixon had to resign because he led an assault on American democracy. Biden must resign for the opposite reason: to give American democracy its best chance of surviving.\n\nThe American right has spent every day since Biden was nominated in 2020 presenting him as an incompetent, doddering old fool, incapable of discharging the responsibilities of the office. Biden's task at the first presidential debate, on Thursday, was to dismiss those allegations as mere smears, as he did in 2020. Instead, he confirmed that he has aged dramatically over the past four years. Biden was very old to begin with, and at the debate he appeared far more visibly diminished than he has in the past.\n\nRead: It wasn't just the debate\n\nSubsequent reporting has confirmed that Biden's condition is worse than Democrats had been willing to publicly admit. Yesterday, The New York Times reported that \"in the weeks and months before President Biden's politically devastating performance on the debate stage in Atlanta, several current and former officials and others who encountered him behind closed doors noticed that he increasingly appeared confused or listless, or would lose the thread of conversations.\" Similar claims have been reported elsewhere.\n\nNow, perhaps it really was just a bad night, and Biden remains as sharp as he was in 2020. If that's the case, then he should be able to make the kind of public appearances necessary to quell these complaints. If he proves himself capable of doing so, I'll happily acknowledge error. But after a week of disastrous coverage about his mental fitness, he has not. That is unavoidably ominous.\n\nBiden was behind in the polls prior to the debate. A strong performance might have calmed fears about his age rather than confirming them, and although it remains early, polls taken after the debate show his support softening. As the political scientist Lee Drutman writes , \"Biden's debate performance has, of course, cemented the number one concern that most voters have about re-electing him: he is way too old to be president. Once a negative impression sets in, it takes much more work to dislodge that impression.\"\n\nThe Trumpified Supreme Court's decision on Monday granting imperial powers to any president unscrupulous enough to use them has raised the stakes of the election tremendously, and they were already too high. As it stands, Donald Trump's advisers are already indicating that a Trump victory in November would result in not the inauguration of a president but the coronation of a caesar . If Trump wins, he will have the presidency Nixon wanted, one in which nothing the president does is illegal. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, which aspires to staff a future Trump administration, has made clear that the MAGA right contemplates using this newfound imperial power to employ political violence against its opposition. \"We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,\" Roberts told the far-right network Real America News. Trump's supporters seem less to wish to govern than to rule indefinitely by force, and they believe that the Court has given them its blessing.\n\nRead: Something has gone deeply wrong at the Supreme Court\n\nFor that reason, Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas on Tuesday called for Biden to withdraw from the race . But that is insufficient. If Biden is incapable of campaigning because of his deterioration, he is also not capable of being president. And if he is incapable of being president, then he should resign and allow Vice President Kamala Harris to take the oath of office.\n\nWhoever holds the office should be in full control of their faculties. It does no good to point out that Trump was deranged but energetic at the debate, that he rambles incoherently, that he is a criminal, an authoritarian, and a racist. It is obviously, incontestably true that a senile president with a competent and ethical staff would be preferable to an authoritarian one who wants to fill his administration with guys who sound like school-shooter manifestos. But unfortunately Trump is propped up by a cult of personality whose members will not abandon him no matter what he does, and if Biden is unfit to debate and campaign, then he is also not fit to govern.\n\nThe earlier Biden resigns, the faster the Democratic Party can move to reunite behind the new nominee and concentrate its efforts on keeping Trump from returning to the White House. Harris would become the party's presumptive nominee, enjoying the prestige and advantages of incumbency. She is also the only candidate who can legally access the financial war chest the Biden campaign has amassed. As Brian Beutler writes , \"it's impossible to identify the most prudent path forward with certainty.\" There is no clear way to know if Harris is a politically riskier option than Biden. But if Biden's mental state is as bad as it appeared at the debate, then there is no other choice.\n\nSome Democrats fear the prospect of a Harris candidacy-perhaps even enough to wish for Biden to hang on until the election, despite the dangers. They worry that she will only exacerbate the appeal of Trump's implicit promise to restore racial and gender hierarchies. Indeed, Trump's brain trust designed his 2016 campaign around the belief that the recent Republican nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney had failed to mobilize demoralized white voters because they had not been overtly racist enough , and that the path to victory lay through deliberate racial polarization.\n\nGiven Biden's condition, the Trump campaign will try to stoke irrational fears about a potential Harris presidency anyway. And the hypothetical, driven as it is by lurid right-wing fantasies, will necessarily be worse than the reality. That is, Harris can begin to defuse apocalyptic right-wing arguments against her-that she is some kind of left-wing radical who will render the country unrecognizable-by governing wisely for the remainder of the term. The strongest rebuttal to the racist caricatures of Barack Obama was always his own public conduct. Besides, as The New York Times ' Jamelle Bouie notes , passing over Harris with a brokered convention or some other process would also risk demobilizing key Democratic constituencies by confirming the worst caricatures of the party: that since Obama, the party is content to have ethnic minorities as foot soldiers, surrogates, and subordinates, but not as leaders.\n\nIf Biden merely steps aside as the nominee, then the Trump campaign can play on racist fears of what a Harris presidency might bring, in a dark echo of the lurid 19th-century warnings of \"Negro domination.\" The phrase DEI president will be on Fox News faster than the Millenium Falcon can do the Kessel Run. But if Harris actually governs the country-albeit for a short time-then those warnings become less believable. Americans will be able to judge her intentions for themselves. In picking a running mate, Harris should follow Obama's example when he chose Biden, and select a moderate who can help assuage the inevitable smear campaign she will face, charging that she is a closet radical. Harris, by her own example, is best positioned to defuse any race-baiting in which the Trump campaign engages. Although a new vice president would have to be confirmed by the House and Senate, rendering her choice vulnerable to Republican obstruction, the Senate rules can be altered to eliminate the chance to filibuster such a choice. The House is a bigger risk, given the GOP majority's fealty to Trump.\n\nFrom the November 2023 issue: The Kamala Harris problem\n\nBiden's inner circle will probably feel that this is all deeply unfair to him. After all, the president's domestic-policy success has been underappreciated. Wages are up , unemployment is low , manufacturing is increasing , the economy has been growing for four years , and the alternative-energy industry that may mitigate the impact of climate change and divest America from its dependence on fossil fuels is booming. Biden has been an enthusiastic supporter and protector of organized labor. The United States had the strongest post-pandemic economic recovery of any Western nation, and although the supply shock that followed the pandemic induced a period of painful inflation, even that has begun to subside, with wages outpacing inflation .\n\nIf the basis of Trumpism were simply economic rather than social and political, Biden would be something close to the president Trumpist intellectuals said they wanted. He has put money in the pockets of low-wage workers, revitalized American industry, and, thanks to recent agreements with Mexico , stemmed a rise in illegal immigration that has been the subject of hysterical right-wing propaganda. Even crime is down dramatically from the Trump era. But Trumpism is about offering status, hierarchy, and domination to its rank-and-file voters in exchange for an upward redistribution of power and income to its elites , and that is not what Biden is offering.\n\nI understand that many liberals and Democrats feel that the political press has been out to destroy Biden. I've observed that newsrooms have moved right in framing and tone since 2020, likely a reaction to the common criticism that they were too harsh on Trump and too supportive of the protests that followed George Floyd's death. The coverage incentives have also shifted-the Biden era has been bad for the media business, but panicked, highly educated liberals are loyal readers, subscribers, and sharers. But more than that, there's the simple bias toward novelty: Compared with Biden's apparent deterioration, Trumpist criminality and authoritarianism is old news. These incentives, which have shaped the negative coverage of the Biden presidency, will not entirely change if Harris assumes the office; she will face her own gantlet of negative coverage and harsh scrutiny, some of which is a necessary part of running for president.\n\nBut the simple fact remains that if one believes Biden cannot campaign or debate successfully, then he cannot run the country presently. The Constitution contemplates a scenario in which someone would need to take the place of a president who is so diminished, and that someone is the vice president. Biden should step aside from both the campaign and the presidency, and allow Harris to take her best shot at saving the country from those who would destroy it."

      "text": "Other Presidents Have Retired in March of Their Reelection Year\n\nBut it didn't work out for their parties.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nWith more than 100,000 people casting a vote against the incumbent president in the Democratic primary last week in Michigan, a swing state essential to his reelection, the wisdom of Joe Biden's decision to face voters in November is again under intense scrutiny. Historically speaking, it isn't too late for President Joe Biden to voluntarily drop his reelection bid. And he must know it: Two other Democratic presidents in his lifetime surprised the nation by announcing in March of an election year that they would not seek a new term.\n\nThe enormous challenges that confronted Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson-wars in Korea and Vietnam-have little substantive resemblance to Biden's current predicament. But the question Biden now faces is the same: Should he risk his presidential legacy by seeking another term in office? The events of 1952 and 1968 are as much a guide to making what is a hard, lonely decision as they are a warning: Having lost the advantages that incumbency incurs, the Democratic Party lost both of the elections that followed, and Republicans took the presidency.\n\nEliot A. Cohen: Step aside, Joe Biden\n\nThe Korean War, which began with North Korea's surprise attack on South Korea in 1950, would make Truman-the winner of a come-from-behind stunner of an election in 1948- a deeply unpopular president . By 1952, the war had become a stalemate. Truman was 67, older than Franklin D. Roosevelt had been when he died in office in 1945, but in good enough health that his age was not considered a political liability. Truman, however, was ready to end his presidency.\n\nAlthough Truman was publicly noncommittal in January 1952 about seeking reelection, many insiders knew even before the start of the election year that he was thinking about retirement and his legacy. In October 1951, he had met with Chief Justice Fred Vinson and his former chief aide Clark Clifford to offer Vinson his full support if Vinson left the Supreme Court to run for president. In late January, Truman wrote to his beloved only child, Margaret, \"Your dad will never be reckoned among the 'Great' but you can be sure he did his 'level best' and gave all he had to his country.\" Meanwhile, also in January, Truman confided in one of the ambitious men around him, Secretary of Commerce Averell Harriman, that he was likely not going to run.\n\nTruman understood that his political power was eroding. By early 1952, according to polls at the time, he was not even the choice of most of his party, and on January 23, Senator Estes Kefauver, a Democrat from Tennessee, announced that he would challenge Truman for the nomination. (Truman was the last possible presidential candidate to whom the Twenty-Second Amendment did not apply.) But giving up on the prospect of reelection was hard. On February 18 , Truman gathered his inner circle for a dinner to discuss what he should do. His advisers were split. The characteristically decisive Truman waited to announce his intentions and courted additional political embarrassment by doing poorly in the first primary. Earlier that year, the politicos of New Hampshire had changed the rules of their first-in-the-nation primary to let voters choose presidential candidates directly, as opposed to electing delegates to vote later at the party's convention. Perhaps Truman hoped to go out with a win. On March 11, however, Truman lost to Kefauver. A little more than two weeks later, on March 29, Truman announced his retirement. As it turned out, neither Kefauver nor the president's favorite, Vinson, became the nominee. The governor of Illinois, Adlai Stevenson II, would lead Truman's party that November.\n\nLike Truman, Lyndon Johnson began considering retirement months before he made his decision and went public with it, and also like Truman, his base of voters was shrinking because of an unpopular war in Asia. But Johnson's process was stealthier, more dramatic, and more emotional than Truman's.\n\nIn Johnson's mind, the question of his retirement was linked directly to what to do about his unpopular war. Johnson was convinced that Hanoi would never enter into serious negotiations with Washington if North Vietnamese leaders believed that Johnson was seeking only political gain in a presidential election year and not a lasting settlement. In late 1967, about a year before the election, Johnson asked General William Westmoreland what effect his retirement would have on troop morale in Vietnam. (Westmoreland assured him that the troops would keep fighting.) In mid-January 1968, Johnson vowed Horace Busby, his favorite speechwriter, to secrecy, telling him, \"I have made up my mind. I can't get peace in Vietnam and be president too.\" Johnson asked him to write a secret coda-announcing his retirement-to the State of the Union address that Johnson was to give on January 17. The statement was written, but Johnson didn't use it.\n\nBy late March 1968, he faced two democratic challengers, Senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy. In the New Hampshire primary, the protest vote against Johnson was nearly 42 percent. He once again enlisted Busby to write a secret retirement announcement, which he would append to a national TV address he was to give on the night of March 31, about Vietnam. In the weeks since the State of the Union, the president had settled a debate among his advisers in favor of offering Hanoi a halt in U.S. bombing \"where 90 percent of the people live\" in return for the start of serious negotiations. He didn't poll his chief advisers about coupling that new policy with a retirement announcement. But for Johnson, in the words of the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who would later assist him with his memoirs, \"by coupling this initiative with withdrawal from the presidential race, he made sure that it would not be read as a political trick. If, on the other hand, it failed to produce negotiations, at least Johnson had laid the groundwork for further escalation.\"\n\nPresidential families play a very important role in these moments of decision. Richard Nixon, the only president to resign in office, was briefly talked out of resigning when he raised the possibility with his family in the first days of August 1974. On March 31, after Johnson told his family over lunch what he was considering, his daughters argued passionately that he stay in the race. \"Both of them were emotional, crying and distraught,\" Lady Bird Johnson recalled in her diary. \"What does this do to our servicemen?\" she recalled them wondering. Both of the Johnson daughters had husbands in the U.S. military. The first lady's reaction was more guarded: \"And I, what did I feel? ... so uncertain of the future that I would not dare to try to persuade him one way or the other.\" There is reason to believe that the first lady didn't need much persuading. Lady Bird couldn't pass the portrait of Woodrow Wilson in the White House without thinking of the series of strokes Wilson had barely survived under the stress of ending World War I, leaving him incapacitated. Johnson had already suffered one massive heart attack that nearly killed him in 1957. When he ultimately decided not to run, Lady Bird wrote a friend, \"I know what I always think in front of the Wilson portrait. In that face you see the toll the office and the times extracted.\"\n\nResistance from his family and some of his advisers weakened Johnson's certainty that he should drop his reelection bid. He told Busby-who, as the keeper of the final secret statement, stayed in the White House residence for more than 12 hours before Johnson uttered the words-that he himself wouldn't know whether he'd go ahead with it until he reached the last line of his prepared text on the teleprompter. During the hours before the speech, Busby became the focus of those who doubted the wisdom of LBJ leaving the race. \"Mr. Busby, why? Tell me why,\" Johnson's daughter Luci asked. As Johnson delayed the decision, he thought about Truman's decision and asked for a copy of Truman's March 29, 1952, speech. Until the moment Johnson made the announcement, around 9:40 that evening, the decision to step down and when was not fully settled in his mind.\n\nEven though the wars that bedeviled them were eventually ended by their successors, neither Truman nor Johnson lived to see their legacy much enhanced by the manner of their withdrawal from public life. Their presidential reputations-first Truman's, lately Johnson's-would grow dramatically with time, but not because of how Korea and Vietnam ended. More relevant to 2024 is the fact that, in both cases, the president's party lost that fall.\n\nBiden's unique challenge is that his legacy-as he likely defines it-depends on a Democrat winning this November. His candidacy in 2020 rested on a promise and an expectation that he would return us to some sense of political sanity and constitutional stability. Following Nixon's resignation over Watergate, Gerald Ford famously said, to the everlasting annoyance of Nixonians, \"Our long national nightmare is over.\" And it was. But the same cannot be said today, three years after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, with the chief instigator of the insurrection about to be renominated by the Republican Party. The nightmare could quite easily resume.\n\nPresident Biden certainly must know, as most every octogenarian does, that he hasn't as much juice in the tank as he did even a decade ago. Special Counsel Robert Hur's unkind cut was only a reminder of the obvious. And like Johnson, Biden must have a nagging sense that what he decides this spring will profoundly affect his legacy. Johnson ultimately, painfully, concluded that leaving would do more for the country and his legacy than staying. But what about Biden?\n\nDamon Linker: Democrats should pick a new presidential candidate now\n\nShould Biden run and lose to Donald Trump, his mandate to stabilize our country will be seen as ending in failure. Memories of his consistent efforts to lead a dignified presidency-with many remarkable legislative achievements, some bipartisan, and a strong economy-will be replaced by a caricature of a stubborn old man who clung to power with disastrous results.\n\nNevertheless, Biden remembers what happened after Truman and Johnson made their big retirement announcements. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower beat the Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson. In 1968, Vice President Hubert Humphrey was defeated by Nixon. Even in less fraught times, the project of preparing for presidential succession within a party is usually unsuccessful. In 1988, George H. W. Bush briefly revived the small legacy of Martin Van Buren, Andrew Jackson's vice president and successor, because of the rarity of a vice president moving directly to the presidency through an election. There is no reason to believe that incumbency as the No. 2 would be enough to carry Kamala Harris to victory in what seems likely to be a close election against Trump. Had Robert Kennedy not been assassinated, there might be an example of someone outside the White House succeeding for the party after a late withdrawal, but sadly, we will never know what might have been in 1968.\n\nPresidential prediction isn't a science, especially when you have an N of only two. Given the risks of political failure suggested by the examples of two titans of his political childhood, Biden may, with reason, decide that the odds of success are better staying in. But these aren't great odds either, and, unfortunately, so much rides on them."

Ronny Jackson said a House panel will probe whether former White House doctor Kevin O'Connor concealed former President Joe Biden's mental decline.\n\nJackson, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee's subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, told the New York Post in a story published Friday that the GOP \"will look into whether or not we actually had a shadow presidency for a large part of [Biden's] term\" and that O'Connor \"will absolutely, positively be implicated in the cover-up of this.

Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump before he was elected to Congress in 2020. In 2021, a report by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General stated that Jackson had \"engaged in inappropriate conduct involving the use of alcohol\" on two presidential trips, and \"made sexual and denigrating statements about one of his female medical subordinates to another of his subordinates.\"\n\nJackson alleged O'Connor, whom he said he's known for a long time, \"would do or say anything to cover up and protect [the Biden family], regardless of what it meant professionally.\"\n\nBiden, the oldest president in U.S. history when he left office at 82, faced growing questions about his fitness for office as his term wore on. O'Connor wrote in a February 2024 memo that the president \"continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.\"\n\nBy avoiding sit-down interviews and large press conferences , the president's apparent mental decline only became apparent during his catastrophic performance in the televised debate with Trump last June. He relinquished the Democratic nomination to former Vice President Kamala Harris on July 21.\n\nThe move spurred Republicans to question whether his team had concealed signs of his supposed mental decline and were doing the president's job for him.\n\nIn July, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for White House aides, including O'Connor, to discuss Biden's cognitive state, but it is not clear whether he responded to the voluntary request.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nGot a tip?

Trump looks in the drawer and finds a letter. pic.twitter.com/2kTk2nZBRT\n\nAlthough Trump opted not to share its contents on camera, he told reporters later on Tuesday that it was a \"very nice letter.\"\n\n\"It was a little bit of an inspirational type of letter,\" he said, according to The Hill . \"Enjoy it, do a good job. Important, very important. How important the job is.\"\n\nIn 2021, Trump left his own letter to Biden, who later called it \"shockingly gracious\" but decided to keep the exact contents private, according to Politico.\n\nObama's message to Trump in 2017 was the longest presidential transition letter on record. He politely reminded his political adversary of the responsibility \"to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.\"\n\nPerhaps the most famous president-to-president missive is George H.W. Bush's note to Bill Clinton, which is often upheld as a paradigm of cross-aisle decorum.\n\n\"I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described,\" Bush wrote. \"There will be very tough times, made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I'm not a very good one to give advice; but just don't let the critics discourage you or push you off course.\"\n\nThe letter tradition was started in 1989 by Ronald Reagan, who wrote to Bush, his former vice president, \"George, I treasure the memories we share and I wish you all the very best.

That's what led her to join the Air Force, where she served with distinction, and it's what compelled her to bravely leak to the U.S. press that Russia had interfered in our 2016 presidential election.\n\nThat's likely the reason you may remember her name, and why she is the subject of two major Hollywood productions- Reality starring Sydney Sweeney ; Winner starring Emilia Jones, Connie Britton and Zach Galifinakis-as well as a documentary directed and produced by Sonia Kennebeck.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA 25-year-old veteran who spent most of her time outside of work at CrossFit or rescuing stray dogs, my daughter was an unlikely criminal. And unlike others convicted of similar offences, she was prosecuted under the Espionage Act , in a very rare and highly politicized move which led to her receiving the harshest sentence of anyone whose leaked classified documents in U.S. history: five years in prison.\n\nIt is very rare that leakers are prosecuted, especially to the extent Reality has been; when they are, as many have suggested, it is politically motivated. It's hard to argue otherwise in Reality's case. Her actions put no one's life at risk nor did they create leverage for any foreign enemy to the United States. The Justice Department was determined to make an example of her.\n\nClemency and pardons are well precedented for convicted leakers, meanwhile. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , was fully pardoned for his role in leaking CIA officer Valerie Plame's identity. Samuel L. Morison, a former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst, was pardoned by President Bill Clinton for charges related to espionage and unauthorized disclosure of classified information. And Chelsea Manning , the former United States Army soldier who was also charged under the Espionage Act after disclosing nearly 750,000 sensitive documents , had her 35-year prison sentence commuted by President Barack Obama shortly before he left office.

Joe Biden left this country in an economic disaster,\" she added.\n\nThe \"recession cover-up\" has been widely debated among MAGA circles online since the markets tanked.\n\nJessica Tarlov, co-host of The Five on Fox News, posted: \"Strange that Biden never had these crappy numbers when it was actually his economy.\"\n\nStrange that Biden never had these crappy numbers when it was actually his economy. https://t.co/5CoVHRPLxX\n\n\"Now that Biden is gone, all of the economic data from 2024 is being revised to show what really happened.

And it's a pattern-consumer sentiment, job growth, and the stock market have all declined since Trump inherited the best-performing economy in the world from Biden.\n\n\"The top reason why is that Trump raised tariff taxes on middle-class families and businesses large and small-which Joe Biden explicitly warned Trump would hurt the economy.

      "text": "Vengeful Biden Uses Century-Old Law to Thwart Trump Plan\n\nReporter\n\nIt looks like Joe Biden will be a thorn in Donald Trump's side long after he vacates the Oval Office, after the outgoing president used a pair of aging laws to effectively troll his successor.\n\nJust a day after using a 72-year-old law to stymie Trump's ambitions to explore offshore drilling opportunities, Biden is at it again-this time deploying a piece of legislation more than a century old to hamper his old foe's plans.\n\nThe ace up \"Sleepy Joe's\" sleeve this time proved he's not so slow, as he invoked the 119-year-old Antiquities Act to protect a vast area of land in southern California, where the Colorado and Mojave Deserts come together.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe area, now known as Chuckwalla National Monument, spans over 624,000 acres of Bureau of Land Management-controlled public lands, and becomes the largest tract of protected land in the continental U.S. The Sáttítla Highlands National Monuments, in the north of the state, will also come into existence, creating a total protected area of nearly 850,000 acres, according a White House statement Tuesday.\n\nTrump took issue with the Antiquities Act in April 2017, when he decreed an executive reversal instructing the Department of the Interior to review then-President Obama's designations of national monuments. Trump was seeking to free up over 553 million acres of natural areas that Obama had protected from development-plus 219 million more set aside by Presidents Clinton and Bush.\n\nRyan Bidwell, Senior Director of Conservation at the Conservation Lands Foundation, told the Daily Beast at the time that the step was \"a thinly veiled attempt to turn these lands over to oil and gas drillers and sell them off to corporate interests.\"\n\nBut under Biden's new order, that will become more difficult. \"With today's designations and yesterday's actions to protect the East and West coasts and the Northern Bering Sea from offshore oil and natural gas drilling, President Biden has now protected 674 million acres of U.S. lands and waters,\" a White House statement boasted.\n\nThe move reflects Biden's ambition to leave a green legacy, but it will serve as a bump in the road to Trump's presidential ambitions-even before he takes office.\n\nAnd Trump, speaking at Mar-a-Lago Tuesday, addressed Biden's move. He said: \"They took away 625 million acres of offshore drilling... nobody else does that. I'm going to have it revoked on day one. If we need to we'll go to the courts, if they try to be sneaky... remember this is a man who said he wants the transition to be smooth. You don't do those kind of things.\"\n\n\"We're going to be drilling soon,\" he vowed.\n\nIt comes after Biden invoked the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to prevent new fossil fuel developments off the East and West coasts of the U.S. as well as in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Northern Bering Sea.\n\nThe law gives presidents the power to permanently withdraw parts of the outer continental shelf from future oil and gas leasing-but doesn't include a provision for how another president could revoke such an order. Trump would therefore likely have to get Congress to change the law before he could undo Biden's action.\n\nTrump's incoming press secretary bemoaned the move, saying it was politically motivated. \"This is a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices,\" Karoline Leavitt wrote in a post on X. \"Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom previously said that Trump's \"only interest is pleasing Big Oil CEOs,\" and the incoming president has blasted the state's liberal environmental-led agenda in the past.\n\nBut politics aside, Biden's plans serve to uphold conservation on a jaw-dropping scale. Chuckwalla National Monument will be a capstone action to create the largest corridor of protected lands in the continental United States, covering nearly 18 million acres stretching approximately 600 miles.\n\nIt will be known as the Moab to Mojave Conservation Corridor and will stretch from southwestern Utah to southern California, encompassing areas significant to Tribal Nations and Indigenous peoples-as well as protecting dozens of plant and animal species.\n\nReporter\n\nGot a tip?

And it would have been minimal-there would have been some pushback, but, you know: 'In the interest of the Biden family and President Biden's long and distinguished service to the community, I'm going to commute the sentence.'\"\n\nCarville lamented that Biden's problems are \"all so f---ing self-inflicted.\"\n\n\"I actually feel for Biden, and he knows that he f---ed up,\" he added. \"And he wasn't crooked, he didn't pursue bad policies, he is the most tolerant, loving, caring, non-prejudiced person you could imagine and this is what he's faced with. It's a f---ing shame.\"\n\nDespite singling out Biden in this instance, Carville has also been highly critical of the campaign run by Harris after she took over as the Democratic nominee.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

The full interview with veteran political correspondent Robert Costa will air on CBS News Sunday Morning on August 11.\n\n\"If Trump wins, no I'm not confident at all,\" Biden told Costa, before quickly correcting himself. \"I mean, if Trump loses I'm not confident at all.

As his term draws to a close and amid outrage over the pardon of his son Hunter, advocates are pressuring Biden - who has pardoned thousands who had been convicted of federal drug charges but were not incarcerated at the time of their pardons - to grant clemency to thousands more who are still in prison over cannabis offenses. The president has a chance to atone for his past support of \"tough on crime\" measures, says the Last Prisoner Project's Jason Ortiz. He says Biden has an opportunity of \"correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years\" and should \"extend the same grace and compassion\" he showed his son Hunter \"to all the folks that he helped put in prison to begin with.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nPresident Biden is continuing to face criticism over his decision to issue a sweeping pardon to his son Hunter Biden. But the president's decision has also brought renewed attention to the power of the presidential pardon. Biden is now facing renewed pressure to commute the sentences of death row prisoners and to pardon or grant clemency to political prisoners like Indigenous leader Leonard Peltier, imprisoned in Florida, and the whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. The group Last Prisoner Project is calling on Biden to use his clemency power to free those still incarcerated in federal prison for cannabis crimes.\n\nWe're joined now by Jason Ortiz, director of Strategic Initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project.\n\nThis is very interesting, Jason. I think they say that Hunter Biden has been clean for something like just over five years. His father has openly talked about his son, formerly an addict. And as he faces bipartisan criticism, talk about what you think this is an opening for.\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Sure. So, this is definitely an opening for folks to talk about exactly how expansive we can use the pardon power of the president to make sure that we're correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years when it comes to cannabis crimes. President Biden himself was actually one of the architects of the 1994 crime bill that created a lot of the outrageous sentences that we're now dealing with today.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing that there are over 3,000 federal cannabis prisoners currently incarcerated on cannabis charges, and these are all folks that also have families and have parents and have loved ones. And we have examples, like folks like Jonathan Wall, who is somebody that was a Maryland resident. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for his first offense. And so, while I can understand why the president wants to have compassion for his own son, where we're really getting frustrated is that he's refusing to extend that compassion to all the parents that are currently watching their kids waste away in prison. Mitzi Wall, who works with the organization Freedom Grow, is the mother of Jonathan Wall. She was joining me this past week when we had the congressional press conference, when we were joined by folks like James Clyburn, Congressman James Clyburn, asking for freedom and clemency for folks like Jonathan Wall. And so, that's one example of 3,000 folks that are currently in prison.\n\nSome of the charges are far more egregious. Folks like Edwin Rubis was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison in the '90s. And so, he's someone that hasn't had a Christmas or holidays with his family. He has a son that's 27 years old. He has currently served 27 years of that federal sentence. He hasn't had a single Christmas with his son because of charges that were orchestrated and architected by President Biden, then as senator, in the crime bill. We have folks that are serving life sentences. Ismael Lira, for a trafficking charge, is currently sentenced on a life sentence for the same activity that is now legal across the country in 25 -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Which is what?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : - different states, including - trafficking. And so, that would be the distribution of cannabis. And so, there is a specific differentiation between what President Biden's previous pardons were intended to do, which was only covering things like simple possession, where right now we have folks that are serving decades for trafficking, which is exactly what the hundreds of legal cannabis businesses across the country are currently doing on a regular basis, including right in Washington, D.C. And so, we're now seeing people sitting in prison for decades for the same activity that is currently generating tax revenue for cities and states across the country. We're paying for schools and building bridges with cannabis activity dollars, but still letting folks waste away in prison. And so, while I can definitely understand why a father would want to have compassion for his son and avoid prison time for his son, we're really asking him to extend that same compassion to all the folks that he helped put in prison to begin with.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: [Jason], you mentioned the previous pardons for simple cannabis possession, but that hasn't led to the release of many of those incarcerated individuals. Can you talk about that?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Yeah, absolutely. So, those pardons were for simple possession, for folks that were currently charged on a federal possession charge. And, now, it is very rare for someone to actually serve prison time for a simple possession charge at the federal level. That generally happens to folks - somebody maybe got caught; they were smoking at a national park or some other sort of federal property where they were unaware of it. But there are nobody in prison for simple possession in the federal prison system whatsoever. So, despite his pardoning of 6,000 charges, zero people were released.\n\nHowever, the charges that we're looking to actually have folks released for, things like cultivation of cannabis, sales of cannabis, those are the charges that folks are currently in prison for. And we want him to expand his use of the pardon to cover all cannabis crimes that are now legal in the majority of the country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, and, Jason, apologies, but, Jason, during your press conference last week, you spoke of, quote, \"the heartbreaking number of Latino fathers incarcerated for life or near-life sentences.\" How do these cases reflect systemic inequalities in federal sentencing?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : So, we've seen for the past 50 years or so that the war on drugs has been racially motivated, specifically targeting young Black and Brown men, and many of those are Latinos, here in the city of New York. There was millions of arrests across the country. We've seen countless young fathers that have been ripped from their families, simply because they were trying to make money to help feed their families.\n\nAnd so, I was somebody who was arrested in high school at the age of 16. I was lucky enough not to get incarcerated, but only because my parents were able to help me through this ridiculous legal process of keeping a 16-year-old out of prison.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing across the country that while these laws are changing, the retroactive relief and the restorative justice for the folks that were impacted has not followed suit with all of the cannabis profits that we're seeing developed across the country. And we know without a doubt that the war on drugs was and is still racially motivated, specifically targeting Blacks and Latinos. And so, we've yet to actually wrestle with that real racist history of the war on drugs. We're simply trying to just move on without addressing the past.\n\nAnd I think the president has an incredible opportunity now to really address the issues that have been developed over the last few years by taking real expansive action, using his clemency power to commute the sentences of the folks that are currently in prison. And roughly half of the folks that are on our list of constituents are Latino. And you can see very clearly just by looking down the list of names who is in there and who is getting out in the future. And Latinos are definitely overrepresented in the prison population generally, but especially in the federal system for cannabis crimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you look at the clemency statistics by president, Biden is at almost the lowest, outside of George H.W. Bush. Biden, Trump, Obama, W., Clinton, H.W. and Reagan - he's number two, among the lowest. Are you speaking directly, are your groups speaking directly with the Biden clemency office? How far are these demands going? You're talking about thousands of people.\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Yeah. So, we have met with White House officials multiple times, and we've explained exactly the folks that we believe are the top candidates for clemency. And while they have been receptive, they have not told us that they're going to take any particular action to help these folks out at all.\n\nAnd so, what we are really doing is hoping that they will take action sooner rather than later. It is true that most of the time most presidents use their clemency powers at the very end of their presidency. However, President Biden has clearly shown that he's not going to wait for everyone to wait until the end of his presidency. He was willing to do it a little bit earlier for his son. And so, we're asking him to extend the same grace and compassion to all the folks that are currently incarcerated and release them immediately, let them join their families for the holidays, let them see their families grow up, and bring joy and happiness back into their lives.\n\nThese are folks that have served a tremendous amount of time already. This is not folks that we're saying did not commit the crime and should be, you know, released without any sort of punishment. Folks like Edwin Rubis have already served 27 years of their life in federal prison for a cannabis charge.\n\nAnd so, while he could wait, we are asking him not to wait, to do this immediately, to show the people that his presidency is going to be one where he will be remembered as addressing the issues that he created and coming to this from a place of compassion, and not continuing the process and continuing the damage done by punitive drug policies.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Jason Ortiz, we thank you so much for being with us, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project.\n\nComing up, Israeli journalist, former conscientious objector Haggai Matar about Gaza and Israel's crackdown on the press. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

But Indigenous political prisoner Leonard Peltier remains behind bars. Over 120 tribal leaders are calling on Biden to grant clemency to Peltier as one of his final acts in office, warning this may be the last opportunity Peltier has for freedom. Peltier is 80 years old and has spent the majority of his life - nearly half a century - in prison despite a conviction riddled with irregularities and prosecutorial misconduct. In December, tribal leaders, including the NDN Collective's Nick Tilsen, met with a pardon attorney at the Department of Justice to prepare a recommendation on Peltier's case for Biden. With only a few days left in Biden's term, Native Americans are eagerly anticipating his decision. \"All of us see a little bit of ourselves in Leonard Peltier, and that's why we fight so hard for him,\" says Tilsen. \"This is about paving a path forward that gives us the opportunity to have justice and begin to heal the relationship between the United States government and Indian people. And so, this decision is massive.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nThere are just days left in President Biden's term. He has made history today, granting thousands of commutations, clemency overall, pardons in his last weeks. The question is: Will he grant clemency to Leonard Peltier? Over 120 tribal leaders are calling on Biden to grant the Indigenous leader Leonard Peltier clemency as one of his final acts in office. In a letter to Biden, the tribal leaders write, quote, \"Our standing in the world as a champion of freedom, justice, and human rights cannot be maintained in a system that allows Leonard Peltier to die in prison.\"\n\nLeonard Peltier recently turned 80 years old. He spent the majority of his life, nearly half a century, in prison. For decades, he and his supporters have maintained Peltier's innocence over the 1975 killing of two FBI agents in a shootout on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and say his conviction was riddled with irregularities and prosecutorial misconduct. The federal government has been repeatedly accused of failing to prove its case against Peltier.\n\nThe former U.S. Attorney James Reynolds, who was a federal prosecutor for the District of South Dakota and was involved in Peltier's prosecution, wrote to Biden in 2021 advocating for Peltier's release. This is Reynolds reading a portion of that letter in a recent video produced by Preston Randolph.\n\nJAMES REYNOLDS : President Joe Biden, I write today from a position rare for a former prosecutor, to beseech you to commute the sentence of a man who I helped to put behind bars. Leonard Peltier's conviction and continued incarceration is a testament in a time and system of justice that no longer has a place in our society. We were not able to prove that Mr. Peltier personally committed any offense on the reservation. As a result to Mr. Peltier's conviction, now arrest, is that he was guilty of a murder simply because he was present on the reservation that day. He has served time for more than 46 years on the hands of minimal evidence, a result I strongly doubt would be upheld in any court today. I believe that a grant of executive clemency would serve the best interest of justice and the best interest of our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we go to Rapid City, South Dakota, where we're joined by Nick Tilsen, founder and CEO of NDN Collective. Tilsen is among the more than 120 tribal leaders who issued a letter to Biden earlier this month as they continue to plead for Peltier's freedom, who's imprisoned in Florida right now.\n\nNick Tilsen, we only have a few minutes. Have you met with the pardon board?\n\nNICK TILSEN : We actually met with the pardon attorney, Liz Oyer. We met with the pardon attorney at the Department of Justice headquarters in December with tribal leaders from around the country and talked specifically about Leonard Peltier and what this would mean for Indian Country. And she was the one who was actually drafting the recommendation, because there will be a recommendation that goes from the Department of Justice to the president's desk. And now that recommendation has been made and is sitting on the desk of the president right now. And he will make a decision in - you know, today or tomorrow, in the coming days, whether he's going to grant clemency to Leonard Peltier. And we don't know - we don't know exactly what the recommendation is, but when we left that meeting, all of the tribal leaders, we felt like - we felt like she was going to bring justice to Leonard Peltier, and we felt like it was going to be a recommendation for his release. And then the decision lies on - the decision lies on the president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, what did the pardon attorney tell you?\n\nNICK TILSEN : The pardon attorney told us that they knew the case inside and out, that they - that one of the primary focuses of this particular meeting that we were sitting in is that the section of the recommendation that she wanted to work on was what this would mean for Indian Country, what this would mean for Indian Country if Leonard Peltier was released. And we talked in depth, that the president of United States issued an apology for the boarding schools, and that it so happens to be that America's longest-incarcerated Indigenous political prisoner in history is, in fact, a boarding school survivor, and that we need to see action from the president, and that this is also an issue that will help illuminate many of the other good things that the Biden administration has done for Indian people. And so, they confirmed - she confirmed that, in fact, there was for sure going to be a written recommendation, and it was going to for sure go on to the president of the United States, and he was going to make a decision before he leaves office.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What is Leonard Peltier's condition in the Florida prison?\n\nNICK TILSEN : Leonard is 80% blind in one eye. He has type 2 diabetes. He's in a walker. He has an aortic aneurysm. His health is deteriorating. And that facility, quite frankly, doesn't even have the capability to meet his medical needs. And so, it's absolutely a dire situation. And we need to get Leonard out of that prison, back home and able to see a doctor almost immediately upon his release.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you tell me if the first-ever U.S. cabinet - Native American cabinet member, Deb Haaland, the former congressmember from New Mexico, has weighed in?\n\nNICK TILSEN : She has weighed in directly to the president. On Air Force One from Washington, D.C., to Arizona, when the announcement was going to be made for the apology for the boarding schools, she weighed in then. She's weighed in several times. And at this point in time, the president of the United States needs to listen to this matriarch and needs to listen to Secretary Deb Haaland, and because this is a priority for Indian Country. And this is a perfect opportunity for the president of the United States to listen to the honorable Secretary Haaland. And she has weighed in. She has not weighed in publicly, but she has weighed in directly to the president as the secretary of the Department of Interior.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to play a clip from - oh, it was over 10 years ago, when I talked to Leonard Peltier in prison on the phone at the time. It was President Obama who was in office.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Leonard, this is Amy Goodman from Democracy Now! I was -\n\nLEONARD PELTIER : Oh, hi, Amy. How are you?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Hi. I'm good. I was wondering if you have a message for President Obama?\n\nLEONARD PELTIER : I just hope he can, you know, stop the wars that are going on in this world, and stop getting - killing all those people getting killed, and, you know, give the Black Hills back to my people, and turn me loose.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It was very interesting, Nick Tilsen, as we break away from that interview - people can hear the whole interview at democracynow.org - that when I asked him to comment, he didn't comment first on his own case. He talked about stopping the wars. If you can, in this last 30 seconds that we have, talk about what it would mean for Native America, for Indian Country, for this country overall, for Leonard Peltier to be granted clemency?\n\nNICK TILSEN : You know, all throughout, the history of the treatment of Indian people by the United States government has been one of injustice. And the reality is, how Leonard Peltier was treated in his prosecution and incarceration is consistent with how this country has treated Indian people. And that's why all of us see a little bit of ourselves in Leonard Peltier, and that's why we fight so hard for him. So this is about Leonard's freedom, but this is about justice for Indian people everywhere. This is about human rights for people everywhere. This is about paving a path forward that gives us the opportunity to have justice and begin to heal the relationship between the United States government and Indian people. And so, this decision is massive. And I really hope that the president of United States weighs this decision. If he releases Leonard Peltier, he will be forever known the president who did that. And American -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Native American activist Nick Tilsen, we're going to leave it there, founder and CEO of NDN Collective. Thank you so much. That does it for our show.

There, men imprisoned for over 20 years, without charge, without trial, and who have been cleared for release, remain caged, virtually forgotten.\n\nPresident Biden, thankfully, hasn't forgotten. Eleven long-term Guantánamo prisoners were recently released, transferred to Oman to live free. Fifteen men remain imprisoned in Guantánamo. Of those 15, six have never been charged with a crime, and three have been cleared for release. Biden can deliver a measure of justice to all those remaining in Guantánamo. He should release those who've been cleared, and transfer those who remain charged or convicted to a facility inside the U.S. He should then order the notorious Guantánamo Bay prison to be shut down, once and for all.\n\nOverall, 780 men were imprisoned at Guantánamo since 2002, most without charge. A handful of U.S. attorneys have advocated for them, some for almost a quarter century. Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at City University of New York, is one of these lawyers.\n\n\"Moath al-Alwi is a Yemeni national,\" Ramzi Kassem said on the Democracy Now! news hour, describing one of his clients who was just released to Oman. \"He's one of the very first prisoners who arrived at Guantánamo. The prison was opened on January 11th, 2002. He was on the second or the third plane. You could tell by his low internment serial number, 028. He was never charged with any crime. He was, like the majority of prisoners at Guantánamo, sold for a bounty, $5,000 to $15,000, that the U.S. government was paying to tribes in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region for so-called Arabs out of place. By the government's own allegations, Mr. al-Alwi never so much as fired a shot at U.S. forces or their allies. Still, he spent 23 years, over half of his life, at Guantánamo.\"\n\nRamzi Kassem described another of those prisoners recently released from Guantánamo:\n\n\"Sanad al-Kazimi survived the CIA black sites. He was disappeared in the United Arab Emirates, survived severe forms of physical and psychological torture at a prison that the prisoners who survived it called 'the prison of darkness' or 'the dark prison.' The CIA called it the 'Salt Pit' or 'Cobalt' in the Senate's report about the torture that happened there. He was brought to Guantánamo in 2004. He was also never charged with a crime. He has four kids that he hasn't seen for the better part of their lives.\"\n\nMultiply these stories hundreds of times, and you begin to grasp the scale of injustice that has dominated the 20-plus year stain of Guantánamo on the U.S. justice system.\n\nSharqawi Al Hajj is another of the Yemeni prisoners just released to Oman. He has long been represented by Pardiss Kebriaei, a senior staff attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ).\n\n\"Sharqawi is 51. He's been inside since he was captured when he was 28, 29,\" Kebriaei said on Democracy Now! \"Guantánamo was set up as an intelligence-gathering operation. The point of it was to establish a place offshore where people could be held outside the bounds of the law, without access to courts, incommunicado, and where they could be interrogated.\"\n\nDespite years of interrogation, including two years before Guantánamo, when Sharqawi Al Hajj was imprisoned at a CIA dark site in Jordan and at Bagram Airbase in Afghanistan, which was dubbed \"Gitmo East\" as the brutality inflicted on prisoners there paralleled that suffered at Guantánamo itself.\n\n\"The release of these people and their freedom for the first time after all of this time, the chance to reunify with their families and begin to recover and rebuild, it's hard to overstate the enormity of that for them,\" CCR attorney Pardiss Kebriaei said.\n\nIt seems at best unlikely that the remaining prisoners would see anything under the incoming Trump administration other than a continuation of their lives in the legal black hole that is Guantánamo Bay. For example, Moath al-Alwi became an accomplished artist while imprisoned. Following a 2017 New York exhibit of art by him and other Guantánamo prisoners, the first Trump administration declared their artwork \"government property,\" telling lawyers it would be destroyed. The policy was reversed under President Biden.\n\nPerhaps, if Trump's federal budget-cutting duo of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were to consider Guantánamo, it would be closed. After all, the government spends half a billion dollars a year keeping the prison and the court at Guantánamo open - now, for just these 15 men.\n\nPresident Barack Obama pledged to close Guantánamo as far back as 2009, but failed to do so. President Biden still has the power to close it, he has the authority, and he still has the time. But does he have the will?\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nBy Amy Goodman & Denis Moynihan\n\n\"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement released by The White House on December 1st. \"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\" Hunter Biden awaited sentencing for two federal criminal convictions, for lying about his drug addiction on a gun purchase form and for tax evasion. He most likely would have spent less than five years behind bars. Joe Biden correctly labeled the prosecutions as partisan and politically motivated. \"Hunter was singled out only because he is my son,\" Biden said. With the simple stroke of a pen, President Biden saved his son from a terrible ordeal. Before he leaves office, he should extend the same compassion to thousands of people in federal prison, victims of the so-called war on drugs.\n\n\"This is definitely an opening for folks to talk about exactly how expansive we can use the pardon power of the president to make sure that we're correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years when it comes to cannabis crimes,\" Jason Ortiz, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project, said on the Democracy Now! news hour. \"President Biden himself was actually one of the architects of the 1994 crime bill that created a lot of the outrageous sentences that we're now dealing with today.\"\n\nOrtiz was referring to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which Biden championed as a senator, and which accelerated mass incarceration. Udi Ofer, former Director of the ACLU's Justice Division, wrote in 2019, on the crime bill's 25th anniversary, \"Under the leadership of Bill Clinton, Democrats wanted to wrest control of crime issues from Republicans, so the two parties began a bidding war to increase penalties for crime, trying to outdo one another.\"\n\nDemocrats have largely accepted the failure of the 1994 crime bill. In 2015, former President Bill Clinton admitted, \"The problem is, the way it was written and implemented, we cast too wide a net. We have too many people in prison.\" While campaigning for president in 2019 and 2020, though, Joe Biden repeatedly denied that the law he helped write contributed to mass incarceration.\n\nJason Ortiz continued, \"There are over 3,000 federal cannabis prisoners currently incarcerated [who] also have families and have parents and loved ones...So, while I can understand why the president wants to have compassion for his own son, we're really frustrated that he's refusing to extend that compassion to all the parents currently watching their kids waste away in prison.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2022, President Biden issued a blanket pardon for those convicted federally for simple marijuana possession. The Justice Department explained then, however, that \"conspiracy, distribution, and possession with intent to distribute are not pardoned by the proclamation.\"\n\nThe goal of The Last Prisoner Project is to expand the relief from the drug war's draconian sentences to those convicted of distribution and other charges.\n\n\"Right now, we have folks serving decades for trafficking,\" Ortiz said, \"exactly what the hundreds of legal cannabis businesses across the country are currently doing on a regular basis, including in Washington, D.C. We're seeing people sitting in prison for decades for the same activity that is currently generating tax revenue for cities and states across the country. We're paying for schools and building bridges with cannabis dollars, but still letting folks waste away in prison.\"\n\nThe Last Prisoner Project is not alone in calling for clemency. Last month, as President Biden prepared to pardon turkeys as part of an annual Thanksgiving photo op, more than fifty members of Congress sent a letter urging Biden to use the pardon power to address the ongoing crisis of mass incarceration.\n\n\"The United States represents just 5% of the world's population, yet we hold more than 20% of the global prison population,\" progressive Minnesota Congressmember Ilhan Omar said at a news conference announcing the letter. \"Over 1.9 million individuals are currently incarcerated with a disproportionate impact on communities of color. Black men are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of white men, a legacy of systematic inequalities that have persisted for generations...President, Biden has a real opportunity to make a difference in these final days of his term, we are calling on him to act.\"\n\nHunter Biden will very likely never see the inside of a prison cell, nor experience the discrimination and indignities imposed on former felons. President Biden has the power to pardon thousands of people imprisoned for federal cannabis crimes, or commute their sentences to time served and allow them to return home. The power is in his hands, but he still needs to be pushed by the millions of citizens in whose name he wields it.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The attack killed 15 people and wounded at least 35 others, carving a path of destruction down Bourbon Street before the assailant was killed in a firefight with police officers.\n\nPresident-elect Trump responded on social media, writing, \"When I said that the criminals coming in are far worse than the criminals we have in our country, that statement was constantly refuted by Democrats and the Fake News Media, but it turned out to be true.\" However, President Biden revealed the suspect is a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Houston named Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who was born in Texas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden : \"He served in the United States Army on active duty for many years. He also served in the Army Reserve until a few years ago. The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack, he posted videos on social media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS , expressing a desire to kill.\"\n\nThe annual college football game hosted at the nearby Superdome, the Sugar Bowl, was delayed until Thursday following the attack. The FBI said it found an explosive device in the Ford F-150 pickup truck used by the suspect. Shamsud-Din Jabbar had two prior criminal offenses: one in 2002 for theft and another in 2005 for driving with an invalid license. Jabbar obtained a real estate license in 2019; the following year, he posted a video to YouTube introducing himself as a professional real estate agent. Court documents show Jabbar struggled with his finances. In 2020, his second wife was granted a restraining order forbidding Jabbar from sending threatening messages or causing \"bodily injury\" to his spouse or their child."

      "text": "Biden's farewell speech sparks predictable split along party lines\n\nResponses from lawmakers underlined the very democratic fragility the president looked to highlight\n\nJoe Biden's farewell address warning that \"an oligarchy is taking shape\" which threatens American democracy sparked polarized reactions from lawmakers that seemed to validate the very democratic fragility the president looked to highlight.\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office for the final time before president-elect Donald Trump's return to power, on Wednesday Biden sounded an alarm about America's future. \"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America,\" he said, that posed a challenge to \"our basic rights and freedoms\".\n\nBiden urged the US to beware what he described as a growing \"tech-industrial complex\", appearing to deliberately echo the 1961 farewell address by a previous president, Dwight Eisenhower, whose warning of a \"military-industrial complex\" became a byword for the overreach of American corporate power in the democratic sphere.\n\nBiden's remarks amounted to a not-so-veiled jab at the tech billionaires Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, who have collectively not just amassed hitherto unseen wealth but have all recently made public gestures of support for Trump. All three are expected to attend Trump's inauguration on Monday.\n\nWithin hours, however, Biden's speech had devolved into another partisan battleground - perhaps the clearest illustration of the political division that has dogged his presidency.\n\n\"President Biden delivered his farewell address to a nation that is stronger because of his leadership,\" the former House speaker and California representative Nancy Pelosi wrote on X . She praised what she called \"four historic years of progress, hope and unity for American families\".\n\nRepublican lawmakers appeared to see a different speech entirely.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy in one word: Failure,\" the Georgia representative Andrew Clyde said on X .\n\nThe South Carolina representative Nancy Mace accused Biden of using his farewell not looking at China, Russia and Iran but to attack American citizens, by \"calling them 'oligarchs' and 'a threat to democracy'\".\n\nThe sharply divergent interpretations came as Biden prepared to hand the presidency back to Trump, who defeated Kamala Harris, the vice-president, in November following Biden's dramatic withdrawal from the race last summer amid concerns about his age and fitness for office.\n\nEven as he warned of democracy's fragility, Biden championed his administration's achievements, including major infrastructure investments, clean energy initiatives, and prescription drug reforms.\n\nThe former president Barack Obama praised these accomplishments , noting \"17 million new jobs, historic wage gains, and lower health care costs\" under Biden's watch.\n\nRepublicans dismissed the claims. \"Joe Biden's presidency will be defined by weakness, failure and dangerously liberal policies,\" the Oklahoma congressman Kevin Hern wrote on social media , while the Florida senator Rick Scott said Biden's speech \"should have been a formal apology\" for what he termed \"endless lawfare\" and \"inflation-fueling policies\".\n\nThe president's warnings about concentrated wealth and power came alongside calls for constitutional amendments to ensure presidential accountability - remarks that seemed particularly pointed given Trump's pending return to office.\n\nBiden argued that no president should be immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in office, a statement that some Republicans interpreted as a partisan attack rather than a broader democratic principle.\n\nHours before the address, Biden had announced what may prove his final diplomatic achievement: a breakthrough ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that could end the 15-month conflict in Gaza. The deal, which Biden first proposed last spring and which Trump's team helped finalize, offered a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation - though it barely featured in lawmakers' responses to his farewell.\n\nInstead, reactions split predictably along party lines, with Democrats such as the Wisconsin representative Mark Pocan saying he will \" always be proud \" of the achievements in creating millions of jobs and turning around the economy, while Republicans counted down the days until Trump's return.\n\n\"Hopefully he has time to finish packing up his boxes after tonight's speech because President Trump arrives back at the White House in 5 days,\" wrote the Indiana Representative Rudy Yakym on X .\n\nBiden's speech illustrated how his presidency, which began with ambitious promises to restore America's soul and unite a divided nation, ends with those divisions still stark. While speaking of a \"crumbling\" free press, rising disinformation and dark money in politics - systemic issues that ought in theory to transcend party lines - they were nevertheless immediately absorbed by politicians into a preferred partisan lens.\n\n\"We're sad to see you go, but the legacy you've created will impact our society for years to come,\" wrote the Mississippi representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, while Lisa McClain, the Republican representative for Michigan, offered a sharply different take : \"January 20th could not come soon enough.\""

They all will no longer have access to classified information - a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.\n\n\"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump wrote. He said he would also \"direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals\".\n\nEarlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump's memo, along with \"the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden disinformation letter\" - referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nTrump's decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike against his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his \"erratic behavior\".\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden's children, Hunter and Ashley, \"effective immediately\", after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president's son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.\n\nMore broadly, the security-clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president's political enemies, including the New York attorney general, Letitia James , and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.\n\nOthers on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss's alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.\n\nLiz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans who served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban \"includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community\".\n\nThe move comes as NBC News reported that former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, had volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden's nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAccording to the network, Biden made the proffer last month when he met the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, but the offer had not been embraced.\n\nAn NBC News poll published last weekend found the Democratic party's popularity has dropped to a record low - only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party. On Friday, Trump was asked about the prospect of Biden re-entering the political arena. \"I hope so,\" he responded."

      "text": "Biden must Trump-proof US democracy, activists say: 'There is a sense of urgency'\n\nPresident can secure civil liberties, accelerate spending on climate and healthcare, and spare death row prisoners\n\nT he skies above the White House were cold and grey. Joe Biden greeted the championship winning Boston Celtics basketball team , quipping about his Irish ancestry and tossing a basketball into the crowd. But the US president could not resist drawing a wider lesson.\n\n\"When we get knocked down, we get back up,\" he said . \"As my dad would say, 'Just get up, Joe. Get up.' Character to keep going and keep the faith, that's the Celtic way of life. That's sports. And that's America.\"\n\nSuch events continue to be among the ceremonial duties of a \"lame duck\" president with waning influence. Biden has cut a diminished figure in recent months, first surrendering his chance to seek re-election, then finding himself sidelined by the doomed presidential campaign of his vice-president, Kamala Harris.\n\nBut with his legacy imperiled by Donald Trump , the president is facing calls to mitigate the oncoming storm. Advocacy groups say Biden, who turned 82 this week, can still take actions during his final two months in office to accelerate spending on climate and healthcare, secure civil liberties, and Trump-proof at least some fundamentals of US democracy.\n\nTrump's signature campaign promise was a draconian crackdown on illegal immigration. He has nominated officials including Tom Homan and Stephen Miller , architects of family separations at the southern border during his first term, and vowed to use the US military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe plans include mandatory detention, potentially trapping immigrants in inhumane conditions for years as they fight deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is leading an opposition effort, urging Biden to halt the current expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facilities, especially those with records of human rights abuses.\n\nEunice Cho , a senior staff attorney with the ACLU national prison project, said Ice detention facilities \"characterised by abusive conditions, pervasive neglect and utter disregard for the dignity of people in their custody\" were key to Trump's logistical plan.\n\nDozens of people have died in Ice detention facilities - mostly owned or operated by private prison corporations - over the past four years, according to the ACLU, and 95% of deaths would probably have been preventable had appropriate medical care been provided. Yet the Biden administration has backed new Ice detention facilities in states where they did not exist before, such as Kansas, Wyoming and Missouri.\n\n\"We are calling on the Biden administration to take action now, in the final days of the administration, to halt any efforts to expand immigration detention and to shut down specifically abusive facilities once and for all,\" Cho told reporters on a Zoom call this week . \"We don't need to put down runway for the Trump administration to put in place these mass detention and deportation machines.\"\n\nShe warned: \"We know that the anti-immigrant policies of a second administration are going to be far more aggressive than what we saw in the first term, and mass arrest and detention is going to become perhaps the norm to create and carry out these deportation operations unless we can do all we can to put a halt to them.\"\n\nAnother crucial area for Biden to make a last stand is criminal justice. In his first term, Trump oversaw the execution of more people than the previous 10 presidents combined. Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, then imposed a moratorium on federal executions in 2021.\n\nTrump has indicated his intention to resume such executions and even expand the death penalty. His nominee for attorney general, Pam Bondi , issued a public apology in 2013 while serving as Florida's top law enforcement officer after she sought to delay the execution of a convicted killer because it conflicted with a fundraiser for her re-election campaign.\n\nCassandra Stubbs , director of the ACLU's capital punishment project, told reporters over Zoom that Trump said \"he will work to expand the death penalty. He's going to try to expand it to people who do not even commit killings. He's called for expanding the death penalty to his political opponents.\n\n\"But perhaps most dangerously in Project 2025 [a policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation thinktank] - and we believe every word of it is this - he promised to try to kill everyone on death row, and the reason why we have to believe this and take it so seriously is the record that Donald Trump left where he, in a span of six months, carried out 13 executions.\"\n\nThe ACLU and other groups are therefore pressing Biden to commute the sentences of all individuals on federal death row to life in prison, fulfilling a campaign promise and preventing potential executions under Trump. Commuting \"is really the thing that Biden can do to make it harder for Trump to restart executions\", Stubbs added.\n\nPastor Brandi Slaughter, a board member of the pressure group Death Penalty Action , told reporters this week: \"We know what the next president plans to do if any prisoners are left under a sentence of death under the Biden administration. We've been there, we've done that.\"\n\nBiden has also received 8,000 petitions for clemency from federal prisoners serving non-death penalty sentences that he could either reduce or pardon. The former senator has long been criticised for his role in drawing up a 1994 crime law that led to the incarceration of thousands of Black men and women for drug offences.\n\nThis week, members of Congress including Ayanna Pressley and James Clyburn led 64 colleagues in sending a letter to Biden urging him to use his clemency power \"to reunite families, address longstanding injustices in our legal system and set our nation on the path toward ending mass incarceration\".\n\nThey were joined at a press conference on Capitol Hill by Maria Garza, 50, from Illinois, a prison reform advocate who spent 12 years in a state prison. She said in an interview: \"There is a sense of urgency because a lot of the people that are sitting waiting for clemency are people that have de facto life sentences that will die in prison if they don't [receive clemency]. A lot of their unjust sentencing was because of the 1994 crime bill that he was the founding father of.\"\n\nSign up to Fighting Back\n\nBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency. From our opinion desk.\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nMitzi Wall , whose 29-year-old son Jonathan is incarcerated on a seven-and-a-half-year federal cannabis charge, called on Biden to keep a campaign promise to grant clemency to more than 4,000 people in federal prison for nonviolent cannabis crimes.\n\n\"We voted for President Biden,\" she said. \"He gave us hope and we're asking him to do nothing more than keep his promise.\"\n\nWall, 63, from Maryland, added: \"President Biden was partly responsible for writing the 1994 crime bill that thrust families into abject poverty and pain. I know he feels bad about that and he can right that wrong with the power of the pen. I'm appealing to him as a father whose son [Hunter] could very possibly be going to prison.\"\n\nIn other efforts to protect civil liberties, the ACLU is recommending a moratorium on all federal government purchases of Americans' personal data without a warrant. It is also asking Congress to pass the Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act to prevent potential abuse of surveillance technologies under the Trump administration .\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds in Biden's landmark climate and healthcare law and stop clean-energy development projects. White House officials are working against the clock to dole out billions of dollars in grants for existing programmes to minimise Trump's ability to rescind or redirect these funds. Earlier this month, the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, announced more than $3.4bn in grants for infrastructure projects across the country.\n\nWendy Schiller , a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, notes that Trump will have the power of impoundment to stall the money flowing out of the government and can order rescissions to programmes funded by Congress.\n\n\"The singular thing that Joe Biden can do is expedite the flow of federal dollars in all the programmes,\" Schiller said.\n\n\"Any money that is supposed to leave the treasury to go to schools, food safety, environmental protection - anything that is not yet distributed needs to get distributed. It's like emptying literally the piggy bank before you go on a trip. President Biden needs to be literally getting as much money out the door in the hands of state, local and community organisations as he can.\"\n\nAnother priority for the White House is getting Senate confirmation of as many federal judges as possible, given the potential impact of the judiciary in challenging Trump administration policies. The Marshall Project, a non-profit news organisation, noted: \"Federal judges restricted hundreds of Trump administration policies during his first term, and will likely play a significant role in determining the trajectory of his second.\"\n\nSenate Republicans forced numerous procedural votes and late-night sessions this week in attempt to stall confirmations. Eventually a deal was struck that will bring Biden within striking distance of the 234 judicial confirmations that occurred in Trump's first term - but four of Biden's appellate court nominees will not be considered.\n\nThe outgoing president could also engage with Democratic-led states and localities to bolster protections and establish \"firewalls\" against Trump's agenda, particularly in areas such as immigration. These collaborations could involve reinforcing sanctuary city policies and providing resources to states that are likely to face pressure from the Trump administration.\n\nChris Scott , former coalitions director for Harris, said: \"What will be interesting is how or what can President Biden to work with states, especially where we have Democratic leadership in place, to be able to brace themselves and arm themselves with more protection. We already have places like a Michigan or Illinois where you have governors vowing to make sure that they have protections - even in the Trump presidency. \"\n\nAs Barack Obama discovered before handing Trump the keys to the Oval Office in 2017, however, lame duck presidents can only do so much. Trump will come into office with a flurry of executive orders, a supportive Congress and fewer guardrails than the first time around.\n\nBill Galston , a former adviser in the Bill Clinton administration, said: \"On January 20 Donald Trump will control all the instruments of government and, at that point, it'll be up to the courts - and public opinion - to restrain him.\"\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

      "text": "'Impactful and selfless': Democrats heap praise on Biden after he quits race\n\nObama and party leaders highlight president's lifetime of service as some begin to back Kamala Harris\n\nJoe Biden withdrew from the presidential race on Sunday after weeks of pressure from other Democrats to step down after his disastrous debate in late June.\n\nDemocratic leaders quickly heaped praise on the president for his lifetime of service.\n\nBiden's \"outstanding track record gave President Biden every right to run for re-election and finish the job he started\", wrote Barack Obama . \"Joe understands better than anyone the stakes in this election  -  how everything he has fought for throughout his life, and everything that the Democratic party stands for, will be at risk if we allow Donald Trump back in the White House and give Republicans control of Congress.\"\n\nThe former president described the process moving forward as \"uncharted waters\". But he praised the decision. \"I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America,\" Obama wrote. \"It's a testament to Joe Biden's love of country  -  and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi , who reportedly was one of several lawmakers nudging Biden to withdraw, spoke of her \"love and gratitude\" in a message following Biden's announcement.\n\n\"President Joe Biden is a patriotic American who has always put our country first,\" the former House speaker said. \"His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history.\"\n\nThough Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris as his successor, a question is instantly emerging among Democrats: whether the party will coalesce around the vice-president to take up the baton and run in his stead, or whether the Democratic national convention should have a floor fight for the nomination.\n\nRonald Klain, Biden's former chief of staff, is one of many in the first camp. \"Now that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it's time to end the political fantasy games and unite behind the only veteran of a national campaign - our outstanding @vp, @KamalaHarris,\" Klain wrote on X. \"Let's get real and win in November!\"\n\nSenators Mark Warner, Tammy Baldwin and others quickly offered their support for Harris in messages on Sunday, as did Bill and Hillary Clinton , ostensibly hoping to avoid a bruising floor fight in Chicago at the convention a month from now.\n\n\"We've lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term,\" they wrote. \"He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile supreme court will only embolden him to further shred the constitution.\"\n\nBut Cenk Uygur, founder of the Young Turks program, who ran an abortive primary campaign against Biden this year, is firmly in the latter camp.\n\n\"The rebel forces have won!\" Uygur said. \"We'll have a new Democratic ticket! There is no reason why the new ticket wouldn't instantly be the favorite over Trump. Please Democrats don't trust leadership to pick anymore - do an open convention to pick the strongest team! ... Has he been the picture of sound judgment lately? No, the delegates should pick. That's the last vestige of democracy left.\"\n\nThat contrasts with the sentiment of Black leaders at the state and local level, who view a contest against Harris as a betrayal.\n\n\"Now's the time for us to rally around Kamala Harris and defeat Donald Trump,\" said Brandon Scott, mayor of Baltimore. \"Black women have saved this country time and time again. For that reason and a hundred others, there is no other - or better - option than the vice-president to unite our party and win in November.\"\n\nJaime Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, described some of the next steps the party will take.\n\n\"In the coming days, the party will undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November,\" Harrison said. \"This process will be governed by established rules and procedures of the party. Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people.\"\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nMany of the strongest contenders in a contested nomination fight made statements expressing their gratitude for Biden's service, while studiously avoiding discussion about their own potential candidacies.\n\n\"President Biden has been an extraordinary, history-making president - a leader who has fought hard for working people and delivered astonishing results for all Americans,\" Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, said. \"He will go down in history as one of the most impactful and selfless presidents.\"\n\nJosh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, also praised Biden.\n\n\"President Biden is a patriot who has served our country honorably in the Senate, as Vice President, and as one of the most consequential presidents in modern history,\" Shapiro wrote on X. \"President Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom. I am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania - the Commonwealth that raised him.\"\n\nGovernor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan said her role in the race had not changed.\n\n\"President Biden is a great public servant who knows better than anyone what it takes to defeat Donald Trump. His remarkable work to lower prescription drug costs, fix the damn roads, bring supply chains home, address climate change, and ensure America's global leadership over decades will go down in history,\" Whitmer said on X. \"My job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families' costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan.\n\nMichigan and Pennsylvania are swing states critical to Democratic chances in November. Biden had been polling poorly in swing states. Undeterred, the chairpersons of the state parties of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona released a joint open letter endorsing Biden's re-election bid only on Saturday.\n\n\"We understand the anxiety. But the best antidote to political anxiety is taking action,\" they wrote. \"You can't wring your hands when you're rolling up your sleeves.\"\n\nThat letter underscores just how stunning Biden's decision is.\n\nJohn Ernst, a Democratic insider and former mayor of Brookhaven, Georgia - an Atlanta suburb with a purple streak - believes this resets the race for Democrats in the state. \"The voter enthusiasm had been down across the board because they had been seeing the same thing,\" he said. \"No one wanted Trump v Biden 2.0. People are tired of the same thing.\n\n\"Joe Biden is probably going to go down in history as one of the greatest one-term presidents,\" he said. \"This is an ultimate personal sacrifice for the nation, to take what would be a personally anguishing decision to step aside. The party will decide in a convention like parties have done in numerous years. There's plenty of time on the clock. This will allow the Democratic party to move forward, to show people that a new day is coming.\"\n\nRead more about Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 election:\n\nJoe Biden drops out and endorses Kamala Harris\n\nReaction from around the world and Republicans go on the offense\n\nWho will replace Biden ?

      "text": "Biden was my boss. I resigned because as a Jew I cannot endorse the Gaza catastrophe\n\nThe president has weaponized the idea of Jewish safety to justify the atrocity in Gaza. I could no longer stand by\n\nUntil last week, President Biden was my boss.\n\nLast week, I resigned from my post at the United States Department of the Interior, becoming the first Jewish politically appointed administration official to publicly resign in protest - and in mourning - of President Biden's endorsement of genocide in Gaza, where more than 35,000 Palestinians have been murdered . This was an incredibly difficult decision, but one that was necessary - and one that felt even more urgent, as the president of the United States has persistently corrupted the idea of Jewish safety, weaponizing my community as a shield to dodge accountability for his role in this atrocity.\n\nI worked hard to elect this administration, first as an organizer for Vice-President Kamala Harris during the 2019 Democratic primary, then for the Biden-Harris ticket in the general election in the swing state of Arizona. I once saw the Biden-Harris administration as a beacon, blinking brilliantly as a hopeful symbol of democracy in the encroaching dark. But now, watching the United States's complicity in the ongoing slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza , I am only reminded that in times of great horror, many with great power choose to do nothing.\n\nLike many Jewish Americans, I am descended from those who fled Europe and survived violent persecution. My pregnant great-grandmother escaped pogroms by hiding in the belly of a horse-drawn carriage, then crossing an ocean alone, looking for safety in a new land. My inheritance is the weighted absence of those who should be here today: entire lineages of family, who could not escape the coming Shoah, snuffed out and disappeared into memory. I feel the weight of this history every day.\n\nAfter the nightmare of 7 October, I spent days checking in with loved ones and tending the trauma felt by my community. I remember the days that followed as being clouded over with mourning for loved ones missing or taken hostage, and overwhelming devastation as the confirmed death list ticked higher and higher. And still, I found myself holding my breath, anticipating Israel's counter to the tragedy.\n\nIn the many months since, I have watched as Palestinians struggle to survive the indiscriminate bombing that has plagued their home - a bombing bought and paid for by the United States. Children livestreaming on social media have been forced to step into the shoes of absent journalists, many murdered in this conflict, which has become the deadliest for journalists on record . I've seen countless videos of families fleeing falling bombs, children wailing at the loss of their mothers and refugees now cowering in Rafah.\n\nAround the world, over Memorial Day weekend here in America, people watched on social media in horror as the IDF dropped 60 2000-pound bombs on a displaced persons camp in Rafah, burning tents and the refugees sheltering inside.\n\nThis does not make anyone safer - neither Palestinians nor Jews. I know what it means to fear the rising surge of antisemitism. I am terrified - I feel it every day. But I am certain that Jews are not better protected by a war effort, endorsed by the United States and waged in the name of Jewish safety, that furthers a genocide of a whole people collectively framed as \"our enemy\". In fact, making Jews the face of an unrelenting, genocidal campaign only puts us at risk even more.\n\nPalestinian and Jewish safety are not oppositional. In fact, they are deeply intertwined. President Biden does not recognize this. He refuses to call for a lasting and permanent ceasefire, end the blank check offered to Israel, secure a diplomatic release of the Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, end the siege on Gaza and work to abolish the apartheid system stretched across the Holy Land. That is why, at this moment, my former boss is the person who makes me feel most unsafe as an American Jew.\n\nIn this moment, I am comforted by the work of organizers demanding to be heard. I have been inspired by the safe communities created by coalitions of Jewish and Palestinian activists working hand in hand in this moment , along with the chorus of voices - including students , union workers , swing state voters , teachers , artists , faith leaders , writers , servicemembers and, yes, more than 500 members of President Biden's own administration - who have condemned the genocide. Each of these voices has spoken in accordance with my Jewish faith, which teaches me that the virtue of pikuach nefesh means that saving a life is the greatest mitzvah one can do.\n\nThere are lessons to be learned from our faith and history, as we watch the same dehumanization that fell upon my community now land upon another. Each day, I see photos of those displaced in Gaza, and I am reminded of my own family's memory of loved ones killed in the Shoah - which, in turn, reminds me of the Nakba: the tragedy that occurred in 1948 when Palestinian society was destroyed and an estimated 700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homeland for the formation of today's modern Israel. Shoah and Nakba mean the same thing in Hebrew and Arabic: catastrophe.\n\nI resigned on Wednesday, 15 May - the 76th anniversary of the Nakba - because I could no longer serve at the pleasure of a president who refuses to stop another catastrophe.\n\nLily Greenberg Call was a special assistant to the chief of staff at the US Department of the Interior"

      "text": "President Biden: stand up to Chevron and pardon Steven Donziger\n\nChevron spent billions trying to destroy him after he won the largest pollution case in history. It's time for Biden to end this nightmare\n\nI t's a tale as old as time: an underdog fighting for what's right, and a powerful giant doing everything it can to stop him. Yet in today's America, the giants don't lose - they rig the system to crush anyone who dares to challenge them.\n\nThat's exactly what happened to Steven Donziger, a well-known human rights lawyer who stood up to oil giant Chevron . After helping Indigenous and farming communities in Ecuador secure a historic $9.5bn judgment against the company for decades of environmental destruction, Chevron retaliated with a vicious legal campaign designed not just to discredit him, but to ruin his life.\n\nDonziger's story is nothing new. We all know that billion-dollar corporations wield their influence to silence critics. But what is so jarring about this case is the lengths to which Chevron has gone to manipulate the courts, corrupt the rule of law and evade accountability.\n\nIt is so bad that this week, I led 34 members of Congress in calling on Joe Biden to pardon Donziger after he was prosecuted and jailed directly by Chevron lawyers in the nation's first corporate prosecution. That's after 68 Nobel laureates demanded he be released from detention and three federal judges - including two supreme court justices - determined his prosecution was unconstitutional.\n\nDonziger's ordeal began after he helped uncover Chevron's decades of environmental destruction in Ecuador's Amazon rainforest - exposing a legacy of poisoned soil, toxic waste dumped into the water, and entire villages ravaged by cancer. In 2008, I traveled to Indigenous communities with Steven and met with families and farmers whose lives and livelihoods were ruined. It was heartbreaking, but it filled both of us with anger and a conviction to fight for justice.\n\nWhen Donziger and his team secured the historic court judgment against Chevron in 2018, it was a rare triumph of the little guy. But instead of accepting responsibility and complying with court rulings that ordered the company to compensate the Amazon communities poisoned by its actions, Chevron turned the tables - launching a retaliatory legal campaign and leveraging its deep pockets to harass and punish Donziger.\n\nWhat happened next was chilling. Chevron successfully weaponized the courts to target Donziger personally. The company filed a bogus civil Rico lawsuit against him, securing an unprecedented court order that would have forced him to turn over his confidential case file to Chevron. When Donziger appealed the order, the trial judge who issued it charged him with misdemeanor contempt of court. After the US attorney in Manhattan declined to prosecute such a bizarre charge, Chevron pressured the judge to appoint private prosecutors from a corporate law firm - who previously had Chevron as a client - to prosecute him in the name of the US government.\n\nDonziger was denied a jury trial, disbarred without a fact hearing, thrown in jail for over a month, and put on house arrest with an ankle bracelet for almost three years - more than four times longer than the maximum allowable sentence in the contempt case. Chevron had his passport confiscated and his work discredited - all because he had the gall to stand up to the company and demand accountability for the harm they caused to communities in the Amazon.\n\nIt's no wonder the mistreatment of Donziger has continued to draw international outrage. In addition to the federal judges and Nobel laureates, Amnesty International and the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have condemned Donziger's treatment as unlawful. In short, the failure to provide justice in this case not only undermines faith in our legal system at home, but also our credibility on the world stage - weakening our government's ability to support human rights without being branded as hypocrites.\n\nJust like in the original David and Goliath, this story doesn't begin or end with one person. Steven Donziger deserves to be pardoned, but this goes way beyond him. It's about what kind of country we want to live in - one where fairness still means something, or one where corrupt corporations can continue using deep pockets to rig the system and get their way.\n\nAs we brace for the transition to the Trump administration , it's more urgent than ever to safeguard the integrity of our institutions and shore up the rule of law. Biden has a closing window to take bold, decisive action.\n\nA pardon for Donziger would not erase the injustices he has endured. And it would certainly not fix what Chevron did to the innocent people of Ecuador . But it would send a powerful signal that truth and fairness still matter, and that the United States stands for justice and not corporate impunity. It also would allow Donziger to travel again and help the Amazon communities force Chevron to comply with court orders that it pay the judgement.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, it would give hope to human rights and environmental defenders everywhere that their critically important advocacy - so necessary to safeguard our planet - will be protected, not punished.\n\nPresident Biden, the people of Ecuador are waiting for justice. The world is watching. Draw a line in the sand. Protect the rule of law. Pardon Steven Donziger. And send a message that no corporation, no matter how powerful they seem or how much money they have, can behave as if they are above the law.\n\nJim McGovern is a congressman from Massachusetts"

      "text": "Governors admit worries but rally behind Biden after meeting: 'We have his back'\n\nPresident meets with Democratic governors for 'candid' talks as he seeks to reassure his party and the public\n\nA group of leading Democratic governors offered words of support for Joe Biden on Wednesday as pressure mounted on the president to leave the race.\n\nThe governors, including Tim Walz of Minnesota, Wes Moore of Maryland, Gavin Newsom of California and Kathy Hochul of New York, held a closed-door meeting with Biden in Washington as he sought to reassure his party - and the public - that he is up to the job after a shaky debate performance .\n\nBiden met for more than an hour at the White House in person and virtually with more than 20 governors from his party. The governors told reporters afterward that the conversation was \"candid\" and said they expressed concerns about Biden's debate performance last week. They reiterated that defeating Donald Trump in November was the priority, but said they were still standing behind Biden and did not join other Democrats who have been urging him to withdraw his candidacy.\n\n\"We, like many Americans, are worried,\" Walz of Minnesota said. \"We are all looking for the path to win - all the governors agree with that. President Biden agrees with that. He has had our backs through Covid ... the governors have his back. We're working together just to make very, very clear that a path to victory in November is the No 1 priority and that's the No 1 priority of the president ... The feedback was good. The conversation was honest.\" \"The president is our nominee. The president is our party leader,\" added Moore of Maryland. He said Biden \"was very clear that he's in this to win it\".\n\n\"We were honest about the feedback we're getting ... and the concerns we're hearing from people,\" Moore said. \"We're going to have his back ... the results we've been able to see under this administration have been undeniable.\"\n\nThe meeting capped a tumultuous day for Biden as members of his own party, and a major democratic donor , urged him to step aside amid questions over his fitness for office. Two Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to exit the race, and a third Congressman said he had \"grave concerns\" about Biden's ability to beat Trump. The White House, meanwhile, was forced to deny reports that Biden is weighing whether his candidacy is still viable.\n\nBiden, for his part, has forcefully insisted that he is staying in the race. \"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running ... no one's pushing me out,\" Biden said on a call with staffers from his re-election campaign. \"I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win.\"\n\nKamala Harris has also stood by his side, despite some insiders reportedly rallying around her as a possible replacement. \"We will not back down. We will follow our president's lead,\" the vice-president reportedly told staffers on Wednesday.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nMichigan governor Gretchen Whitmer also threw her support behind Biden. \"He is in it to win it and I support him,\" she said on Twitter/X after the meeting.\n\nWhitmer is one of several Democratic governors who have been cited as possible replacements if Biden were to withdraw his candidacy. Gavin Newsom , whose name has also been floated, flew in for the governors' meeting on Wednesday , saying afterwards : \"I heard three words from the president tonight - he's all in. And so am I.\"\n\nNewsom has been a top surrogate for Biden's re-election campaign, but has also garnered increasing buzz as a potential replacement if Biden were to withdraw. He was swarmed by reporters after the debate ended last week, some asking him if he'd replace Biden.\n\nA Siena College/New York Times poll released Wednesday suggested Trump's lead had increased since the debate, with him winning 49% of likely voters compared to 43% for Biden. Only 48% of Democrats in the poll said Biden should remain the nominee. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Tuesday said that former first lady Michelle Obama is the only hypothetical candidate to definitively defeat Trump, but she has previously said she's not running. That poll had Biden and Trump tied.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting"

Carville argues that Biden's initial wavering, and the Democrats' subsequent electoral loss, turned an otherwise admirable run into a failure.\n\n\"The most tragic figure in American politics in my lifetime is President Biden,\" Carville declared.\n\nAddressing Biden's reversal on pardoning his own son, Carville seemed relatively unbothered. \"So he said, 'I'll never pardon the kid,' OK ... everybody's going to do whatever they're gonna do with their own children,\" he reasoned.\n\n\"But ... if he would have in September of 2023 or August said that he wasn't going to run, goddamn we would have won this election,\" Carville argued. \"And it wouldn't have been that close because we would've had so many talented frickin' people that were running.\"\n\nThe longtime Democratic strategist said that Biden could have left the White House \"on a high note\" as \"the toast of Washington\" with landmarks named after him, and that a future Democratic president could've pardoned Hunter Biden.\n\n\"What's so sad [is], it didn't have to be this way,\" Carville added. \"He brought it all on himself.\"\n\nThe strategist had predicted a clear-cut win for Harris but admitted after she lost that a lack of Democratic primaries had left the party without options. Carville reiterated Thursday that he deeply respects Biden, which made the election outcome all the more devastating, he said.\n\n\"All of this is fucking self-inflicted,\" he said in the video. \"It's tragic, it's sad, and of course everything about him is... it'll be six years before somebody comes back and talks about all of the stunning things [Biden accomplished].\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

You've still got 100 days left in office! And the Supreme Court has just granted you super powers - AND immunity!\"\n\n\"You don't answer to anyone,\" Moore continued. \"For the first time in over 50 years, you don't have to campaign for anything.\"\n\nMoore was referring to a Supreme Court ruling made in July, which declared that presidents have \"absolute immunity\" from criminal prosecution for acts done in an official capacity as commander in chief.\n\nThe \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" director went on to again remind Biden, \"You have full immunity! No kidding! No joke! That's not hyperbole! You can get away with anything! And what if anything means everything to the people?\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Dozens Of Democrats Plead With Biden To Free Leonard Peltier Before Leaving Office\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― Dozens of U.S. senators and members of Congress wrote to President Joe Biden on Thursday \"with renewed urgency\" in their calls on him to release Native American rights activist Leonard Peltier, who has been in prison for nearly 50 years and is in poor health.\n\n\"The power to exercise mercy in this case lies solely within your discretion, and we urge you to grant Mr. Peltier clemency, allowing him to return home and live out his remaining days among his own people,\" reads the letter, signed by 34 Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"We commend the steps that your Administration has taken to right past wrongs of our federal government's treatment of Native Americans, and the steps you have taken to uphold the American values of liberty and justice, including rectifying inequities in our nation's criminal justice system,\" they wrote. \"In keeping with these principles, we strongly urge you to commute Mr. Peltier's sentence.\"\n\nThe letter is signed by seven senators, 26 House members and, curiously, one former longtime Democratic senator who served with Biden for decades, Patrick Leahy of Vermont.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment as to whether Biden is considering commuting Peltier's sentence.\n\nHere's a copy of the letter:\n\nDemocrats delivered their letter to Biden on the same day he commuted the sentences of 1,500 people who had been released from prison but placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also pardoned 39 people convicted of nonviolent crimes.\n\nBetween that and Biden's recent pardon of his son Hunter , Democrats are hopeful it's a sign that the president will show mercy in Peltier's case in his final weeks in office.\n\n\"President Biden has long recognized that our criminal justice system is not without its flaws,\" Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), one of the signatories on the letter, told HuffPost in a statement.\n\n\"His action to grant clemency to 1,500 Americans ― the most ever in a single day ― is a promising sign that he's ready to undo the wrongs of the past and give so many the second chance they deserve,\" said Grijalva, who has long advocated for Peltier's freedom. \"Mr. Peltier should never have been imprisoned, much less for nearly half a century, so I hope President Biden will continue to do the right thing and pardon Leonard Peltier now.\"\n\nPeltier has been in prison ever since the U.S. government accused him of murdering two FBI agents in a 1975 shoot-out on a South Dakota reservation. There was never evidence that Peltier committed a crime, and the U.S. government never did figure out who shot those agents, but federal officials needed someone to take the fall, and Peltier was their pick.\n\nHis trial was riddled with misconduct: The FBI threatened and coerced witnesses into lying. Federal prosecutors hid evidence that exonerated Peltier. A juror admitted on the second day of the trial that she had \"prejudice against Indians,\" but she was kept on anyway.\n\nThe U.S. government's case fell apart after these revelations, so it just revised its charges against Peltier to aiding and abetting whoever did kill the agents ― based entirely on the premise that he was one of dozens of people present when the shoot-out took place.\n\nPeltier, who is nearly 80 now, has maintained his innocence, which has almost certainly led to him being denied parole. He's mostly blind and uses a walker to get around when he's not confined to the inches of space in his cell. He's facing serious health issues related to an aortic aneurysm and diabetes, which sent him to the hospital in July with \"open wounds and tissue death on his toes and feet.\" He was hospitalized again in October.\n\nVirtually every international human rights leader in modern history, including Pope Francis and Nelson Mandela, has called for Peltier's release. Remarkably, so have some of the same people who put Peltier in prison in the first place.\n\nThe only reason the Native American rights activist is still in prison is because of unwavering opposition to his release from the FBI, even though its arguments against clemency are full of holes, are outdated and are remarkably easy to disprove .\n\nThe bureau still hasn't publicly addressed the key context of that 1975 shoot-out, either: The FBI itself was intentionally fueling tensions on that reservation as part of a covert campaign to suppress the activities of the American Indian Movement (AIM), a grassroots movement for Indigenous rights. Peltier was an active AIM member and an FBI target.\n\nBiden, who arguably has nothing left to lose at this point, could unilaterally grant compassionate release to Peltier. If he wanted to avoid some controversy, he could simply commute Peltier's sentence versus granting a pardon. Doing so would just mean his prison time is over versus suggesting the government is acknowledging it did something wrong.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Why Any Biden Replacement Besides Harris Would Face A Major Fundraising Hassle\n\nSenior Political Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIf President Joe Biden does not run for reelection, Vice President Kamala Harris would have a major practical advantage over other possible candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThat's because only Harris could seamlessly assume complete control of the president's campaign war chest, making the vice president the easiest option, at least financially, to replace Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"It's uncharted waters, and for a candidate other than the vice president, it's going to put a burden on raising a lot of money very quickly,\" Larry Noble, the former general counsel for the Federal Election Commission, told HuffPost.\n\nTransferring everything to another candidate besides Harris becomes much trickier, if not impossible, according to experts who emphasize the unprecedented nature of the situation currently facing Democrats . In that case, the Biden-Harris account could roll everything over into a political action committee, turn it over to the Democratic National Committee, or refund donors and ask them to contribute to a new committee. None of these are ideal options.\n\n\"Because President Biden and Vice President Harris share an authorized campaign committee ... if President Biden were to cease being a candidate and was succeeded as the nominee by Harris, she would maintain access to all the funds in the committee and could use them to advance her presidential candidacy,\" Trevor Potter, the president of the Campaign Legal Center, a campaign finance watchdog, explained on social media this week .\n\nA new campaign would also have to pay for campaign infrastructure like staffers, field offices and existing ad buys at fair market value since it's all subject to in-kind contribution limits .\n\n\"The Biden-Harris campaign could make a political contribution to another candidate, it's just subject to political contribution limits,\" Noble said, citing the candidate-to-candidate federal contribution limit of $2,000 per election. \"They just can't transfer [everything] to another candidate.\"\n\nIt's just one example of how challenging building out a new campaign would be for anyone but Harris four months from the election, as Democrats begin to waver publicly on whether Biden has the stamina to win the election and complete another term. Fundraising is just one piece of a puzzle that would include coalescing behind another candidate and getting them on the ballot in 50 states with different rules for qualifying .\n\nHarris, who ran against Biden in 2020 before becoming his running mate, is getting a renewed look as a presidential candidate. A CNN poll this week even showed her slightly edging out Biden in a head-to-head against Trump.\n\nBut Biden and his closest advisors have dug in following last Thursday's debate, during which Biden, 81, appeared unable to effectively counter the 78-year-old former president.\n\nTo try and quell mounting concerns, Biden's campaign released its second-quarter fundraising numbers on Tuesday, revealing that Biden raised $264 million in Q2 , including $127 million in June and $33 million alone on the day of the debate, according to the campaign. Biden ended the quarter with $240 million cash on hand versus Trump's $285 million in cash from his $331 million Q2 haul. They're strong numbers for both campaigns in the election's final stretch.\n\nBut if Democrats were to nominate Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or California Gov. Gavin Newsom - who are both being floated as possible Biden successors now and in 2028 - neither directly benefits from the Biden-Harris campaign's mountain of cash unless Harris is also running.\n\nThe only way, according to campaign finance experts, to ensure an entirely new ticket gets the same money would be to refund donors and ask them to contribute to a new candidate committee - a logistical nightmare wouldn't guarantee the same outcome for a new campaign.\n\nA Democratic strategist called that option \"phenomenally stupid\" but emphasized there's no modern precedent for what Democrats are currently facing. \"People are not going to donate it back ... I don't think you should ever give back money in politics,\" this person said.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign could also roll over money into a PAC, which can accept unlimited contributions but can't spend them in direct coordination with a candidate. Another PAC downside: They often pay more than candidates for TV airtime , a major campaign expense.\n\nThe campaign could also give it all to the Democratic National Committee, but even with the DNC, there are rules governing coordinating with candidates that curb how freely the committee can spend. \"That's not necessarily as effective as a campaign spending money itself,\" Noble said.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Biden's Debate Disaster Changes Nothing. There's Only One Path: Forward.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, I remember hosting a minister's breakfast in South Carolina when Congressman Jim Clyburn leaned over and said to me that he would be endorsing Joe Biden . Even then, many discounted Biden and called him too old; not able to withstand the competition or win the election. He beat all the other Democratic presidential candidates and went on to defeat then-President Donald Trump . Time and again they say Biden isn't up to the task, and time and again he delivers.\n\nOver the course of the next few days and weeks, there will be extensive parsing of Biden's and Trump's first debate of the 2024 campaign, the ramifications for each candidate and for the election itself. Already, much of the coverage is zeroed in on Biden's underperformance and on whether he should drop out of the race. Not only is this premature, but it is also highly insulting to dismiss a president's entire track record and platform because of one bad debate several months out from November. Everyone is already chiming in and calling for him to step aside, but I would argue that the president himself is the only one who can even entertain this notion. The real question is: Has Biden not earned the right to make this decision himself?\n\nWatching the debate Thursday evening, I'm reminded of my own words at the Democratic National Convention two decades ago: Our vote is soaked in the blood of martyrs, and it cannot be given away nor bargained away; those that earned our vote will get our vote.\n\nIt was Biden's leadership that rescued us from the disastrous Trump presidency and helped the nation correct course. In the midst of a historic global pandemic (one that Trump downplayed and mishandled entirely, I might add), Biden stepped in and helped us recover. His policies increased job growth, creating nearly 11 million jobs, with more people working than at any other point in American history. Under President Biden, a recession was prevented, and more people have health insurance than ever before. The president delivered historic student debt relief, signed executive orders protecting reproductive rights, signed the Respect for Marriage Act protecting marriage for LGBTQ+ and interracial couples, delivered on the most aggressive climate and environmental justice agenda, nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, passed the Inflation Reduction Act and so much more.\n\nHow can anyone honestly viewing Biden's presidency and list of accomplishments call for him to drop out because of one bad debate performance? And what about all of Trump's lies last night? In about 90 minutes, he lied about the insurrection on Jan. 6, immigration, his handling of COVID, the economy, abortion, and the list goes on. Are we really saying that showmanship is more important than substance? There is far too much on the line for people to make such rash decisions. Whether it's voting rights, criminal justice reform, reproductive rights, representation across the board, hate crime protections or democracy itself, the question isn't what will happen to Biden but rather what will happen to us?\n\nAs the conventions fast approach and the campaigns kick into full gear, the president can, and should, remind the nation about what he represents and what his opponent does not. He has to speak to the needs of the people of this country and what is best for America's future ― progressing forward or reverting to an era of division, injustice and inequality.\n\nHave we forgotten the deaths of over a million people from a deadly pandemic that Trump mishandled, or the Charlottesville march during his tenure, or his Supreme Court nominees who have already rolled back many of our gains, or the demonization of marginalized communities or the climate of hate in this country?\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

He is the only one who can say that they were a part of two major recoveries, first as vice president in the Obama administration and then in 2020. He helped the country recover from the Bush recession and disastrous policies (both domestic and international), and then helped us recover from the Trump trauma and the catastrophic state we were in. He has more than earned the right to decide where he goes, and we ought to give him more than 24 hours to make such a monumental decision.\n\nTwenty years ago, I myself ran for the presidency. The nation was still recovering from the worst terrorist attack at home and still reeling from the George W. Bush administration's disastrous handling of the crisis, including misleading us into unnecessary war. Though I did not win the Democratic Party 's nomination in 2004, I continued to push for the Democratic candidate because I understood what was at risk and the significance of that election.\n\nIn 2004, I reminded everyone that we didn't come this far playing political games. Today I say we will not continue to move forward if we indulge in political theatrics. Did President Biden show up to the debate like he did when he delivered the 2024 State of the Union address? No. But as I've often stated, he is the ultimate comeback kid. I wouldn't count him out just yet, and anyone who cares about this nation can't afford to do so."

He would wield the power of the presidency with unprecedented, incalculable cruelty and unfairness.\"\n\nShe added: \"Because of the very real hurt millions of people would feel when he is president again, the Democratic Party must not delay in thanking President Biden and supporting a talented, robust Democrat to be our party's nominee.

A new candidate could break with his confused course for good.\n\nFrom the beginning , something has been off about President Joe Biden's approach to the October 7 Hamas attack and Israel's genocidal invasion of Gaza.\n\nEven by the low standards of America's steadfast support for Israel's occupation of Palestine and Biden's own long-standing Zionism, he's been careless: endorsing baseless Israeli propaganda, bear-hugging the notoriously unreliable Benjamin Netanyahu, and slandering his own supporters as antisemites.\n\nThe disastrous presidential debate, and Biden's decision to bow out of the race, has given us a new way to understand what's been happening. Maybe Biden's approach has been thoughtless because the president is having trouble thinking.\n\nIn retrospect, Biden's incapacity has been on display since the first days following the October 7 raid. \"I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children,\" the president said, repeating a gruesome but uncorroborated rumor .\n\nThe press raced to clarify : Had Biden seen evidence that the Israelis were keeping secret? White House staff explained that the president was merely referring to Israeli media reports. We could chalk it up to a gaffe at a highly charged moment, except that Biden kept repeating the charge, leading Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler to accuse the president of exaggerating under the headline \"Biden yet again says Hamas beheaded babies. Has new evidence emerged?\" The answer was \"No.\"\n\nThe Intercept's Jeremy Scahill called Biden's constant invocation of the fantastical beheaded babies story \" inexplicable ,\" but now we know better. As two Harvard researchers wrote in a 2020 peer-reviewed study titled \" Aging in an Era of Fake News ,\" those in late adulthood tend to have \"difficulty detecting lies,\" and they place \"less emphasis on accuracy when communicating.\" Obviously this does not apply to all older adults - Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, has remained notably sharp into his 80s - but after what we saw on the debate stage and in subsequent interviews, I find it hard to argue that it doesn't fit Biden. At very least, it's an explanation that fits the facts.\n\nIf insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result, then how to describe Biden's plan to break Yemen's hold on Red Sea shipping lanes? When asked if U.S. airstrikes were working , Biden told the press , \"When you say working, are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they going to continue? Yes.\" It'd be easier to call this another gaffe if that weren't exactly what happened. Operation Prosperity Guardian airstrikes have killed dozens of Yemenis, and two Navy SEALs were lost at sea, but there has never been any hint of success for the Western alliance.\n\nOver six months after the beginning of Prosperity Guardian, U.S. forces remain locked in what personnel have called \"the most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II.\" America has been losing that battle every step of the way, something the troops aren't used to. \"I'll be honest,\" one recently returned Navy pilot told the AP about the novelty of getting shot at off Yemen, \"it was a little traumatizing for the group.\"\n\nThis drawn-out defeat is more or less what Biden said was going to happen; it's not the statement that was the mistake, it was the mission itself. Starting a deadly international fight you can't even plan to win is professional incompetence, but not being able to stop yourself from saying so out loud to the press suggests a different, more personal kind of incompetence.\n\nThough Biden is unlikely to jump to the alternate explanations - corruption or racism - in his own defense, there's evidence for both.\n\nAs a senator, Biden topped the Open Secrets list of recipients for pro-Israel money, receiving more than twice as much since 1990 as second-place Bob Menendez of New Jersey. (Menendez is corrupt: He was recently convicted at trial of acting as an overseas agent for Egypt.)\n\nWhatever combination of earnest and bought, Biden's support for Israel has never been tempered by concern for Palestinians. When the New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner suggested to former State Department official Aaron David Miller that American policymakers don't value Israeli and Palestinian lives equally, he didn't get much pushback. \"Do I think that Joe Biden has the same depth of feeling and empathy for the Palestinians of Gaza as he does for the Israelis?\" said Miller. \"No, he doesn't, nor does he convey it. I don't think there's any doubt about that.\" I have similarly little doubt that Biden's bigotry has made it easier for him to support the genocide in Gaza, but it's not sufficient to explain his conduct.\n\nBut incompetence explains Biden's actions in a way that unconditional support for the Israeli project can't. It would have been easy enough to try and muddy the waters and obscure Israel Defense Forces responsibility for the massacre at Gaza's largest hospital, for example, but there was no strategic reason for Biden to claim , as he did in November, that it was a \"fact\" that Hamas was hiding its military headquarters under al-Shifa.\n\nWhen pressed by reporters to present some, or any, evidence that this was the case, Biden said with a strange, crooked smile , \"No, I can't tell you. I won't tell you.\" He doesn't even allow a reporter to get through the follow-up: \"Do you feel absolutely confident based on what you know, that-?\" \"Yes,\" he says, holding his bizarre expression. Hamas did not , in fact, have its military headquarters in tunnels under al-Shifa Hospital , and the president has never revealed any basis for his false but absolute confidence.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nGeorge W. Bush is not famous for having been one of America's brighter presidents, but even he knew that you're not supposed to get fooled twice . Biden, on the other hand, doesn't appear to realize Netanyahu and his administration are running up the score on him: expanding the scope of the war to Lebanon, Syria, and even Iran; demanding the defunding of UNRWA under false pretenses , assassinating Western aid workers, and blocking aid trucks ; and sabotaging peace negotiations. Israeli media has even reported that Netanyahu's right-wing allies are opposing a hostage deal because it would be a victory for Biden and a \"slap in the face\" to their ally Donald Trump. None of this has upset Biden's \"bear hug\" approach to the Israeli leadership, by which he preemptively ceded any leverage America might have over the country's actions. Just look to Rafah , Biden's \"red line,\" where the IDF has called his bluff and turned Gaza's final \"safe zone\" into a killing field with impunity.\n\nAnd yet, Biden seems to earnestly believe he is doing a good, fair job. \"I'm the guy that did more for the Palestinian community than anybody,\" he told Speedy Morman of Complex. \"I mean, I've been very supportive of the Palestinians.\" When asked why an Arab or Muslim voter would support him, Biden says his leadership represents the best path to peace and a two-state solution.\n\nMeanwhile, under Biden's watch, Israel has not only been seizing land in the West Bank at an unprecedented clip, but the Knesset also overwhelmingly voted against the idea of a two-state solution, right before Biden is set to reward Netanyahu with another bear hug during his visit to address Congress in D.C. this week.\n\nLet's not even get started with the disastrous temporary pier except to say that managing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars without helping any of the hundreds of thousands of desperate people in direct proximity to the project surely represents an ironic achievement in American international aid. If still-President Biden thinks he has brought Palestinians anything but the kind of unfathomable tragedy and grief that resonates for centuries, it is the single strongest piece of evidence that he lacks the mental capacity to govern.\n\nJoe Biden will not be the Democratic nominee in November's presidential election, thankfully. He is not withdrawing because he's being held responsible for enabling war crimes against the Palestinian people (though a recent poll does have nearly 40 percent of Americans saying they're less likely to vote for him thanks to his handling of the war). Yet it's impossible to extricate the collapse in public faith in the Biden campaign from the \" uncommitted \" movement for Gaza. They were the first people to refuse him their votes, and defections from within the president's base hollowed out his support well in advance of the debate.\n\nDitching Biden won't automatically change anything, and the president is not solely responsible for Gaza, even within the White House. Anyone who is held personally responsible for a broad social crime such as genocide is, to some degree, a scapegoat - but that is not a reason to hold no one responsible. And Biden's public incapacity opens a door to a better way forward for American policy. It's time to take the keys; millions of Palestinians can't wait for next January.\n\nOriginal reporting.

That would help allow the party to cover for Biden and put a positive spin on a smooth handoff, even though we all know this would mainly benefit the embittered president himself and his small coterie of loyalists. Such a choice would confirm that the institutional rot that allowed the current situation to develop still characterizes the party.\n\nThe alternative is to force a change in policy. Harris must assure voters that, as the party's leader, she won't assume Biden's biggest mistake, effective immediately. That starts with staying out of town during Netanyahu's visit, and it has to grow from there, with public pressure from her office on the Israelis to sign a permanent ceasefire. This would in effect concede that the president's incompetence has not been harmless at all: that on the contrary, it paved the road to hundreds of thousands of awful deaths.\n\nBiden may well go down in history as Genocide Joe , a disgrace even to the job of president of the United States, roped to Israel's atrocities in the same way Lyndon Johnson is tied to the Vietnam War. The upside for the rest of us is the possibility of an end to Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza.\n\nIf the Democrats and Kamala Harris can't decide between protecting Biden's legacy and thousands of Palestinian lives, they're no more competent to lead than he is.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Biden Should Have Quit Over Gaza, but His Exit Could Be an Inflection Point\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nKamala Harris is less burdened by Biden's disastrous support for Israel's war, sparking some hope in pro-Palestine advocates.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will not run for reelection in 2024, on the eve of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the United States.\n\nWhile the announcement may dispel widespread concern surrounding the Democratic nominee's capacity to lead - especially relative to Republican nominee Donald Trump - the issue that has prompted mass protest against the Democratic incumbent still looms large over the campaign: Biden's virtually unconditional support for Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nBiden has maintained a chiefly deferential and supportive stance throughout Israel's bombardment of Gaza. Now, some see his departure as opening the possibility for a reset on U.S. policy toward Israel.\n\nFormer Biden Department of Education political appointee Tariq Habash - who resigned in January in protest of Biden's policies on the Gaza war - notes that a significant part of the base is already disillusioned with Biden because of his unwillingness to enforce U.S. law and hold Israel accountable for violations of international humanitarian law. Biden's decision also comes just two days after the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel's occupation of Palestine constitutes illegal apartheid.\n\n\"Whoever replaces the President on the ticket needs to show voters that there will be a substantive shift in policy that ends the dehumanization of Palestinians and supports Palestinian human rights, international law, and peace,\" Habash said.\n\n\"Obviously both Democrats and Republicans have a long way to go,\" he added. \"This week's visit from Netanyahu is emblematic of that, as is President Biden's refusal to hold his red lines, enforce Leahy or Foreign Assistance Act, or achieve a permanent ceasefire or return Palestinian and Israeli hostages.\"\n\nMany critics had noted that Biden's stance on Israel's war revealed concerning signs of his leadership and adaptability far before the fateful June debate.\n\n\"It was not Biden's failed debate that showed he is unfit to lead. It was the tens of thousands of bombs he sent to kill Palestinian families,\" the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights said in a statement. \"Biden's refusal to adhere to international law or enforce U.S. law has deepened Israel's illegal military occupation. The International Court of Justice's latest advisory opinion on Friday asserted that every state has a legal obligation 'not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation' created by Israel's denial of Palestinian rights.\"\n\nNo matter who replaces Biden, Riley Livermore - an Air Force major who said the Biden administration was \"complicit in genocide\" when he resigned in June - said the moment presents a possible inflection point for U.S. policy on Israel's war.\n\n\"That being said, Biden isn't stepping down because of pressure on how brutal his Gaza policy was. From my perspective, the ongoing genocide in Gaza had minimal to no impact on the pressure for him to step down. I'm still disheartened that the Democratic Party doesn't care about Palestinians and continues to offer unconditional support to Israel,\" Livermore told The Intercept, repeating that he resigned due to Biden's policies on Gaza, not his age.\n\nOne senior Democratic aide told The Intercept that they were wary of the rushed process to replace the candidate that had little to do with how Biden's support for a war that's killed 15,000 children in Gaza may have already irreparably hurt his chances among crucial voting blocs. \"The country needs to hear from an anti-war candidate who sees Palestinians as human beings,\" they said. \"It's important that our next candidate is chosen through a democratic process at an open convention.\"\n\nBiden and scores of elected officials and party caucuses have already thrown their support behind Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the Democratic ticket in November. And there have been signs that she may divert from Biden's hard-line support for Israel's campaign in Gaza.\n\nLate last year, Harris reportedly pushed the White House to be more sympathetic toward Palestinian suffering, and more forceful against Netanyahu to seek a long-term peace. In March, Harris delivered a speech in Selma, Alabama, forcefully calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\" and urging Israel to do more to increase the flow of aid to Gaza. \"No excuses,\" she insisted. While the speech seemed to mark a change in the administration's stance on the war, reports surfaced that National Security Council officials had watered down parts of her speech.\n\n\"We have to have a goal that we start working on right now, for peace and for an equal measure of security for Israelis and Palestinians,\" Harris said later that month. \"Palestinians have a right to self-determination; they have a right to dignity, and we're going to have to work on that.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThese reports have not gone unnoticed by people hoping for change in U.S. policy.\n\nLivermore said he was hopeful if Harris becomes the next president, she will take the opportunity to drastically change the U.S. posture toward Israel. \"Harris has a choice between listening to her own humanity and the overwhelming will of the American people, or listening to donors and special interest groups by continuing to make genocide part of her platform and in doing so, delegitimizing America internationally.\"\n\n\"Leaders like myself, and the other Black faith leaders who signed open letters pressuring Biden to call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza believe Harris would be much more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause if nominated,\" Rev. Michael McBride, a pastor and founder of Black Church PAC said in a statement. \"This could help reinvigorate a part of the base that has largely felt conflicted about casting a vote for Biden.\"\n\nWaleed Shahid, co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement - which has garnered over 700,000 people nationwide casting protest votes against Biden's hard-line support for Israel - also noted dissenters' openness to Harris .\n\n\"While by no means a champion of the cause, I've heard numerous people note that Vice President Harris exhibited a deeply different emotional reaction to the stories of Palestinian suffering than President Biden,\" he said in a statement. \"While the Vice Presidency is limited, many feel that she would be an improvement from Biden's severe lack of empathy for Palestinians and his ties to the AIPAC old guard in the party. However, challenging AIPAC's power within the Democratic Party establishment remains a formidable task regardless of who the nominee is.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "After Historic Ruling, Lawyers Vow to Keep Fighting Biden Over Complicity in Gaza Genocide\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Biden but implored his administration to reconsider its \"unflagging support\" for Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nA federal judge declared on Wednesday that Israel is plausibly engaging in genocide in Gaza and implored the Biden administration to reconsider its \"unflagging support\" for Israel's attacks on Palestinians.\n\nThe comments came in a ruling in response to a lawsuit that accused President Joe Biden and senior administration officials of complicity in and failure to prevent Israel's genocidal acts, as required by both international and U.S. law. The Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal organization, filed the lawsuit on behalf of two Palestinian human rights organizations and Palestinians in Gaza and in the United States.\n\nThe judge, Jeffrey S. White of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds -citing legal doctrine that prevents the judiciary from interfering in matters of foreign policy. But his strong-worded statement is unprecedented, as was his unusual decision to allow more than three hours of testimony from Palestinian plaintiffs during a powerful hearing last week, including a doctor calling into court from a Gaza hospital hallway.\n\nDuring that hearing, which took place in Oakland just hours after the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that Israel had plausibly engaged in genocide in Gaza, White described the case as the \"most difficult\" of his career.\n\n\"It is every individual's obligation to confront the current siege in Gaza, but it [is] also this Court's obligation to remain within the metes and bounds of its jurisdictional scope,\" he wrote in his decision to dismiss the case. \"There are rare cases in which the preferred outcome is inaccessible to the Court. This is one of those cases.\"\n\nJustice Department attorneys had asked the judge to dismiss the case on a technicality, citing the jurisdictional question, but did not challenge the suit on its merits. In court last week, government lawyers did not cross-examine witnesses, with the exception of a scholar of the Holocaust who testified that Israel's actions in Gaza amounted to genocide.\n\nAt a press briefing on Thursday afternoon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller declined to comment on the lawsuit and the judge's ruling but said that \"it remains our conclusion that the allegations of genocide are unfounded.\"\n\nBrad Parker, a senior adviser at Defense for Children International Palestine, one of the two organizational plaintiffs in the case, said that the decision was \"disappointing,\" but that the judge's findings - and the fact that such a hearing could take place in a U.S. courtroom in the first place - were of \"significant, historic meaning.\"\n\n\"We know that U.S. weapons are integral in the genocide that we're documenting as a Palestinian human rights organization,\" Parker told The Intercept. \"But similar to the historic ICJ decision and the increasing recognition that what Israel is carrying out is a genocide and the U.S. is complicit in those genocidal acts, I think the strong language from a U.S. federal court judge increasingly works to isolate Israel's actions and also bring pressure on the Biden administration to change course.\"\n\n\"It's clear what President Biden's complicity is in the destruction of Palestinian life,\" Parker added. \"And we're committed to doing everything that we can to end that complicity, and ultimately end the genocide.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs responded to the ruling by stressing the judge's \" historic rebuke \" of U.S. government support for Israeli crimes. They also disputed the court's jurisdictional finding, indicating an argument for a potential appeal or request for the case to be reconsidered.\n\nAhmed Abofoul, a Palestinian attorney at Al Haq, the second organizational plaintiff, testified in court last week about the killing of more than 80 of his relatives since the beginning of the war. During a press conference on Thursday, he said that the dismissal on a technicality \"doesn't mean that this was not a victory.\"\n\n\"The judge acknowledged that genocide is being committed,\" Abpfoul said, \"and basically what he was saying is just that his hands are tied.\"\n\nKatherine Gallagher, a senior attorney at CCR and lead counsel on the case , said, \"The legal conclusions are there: The U.S. is clearly on notice that its actions are in violation of both international and domestic law.\"\n\nIn his opinion, White cited an earlier suit , also brought by CCR, against Caterpillar, the manufacturer that provided the bulldozer used by an Israeli soldier to kill American peace activist Rachel Corrie in Gaza in 2003. That case was also dismissed on the basis that policy decisions are exempt from judicial review, with an appeals court upholding the dismissal. CCR attorneys argued that their case against the Biden administration is different, pledging to explore all legal avenues.\n\n\"There is a legal distinction,\" Gallagher said during the event on Thursday. The Biden administration's support for the war in Gaza is more than just \"rubber-stamping or approving the use of foreign military financing for a direct commercial sale,\" she said. \"We have the president of the United States knowing that there is an ongoing genocide and continuing to provide 'unflagging support' to Israel.\"\n\nStill, Gallagher implied that the lawsuit against Caterpillar could provide a road map for future legal action. \"Companies are now on notice because of the ICJ judgment and the U.S. court judgment if they weren't before, which they should have been. Those companies also have obligations to not further the genocide by continuing to sell and supply weapons that are being used to kill Palestinians every day.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Legal Case Against Joe Biden for Enabling Israel's Genocide Against Gaza\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs the judges at The Hague deliberate on South Africa's indictment of Israel, a lawsuit against senior U.S. officials for supporting genocide is set to begin in federal court.\n\nA panel of judges at the International Court of Justice in The Hague has entered deliberations in the preliminary phase of South Africa's historic suit against Israel, charging it with carrying out a genocide against the Palestinians of Gaza. While a final ruling in the case could take years, the judges will rule on whether to order a halt to continued Israeli military actions pending a trial.\n\nThis week on Intercepted, Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, discusses the ICJ case as well as a lawsuit CCR has filed against President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for the support and failure to prevent genocide in Gaza. Arguments will begin next week in federal court in California.\n\nGallagher, Jeremy Scahill, and Murtaza Hussain discuss what a ruling in South Africa's favor would mean for Israel's U.S.-backed war against Gaza and how the U.S. may try to shield Israel from international consequences, as it has done throughout history. They also examine the history of the U.S. judge who is currently president of the ICJ, as well as U.S. laws that require American officials to take actions to prevent, not enable, genocide, including one that was sponsored by then-Sen. Biden.\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\nWelcome to Intercepted. I'm Jeremy Scahill.\n\nMurtaza Hussain: And I'm Murtaza Hussain.\n\nJS: Maz, Joe Biden marked a hundred days of his no-holds-barred support for Israel's war of annihilation against the people of Gaza by pretending that the deaths, the maiming, the displacement of the Palestinian victims in Gaza were invisible. And I found it really interesting that Biden issued this statement, which only emphasized the Israeli deaths on October 7th and the hostages who remain in the custody of Hamas and other groups in Gaza, and made no mention of 10,000 dead Palestinian children ... That that statement was issued just as the United States was starting the observation of the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday ...\n\nI'm saying that it seemed fitting, because there's something symbolic about how Biden's statement on Gaza erased the existence of - and the deaths of - the Palestinian people while, for decades, the United States government, Democrats, and Republicans [have] tried to erase the parts of Martin Luther King's legacy that they deemed politically or morally inconvenient, specifically Martin Luther King's discussion of the way that the United States exports its violence around the world.\n\nAnd we are now waiting for judges at the International Court of Justice to rule on South Africa's genocide case against Israel, rule on the request for what are called provisional measures, which means that the South African government's lawyers are arguing that the International Court of Justice should issue provisional orders for Israel to cease its military operations in Gaza, so that the investigation and trial of the state of Israel for potential genocide in Gaza can take place, and that no further harm or death is going to be inflicted on the people of Gaza.\n\nThe world's eyes are very much on this, Maz.\n\nMH: Yeah, I was very moved by the hearing this month by the ICJ South African lawyers presenting their arguments - and I recommend listeners who haven't watched it to go back and watch it as well too,  because it was really a very symbolically powerful - and potentially legally and practically politically powerful - demonstration of South Africa showing consistency to the same values that the U.S. claimed to espouse many, many years ago, vis a vis apartheid in that country. And one person who was a quite vocal opponent of apartheid in many cases was, actually, Joe Biden at that time, Senator Joe Biden. And whereas he has shifted to what I'd have to say at this point is a chauvinistic and even xenophobic position against Palestinians, that level of disregard for their humanity, or even the acknowledgement of their own suffering, the South Africans are applying the same principles of opposition to apartheid in their country to Israel and Palestine.\n\nAnd what we've seen in the last three months since this war started has been probably worse than anything that's taken place in this conflict over 75 years. The level of death, destruction, displacement, just total human misery, is so much greater in scale, even in a conflict that's been one of the worst for a very, very long time.\n\nIt's really a turning point, and we're seeing the diminution of moral leadership - or however much moral leadership the U.S. could claim right now - being supplanted by other countries which are outside what you can say is the West, speaking up for values which were deemed to be universal, but have been abandoned by many, many of the same countries which first came up with them in the first place.\n\nJS: While we're waiting for the judges to potentially issue these provisional measures, there are several cases that have been brought that deal with the Israeli government's onslaught against the people of Gaza, one of them is taking place in federal court in the United States, and there are going to be arguments [on] January 26th of this year, just next week. There will be arguments in the case that was brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights; the case is called, \"Defense for Children International Palestine v Biden,\" and that lawsuit names Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, with failing in their legal responsibility to prevent - and also their complicity in - Israel's unfolding genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nAnd we're joined now by one of the attorneys leading that case, Katherine Gallagher. She is the Senior Staff Attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, one of the lawyers who's going to be arguing in court in California next week, in federal court, asking a judge to intervene in this case.\n\nKatie Gallagher, thanks so much for being with us here on Intercepted.\n\nKatherine Gallagher: Thank you very much for having me.\n\nJS: Katherine, in a moment, we're going to talk in detail about South Africa's case against Israel that it argued before the International Court of Justice. But first, I want to talk about the lawsuit that you're involved with, which is directing its attention at the most senior officials in the United States - Joe Biden, the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and other U.S. officials - for failure to prevent genocide. Lay out your case against these U.S. officials.\n\nKG: Sure. So, already, on October 7th, Israel was making clear its intentions against Gaza and the Palestinian population there - the 2.3 million people of whom nearly half are children. The highest level of Israel's senior political and military leadership made statements on October 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, laying out that they intended, in effect, to destroy Gaza. They equated all of the population with Hamas, they declared the entire population effectively the enemy, and they promised to shut off and cut off Gaza from the outside world. The Israeli Minister of Defense famously and horrifically declared that there would be no food, no fuel, no electricity, no water for the, quote, \"human animals\" in Gaza.\n\nAnd as the statements of intent were being made, senior levels of the United States government - including President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Austin - were likewise making declarations about their intentions in the coming days, weeks, months, as we've seen. And that was to give unconditional and complete support to Israel. That is complete military support, financial support, diplomatic support for Israel's mission in Gaza, and against the Palestinian population.\n\nSo, quite quickly, CCR saw and understood that we were in a different moment. This is not a question of simply Israel exceeding - as it often has and continually does - the limits of international humanitarian law, in terms of how it has carried out its occupation over the many decades and its 17-year blockade of Gaza. This isn't simply about breaching the Geneva Conventions and collective punishment against the Palestinian population; this was qualitatively different. Statements such as we were hearing and the immediate military assault and total siege on the Palestinian population of Gaza indicated to us already in those opening days that we were risking and fearing a genocide to be committed.\n\nSo, CCR put together a legal and factual analysis by October 18th and, in that, we laid out Israeli statements and actions demonstrating the mental element, the intention for genocide, as well as the underlying acts. And the crime of genocide, just to step back, is the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on their ethnic, religious, racial, or national identity. And that can be carried out through five underlying acts, which include: killing, the infliction of serious physical or mental harm, or the creation of conditions of life intended to destroy, in whole or in part, that group.\n\nSo, when we were hearing promises of total siege by the minister of defense, meaning cutting off all basic necessities, that was a genocidal statement. So we put together those statements and actions by Israel. And if we've learned anything over the years, it is that Israeli officials say what they mean and do what they say, so it was clear that this was what was coming.\n\nAnd then we put together what the United States officials did, those promises of support and the way that military support began to roll out to Israel. So, already, the United States gives $3.8 billion a year in military support to Israel. The United States has over $4 billion in weapons stockpiled in Israel that Israel can use. But even with all of the preexisting military support, the United States was rushing further munitions to Israel, pledging its continued support for the military operations, putting in place in the region, and in Israel, military advisors and forces to be there ready to back Israel up.\n\nSo, in doing these actions with the knowledge that Israel was planning to commit or already taking measures to commit genocide, we said that the United States was in breach of two fundamental obligations that it has under customary international law. And those obligations are the duty to prevent genocide, when it is clear that there is a serious risk of genocide, and the obligation to not be complicit or aid and abet a genocide.\n\nSo, we put out that legal briefing paper on October 18th. We sent it to President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, we sent it to the U.S. ambassador to the U. N. And as we send this warning urging the United States to comply with its international obligations, what we saw instead was the United States veto a ceasefire resolution at the security council, and pledge that there would be continual flow of weapons and support with, quote, \"no red lines.\"\n\nSo, understanding that the United States would not voluntarily comply with its legal obligations, we moved quickly to file a case and on - quickly, but it already felt so, so slow, I have to say - on November 13th, we filed a case in the northern district of California on behalf of two Palestinian human rights organizations: Defense for Children International Palestine, and Al-Haq, as well as three plaintiffs from Gaza. And I can say it's very difficult to maintain contact with our Gaza-based plaintiffs, um, and it is really a heroic action for them to file a case with the risk that comes with that.\n\nAnd then, also, on behalf of Palestinian Americans, who have family in Gaza and are themselves enduring days, weeks, months now of just absolute anguish as they watch their government, their families, their people.\n\nJS: Katherine, we also have watched as President Biden has repeated, knowingly repeated, now-proven false claims about beheaded babies. We've watched as the United States claimed that it had its own independent evidence that Hamas operated what was effectively described by the Israelis as an underground Pentagon under Al-Shifa hospital.\n\nWe had the president of the United States undermining the extent of the death toll in Gaza among civilians, particularly among children. We've had the Secretary of State Antony Blinken - not once, but at least twice - circumvent basic congressional processes for expediting weapons shipments to Israel.\n\nAnd we also have - and this is relevant to your case - the fact that there are also U.S. laws that deal with prevention of genocide; among these is the Genocide Convention Implementation Act, which was signed into law in 1988. And I went back, and I looked at the legislative history of that law, and the original sponsor of the Genocide Convention Implementation Act was a senator named Joe Biden.\n\nTalk about the U.S. legal aspect of this, and laws that, potentially, the administration is violating inside the United States.\n\nKG: The United States has unquestionably recognized its obligations to prevent and punish genocide. As you noted, yes, it was Senator Biden who finally pushed through the United States becoming a party to the genocide convention, 40 years after most other countries had. And, in his time as vice president under Barack Obama and within his own administration, he has claimed that the prevention of mass atrocities and specifically identified genocide is a matter of national policy and national priority.\n\nBut when it comes to the genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, again, half of the victims are children who have been killed, rendered orphans, maimed, homeless, with no schools to go to. When president Biden issued a statement over the weekend marking 100 days since October 7th, he failed completely to recognize the harms that have occurred and been carried out against the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza.\n\nThere is no reference to the fact that over 23,000 people have been killed. And that number, of course, is really an unknown, because so many people are buried under the rubble, and Gaza is cut off from the outside world. To a large extent, that statement did not talk about the way that U.S. weapons from the air, from the sea, from the ground, are being used every day to maim and kill Palestinians.\n\nThat statement was limited to discussing the hostages and, really, not only didn't repeat the falsehoods - again, which is incredible that President Biden continues to put forward falsehoods about the very serious harms that have been carried out, no doubt, since October 7th - but he just is ignoring the human cost and responsibilities. Indeed, the U.S. has put forward, about a year ago, a submission to the International Court of Justice in the case of Ukraine v Russia.\n\nIn that submission, in that intervention, the United States recognizes that the duties to prevent genocide and the responsibility, the prohibition on complicity in genocide,  are what's called erga omnes obligations. These are the highest level of obligations on states, and that violation of these obligations is, again, the highest level of violation of international law.\n\nSo, the Biden administration knows what the law is internationally, and it knows what the law is domestically. It has expressed that these are also policy principles for the administration. But when it comes to implementation, when the victims are Palestinian and the perpetrators are Israel, we see the United States do a 180 and absolutely ignore its obligations to not provide the means by which a genocide is being carried out.\n\nAnd as, again, the United States has recognized in pleadings that it's made elsewhere, that is a form of aiding and abetting genocide, and that is prohibited, again, under both international and domestic law.\n\nMH: So, Katie, in addition to your own filing domestically, this month, South Africa had an 84-page filing at the International Court of Justice, drawing upon many of the same very incriminating statements made by Israeli officials at the outset of this military campaign in October. The 84-page filing describes the military campaign as exceptionally brutal, and says that genocidal actions have been taking place that constitute flagrant violations of Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nCan you tell us, just in brief, what is the significance of South Africa bringing this case to the ICJ, and what could the consequences be for Israel, if it's found culpable of violating a genocide convention, ultimately?\n\nKG: South Africa's filing against Israel at the International Court of Justice in The Hague is truly a historic document, and a historic moment. The hearings that took place last week was a day that I think anyone who listened or watched, and certainly for some of the Palestinians who traveled from Gaza to be there in the court and hear that, it was a day that won't be forgotten.\n\nSouth Africa put the genocide in a context, which I think is so important in this moment where, for many, the clock starts on October 7th. It framed the current genocide in the context of the Nakba and Israel's action since 1948, through the prolonged belligerent occupation and the closure of Gaza for the last 17 years. So that, in and of itself, I think, was quite notable.\n\nAnd then it laid out in great detail the horrifying truths that we all have borne witness to. And one of the Council for South Africa spoke particularly powerfully about how this is a genocide that has been broadcast, and we are all watching. And Gazans, Palestinians in Gaza are using whatever means they have, with the limited electricity that they have, to try and broadcast their own destruction, with the hope that someone will hear an action will be taken, and that is what South Africa did on behalf of the Palestinian people.\n\nAnd knowing it was South Africa, with its history of fighting off a colonialist apartheid regime, was very profound. And I think, for the South Africans in the court, they felt that weight of moral responsibility, and this is a country that met the moment. They really showed up, not just legally, but with heart and with love.\n\nAnd, for me, listening as an international lawyer, where so often we have to maybe cabin off parts of ourselves to just focus on the facts, applying them to the law. What was done so beautifully by South Africa was hitting every single legal element, but continually grounding it back in humanity, and explaining what this case is ultimately about. And it's about our shared humanity, and that is something that the Genocide Convention, being a reflection of a global commitment to never again target a population because of who they are, this global movement, and the question for all of us as to whether or not we are truly committed to global humanity, I think was as much what came out over those three hours of argument.\n\nEqual to arguments around provisional measures, and what's the scale and scope of what a provisional measure might be, or whether specific intent was satisfied, and explaining it in detail which, again, South Africa did so well, the ways that this underlying act of creating conditions of life to destroy, in whole or in part, a population, they really explained that. And powerfully used the warning statements over these last three months by U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations, about the impact of Israel's actions. And, again, actions that matched their statements of intent.\n\nSo, there was a lot that was in the courtroom. But the fact that South Africa was the state that was there for Palestinians, I think, really, was so powerful.\n\nMH: And Katie, as a follow up, I'm curious about the potential implications of a verdict in this case. Obviously, there have been many international injunctions against Israel on various issues, including over the apartheid wall in the West Bank, and Israel has generally tended to ignore those rulings and continue on without meaningful political consequence.\n\nIf there is a final guilty verdict of genocide in this case, which I believe could take quite a while to come, what would the consequences be for Israel? Is it something that they could continue to brush off? And, secondly, can you explain the context of provisional rulings that the court could make, because, obviously, the situation in Gaza is a crisis happening right now, and there could be injunctions short of a final ruling that come in the coming days or weeks. What might those mean, and can Israel and its supporters in the U.S. or in the European Union elsewhere, can they ignore these rulings as they have in the past?\n\nKG: Yes. Right now at the International Court of Justice, we are in the very first phase of a case. South Africa, because of the urgency of the moment, has asked the World Court to put in place some provisional measures while the merits of the case are being adjudicated. And, just to draw a parallel, that is the same thing that we have asked the court in California to do in our genocide case against President Biden.\n\nWe have sought a preliminary injunction, where we say, at this moment, because of the ongoing risk of or actual genocide, we need you, court, to act now. So, it's a very similar proceeding to a preliminary injunction, where you're asking the court to enjoin cert to stop and cease and desist certain actions because of the huge risk of irreparable harm. You can't bring back human lives that are lost in the course of a genocide by finding a good ruling three years down the road.\n\nSo, what South Africa has asked the court to do - and this is why the hearing happened less than two weeks after South Africa's application - is to put in place a number of measures. The first of which is to order a ceasefire, to stop the military assault on Gaza, and this is something that has been ordered in prior proceedings. I mentioned that there is a case pending between Ukraine and Russia. And, in those proceedings, the International Court of Justice did order a secession of military activities. So, a ceasefire is one of the steps that South Africa is asking the court to take right now, and we could see an order from the court within weeks.\n\nNow, even if it doesn't order the complete secession of hostilities, the total siege is also an underlying act of genocide; the starvation that the population is facing right now, the denial of access to medical care because Gaza is sealed. These are measures that, if the total siege were to be lifted and the court were to order that, it would also be taking out one of the underlying acts of genocide. So, there are concrete measures that the court can take that would have a direct and immediate impact on the Palestinian population in Gaza, in saving lives.\n\nWhat that means more broadly ... Certainly, Israel may choose to not comply with provisional measures that would be very akin to what Putin decided in Russia after the ICJ made its ruling. So, that would be the framework in which Israel is operating, that of Russia's government. And that position has been highly criticized by the United States, by the European Union, and by most countries in the world that say we have to respect rulings from the International Court of Justice.\n\nSo, first, for Israel, it will put them further on the outside of the international legal order, so to speak, in a way that being labeled or found to be a committer of genocide certainly will, as well. But the provisional measures would have larger ramifications, too, for all of the countries of the world, and certainly all of the signatories of the Genocide Convention. Because every country, every state has the obligation to prevent and to punish genocide.\n\nSo, if the International Court of Justice were to rule that at this moment there's a serious risk of genocide, or an ongoing genocide, and it can be either all states, and especially those states that have the ability to influence Israel's behavior, must take immediate action, or themselves also be in breach of it of the ICJ's ruling.\n\nSo, that means that the United States and all of the European countries, Australia, countries that are providing military support to the genocide must cease doing so. So, we may see a change in behavior by those countries who are providing the means and support by which Israel is carrying out its genocidal acts. We will see countries having to take a different position regarding support for the total siege of Gaza and, ultimately, arguably, for the occupation of Gaza.\n\nAnd if the entire European Union, the United States, Australia, Canada, and other countries decide that at this moment they're going to simply ignore the International Court of Justice's ruling, that does throw into question the legitimacy of the entire legal system, and that is no small outcome.\n\nI think, for some, there may already be serious questions about the efficacy of the international legal order and these international treaties, but international law does provide some backstops and parameters by which countries are expected to act. And, if decisions by the world court are easily ignored, it really does raise questions as to where and how countries will act.\n\nJS: Benjamin Netanyahu, after Israel finished its rebuttal at the International Court of Justice, gives a speech in which he says, quote, \"Nobody will stop us. Not the Hague, not the Axis of Evil, and not anybody else.\" Your response to Netanyahu.\n\nI mean, first of all, they introduced - the South Africans did - at court, statements that Netanyahu and others made, including Netanyahu's invoking of the biblical tale of Amalek, where God orders the Israelites to kill all of the men, women, children, infants, and cattle. And the Israeli lawyers basically said, oh, the South Africans don't understand theology, and, by the way, they've failed to continue reading the quote where Netanyahu characterizes the Israeli Defense Force as the most moral army in the history of humanity, and says that we only go after the terrorists.\n\nBut Netanyahu, already - even before there's been any ruling, even on provisional measures - is saying, nobody will stop us. Not the Hague, not the Axis of Evil, and not anybody else.\n\nKG: Yes. Prime Minister Netanyahu's statements stood in stark contrast to what Israel's lawyers tried to do over three hours on Friday in The Hague, and that was to tell the court: don't worry, we have it under control, trust us, and we're scaling back operations anyway. So, just let us wrap this up.\n\nThat was essentially what three hours of argument by Israel boiled down to, with statements of self-defense, and legitimizing or justifying their actions also attempted in that time. And then when you had Netanyahu come out the next day and say, hey, no, we won't follow anything, we can do what we want.\n\nI think for judges who are currently considering the application for professional measures, that will give them serious pause as to whether or not they can or should trust Israel.\n\nJS: Katie, on that issue, though, of the judges, I do want to make sure to ask you a question about the current president of the court. She happens to be an American, Joan Donahue, she's the chief judge on this panel. Her term ends, I think, next month, but she clearly is going to be presiding at least over this phase of the proceedings dealing with potential provisional measures.\n\nFor people that aren't in the weeds on all of this: Joan Donahue, she served in the Obama administration at the State Department, and she was the principal legal advisor to the State Department under Hillary Clinton, at a time that the Obama administration was dramatically expanding American drone strikes, the U.S. assassination programs.\n\nBut, deeper back in Donahue's history, she was a legal advisor for the United States when Nicaragua sued the United States at the world court for backing the contra death squads in Nicaragua, for the mining of the harbors and the shores around Nicaragua. And the court in that case had 15 decisions that it voted on, and it found in its verdict that the United States was in breach of its obligations under international law, not to use force against another state, not to intervene in its affairs, not to violate its sovereignty, not to interrupt peaceful maritime commerce, and in breach of a number of other treaties.\n\nSo, this judge has very deep ties to, not just powerful figures within the United States, but served at some of the highest levels of the U.S. State Department, also served as part of the defense of the United States when it argued that the court had no jurisdiction to hear Nicaragua's claims about the United States sponsoring death squads in their country.\n\nKG: Yeah. Thank you for sharing all of that background. And I would just add two more pieces that I think should be considered when we're thinking about these judges, and that is that Judge Donahue in the last four years has twice weighed in on the obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nShe has found in the Gambia case against Myanmar that there are duties to prevent genocide for all states, and outlined that sending weapons in support of a genocide can be a form of complicity. And then she made the same ruling in the context of Ukraine v Russia. So, this is a judge who is also on record in The Hague about what the obligations are for all states.\n\nSo, stepping back, we have a panel of 15 judges at the ICJ, and it is a diverse set of judges. And we often see that there can be dissents or concurring opinions because those countries on both sides of a dispute are allowed to have their own judge. So, South Africa appointed a judge, Israel appointed a judge.\n\nAnd because of the geopolitical nature of things, we often see, when you have a judge from the United States, for example, and a judge from Russia, that they may not be aligned ... And a judge from China. You have some of the dynamics that we see in the security council.\n\nSo, I'm not going to prejudge at this moment what Judge Donahue may or may not decide in this case, but what I would say is, the jurisprudence of the international court of justice is very clear on what the obligations are for Israel, and for all other states, including the United States. And if there were to be a carveout from that jurisprudence given to Israel - and, again, by extension, those countries that are failing to prevent or indeed even supporting Israel's genocide - I think that this court that President Donahue is currently the president of will have a serious crisis of legitimacy on its hands. And I hope that that is a factor that all judges at the International Court of Justice are taking into account.\n\nWe need an International Court of Justice to be independent, to apply the facts to the law equally for all peoples in protection of all peoples, and being willing to hold the powerful to account. So, I agree that this is a moment of reckoning for international justice and accountability, and I hope that a majority of judges - if not all judges - recognize the gravity of the current situation for Palestinians in Gaza, and issue the provisional measures with urgency that are needed to save lives.\n\nMH: You know, Katie, genocide itself is a crime that has universal jurisdiction, and if the ICJ finds that Israel and Israeli officials are culpable of genocide, in this case in Gaza, it would also open the door, I think, to domestic courts in other countries filing their own charges against Israeli officials, which could preclude them from travel, which could lead them to the danger of extradition when they do travel to various places.\n\nAnd you mentioned Vladimir Putin recently as well, too. He also has notably been pretty grounded in Russia since the ICC issued this warrant against him. So, international law, even though the enforcement of it is in many cases lacking, it could have knock on effects for how people comport themselves vis a vis domestic criminal culpability.\n\nCan you talk a bit about what some of the concrete fears may be on the part of Israeli officials if they are found culpable in this case? And, you know, Benjamin Netanyahu is continuing to make these very provocative statements about the Hague, and ignoring its ruling, and so forth. But also, it seems like the Israelis have been a bit chastened or a bit worried about this case, given how hard they're now fighting against it.\n\nTalk a bit about what could happen if Israel finds itself in legal jeopardy as a result of a ruling by the ICJ.\n\nKG: Yes. I think it is quite notable that right after South Africa filed its application on December 29th, the tone, the rhetoric coming out of Israel was different, if not yet the actions on the ground. So, right there, we do see that international law has some power, and enforcement looks different at the international level than it might in a pure criminal case at the domestic level.\n\nThe levers of enforcement of something like the obligation to prevent or to punish genocide could take the form of sanctions, it could take the form of divestment from Israel. It could take the form of support for a ceasefire resolution at the security council, if a resolution were to come up again.\n\nSo, one thing could very well be criminal cases at the national level against senior Israeli officials and others who have perpetrated or supported the genocide against the Palestinian population. But it could also be what might be seen as softer forms of enforcement and accountability, and isolating Israel in a way that it hasn't felt before.\n\nAnd I think here it's important to go back to the South African example, and the fact that it's South Africa that brought the case. In many ways, we may be finding ourselves back in the 1980s, again, in a slightly more positive way, where we have the feeling of the waning days of the apartheid regime in South Africa, where you have the majority of the world saying: This must stop, we have to take actions to end this, and doing so using diplomatic and legal measures to isolate apartheid South Africa.\n\nAt this moment, the United States stands alone at the security council in blocking ceasefire resolutions, in condemning the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians, and the destruction of so much of the Gaza Strip. The rendering of 1.8 million people unhoused at this moment with so many of their homes destroyed. The United States is really out there almost on its own. We even see changes in language and, possibly, of actions, by the U.K., by France, by Australia.\n\nSo, when Israel at the world court on Friday spoke of South Africa as a terrorist-supporting state, I believe it further reignited the division between maybe the Global North and the Global South, or even countries that abide by basic principles of humanity, and those that think it's OK to colonize and kill those who are other or different.\n\nSo, the ramifications of the ICJ proceedings, I think, are already being felt, in terms of making states choose which sides they are on, the side of humanity or the side of arrogance and destruction of the other. And the concrete ruling will have even further effect, both legally, in the form of potential cases at the national level, and certainly diplomatically, where we may see moves to isolate Israel, and also to have countries behave differently, in terms of how much support they are willing to give to a regime that is attempting a genocide against the Palestinian people.\n\nJS: There's been decades of ... And it's not, it's certainly not just the Democrats. I mean, both Democrats and Republicans, when they're in power, have used the full force of the United States government to protect Israel from any international consequences for its actions. This is certainly true at the United Nations, and at the security council through the use of the veto.\n\nIn fact, one of the great scandals of the early Trump era was this maneuvering that took place to try to assure Israel that Trump was going to be on its side if the Obama administration directed the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. at the time to simply abstain on a vote that was against Israel's policies in the West Bank. That was one of the real scandals that was drowned out by the Russiagate stuff.\n\nBut also, I think it bears repeating that there is a law on the books in the United States that was signed by George W. Bush in 2002, that is known in the human rights law community as the Hague Invasion Act. And it relates directly, not to the International Court of Justice, but to the International Criminal Court, because the International Criminal Court can prosecute individual leaders, whereas the ICJ is dealing with nation states and the crimes of states. But the ICC can actually prosecute individuals, and has prosecuted individuals.\n\nAnd that law that was signed in 2002 was passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority; it was 75-19 in the Senate. Notably, Joe Biden dissented on that and voted against it. But, just to remind people, what that act authorizes, it provides for the President of the United States to, quote, \"Use all means necessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any person who is detained by the International Criminal Court.\" That is, not just a member of the United States Armed Forces or an official of the United States government, but also covered allied persons, meaning personnel from NATO states. But then it also specifies major non-NATO allies of the United States, including Australia, Egypt, Japan, Argentina, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Israel.\n\nSo, you know, there also are cases that are in process where there's an effort to try to get an arrest warrant issued for Netanyahu and other Israeli officials at the ICC. I don't think there's any chance in hell that that's going to happen, but, you know, I respect the effort.\n\nBut that's how extreme - and this is the point I'm making - this is how extreme the U.S. position is on the application of international law to not just the United States and its actions, but the actions of its allies, including Israel. And when we look at that, that the U.S. actually has a law that says the president can use military force, essentially invade The Hague in the Netherlands to, quote-unquote, \"liberate American personnel,\" or, in this case, potentially Israeli personnel, you understand what the people of Gaza are up against when it comes to international law.\n\nAnd what I want to ask you specifically, though, is: at the end of the day, if provisional measures are ordered by the court, and Israel is told it must cease its active military operations pending this litigation moving forward at the International Court of Justice, is, at the end of the day, Katie, can't the U.S. stop it? Even using legitimate legal maneuvers at the United Nations, isn't it true that the U.S. can actually, at the end of the day, stop that, and halt the court from doing it?\n\nKG: Look, I think the United States can try, but in the long term, or even the midterm, the United States is taking on a losing battle if it is willing to take the measures that you just described, and to buck international law as blatantly as it would be demanded, if the ICJ were to order a ceasefire. If the United States were to say, well, sorry, we're going to continue to rush 155 millimeter artillery worth $106 million to Israel, which it did the same day. It did not issue the veto against the ceasefire resolution. Or send tank munitions worth $150 million without going to Congress, which it did on December 29th, the same day that South Africa filed the application at the International Court of Justice.\n\nIf it continues this behavior of aiding and abetting a genocide, then the United States is making clear that it, too, is a pariah state. I think there are already many countries in the world, and many of us, who doubt that the United States really believes the principles of international law that it urges others, or demands others comply with. But such a blatant break with principles that, again, just last year in the Ukraine v Russia proceedings it espoused, really will take a lot of explaining to do.\n\nAnd I think, also, with the International Criminal Court, we have a prosecutor right now, Karim Khan, who has raised many questions for those who want to see the ICC succeed in being an independent arbiter of justice and accountability. We have not seen the kinds of statements - and certainly not the kinds of actions - needed to meet the moment with an ongoing genocide in Gaza. But I think for someone like Karim Khan, a decision by the International Court of Justice that recognizes an unfolding genocide against the Palestinian people will make inaction by him far more difficult.\n\nSo, while we might not see an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu, we might see an arrest warrant against the minister of defense who ordered a total siege against the Palestinian population that has led to mass starvation. And that is not only an underlying act of genocide, it is also part of a crime against humanity, of extermination. It is also a war crime. There is a war crime of starvation. And that is something that we have heard even the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, warn against repeatedly in the last few weeks and months.\n\nSo, I do think there will be spillover effects that reach not only Israel, but the United States, if the ICJ puts out a ruling that acknowledges that there is an unfolding genocide. And that requires all states to take measures to stave off the risk of further death and destruction for Palestinians.\n\nMH: Katie, I just want to ask you one more question to put things in a broader perspective. Obviously, the ICJ and these other institutions of international law were created kind of out of the moment of World War II, and the destruction and the chaos that had been unleashed, to try to put some sort of guidelines around human rights, and the way states and peoples are allowed to deal with each other.\n\nAnd now, it seems like, with this crisis, it's almost come to an inflection point, because the United States, the country which did the most - in theory and however flawed - to try to build this infrastructure, and promote it, and lend it some legitimacy, is now faced with a situation where it may be the prime abettor of violations, of very brazen violations of international law by a client state. And even directly complicit itself in active genocide for its own officials. And it may, as you said, it may end up being in this position, rejecting or ignoring injunctions directly aimed at its own actions.\n\nCan you talk about what the implications would be for the U.S. to turn its back so brazenly on international law in a situation where we have such damning and incriminating evidence in the clear light of day? And what would that mean for the entire project of international law in the post-World War II system, which people had tried to create very much in earnest for all these years.\n\nKG: I think you said it absolutely correctly, in identifying this as an inflection point. We are at a critical moment for humanity, and for the principles under good international law, which are supposed to be about the protection of humanity.\n\nWe had an amicus brief go into our case in the U.S. proceedings, our case against Biden, by 77 human rights organizations, bar associations, international legal organizations that are committed to ensuring that the best of international law, the best of those principles, apply equally for the protection of all. And that brief warned about the real risk to the international legal order, and to humanity, if the United States continues down the course of action that it's on, of fueling, rather than ending, a genocide.\n\nIt spoke about the fact that there would be a complete erosion of rights. And, as a Palestinian human rights defender that some of us know, Raji Sourani often says, \"We either have the rule of law or the rule of the jungle.\" And I think we are at that moment.\n\nWhat was also important, though, about that amicus brief is it put in context how we got to this place that is a breaking point, and that it went back to the post-9/11 so-called \"war on terror.\" The United States's embrace of torture regimes. embrace of so-called \"targeted killings,\" embrace of a global battlefield where it could bomb and shoot anyone who they considered a, quote, \"terrorist,\" with impunity and without explanation. Or where they can have a preventive, so-called \"preventive\" war against Iraq. A war by choice that led to a horrifying occupation with tremendously cruel and long lasting impacts for the Iraqi population and their country.\n\nThis is the context that we need to see to understand why a case at the International Court of Justice between South Africa and Israel is about much more than just the outcome in a judgment. It's really about what kind of world we want to have, and is it going to be one where some powers have to comply with the law while punishing others who don't. Or will it be a moment where the law will equally protect and hold the powerful to account?\n\nImpunity breeds repetition and recurrence, and what we've seen from Israel with its military assaults on Gaza - in 2009, in 2012, in 2014, in 2018, in 2021 - is that each military assault they've gotten farther, been even more brutal, with more destruction, more death, and they've never had to pay a cost. And that is why, at this moment, we have at least 23,000 Palestinians who've been killed, 1.9 million who've been displaced, and so much of the infrastructure, including homes, destroyed in Gaza.\n\nSo, international law really needs, at this moment, to be given effect, or else we are in a point of a true lawlessness, and it will extend far beyond the occupied Palestinian territory in Israel, or even far beyond what the United States has done in black sites it over the years of the War on Terror. It really will be a lawlessness that will be global.\n\nAnd I think when we see so much risk of the end of democracy, as we've been experiencing these last five, ten years, it's really quite a concerning moment. A scary moment.\n\nJS: On that dark note, Katie Gallagher, I want to thank you very much for being with us here on Intercepted.\n\nKG: Thank you.

      "text": "That Time Joe Biden Was Banned From Negotiating With Republicans\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden negotiating a debt ceiling with Kevin McCarthy was Harry Reid's worst nightmare.\n\nFrom the moment Joe Biden announced his candidacy, the biggest risk the country faced from a potential Biden presidency was that he would wind up in high-stakes negotiations with Republican congressional leaders and those Republicans would fleece him blind.\n\nFor months, Biden insisted that he wouldn't ever be in that room, because he simply wasn't going to negotiate with Republicans over lifting the debt ceiling. But he also poured cold water on invoking the 14th Amendment or minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin, which handed Republicans all the leverage. Biden also had the chance to lift the debt ceiling at any point from January 2021 until last December when Democrats still controlled both houses of Congress. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., recently told Politico not doing so is one of his biggest regrets.\n\nInstead, Biden went into negotiations with congressional Republicans without a serious offer of his own. He made a few half-hearted suggestions that a better way to cut the deficit is to target hedge fund managers and the superrich. But when Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy objected, he dropped it. Talks continued at the White House between McCarthy and Biden Monday evening. But with Biden now negotiating the size of the cut, Democrats' only hope is that Republicans can't agree and fail to seize the moment.\n\nAll of this is reminiscent of the last time Biden, as vice president, intervened in high-stakes Capitol Hill negotiations. Afterward, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ordered the White House to never send him down again. He did such a bad job that he got a worse deal out of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell than McConnell had already agreed to give Reid. I covered this moment in my last book, \" We've Got People: From Jesse Jackson to AOC, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement ,\" which was excerpted in The Intercept.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt all came at the end of 2012, and the circumstances were similar. President Barack Obama had just stomped Republican Mitt Romney at the polls in a post-Occupy campaign that centered on economic inequality. Democrats picked up two seats in the Senate, expanding their majority to 53 and adding Elizabeth Warren to their ranks. Though Democrats won more House votes nationwide and picked up a net of eight seats, Republicans held onto the House narrowly.\n\nThe major tax cuts pushed through by President George W. Bush were set to expire at the end of 2012, creating what was called a fiscal cliff. If Congress did nothing, taxes would go up on everybody. Reid told me in an interview for \"We've Got People\" that going over the cliff was precisely his plan. Reid said, \"I thought that would have been the best thing to do because the conversation would not have been about raising taxes, which it became, it would have been about lowering taxes.\"\n\nIn other words, let all the rates go up and then bargain with Republicans to reduce taxes just for middle class and poor people. McConnell similarly knew the difficult position going over the cliff would put him in, and in talks with Reid, he agreed to let rates on people making more than $250,000 per year go back up.\n\nReid felt like he had successfully pushed McConnell to the brink; McConnell had a strong sense that Reid intended to go over the cliff and put Republicans up against a wall. It was now Sunday, December 30, 2012, and Democrats only had to hold out until Tuesday to find themselves in a dramatically improved political position, as the dawning of the new year would mean the tax cuts expired and automatically reverted to pre-Bush levels. At that point, it would be Republicans who would be left pleading for rate cuts.\n\nIn desperation, McConnell reached out directly to Vice President Biden, calling him on the phone and explaining that Reid was refusing to be reasonable. Over the course of the day, McConnell and Biden struck a deal. A senior Republican aide told me, \"Biden gave Republicans everything they wanted in exchange for fixing the fiscal cliff problem.\"\n\nJust like today, the fiscal cliff was only a problem because Biden allowed it to be. Reid would have been happy to drive the car off the cliff and then fight it out amid the wreckage.\n\nIn the same way, Biden could have just ignored the debt ceiling, invoked the 14th Amendment, declaring the debt ceiling unconstitutional, and dared Chief Justice John Roberts to blow up the global economy. McCarthy himself would publicly complain but be privately relieved that he had gotten through this moment with his speakership intact. Future presidents would thank Biden. If future Congresses wanted to rein in spending, they could rein in spending. But they could not threaten the global economy to do it.\n\nOn the morning of New Year's Eve back in 2012, Reid was still feeling good about his position, still ignorant of what Biden had given away. Then McConnell took to the Senate floor and announced that he'd been in talks with the vice president, they were progressing well, and he was hopeful that they'd have legislation to move by the end of the day.\n\nAs details of the deal began leaking out, progressive Democratic senators were floored. A large group of them - including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Al Franken of Minnesota, and Tom Harkin of Iowa - stormed over to Reid's office.\n\nThe deal was awful, they told Reid, and it had to be stopped. Reid told them what had happened, that it was out of his hands and that McConnell had gone around him to Biden. He said he was working on improving it and would be in touch throughout the day.\n\nNone of the senators had any business scheduled - it was New Year's Eve, after all - so Sanders invited them back to his office in the Dirksen building. The Hart building had a popcorn machine, so Harkin asked his staff to bring some by. The crew ended up spending several hours together in Sanders's office, thinking through potential strategies of opposition and waiting to hear from Reid.\n\nInstead, one senator's phone rang, and it was Biden, calling to sell the deal he had cut. In classic Biden fashion, he offered a 10- to 15-minute soliloquy, a meandering argument that largely boiled down to, \"You can trust me; I'm your friend; this is a good deal.\" The senator could barely get a word in before the conversation ended.\n\nMoments after he hung up, another cellphone rang, and it was Biden again. Unaware that the group was all together, Biden proceeded to call each of them, one after the other, delivering the same spiel.\n\nUltimately, it fell to Reid to drag the progressive senators into line. Once it was clear that the White House was on board with Biden's deal and McConnell was all in, that meant that there would be at least 70 or 80 votes for it. The progressive bloc could vote no, but it would only send a message of discord and have no effect on the outcome, Reid told them, coaxing them to support the deal he himself loathed. In the end, all the progressive senators except Harkin voted for the deal. It passed 89-8.\n\nYears later, Reid still regretted how it went down. He told me, \"If we'd have gone over the cliff, we'd have had resources to do a lot of good things in the country - infrastructure development - but it didn't work out that way.\" Letting all the tax rates go back to pre-Bush levels would have yielded the Treasury around $3 trillion over 10 years. Without the deal, taxes on dividend payments to the rich would have been set at 39.6 percent. Under the terms of the deal, they would be set at 20 percent, meaning that the superwealthy would be paying lower tax rates on their passive dividend income than many working people would pay on their wages. It helped fuel the inequality that keeps getting worse and added trillions to the debt at the same time.\n\nNow Biden has another chance to be in the room, and so far, he's getting outmaneuvered by McCarthy.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "\"And I Was Surprised\": On Federal Death Row, They Feared Biden Would Set Up Another Trump Killing Spree\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden's commutations for 37 of 40 people on death row brought relief for the men and their loved ones.\n\nRejon Taylor awoke to the sound of voices outside his death row cell just after 5 a.m. on Monday morning. A neighbor in the Special Confinement Unit at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where the federal government sends men it has sentenced to die, was talking about a segment he caught on NPR.\n\n\"One guy, he wakes up early and listens to the radio,\" Taylor told me later that morning. \"And he was like, 'Hey, I think I heard them say something about Biden - he commuted the sentences of 37 guys.'\"\n\nTaylor turned on CNN. Sure enough, the news was written on the screen.\n\n\"And I was surprised,\" he said softly, with a blend of joy and relief. \" Surprised .\"\n\nSince the reelection of Donald Trump, a rising chorus of activists, lawmakers, and members of the legal community had been calling on President Joe Biden to commute the sentences of all 40 men on federal death row to life without parole.\n\nAlthough Taylor was one of the dozens who had filed an application asking for clemency, he was not optimistic. He started feeling a glimmer of hope on Friday night, when he checked his email to find an article from the Wall Street Journal saying that Biden was mulling mass commutations. He printed it out and made copies for his neighbors. \"This is my FIRST time feeling REAL hope about commutations for the row!\" he said.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nOnly four years ago, Taylor and his neighbors lived through an unprecedented execution spree that left him deeply traumatized. Between July 2020 and January 2021, the Trump administration executed 13 people in the federal death chamber. As an orderly, Taylor cleaned out the death watch cells where the men would await their execution. His clemency petition described how he carefully packed up any belongings left behind, approaching the task \"as a small measure of dignity he could give to his fellow man.\"\n\nTaylor was sentenced to death in 2008 for fatally shooting an Atlanta restaurateur named Guy Luck. His lawyers described it as a botched kidnapping that crossed state lines into Tennessee. Taylor was 18 years old at the time and had never been convicted of a crime.\n\nHis trial, which took place in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was rooted in racism, his post-conviction attorneys argued. A woman who served as an alternate on his jury later told a local reporter that she'd heard other jurors say they needed to \"make an example\" of Taylor. \"It was like, here's this little black boy,\" she said of fellow jurors' sentiment. \"Let's send him to the Chair.\"\n\nLike many who commit violent crimes in their youth, Taylor, who is now 40, matured considerably over his 16 years on death row, developing a reputation as someone who showed deep empathy and care toward his neighbors. My own correspondence with Taylor dating back to 2020 reflects this too. In our most recent conversations, he was more interested in advocating for his neighbors than he was to talk about himself.\n\nTaylor had not yet spoken to his family when he sent me an email on Monday night. His lawyer Kelley Henry, a supervisory assistant federal public defender, had shared the news with his sister, whose birthday is Christmas Eve. Recounting their exchange, Taylor said, \"My sister cried, saying this was the BEST birthday gift for her.\"\n\nHenry, who still represents people on Tennessee's death row , wrote in a statement that she was \"profoundly grateful to President Biden for his extraordinary act of mercy and grace.\" She expressed hope that the commutations would serve as an example to state executives like Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee . She wrote, \"The death penalty is a relic of the past and should be left there.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBiden's 37 commutations were historic - a sweeping act of mercy never seen before from a U.S. president. Although his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama presided over a de facto moratorium on federal executions, due in part to the inability to procure drugs for lethal injection, he commuted only one federal death sentence, along with that of one man on military death row. Of the 13 people executed by Trump, 10 of them had sought clemency from Obama before he left office.\n\nIn his statement announcing the commutations, Biden, who reimposed the moratorium immediately upon taking office, made clear he did not wish to repeat Obama's mistake. \"In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Biden ran on an anti-death penalty platform in 2020, many advocates had quietly worried that he would leave office without taking action. Over his decades in government, Biden made a name for himself as a \"tough on crime\" senator who did more than almost anyone to expand the federal death penalty in the first place.\n\nPressure on Biden to make good on his vow to end the federal death penalty came from all quarters, behind the scenes at the White House, and in public demonstrations. Last week, activists and death row family members appeared alongside Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., at a briefing on Capitol Hill.\n\nAfter the commutations were announced, some argued that Biden did not go far enough. Members of the abolitionist group Death Penalty Action called on him to commute the sentences of the remaining three men on federal death row, who include Dylann Roof, the self-declared white supremacist who murdered nine parishioners at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. In his statement, Biden characterized the three men denied clemency as guilty of \"terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\"\n\nDeath Penalty Action Board President Sharon Risher, who lost her mother and cousin in Roof's massacre, was emotional in a Zoom call for reporters on Monday morning.\n\n\"I need the president to understand that when you put a killer on death row, you also put their victim's families in limbo with the false promise that we must wait until there is an execution before we can begin to heal,\" she said.\n\nAmong those who represent people facing execution, however, each life spared was a source of celebration - and palpable relief.\n\nVeteran attorney Margaret O'Donnell, who has spent decades advocating for people on federal death row, described a flurry of phone calls from men whose sentences were commuted.\n\n\"Over the years, I have learned their life stories, shared their fears, known their pain of living in solitary confinement so far from those they love and have come to deeply appreciate how they do their best to live meaningful lives,\" she told me.\n\nO'Donnell had spent part of her time since Trump's execution spree coordinating a visitation program to help death row families stay in touch with their loved ones. Earlier this year, I met Rose Holomn, who had made use of the program so that her son, Julius Robinson, could see his father for the first time in years. In January, she told me she felt betrayed by Biden: \"He didn't keep his promise.\"\n\nIn a phone call Monday, however, Holomn was exuberant. She saw the news around 8 a.m. on the Fox affiliate in Atlanta, where she lives.\n\n\"I ran around the house - 'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jesus!'\" she said.\n\nFor 27 years, she has only seen her son through plexiglass; no contact is allowed at death row visits. Now she was overjoyed at the thought of being able to hug him sometime in the near future.\n\nThough many questions remain about what comes next, Holomn sounded undaunted. She helped her son survive death row for nearly 30 years. She asked me to include something in my article: \"Be sure to put in there: 'A mother's love goes a long way.'\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Squeezed by African Coups, Biden Cozies Up to the World's Worst Dictator\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFamous for its repression and torture, Teodoro Obiang's Equatorial Guinea got an aid delivery from U.S. Special Operations forces.\n\nU.S. commandos have shown a special interest in strengthening ties with one of the most corrupt, abusive, and repressive regimes on the planet. The delivery of aid by Special Operations forces to the coastal African nation of Equatorial Guinea last month followed pilgrimages to the country's pariah president by top U.S. officials.\n\nThe move came amid shifting West African geopolitics. A Pentagon report last year mentioned Equatorial Guinea as the potential site of a future Chinese military base. At the same time, U.S. relations with longtime allies in Central and West Africa have frayed, often in the aftermath of coups d'état by American-trained military officers.\n\nThe aid to Equatorial Guinea appears to be the latest facet of a U.S. charm offensive to woo the country's president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, a tyrant now in his sixth decade in power, as the U.S. has lost influence in the African Sahel.\n\n\"We hope that this donation is the beginning of additional cooperation,\" said Commander Michael White, the defense attaché to the U.S. Embassy in Equatorial Guinea, after U.S. Special Operations Command Africa spearheaded a modest donation of humanitarian aid to the tiny, oil-rich central African nation.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Equatorial Guinea David Gilmour expressed hope that the recent donation of medical supplies would be the \"first of many opportunities to partner with\" the government there. It follows high-level engagement by the administration of President Joe Biden with Obiang's regime.\n\n\"This seems to run counter to every value that the Biden administration publicly espouses when it comes to democracy, human rights, and anticorruption,\" said Cameron Hudson, a former Africa analyst at the CIA, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The administration is doing everything it can to maintain a military foothold on the continent. And if we don't already have a foothold, to create one. So establishing or deepening relationships with particularly odious regimes like Equatorial Guinea are not off the table.\"\n\nEfforts to improve relations with the notorious kleptocracy come as the U.S. has been forced to scale back its military reach on the continent. (Kelly Cahalan, a spokesperson for U.S. Africa Command, or AFRICOM, said the command was unaware of any increased U.S. engagement with Equatorial Guinea.) The Pentagon curtailed military ties with Burkina Faso , Mali , and Niger following coups and reduced its counterterrorism activities in Cameroon due to human rights abuses by the country's military.\n\nEarlier this month, Niger's ruling junta, which includes a number of officers trained by the U.S. military, announced it was severing a long-standing security cooperation agreement with the United States \" with immediate effect .\"\n\nCrisantos Obama Ondo, Equatorial Guinea's ambassador to the U.S., did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nEquatorial Guinea has been plagued by oppression, corruption, and poverty for decades. After seizing power in a military coup in 1979, Obiang and his family have ruled it as their personal fiefdom. Despite significant oil wealth, the country suffers widespread poverty due to rampant embezzlement.\n\nThe most recent State Department report on human rights in Equatorial Guinea details credible reports of extrajudicial killings, torture, \"inhuman\" punishment, arbitrary arrest, and political imprisonment by the state, among many other abuses. It also chronicles corruption at all levels of government, especially the top: \"The president and members of his inner circle continued to amass personal fortunes from the revenues associated with monopolies on all domestic commercial ventures, as well as timber and oil exports.\"\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. Justice Department seized a beachfront mansion in Malibu, California; a private plane; and a fleet of luxury cars - purchased with looted funds laundered in the U.S. - from Teodoro \"Teodorin\" Nguema Obiang Mangue, the president's son and now Equatorial Guinea's vice president. The U.S. settled the case after Teodorin forfeited nearly $30 million in assets .\n\nSwiss prosecutors took possession of 11 of the younger Obiang's luxury cars in 2016, seizing Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Bentleys, a Bugatti, and a Rolls-Royce. In 2021, France seized $170 million of Teodorin's assets including a 101-room mansion near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.\n\nThe seizures have not affected Teodorin's conspicuous consumption, typified by his penchant for enjoying the high life on a luxury superyacht and, last year, staying in a $75,000-a-night New York hotel suite while asking the United Nations for aid.\n\nIn recent years, U.S. officials have publicly fretted about China establishing a naval outpost in West Africa. \"The thing I think I'm most worried about is this military base on the Atlantic coast, and where they have the most traction for that today is in Equatorial Guinea,\" Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, then-chief of AFRICOM, told the House Armed Services Committee in March 2022.\n\nIn an October 2023 analysis for Congress, the Defense Department reported it was \"likely\" that China has considered locating a \"military logistics\" facility in Equatorial Guinea. Earlier this month, Gen. Michael Langley, the current AFRICOM commander, warned the Senate Armed Services Committee: \"China is actively pursuing a naval base on Africa's Atlantic coast.\"\n\nThe pariah state has been invited, since 2019, to participate in AFRICOM's Obangame Express, the largest multinational maritime exercise in Western and Central Africa. AFRICOM also conducted a maritime capability assessment for the country in 2021.\n\nThat same year, when a Navy ship made a port call there, a U.S. news release called Equatorial Guinea \"an important partner of the United States.\" A visit by another ship in 2022 prompted Navy commander Tim Rustico to highlight the \"great opportunity to continue building our partnership with Equatorial Guinea.\"\n\n\"U.S. forces worked ... with the government of Equatorial Guinea to facilitate this engagement signifying sustained relations between the two nations,\" reads an Army news release about the February donation of $24,000 worth of supplies, including baby formula and first-aid kits to the country where most of the population lives on less than two dollars a day, but where the president has a reported net worth of $600 million .\n\nTutu Alicante, the head of EG Justice, a nonprofit organization that promotes human rights in Equatorial Guinea, said that the Biden administration's high-level engagement with the Obiang government was even more damaging than providing aid.\n\nSince Biden took office, Obiang, his son, or both have met with Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee , Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer , CIA Deputy Director David Cohen , and Maj. Gen. Kenneth Ekman, the director of strategy, engagement, and programs at AFRICOM.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies's Hudson said, \"Equatorial Guinea seems blatant about the fact that they are very much for sale to the highest bidder. They are very happy to be courted by Washington and Beijing because they occupy a strategic spot in the world and sit on a strategic resource and they have the money to allow them an independence that other countries in the region don't have.\"\n\nFollowing rigged presidential elections in 2022 - in which Obiang won 95 percent of the vote - Phee wrote a letter to the newly reelected president. Posted to X by an Equatoguinean government official , the letter shows that Phee welcomed \"close collaboration\" in which their countries would \"act together\" and seize \"opportunities to strengthen\" and \"enhance our mutual security.\" (The State Department verified the authenticity of the letter to The Intercept, but did not respond to other questions about engagement with Obiang's government.)\n\n\"The United States is committed to a world in which human rights are protected ... and those who commit human rights abuses are held accountable,\" said Phee's boss, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in a 2021 statement defining the Biden administration's core principles. \"President Biden is committed to a foreign policy ... centered on the defense of democracy and the protection of human rights.\"\n\nExperts said engagement with Equatorial Guinea makes a mockery of this pledge and undermines U.S. credibility across Africa.\n\n\"The hypocrisy of publicly saying that democracy, human rights, and anticorruption are the cornerstone of your foreign policy and then to go down a path that does not put those values into any kind of real practice is most troubling,\" Hudson told The Intercept. \"It sends a message to everyone on the continent that everything we say is negotiable.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Proud Papa: How Joe Biden Became the Father of the Iranian Nuclear Bomb\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden's fecklessness has stymied his agenda, but it's been a boon to one project - an Iranian one.\n\nPresident Joe Biden in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 28, 2022.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has struggled mightily to pass any part of his domestic agenda. Yet there is one outcome he can take direct credit for, an accomplishment that, because of Washington's screwed-up political incentives, he pulled off with almost no opposition.\n\nAfter decades of halting progress to develop nuclear weapons capacity, Iran is now turning the final screws to bring them to that threshold. Iran is now closer than ever to developing an actual nuclear weapon - beyond the point where assassinations, sabotage, or even a campaign of airstrikes could significantly hinder its nuclear capacity. Both hawkish and dovish segments of the U.S. press point to a plain fact undergirding this development: The nuclear deal struck in 2015 is toast.\n\nIran's path to the bomb is of course of its own making, but it has been helped along the way by Biden's stubborn refusal to make the compromises necessary to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. Biden's predecessor Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in a fit of pique, and Biden campaigned on getting back in. When push came to shove, however, Biden refused to undo Trump's aggressive measures.\n\nIt's hard to say that the nuclear deal is definitively finished because, in theory, both parties could miraculously come to terms at any time. It could be accurately described as a zombie: not quite dead, but not about to have life breathed back into it either.\n\nWhite House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk reportedly told a group of think tank experts this Wednesday that any return to a deal was \"highly unlikely.\" Earlier, the European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said, \"I have concluded that the space for additional significant compromises has been exhausted.\" Both sides must now sign the deal on the table if they want to move forward, he added. The problem is that both the Americans and Iranians have already said that the deal currently on the table is unacceptable.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe Americans deserve the bulk of the blame: It was the U.S. that violated the agreement in the first place. Now, both sides - as well as regional countries - will be worse off amid the continuing fallout.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting statement about the death of the nuclear deal came from the country whose political leadership did the most to kill it: Israel.\n\nIn an article published in Time this week, Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister, laid out his case for why the end of the deal has ensured that Israel's worst fears of a nuclear Iran will now become a reality. \"This summer, Iran will turn into a de-facto threshold nuclear state,\" Barak wrote, adding that Iran's uranium enrichment program had now advanced to a point where it could be no longer be set back with military strikes or sabotage.\n\nBarak, far from a dove, argued that the U.S. and Israel should have made plans to immediately attack Iran in 2018 after pulling out of the nuclear deal. For \"unexplainable reasons\" they failed to take this step, which would have set the program back by years. Instead, nuclear progress continued despite Trump's \" maximum pressure \" campaign. Iran's enrichment programs are now beyond the point where they could be effectively targeted by outside attack.\n\nBarak said that the ship had sailed on stopping a nuclear Iran. In lieu of even some weaker, limited new nuclear deal, Barak wrote, Israel and its neighboring states must simply try to contain an Iranian state that has finally crossed the nuclear threshold.\n\nIran has said, at least, that it will not build an actual nuclear bomb, and it likely won't do so any time soon. Even after developing the capacity, mastering the technology necessary to deliver a warhead will take some time. The ability to maintain plausible deniability is also important for the Iranian government, which would like the benefits of a nuclear deterrent without taking the political heat. (Israel has maintained a policy of ambiguity - refusing to confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal - for decades for this reason.)\n\nRecently, while noting that there was no decision to build a weapon, a top Iranian official said that Iran, in fact, has \"the technical ability to build a nuclear bomb.\" The statement was later walked back by the Iranian side but reflected a significant shift in tone from past statements that have been clearly against even the possibility of nuclear weapons development.\n\nThe Israeli and U.S. flags are projected on the wall of the old city of Jerusalem during President Biden's visit on July 13, 2022.\n\nBiden's response to all these events has been the worst of all worlds: disappointing his pro-diplomacy base while failing to placate his political enemies.\n\nThe nuclear deal was the signature diplomatic agreement of the Obama administration, in which, of course, Biden served as vice president. Upon taking office, Biden had a strong political opportunity to snap back into U.S. compliance with the deal, the minimum terms of which the Iranians had continued upholding despite Trump's maximum pressure campaign.\n\nInstead, in apparent fear of angering his political opponents by looking weak, Biden declined to immediately reenter the agreement that was signed - something that Iranian officials indicated that they would've accepted once he took office. Due to domestic political pressures, Biden continued playing hardball instead of making a good-faith bid to reenter the deal. Now, it looks like he has nothing to show for any of it.\n\nIn the real world, outside of the funhouse-mirror debates of American politics, a nuclearized Iran is likely to seriously constrain U.S. decision-making in the region for generations to come.\n\nThe U.S. technically could wage a full-scale war against Iran that would eliminate or severely degrade the nuclear program, even possibly leading to the collapse of the Iranian state. Outside of a few particularly psychopathic corners of Washington, however, there is little appetite among U.S. elites for starting such a massive conflict. The American public is even less likely to support it. After two exhausting decades of fighting futile wars in the Middle East, the idea of starting yet another with a country over twice the size of Iraq would be politically radioactive for any president.\n\nThe U.S. is largely stuck now with a long-term mess of its own making. Negotiating with Iran was often depicted by U.S. leaders as doing a favor to the Islamic Republic. The reality, though, was that the deal served legitimate U.S. interests: preventing nuclear proliferation, while sparing Americans from another armed conflict in the region.\n\nContrary to the statements of longtime Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his backers in the U.S., who tend to dominate Israel lobby organizations, the deal also served the interests of Israel, according to Barak and many other current and former Israeli political and intelligence officials. Former Mossad director Tamir Pardo, of all people, has said that withdrawal from the deal was nothing less than a \"tragedy.\"\n\nThat tragedy is now becoming tangible reality - on Joe Biden's watch. Although Trump started the process that brought us to this point, it was only thanks to Biden's mixture of weakness and indecision that the world will now likely be faced with a Middle Eastern equivalent of North Korea, rather than a version of Iran, as envisioned by the nuclear deal, that may have become economically dependent on the West.\n\nFor this, Biden has only himself to blame. He hasn't accomplished much as president, but it looks like Biden will have one legacy achievement to look back upon: fathering the Iranian nuclear bomb.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

(Robyn Beck / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has roughly two months left before he hands the reins to another Trump administration . Can he do anything during this lame-duck period to safeguard federal institutions and government protections from the coming deregulation bomb?\n\nAccording to experts, the answer is yes.\n\nThe Biden administration and Democratic majority in the Senate can fill crucial regulatory and judicial roles and make other moves that can serve as guardrails against the next four years of deregulatory and pro-business policies.\n\n\"I've heard many folks calling this moment in time 'Y.O.L.O. Joe,'\" said Lisa Gilbert, the copresident of consumer advocacy watchdog group Public Citizen. Biden needs \"to really think about the things that [the administration] can do right now to create speed bumps, to lock the doors, if you will.\"\n\nThe following steps, as suggested by experts and consumer advocates, might help establish critical safeguards for the years ahead.\n\nWhile President Biden is still in office, he has the power to nominate hundreds of appointees to government positions. According to the nonpartisan US Government Accountability Office, there are currently almost seven hundred vacancies across a wide swath of agencies.\n\nAlong with filling these vacancies, Biden can renominate a number of agency heads whose terms are set to expire during Trump's second administration. Presidents can renominate or propose a replacement for presidential appointments during their time in office, even if the president's term ends by the time the appointee steps in. After they're nominated, these appointees must be confirmed by a simple majority. Democrats have a fifty-one-seat majority in the Senate until January 3.\n\nAdvocates have urged Democrats to fill as many independent agency positions as possible while they still can - focusing on positions with statutory removal protection, which limit or restrict the president's ability to remove federal employees from their positions.\n\n\"If there is not a protection, then you're inviting Trump to fire them on Day One,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the anti-corruption group the Revolving Door Project, a nonprofit research group that scrutinizes conflicts of interest among executive branch appointees.\n\nSenate Democrats and the White House could also opt to recess the Senate between now and the end of the year, therefore allowing Biden to make a number of critical recess appointments .\n\nBiden \"should get in place every person who will have removal protection before the end of his term, ideally via Senate confirmation - and Plan B, via recess appointment,\" Hauser said.\n\nAdvocates expect Trump to immediately begin rolling back regulations on issues affecting the health, safety, and financial security of millions of Americans.\n\nEarlier this month, referring to his plan to have billionaire executive Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy spearhead a new Department of Government Efficiency, Trump said , \"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies - essential to the 'Save America' movement.\"\n\nAccording to experts at the Revolving Door Project , critical appointments with statutory removal protection include renominating Lina Khan , chair of the Federal Trade Commission and the government's top antitrust regulator. Khan, whose term technically expired this September , has used the agency to pursue an aggressive antitrust policy, including suing Amazon , Apple , and Google over anticompetitive economic conduct, banning noncompete agreements for workers, and calling for increased crackdowns on cryptocurrency scams . Consequently, she has faced significant criticism from Big Tech and Wall Street.\n\nTwo other priority efforts could be to renominate Susan Grundmann as chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which oversees two million federal employees' labor rights, and renominate Raymond Limon as vice chairman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects federal employees from partisan and unfair workplace practices. Both of these officials' terms expire next year, and experts say their appointment could help strengthen federal worker protections and safeguard agencies from significant financial cuts and layoffs.\n\nAlong with Biden nominating key government officials in the weeks ahead, advocates say the Senate needs to prioritize approving outstanding nominations to top regulatory agencies. Right now, there are seventy-eight nominees being considered by the Senate.\n\n\"We absolutely think . . . everyone there should be focused on appointments, ensuring that we move through outstanding nominees, particularly for commissions that are independent,\" said Gilbert.\n\nEarlier this month, after reporting from the Lever revealed that the confirmation of Biden's choice for top anti-corruption enforcer had been stalled for more than a year, the Senate successfully confirmed David Huitema as director of the Office of Government Ethics. The department, which monitors corruption issues at more than 130 federal agencies, will determine whether Trump's presidential nominees must divest assets to avoid conflicts of interest and, if so, whether they score a major tax break .\n\nOther nominees waiting to be confirmed include Caroline Crenshaw, Biden's choice for commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is responsible for policing the financial industry. The SEC will be pivotal in the years ahead, particularly as the ascendant cryptocurrency industry pushes Trump to weaken regulatory efforts, undermining investor protections and jeopardizing financial markets. Recently, SEC chair Gary Gensler announced he will step down this January, opening the door for Trump to appoint a new agency head and making Crenshaw's confirmation all the more important.\n\nAnother outstanding matter is confirming attorney Mark Eskenazi to the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, an independent federal agency that handles work-related safety and health disputes. This commission will likely be increasingly vital, as many expect the Trump administration to repeat its history of rolling back worker safety inspections.\n\nThere are also dozens of empty judicial slots in federal courts across the country that could be filled before Trump and a Republican Senate majority take office in January. Following a judicial nomination by the president, the Senate holds a public hearing and then votes to confirm or reject the president's nominee.\n\nJudicial appointments are crucial in shaping the country's legal landscape and are responsible for decades of civil rights, environmental, and criminal policies. A second Trump presidency could lead to a deluge of new far-right judges . From 2017 to 2020, Trump appointed 234 judges to the federal bench - a record amount for a single four-year term. In his first two years in office, he pushed nearly four times as many judicial confirmations compared to Obama's final two years.\n\nTrump's appointments included three Supreme Court judges championed by his judicial advisor Leonard Leo , a right-wing legal activist who's using his billion-dollar dark money network to reshape the country along conservative lines. Trump's Supreme Court picks and other Leo efforts were pivotal in the high court overturning federal abortion protections in 2022.\n\nTo limit Trump's options as much as possible, advocates say it's imperative that Senate Democrats confirm outstanding judicial nominees before January.\n\n\"The president should be working with the Senate, keeping the Senate in session day and night to confirm both judges and independent agency regulators,\" said Hauser.\n\nDemocratic senators like Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) agree. \"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer must use every minute of the end-of-year legislative session to confirm federal judges and key regulators - none of whom can be removed by the next president,\" Warren wrote in a recent Time op-ed .\n\nDemocrats appear to have taken the hint. Taking advantage of missing Republican lawmakers, the Senate recently confirmed the 219th judge under Biden's administration, fifteen short of the number confirmed during Trump's first term. Biden has announced twelve other judicial nominees who are still waiting to be confirmed.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump took to social media to claim that \"no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\"\n\nLeft unsaid: one out of every fourteen judges confirmed during Trump's first presidency were confirmed during the lame-duck session following his reelection loss in 2020.\n\nWhile President Biden still oversees the Department of Justice and the Office of Information Policy, he could redirect resources toward fulfilling outstanding Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and publishing other declassified materials.\n\nThe 1966 act requires the federal government to disclose documents and records requested by the public with limited exemptions. Advocates say it's vital for the White House to expedite as many outstanding FOIA requests as possible, as the backlog will likely balloon with Trump back in the White House.\n\n\"Getting ready for Freedom of Information Act requests is not the sexiest thing to talk about, Gilbert added. \"But [it's] important to understand what's happening so that we can fight back.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to avoid transparency during his first term are well documented.\n\nThe first Trump administration waged a \" war on transparency,\" instructing staffers at major agencies including the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Health and Human Services to limit interactions with the press and curb their responses to FOIA requests. Trump's pick to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr Robert Redfield, was accused by staff of instructing them to delete email correspondence during the pandemic.\n\nA 2021 report by the Associated Press found the US government censored, withheld, or said it couldn't find records requested by the public more often than at any other point in the past decade. FOIA lawsuits over withheld records sharply increased during Trump's first year in office, even though under his predecessor, Barack Obama, government officials had set records for FOIA noncompliance.\n\nTrump's political machine found other ways to hide information. According to documents obtained by the government watchdog group American Oversight , key officials in the Trump White House repeatedly abused private communications channels to surreptitiously conduct government business. And during Trump's first term in office, thousands of government web pages with information about climate change and the benefits of renewable energy were reportedly wiped from the internet.\n\nBy making scientific data, intelligence reports, and even records from Trump's first term public now, the Biden administration can help disseminate information that Trump might soon try to suppress or eradicate.\n\n\"There's a lot of information within the purview of the government about corporations and about the government itself - and as much as can be made visible, the better,\" said Hauser.\n\nMore specifically, advocates say they'd like President Biden to instruct the Department of Homeland Security to make public as much data as it can about existing Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement detentions, including the identities of those held in custody and the duration and conditions of their detention. That way, activists will have more data they can use to track Trump's plans for military-assisted mass deportations .\n\n\"We want all of that disclosed because there is a genuine chance that, given the scale of what the Trump administration has planned, people could just disappear into federal custody,\" said Sarah Turberville, director of the Constitution Project at the independent watchdog group Project On Government Oversight.\n\nThough advocates maintain there's still plenty of work to be accomplished before Trump's inauguration, they stress that the reality remains: the coming years will likely harm government efforts designed to help people.\n\n\"I think that things are going to be bad - and we should not really be looking for silver linings as such because that would diminish how bad things are going to get for a lot of vulnerable people,\" said Hauser.\n\nThere is little doubt Trump will pursue many of the policies proposed in Project 2025 , a radical plan proposed by the right-wing Heritage Foundation to dismantle many parts of the government under a Trump administration.\n\nHowever, \"eventually this [trend] is going to reverse,\" said Hauser. And these rebuilding efforts should be more ambitious than the policies that came before to help protect against future government deregulation efforts long after Trump is gone, Hauser added\n\n\"I think it's imperative that we figure out how we can recover from this Trump administration in a more self-sustaining way than the 2018 and 2020 [Democratic] victories created,\" said Hauser.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nHelen Santoro is a journalist based in Colorado.\n\nVeronica Riccobene is a producer based in Washington, DC.

(Anna Moneymaker / Pool - Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn one of his first days in office all the way back in January, Joe Biden signed an executive order pausing new oil and gas leasing on public lands. His administration framed the move as an attempt to \"restore balance on public lands and waters\" and \"invest in [a] clean energy future,\" with the president himself saying that \"we can't wait any longer.\"\n\n\"It's not time for small measures,\" he said before signing. \"We need to be bold.\"\n\nAn avalanche of coverage ran with this framing, using the freeze as part of the basis to declare the Biden administration not just a sharp break from Donald Trump's four years but a radical, transformational new frontier in US policymaking. It was a \"stark contrast\" from Trump's actions laying out a \"historic vision for how the United States can once again become a global climate leader,\" wrote the press, a \" sweeping assault on climate change \" that showed he was \"serious about cutting the country's outsized contribution to global warming.\"\n\nYet despite the undoubted symbolic power of Biden's order, in its more than three months in effect, it's done little to slow the stream of fossil fuel drilling on public lands. According to statistics from the Bureau of Land Management, from the start of February to the end of April , the administration approved 1,179 drilling permits on federal lands, not far from the four-year high of nearly 1,400 approved over a similar three-month period at the end of Trump's term.\n\nMeanwhile, according to numbers from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement numbers, that same February-to-April period saw 207 offshore drilling permits approved. This is compared to the 249 offshore permits approved over the three months to Trump's final day in office.\n\nThis isn't totally surprising. When they weren't loudly whining about the supposed damage Biden's lease moratorium would do, the fossil fuel industry privately wiped their collective brow that that was as far as he was willing to go, since, as one industry insider told the Financial Times , \"leases are already plentiful - it's the permitting that matters.\" As S&P Global Platts Analytics stated at the time, \"the order won't impact US crude oil and gas production much in the near term because existing leases and drilling permits are not impacted and big producers have ample inventories of undrilled well permits.\"\n\nBiden's move was blunted in advance by not just a surge of more than three thousand applications for drilling permits just before he took office but by the fact that \"the oil and gas industry has stockpiled millions of acres of leases on public lands and waters,\" in the words of the Department of the Interior. As of March, more than half of the twenty-six million acres of federal lands leased to fossil fuel companies was sitting idle and not yet producing oil or gas, while the figure was nearly 80 percent for the twelve million acres of public waters.\n\nAnd in any case, \"older leases are responsible for most production and revenues on public land,\" as the Center for American Progress explained in March. That report, ironically, defended Biden's pause on the grounds that it wouldn't do a whole lot to slow production and admonished the industry for \"sitting idle\" on, and \"not creating any revenue or jobs\" from, unused leased land they'd acquired from Trump's mass sell-off of public lands .\n\n\"President Biden needs to fulfill this basic promise of candidate Biden and stop oil and gas drilling on public lands,\" says Mitch Jones, policy director at Food and Water Watch, who warns this would simply be a \"bare minimum.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups were aware at the time of the largely symbolic nature of Biden's order and had hoped it signaled more ambitious, wide-ranging actions to come. After all, neither Biden's campaign climate plan nor the 2020 Democratic platform made any mention of stopping leasing but rather pledged to ban the very permits he's now approving at a rate rivaling Trump's.\n\nThere's no question Biden is doing more on the climate crisis than any president in history. But when the last holder of that title brags about turning the United States into the world's biggest oil and gas producer, that's not saying much.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because Biden looks bold in comparison to past presidents, especially the last one, he gets a pass from many people in the environmental movement on his actual record,\" says Jones. \"Of course, the planet doesn't recognize the low bars set by political precedent and the lack of ambition of the established political and media leadership.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Biden administration's handing out of drilling permits is far from the only sign it's not taking climate science seriously.\n\nBiden's infrastructure bill - another subject of lavish praise for the administration and acknowledged , as one commentator put it , to be \"the country's one shot to pass meaningful climate legislation in the next few years, if not in the next few decades\" - underspends on climate by trillions of dollars over its eight-year time span. His latest budget significantly increased climate spending to $36 billion , which sounds impressive, until you remember that experts are calling for roughly $1 trillion of annual climate spending for a decade to prevent unspeakable catastrophe . The promise of climate spending worth 1 percent of GDP per year pales in comparison to the 5 percent urged by the Roosevelt Institute, let alone the 37.5 percent of GDP spent by the US government on defense in the final year of World War II.\n\nDespite signing executive orders meant to mandate a \"government-wide approach to combat the climate crisis,\" the administration is fighting environmental groups to keep alive a controversial Trump-era Alaskan drilling project set to produce one hundred thousand barrels of oil a day for thirty years, rendering Biden's climate goals irrelevant. For all the praise his early cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline received - which, instead of a bold new step, simply rewound Trump policy back to the status quo when Obama left office - in office, he's firmly behind keeping the similar Dakota Access Pipeline flowing. And he's already made a mockery of his own lease moratorium, issuing dozens of leases on federal lands in May that had been sold off by Trump in his final weeks as president.\n\nReport after report after report has warned that if climate change and overexploitation of natural resources aren't urgently checked - not some, half, or most of the way, but all of the way - there is a good chance our civilizations will begin to unravel in our lifetimes, as civilizations have tended to do throughout history when put under extreme environmental pressures. Ours might be the first to actually have the knowledge, technology, wealth, and foresight to avoid this grim outcome. And yet the Biden administration - potentially this decade's last chance for the United States to take action on the issue, given political realities - is not really even trying.\n\nThat's not a shock: Biden, after all, only got to the point he's at now because of relentless pressure from the bottom up. What's less excusable is the failure by liberal institutions to hold him to account for this planned failure, as the reality of his administration's inadequacy on climate is drowned out by celebratory headlines and news segments that treat the president as if he's already won a war he's barely bothering to fight.\n\nThe administration is due to put out its report about the lease moratorium this summer . But there's no indication of when we'll see an end to the moratorium on truth-telling about Biden's climate policy.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSeveral of President Joe Biden's most powerful appointees and advisers have had business relationships with pharmaceutical giants lobbying the administration on COVID-19 and intellectual property issues, according to documents we reviewed.\n\nThose ties - and Biden's longtime alliance with pharmaceutical industry interests - could prove particularly relevant as drug companies now try to defang any new waiver of patent rules that might reduce their profits and facilitate the wider distribution of vaccines to COVID-afflicted countries.\n\nLast summer, Biden broke with his own legislative record and pledged to support relaxing those intellectual property rules to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine, saying it \"is the only humane thing in the world to do.\" With the pandemic creating a full-fledged humanitarian crisis in India this spring, Biden's administration on Wednesday issued a statement reiterating that general promise.\n\n\"This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures,\" said United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai in a press release . \"The administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\nThe declaration was widely hailed by public interest groups, who feared the administration would follow past precedent and oppose any emergency action on patents.\n\nHowever, Tai's statement was narrow: it only mentioned COVID vaccines and avoided endorsing an existing , broad waiver proposed by India and South Africa which would cover \"diagnostic kits, vaccines, medicines, personal protective equipment and ventilators.\" Her statement also preemptively warned that the \"negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved\" - a process that could provide drugmakers an opening to try to limit a final waiver.\n\n\"This is a magnificent development,\" said Global Trade Watch's Lori Wallach of the Biden administration's general support for a waiver. \"For it to translate into ending the COVID pandemic as quickly as possible, a final waiver text must include the full set of intellectual property barriers and must cover vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nPharmaceutical stocks dipped after Tai's announcement, and the industry is already criticizing the Biden administration's support for relaxing intellectual property rules. However, the decision from the Biden administration to not immediately support the existing WTO waiver proposal may ultimately prove to be an important win for drug companies. Public health advocates are already warning that drug companies will likely intensify their efforts to narrow any new measure.\n\n\"(Biden's waiver) is on vaccines, but it's not on diagnostics or therapeutics or other things in the pandemic,\" said James Love, director of the DC-based nonprofit Knowledge Ecology International, which focuses on intellectual property issues as they pertain to health care and access to knowledge. He added that Tai's assertion that the negotiations will take time is \"not a good thing right now.\"\n\nThe granular details of the waiver will be negotiated by a Biden administration populated by individuals with significant pharmaceutical investments and whose previous employers worked for a panoply of pharmaceutical giants. That includes drugmakers currently lobbying the White House on intellectual property.\n\nAmong them are:\n\nAntony Blinken: Before he was appointed secretary of state, Blinken helped form a corporate consulting firm called WestExec Advisors. His client list included pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences, which manufactures remdesivir , the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID. Several US government agencies \"conducted or funded much of the preclinical and clinical development of remdesivir,\" according to a report from Knowledge Ecology International.\n\nBetween January and March, Gilead reported lobbying Congress and Blinken's State Department on \"international trade and protection of intellectual property; compulsory licensing and other IP issues in multiple countries.\"\n\nGilead recently made headlines announcing it would give India 450,000 vials of remdesivir and help ramp up production of its antiviral drug in the pandemic-ravaged country. On Tuesday, Gilead sued the Russian government after it allowed a domestic company to manufacture remdesivir.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield: Biden's ambassador to the United Nations previously worked for the consulting firm Albright Stonebridge Group, which has represented Pfizer.\n\nJennifer O'Malley Dillon: Biden's deputy chief of staff was a founding partner of consulting firm Precision Strategies, which has worked for both Gilead and Pfizer. O'Malley Dillon's former colleague at the firm, Stephanie Cutter, is an adviser to a new nonprofit, Building Back Together, created to support Biden's agenda. The organization listed its business address as Precision Strategies' office in DC corporate records.\n\nAnita Dunn: Dunn's job as a senior adviser in the Biden White House is only temporary , which means she doesn't have to file a public financial disclosure. But her firm, SKDK, has also worked for Pfizer.\n\nSteve Ricchetti: Currently serving as a counselor to Biden, Ricchetti used to be a lobbyist for pharmaceutical companies like Novartis as well as Eli Lilly and Sanofi. Those companies are top manufacturers of insulin, which is significantly more expensive in the United States than in many other countries.\n\nSteve's brother, Jeff Ricchetti, runs a lobbying firm, Ricchetti Inc., which has seen a boom in business since Biden won the presidency. His current clients include pharmaceutical firm Vaxart, which is working on a tablet-based COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBiden is also reportedly considering attorney Ellisen Turner for director of the US Patent and Trademark Office. Turner, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis , counts Gilead among his past clients. Turner has worked on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to prevent the development of generic drugs.\n\nOutside the administration, Biden's former legislative affairs director, Sudafi Henry, recently started lobbying for medical device company Abbott Laboratories on COVID issues , according to federal disclosures. Abbott has significant business in India and produces coronavirus tests, and could thus have an interest in whether any international trade waiver includes diagnostic tests in addition to vaccines.\n\nOn Thursday, Politico reported that Kwabena Nsiah, who served as chief of staff to former congressman and current White House senior adviser Cedric Richmond, was joining Henry's firm.\n\nBiden's decision to stock his administration with pharmaceutical industry allies tracks with his own previous record. Hailing from Delaware, the home state of the US headquarters of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, he has periodically aligned himself with drugmakers on patent issues.\n\nThroughout his career, Biden has supported trade legislation strengthening pharmaceutical patent rules. That includes voting for the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which backed the original World Trade Organization negotiating round that created the restrictive system of patents known as the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in the first place. Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies pushed hard for TRIPS, and the new agreement required member countries to enact national laws providing a minimum standard of intellectual property protection. Predictably, after its establishment, drug prices soared.\n\nIn 2000, Biden was one of eight Democratic senators to vote with Republicans against reinstating the government's ability to compel reasonable pricing for pharmaceutical products developed with federal assistance after the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under pressure from industry, surrendered its ability to do so five years earlier.\n\nYears later, as vice president, Biden once again acquiesced to the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, India's Patent Office granted a compulsory license to patents for Sorafenib, a cancer drug marketed as Nexavar by German pharmaceutical giant Bayer. The license allowed Indian manufacturers to produce generic versions for the country's market at a greatly reduced price. The Indian government was planning to do the same for dozens of expensive cancer drugs.\n\nBayer took the matter to court, and the pharmaceutical industry appealed to the Obama administration. In response, Vice President Biden visited the country and successfully pressured the Indian government not to grant any further licenses.\n\nThree years after his success in blocking affordable generic cancer drugs in India, Biden wrote a letter to Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos Calderón expressing the administration's concerns about his country's efforts to produce affordable generic cancer drugs.\n\nAs vice president, Biden was also a major proponent of the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which would have strengthened patent exclusivity and included protections against bulk purchasing by governments.\n\nAs the Sunlight Foundation noted at the time: \"At the behest of the pharmaceutical industry, the U.S. is also pushing to limit the ability of national regulatory agencies to support generic drug development.\" Speaking at the Export-Import Bank's 2013 Annual Conference, Biden called the TPP \"the most ambitious trade agreement underway in the world\" and said it would be the \"metric\" by which future trade agreements were measured.\n\nConsidering his past efforts, pharmaceutical interests were likely optimistic about Biden's support once he was elected president. Pfizer, which has manufactured one of the most widely used COVID vaccines in the United States, donated $1 million to Biden's inaugural committee.\n\nIn 2019, the Associated Press reported that drugmakers Johnson & Johnson, Amgen, GlaxoSmithKline, and Bristol Myers Squibb were \"among a host of corporate partners and other groups that work on cancer-related projects promoted by\" the Biden Cancer Initiative, a nonprofit Biden started after his time as vice president.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Biden administration's waiver announcement this week, drugmakers manufacturing vaccines and other COVID-related products had already been gearing up for battle. In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the pharmaceutical industry spent $92 million on federal lobbying efforts, much of it focused on fortifying intellectual property rules .\n\nThey were recently boosted by a letter from Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) to the Biden administration, arguing that the waiver requested by India and South Africa \"would allow for the creation of entire industries in these countries that will compete with American companies in the development of cutting-edge health care technologies.\"\n\nJudging from the posture of its major Washington lobbying organizations, the pharmaceutical industry is united against any coronavirus vaccine waiver. Even companies that do not produce COVID vaccines likely fear that any waiver could set a precedent for weakening patents on other life-saving medicines.\n\n\"This change in longstanding American policy will not save lives,\" wrote Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), one of the biggest lobbying groups in DC, with $459 million in revenue in 2019. \"It also flies in the face of President Biden's stated policy of building up American infrastructure and creating jobs by handing over American innovations to countries looking to undermine our leadership in biomedical discovery.\"\n\nBiotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), a lobbying group that represents COVID vaccine makers Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, wrote a letter threatening that the Biden administration's waiver \"decision will act as a disincentive to companies to respond to the next pandemic.\"\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry argues that companies are being generous by developing extremely lucrative medicines.\n\n\"It is not true that the U.S. government underwrites our manufacturing efforts,\" said Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla during an earnings call last month. \"The orders that we had received from the U.S. government were only going to be delivered - and the U.S. government was only going to pay us - if the vaccine was successful, if the vaccine was successful in receiving regulatory approval, and if the vaccine was successful to the manufactured. The risk all was with us.\"\n\nIn truth, however, most of the leading COVID vaccines being distributed around the world, including those from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, rely on technology developed by government scientists at the NIH.\n\nThe companies also benefited from the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed program. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson received federal assistance for research and development, while the government promised to purchase nearly $2 billion worth of Pfizer doses should they prove effective.\n\nThese considerations, as well as the Biden White House's long-standing ties to the pharmaceutical industry, could all come into play as the administration hammers out the details of the vaccine waiver it has pledged to support.\n\n\"I think the most important thing is this (announcement) sort of shifts the conversation from, like, 'We can't do anything; the companies' got it under control; let's listen to Bill Gates ' - all that sort of stuff was kind of out the window,\" said Love of Knowledge Ecology International. \"Now it's a little bit like, 'We have to do something, let's talk about what needs to be done, not what we can't do.'\"\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

That refusal, cosigned by Kamala Harris, is an integral part of both their legacies.\n\nUS president Joe Biden during the National Veterans Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, on November 11, 2024. (Bonnie Cash / UPI / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAkbar Shahid Ahmed, senior diplomatic correspondent for the Huffington Post , has been reporting on US support for the Israeli attack on Gaza over the last year, and is now working on a book that will give us the inside story. He spoke to Jacobin about why Kamala Harris wouldn't distance herself from Joe Biden over Gaza, what impact it had on the US presidential election, and what is likely to happen next. This is an edited transcript from Jacobin's Long Reads podcast. You can listen to the interview here .\n\nIn very broad terms, can you tell us what impact Gaza had (or might have had) on last week's presidential election? What problems did it cause for the Democrats with particular groups of voters, notably in swing states like Michigan?\n\nOne week out, we know that Kamala Harris got significantly fewer votes than Joe Biden got in 2020, even among Democratic-leaning constituencies, so that's an important indicator. It's not so much that these voters were swinging to Donald Trump or seeing him as a savior for Gaza, but perhaps people were much less enthusiastic to show up for her. That applies to younger voters, many of whom did back Biden in huge numbers to eject Donald Trump in 2020, and to Arab and Muslim Americans.\n\nLooking at the swing states, Michigan gets talked about a lot, but you also have large Arab American populations in Georgia and New York, where Harris's margin of victory for a safe Democratic state was much lower than Biden's in 2020 or other Democrats' historically. There does appear to have been an impact.\n\nWe know that there were a significant number of votes for Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential candidate. In states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where it's a matter of tens of thousands of votes between Trump and Harris, yet a third-party candidate is getting some of those votes on an antiwar platform, that is telling you that Gaza is having an outsized impact among certain groups.\n\nWhen it comes to the Trump campaign, according to the New York Times , their research told them that undecided voters were six times as likely as other swing-state voters to be driven by their view of the war in Gaza. That is a constituency that Trump very openly courted. We saw him during those insane rallies where he was promising to be a peace president and end the wars.\n\nI don't think there's much reason to believe that he will deliver on those promises. But the degree of exasperation with the approach of the Biden administration - the sense that there was still no change in policy after a year, with at least 44,000 people dead - created an opening for Trump.\n\nWe can also see this in the postmortems coming out of the Harris campaign. They are pointing to the fact that she didn't differentiate herself from Biden on Gaza and saying, \"Look, there were opportunities to pick up some of those voter groups that you missed.\" When Harris took over from Biden as the Democratic candidate, she had an opportunity to present herself as being different and she botched it.\n\nBack in June, the members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council passed a motion at the prompting of the Biden administration, having been assured that this could provide the framework for a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. It was said at the time by various officials from the Biden administration that this was a framework Israel had signed up to. Of course, we know now that there was no cease-fire, and the idea that there would be a cease-fire became increasingly notional and elusive over the months that followed. What were the key developments that you would identify in that period?\n\nWhen Biden unveiled his cease-fire proposal on May 31, I think there was a sense on the part of many US government officials that they could land the plane. There was a lot of confidence (and perhaps hubris) on their part.\n\nThinking about the wider context at the time, we saw the deadly raid that Israel launched, killing hundreds of Palestinians while rescuing a handful of Israeli hostages. There was ongoing bombing and displacement in Gaza. To outside observers, it did not look as if Israel had stopped escalating its campaign.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration officials told themselves a story. From their perspective, a couple of things had happened. Firstly, they had persuaded Biden to stop a shipment of two-thousand-pound bombs and some five-hundred-pound bombs, which was really a stretch. That shows you how limited their willingness to impose any kind of restraint on US support for Israel was. But for them, that was huge.\n\nThey were also looking at the picture of the Israeli attack on Rafah, the southernmost town in Gaza, on the border with Egypt. This was the place where more than a million Palestinians had fled in response to Israeli evacuation orders. The United States said for months that an Israeli assault on Rafah would be a red line. Biden openly set this test for himself.\n\nThe Israelis then attacked Rafah in early May. They also prompted a serious diplomatic crisis, which continues to be a problem, by taking over Gaza's border with Egypt. That was a clear escalation, crossing Biden's red line. But you had US officials like John Kirby saying, \"We don't think the Israelis have crossed the line.\" They thought the Israelis hadn't launched a full-blown invasion, so from that point of view, they could say, \"We've gotten results from the Israelis - they aren't doing this.\"\n\nInto June and July, you saw people from the Biden administration very much saying, \"Look, you all told us to put pressure on the Israelis - we finally did it.\" They were now putting the onus on Hamas, even though Hamas had already agreed to some form of cease-fire, saying, \"We want to do this - we want to have a permanent settlement.\" Meanwhile, the Israeli side wasn't taking this as seriously.\n\nOn the one hand, you had the Biden administration telling people, \"Hamas is the obstacle, and we can't question or challenge the Israelis in any way, because Hamas will exploit that.\" At the same time, Benjamin Netanyahu was creating a political crisis for the Biden administration by working with Republicans in Congress to say that the United States had stopped the supply of weapons to Israel.\n\nIn fact, the United States had not really stopped sending weapons in any significant way, apart from the hold on two-thousand-pound bombs. But because Biden had agreed to that, Netanyahu worked together with Republicans to create a narrative of the United States abandoning Israel. Biden's team failed to challenge this narrative and in fact gave it their blessing.\n\nBy the end of June, you had the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, travelling to Washington, where the Biden administration publicly assured him, \"Don't worry - we're going to expedite the supply of weapons - in fact, we're even going to send some of the bombs that we previously held up.\" That was a clear folding on the part of the US government to Israel.\n\nThe other aspect of the folding of the US position was Biden's disastrous debate performance on June 27. This signaled to Netanyahu that Biden was either going to lose his candidacy or lose the election. That shifted the narrative in a big way and created the space, coming into July and August, for Netanyahu to add new demands, saying that Israel wanted to have permanent control over the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nEven though the United States and Israel continued to say that Hamas was the obstacle to a cease-fire, Hamas openly stated by early July that they would accept the cease-fire proposal, while Netanyahu was introducing new demands. At the end of July, Israel assassinated the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. As we approached the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in mid-August, the Biden administration was in a position where its officials had publicly put what was left of their credibility on the line. They were being aggressively questioned, and they were responding to that questioning with a lot of hubris rather than reflection.\n\nWhat I heard from administration officials and people close to them was, \"We haven't paid a huge political cost over Gaza - we have presented a cease-fire proposal, and now everyone should give us credit for that.\" That effort ramped up in the week prior to the DNC. For political reasons, they would have loved to walk into the convention saying, \"Look, we solved the war.\" Of course, the Israelis were in no position to give them that.\n\nThere was another momentous shift when Biden stepped down as the Democratic candidate and Kamala Harris took over. Harris had a high-profile meeting with Netanyahu where she said, \"I will not be silent on the suffering of Palestinians.\" That was all well and good, but they didn't use that momentum in any clear or powerful way, which led to the reality that I saw on the ground at the DNC. There was huge frustration among the Uncommitted movement of voters, who said they were denying support to Biden until he shifted his Gaza policy, but also among rank-and-file Democratic delegates.\n\nPeople in the party were saying, \"Even if we don't know very much about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, about the accusations of genocide and war crimes, about what our taxpayer dollars are funding in terms of potential ethnic cleansing, we don't want to be hearing about this anymore - we want to be celebrating - we want to have joy.\" The Harris narrative was to say, \"Let's move on from Trump\" (and implicitly, \"Let's move on from Biden\"). Her campaign theme song was \"Freedom.\" But what the Biden administration failed to do was free their party and their coalition from being implicated in what is arguably the deadliest and most horrifying war of the century so far.\n\nThat brings us to early September, which is when I would say any pretense or hope of cease-fire negotiations fell apart. You had the incident where Israeli troops discovered the bodies of six hostages that Hamas had been holding, including the dual Israeli-American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin. That created a mood of anger and rejection of any kind of peace, not just in Tel Aviv but also in Washington.\n\nWhile some of the families of Israeli hostages ramped up their calls for an agreement, you saw US officials at that point openly starting to embrace the Israeli position that you can't negotiate with Hamas. A longstanding feature of the Biden administration's thinking - their fear of being seen as anti-Israel, in spite of their huge support for Israel - started to loom large once again.\n\nIn the last two months before the election, we didn't see any movement on a cease-fire, and we also didn't see any US pressure on the Israelis. In the month of August, according to aid groups, more than a million Palestinians in Gaza did not receive any food. There was also the beginning of the Israeli operation in Lebanon.\n\nI can recall being with some quite senior Biden administration officials in this period as they were saying, \"We're going to get a diplomatic solution for Lebanon - we're going to prevent a straight-up Israel-Hezbollah war.\" Within days, you had Netanyahu ordering the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, while he was in New York, before launching an Israeli ground operation in Lebanon with clear US support. That was when any hope of US restraint over Israel died.\n\nThere's another point I want to mention in relation to the preelection period. In Washington, some people never seem to go out of style. Figures like Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, are sometimes compared to cockroaches - a nuclear bomb could land on Washington, but they would still have top foreign policy jobs. That was an important dynamic by this stage, because people within the Biden administration were starting to think, \"We want a job in a Harris presidency, so we don't want to be doing anything too daring right now, particularly not on Israel-Palestine.\"\n\nCould you tell us a bit more about what you have gathered from conversations with the people involved about the attitude of US government officials to what Israel has been doing in Lebanon?\n\nThere are a few trends and themes at work here. Throughout the period since October 7, I had been hearing anxiety inside the US government about Israel seeking US military support and weaponry not just for use in Gaza, but also for a potential invasion of Lebanon. The Biden administration appointed an envoy, Amos Hochstein, who had a channel to Hezbollah, through which he able to convey a strong US desire to avoid an Israel-Hezbollah war.\n\nHochstein was even able to create the accurate impression, which is hard in terms of US diplomacy, that Hezbollah did not want a war. If a war was going to happen, it would be because Israel and Netanyahu chose it. All of that shifted in September to a stunning degree. Up to that point, the Biden administration had been able to prevent an all-out war, while there were growing signs of Israeli willingness to escalate the use of force, going after Hamas and Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon as well as Iranian commanders.\n\nFrom September, there was a remarkable shift in what US officials were saying. They started parroting the Israeli line: \"Look at how successful we are; we have been able to target so many people in Lebanon. Hezbollah is a paper tiger, in a way that many regional experts did not think it was.\" The Israeli and US governments both pointed to the pager attack, which targeted hundreds of people associated with Hezbollah - many of them possibly not fighters, and located in civilian areas - but the United States quietly embraced that as a sign of Israeli prowess.\n\nWhen the Israelis took out senior Hezbollah leaders like Nasrallah, the United States took that as another sign: \"They know how to target these guys - they know where they are.\" Finally, you saw the United States embracing a very alarming Israeli narrative, one that experts on international law say has resulted in staggering bloodshed in Gaza and is now being copied and pasted into Lebanon. This is the idea that all of these civilian areas have been totally infiltrated by combatants and thus are fair game.\n\nUnder international law, there are principles of proportionality in terms of where you can attack, which require you to do as much as you can to minimize civilian casualties. But US officials suddenly began saying things like, \"Literally every house in southern Lebanon is full of Hezbollah weapons.\" Okay - does that make it a legitimate target? Probably not, according to the Biden administration's own standards for reducing civilian harm. But you saw them taking that line.\n\nFrom that point of view, looking at the clear Israeli failure to develop a plan in Gaza with a lasting solution for its future that would prevent Hamas from coming back, which is Israel's stated aim, this was an opportunity for the Israelis to say, \"We can be successful here on a different front - give us a chance.\" The Biden administration decided to give them that chance.\n\nThis was in spite of the fact that it received numerous warnings from inside its own government. While there might be a lot of success, is it tactical or strategic? Is it long-term and sustainable? Nearly two months on from the Israeli pager attacks and the assassination of much of the Hezbollah leadership, Hezbollah hasn't folded. There isn't going to be a Lebanon after this conflict in which Hezbollah does not play a major role, and Hezbollah attacks on Israel and on Israeli soldiers are continuing.\n\nThe Biden administration has spoken at various points about setting benchmarks for Israeli compliance with US and international law. Most recently, on the eve of the presidential election, there was a new deadline for Israel to show that it was allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. Could you tell us more about that process? At the same time, regardless of what the US government might say, there have been several things happening on the international legal front, including the case by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the request from Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), for arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas officials (all of whom are now reportedly dead). How has the Biden administration responded to those developments?\n\nI'll start with the US assessments. There's no shortage of expertise inside the US government to measure potential war crimes. The US government is quite comfortable saying, \"The Russians are perpetrating what look like war crimes in Ukraine,\" or, \"We believe there's a genocide in Myanmar.\"\n\nAll of that expertise is there, particularly when it comes to an extremely close partner like Israel. The United States has huge insight into how Israel is treating humanitarian aid, much of which is funded by the United States, and into how its military is operating, given the close relationship between the two militaries.\n\nWe are at the cusp now of the deadline you mentioned for Israel to meet that benchmark to improve access to humanitarian aid for Palestinians. Aid groups tell us that it clearly hasn't done so. Again, it has ignored these requests from the US while pointing to loopholes and caveats.  [Note: Since this interview was conducted, the thirty-day deadline has passed. State Department officials confirmed that Israel has not complied with the benchmarks set by the United States, but Antony Blinken announced that there would be no consequences for Israel .]\n\nThe Israeli narrative will say, \"We let in a lot of aid.\" But is it going to all the places where aid is most needed? For instance, there's aid reaching northern Gaza, but not the section where international and US experts believe there is a very high risk of famine - the parts that are covered by the \"Generals' Plan.\"\n\nIsraeli officials will say, \"There's all this aid gathered on the Palestinian side of the crossing at Kerem Shalom - why isn't the UN distributing it?\" The UN and aid groups will respond by saying that there is no safe way to distribute aid inside Gaza, because they don't know whether they might be stopped by Israeli guards or hit by air strikes. The delivery of aid continues to be far short of what the United States expects.\n\nIt's important to remember there is a standard in US law to which US government officials have been pointing to try and hold Antony Blinken accountable. There is a standard governing assistance to foreign countries that says if you block US humanitarian aid, you cannot receive certain kinds of US weapons. The Biden administration has been aware of that provision hanging over its head, because lawmakers have been highlighting it for almost eleven months now, since last December.\n\nI don't know how the administration can in good faith say that Israel is in compliance with that standard. It did claim in a report last May that Israel was not blocking US aid, by pointing to a four-week period of improvement in April. But that was not a consistent improvement, and as aid groups have stated, the situation has gotten much worse since then, in large part because the Israelis crossed the US red line and invaded Rafah, which was where the entire aid infrastructure for Gaza was based. Aid groups haven't been able to rebuild that infrastructure.\n\nThat leads directly into the ICJ genocide case, because the case has raised the question: Are the Israelis trying to diminish the Palestinians or reduce their numbers as a protected group? Given that there's such a huge risk of starvation and disease in these overcrowded places, I think it strengthens the case and the scrutiny that South Africa and other nations have been calling for.\n\nFrom the US perspective, their approach throughout has been to say that this is not a matter for international discussion. They want it to be a matter between the United States and Israel. But given that they haven't been able to produce results, I think further ICJ discussions will say, \"Despite our orders clearly being issued, you haven't done anything with them, so it's on to other measures we can pursue.\"\n\nThe United States is very happy to seek international scrutiny when it appears convenient. When Biden wanted the UN Security Council to endorse his cease-fire proposal back in June, the United States was happy to go there and get the votes, but at the same time it can push back when it wants to. The charges of hypocrisy and double standards has become emblematic of this conflict and will remain a major issue for US standing in the world as a result of its Gaza policy for years to come.\n\nNow that we're on the cusp of a Trump administration, the ICC question in particular becomes more salient, because the last Trump administration actively targeted the ICC (something that we know Israel has done covertly as well). This is a fear that I've heard from folks close to the ICC: not only will the United States be rhetorically opposed to international accountability for both Israel and Hamas, but it will also take steps to stymy the investigations and make life harder for the ICC as it pursues these ongoing potential indictments for Netanyahu, Gallant, and others.\n\nBefore we come back to the US presidential election, I want to ask you another question about developments in the Middle East. You've spoken with us before about the role of Brett McGurk, who has been pushing the idea of a grand bargain with Saudi Arabia. Is McGurk still trying to promote that idea, and does he have any prospect of achieving his goal?\n\nThis would-be deal is a bargain in which the United States would provide security guarantees to Saudi Arabia, the Saudis would provide a long-term commitment to the United States, implicitly preventing them from growing closer to China and Russia, and the Saudis would give Israel recognition, which would be hugely significant, given their stature and influence in the Muslim-majority world. This is something that Israel has sought for a long time.\n\nThe Palestinians are left out of that equation. The discussion around this deal had always said there will be a \"component\" for the Palestinians. The importance of that component has grown as discussions have continued, and now the Saudis are saying they want it to be significantly bigger.\n\nWill those discussions keep going? I wish I had a commitment to anything as much as Brett McGurk does to a US-Saudi-Israel deal, so I think they will keep going, at least for the remainder of the Biden presidency. Biden administration officials, with McGurk chief among them, see this as a legacy issue for the president, in a similar way to how they see the AUKUS deal with Australia and the UK around nuclear submarines.\n\nThese are the kind of grand strategic efforts that may or may not bear fruit in the long run in terms of securing US influence in various theaters, but which unquestionably are very out of touch with where the US public is today. That disconnect is going to shape the continued discussion around the US-Saudi deal.\n\nThis proposal is catering to the DC think tank crowd, which loves ideas like this and generates endless position papers about them. But it's also catering to the future careers of men like McGurk, Blinken, and Jake Sullivan. These men who have been shaping the foreign policy of the Biden administration now have to think about the rest of their lives.\n\nBlinken was previously in private business, advising on geopolitical matters. Can he use this as a feather in his cap? Or Sullivan, who has future political ambitions? Can they say, \"Look, even though there were tens of thousands of dead civilians and no progress toward Israeli-Palestinian peace, at least we got this bargain\"? With the prospect of a Trump presidency and a very different kind of relationship between Trump and the Saudi royal family, I think any idea that this will be seen as a Biden administration win is now almost dead, but they're going to keep trying.\n\nAt the moment when Joe Biden was pressured into making way for Kamala Harris, many people who had been opposing Biden's support for Israel over the last year hoped that Harris would take some distance from his policy. As you noted earlier, that didn't prove to be the case: there was very little distance between Harris and Biden over Gaza, if indeed there was any distance between them at all. What were some of the key choices that her campaign made in relation to Gaza, and why? In the context of the Harris campaign, making those choices, what moves were made by Donald Trump and his associates? How did they position themselves in relation to Gaza and to Israel during the run-up to the presidential election?\n\nIt's important to track Harris's chief foreign policy advisor, Phil Gordon, because he was running a parallel messaging operation to Harris. While she was standing up next to Netanyahu saying, \"I will not be silent on the issue of the Palestinians,\" it fell to Gordon to say that she would not be pursuing an arms embargo, which was a demand that many antiwar activists were making of her. That shows you there was no worked-out approach to how she might think differently to Biden on Gaza.\n\nIn part, that was because the inner core of the Biden administration had made Harris and her team largely irrelevant on this issue. They might have been marginally consulted, but they were certainly never decision-makers and rarely had serious input. When she suddenly took over the mantle from Biden, there wasn't a ready-made playbook or Harris doctrine on Gaza, Lebanon, or Israel - any of it.\n\nHer campaign and her policy staff made a clear decision that they weren't going to develop that playbook. One of her key policy advisors, Ilan Goldenberg, is someone who has publicly and in detail thought about peace between Israel and the Palestinians, recommending some steps that the Biden administration didn't take. When Goldenberg was appointed as her outreach director to American Jewish communities, you didn't see him putting across any messages about differing from Biden.\n\nThat leads us into the DNC, where the request for a Palestinian American speaker was vividly denied, even though there were Israeli Americans who spoke from that stage. The campaign's response was to say, \"We had a Muslim American,\" which was not the same as having a Palestinian, particularly in the context of running against Donald Trump.\n\nTrump played this in a very interesting way. As some folks in the Uncommitted movement put it, he made himself appear to be both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine. On the one hand, Trump used the word \"Palestinian\" as a slur repeatedly in his debate with Biden, and also against Chuck Schumer. At the same time, his surrogates and his family members were out there saying, \"Trump will stop the wars.\"\n\nThey didn't have to say how Trump would stop the wars, because the alternative to what they were offering was very clear - it was the status quo Biden administration policy. There was no alternative to that policy coming from Harris. The only thing to which they were responding was the policy that people were watching as it produced dead babies every single day. That was the consequence of the Harris campaign choosing not to present an alternative plan.\n\nYou saw Trump, even in the last days of the campaign, make striking moves where he had \"Muslims for Trump\" on campaign stages. He had Arab American surrogates - including the father-in-law of his daughter Tiffany - out there saying he would personally help stop the wars in Lebanon and Gaza. Since the Harris team didn't have an answer and made a clear political judgment to ignore voters for whom this was a principal concern, Trump was able to romp.\n\nTrump is now in line to become the next president, but Joe Biden still has the powers of the presidency at his disposal for the next couple of months. Are there any significant moves that we can expect to see from Biden and his officials in whatever time is left to them?\n\nI've been talking to people inside government circles to try to understand what may come next. There was some talk and some hope that the Biden administration would use the unprecedented new policy it unveiled in February, giving the US power to financially target violent Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank who have been dealing out bloodshed and turmoil to a degree that hasn't been seen in decades.\n\nThey have applied some sanctions on those settlers, and there was speculation that they might apply them to more significant settler targets, or to institutions that enable settler violence, or even to ministers in Netanyahu's own cabinet, like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who are known extremists. But from what I'm hearing, a lot of that discussion has gone quiet. There's now a lot of waiting among US officials to see what the tone is from President Biden, and there hasn't been any clear communication of that.\n\nWhat you see in the efforts of Sullivan, Blinken, and others to work with the Trump transition team is, I think, an attempt to build good faith and trust with that team and not to try to tie their hands. Will this approach bear fruit for the Biden administration, in terms of the Trump people not rolling back every single thing they've done? It's quite unlikely to work in that sense, but that's probably what they're going to do.\n\nI'd also look at the US-Saudi file. There's a prospect that the Biden administration will try to shoehorn through some US-Saudi commitment that they can point to in the long run. I also think there's a real fear, particularly among Palestinians, about what will happen in this lame-duck period. We could see Netanyahu pursuing greater violence and bloodshed, feeling that Biden is not going to rein him in, and even if Trump has an interest in reining him in to some degree, he's not in office yet.\n\nFinally, I'd look at the diplomatic setting, where the United States shields Israel from scrutiny at the UN Security Council. Does the Biden administration allow some sort of resolution through in a face-saving effort before they leave office to say, \"We did allow Israel to be questioned in one way\"? That was a tactic that the Obama administration used, and perhaps the officials around Biden, many of whom did serve under Barack Obama, will use it again.\n\nWhat should we expect from the second Trump administration, and how will the choices made by Trump and his officials shape the decision-making of Netanyahu and his allies?\n\nIt's a very alarming picture for Palestinians and advocates of lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. You've already seen Trump appoint very hawkish pro-Israel figures, like his secretary of state pick, Marco Rubio. These are not people who have a history of saying they want to compromise with Palestinians in general, and still less with Hamas in particular.\n\nI think there's a possibility that Netanyahu will see it as being in his interest, and in line with Trump's campaign-trail promises, to achieve some sort of apparent compromise that will cover Lebanon and perhaps also Gaza, so that he and Trump can both claim a win. But what does that compromise look like?\n\nIs it a compromise that allows Israel to continue launching deadly strikes every few days or every few weeks, because we know that Hamas is resurgent, and we know that Israel wants to retain that capability? Is it a compromise that gives its blessing to the effective ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from northern Gaza, which has been discussed by some Israeli hard-liners, and the reestablishment of Israeli settlements within Gaza, which would be crossing a huge red line?\n\nThere's also a lot of anxiety about the future of the West Bank and what kind of settlement might be reached there. There has been outreach from the Palestinian side to the incoming Trump team, which could bear fruit to a certain degree, whether that involves Trump meeting Mahmoud Abbas or having him pressure Netanyahu to some extent.\n\nBut the overarching message we're getting from the Trump team is they want to push this under the rug as quickly as possible. We know that they are not a team that is focused on human rights and that they have been pretty derogatory toward Palestinians throughout their previous time in office, so they are not going to advance that goal in a way that will lead to a just or sustainable peace.\n\nThey want to turn toward more hawkish positions on China, and toward Ukraine and their planned trade war with Europe. Against that backdrop, I think they're going to pursue a messy settlement in the Middle East, and there's a real risk of bloodshed there. That's particularly clear if you think about Netanyahu, who has an incentive to solidify his power and his image as Israel's security savior.\n\nNetanyahu will be looking at his own political prospects for the next several years. His shift over the last year has been to abandon the idea of relying on the moderate or centrist forces in Israeli politics, to whatever degree those forces remain. He has become even more dependent on support from the far right, with their plans for annexing the West Bank and building settlements in Gaza or even Lebanon.\n\nInsofar as he has reached out to the center of Israeli politics - the kind of people that American liberals have sometimes looked to as saviors, such as Benny Gantz or Yair Lapid - the whole Israeli political spectrum has shifted so far to the right that even the centrist figures are now enabling those extreme polices. There's a lot of potential for greater bloodshed and violations of international law from this point.\n\nFinally, of course, Trump previously pursued a policy of applying maximum pressure on Iran. He is now saying that he might be open to negotiations with Iran. What kind of military risk is he prepared to take as a negotiating tactic? Remember, this is the man who ordered the assassination of Iran's top general, Qasem Soleimani, risking a major war.\n\nThe idea that Trump was a peace president was propagated on the back of some lucky moments and smart decision-making by Iran and other players to avoid a war. We may not be so lucky over the next four years of a Trump administration. There is huge potential for miscalculation, with figures like Netanyahu involved who are pursuing a broader conflict.\n\nAkbar Shahid Ahmed is the senior diplomatic correspondent for the Huffington Post .\n\nDaniel Finn is the features editor at Jacobin .

But the Left now needs to pivot immediately to opposition to the Joe Biden administration.\n\nJoe Biden speaks at a drive-in election night event at the Chase Center in the early morning hours of November 4, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware. (Tasos Katopodis / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe end of the Trump era is a good thing. As my friend and comrade David Griscom likes to put it, \"This is a show whose second season you don't want to see.\" Donald Trump appointed hard-core union busters to the National Labor Relations Board and a parade of Federalist Society ghouls to the federal judiciary. He doubled the rate of drone strikes in Yemen and brought the United States to the brink of war with Iran. He banned Muslims from entering the country and separated immigrant parents from their children.\n\nIf there were ever a case where the victory of the lesser evil over the greater evil merited busting out a bottle or two of champagne, this was it. But once you've sobered up, remember that being less evil than Trump is fully compatible with being an implacable enemy of the working class. The incoming Joe Biden administration doesn't deserve an ounce of credit for having the right intentions or a day of progressives patiently waiting to see how it acts before pivoting to a posture of opposition.\n\nThis might seem wildly overstated. A quick glance at the Biden/Harris campaign website shows that the president-elect wants to make community colleges tuition-free , create a public option to compete with private health insurance companies, and allow workers to unionize through a simple and easy card check process, which would boost labor's membership and power.\n\nSocialists have good reasons to criticize the inadequacy of these proposals. I've argued in previous Jacobin articles that proposals like the one on Biden's website to create a \"Medicare-like\" public option amount to proposals for a two-tiered health system that would lack most of the benefits of Medicare for All and would keep most of the downsides of the status quo. Similar points could be made about providing community college tuition-free but keeping the colleges where more affluent parents send their children expensive. But there's no denying that the reforms on Biden's website would improve the lives of millions of working-class people.\n\nThe problem is that there's no good reason to take any of those proposals seriously.\n\nJoe Biden became a Delaware senator in January 1973. He stayed in this office until he became Barack Obama's vice president in January 2009. He kept that job until January 2017, and he's pretty much been running for president since then. That means that we have forty-seven years of evidence to draw on to see who Biden is and what interests he represents.\n\nHis campaign website includes rhetoric about the evils of mass incarceration. It says that no one should be imprisoned for drug use alone, that the prison system should be focused on \"redemption and rehabilitation,\" and that we should work to reduce the number of incarcerated individuals.\n\nBut anyone with even a passing familiarity with his record in the Senate knows that he was one of the loudest voices calling for a harsher and more punitive criminal justice system for decades . When Radley Balko told the story of the series of \"tough on crime\" measures in his 2013 book Rise of the Warrior Cop , Biden's name came up again and again. Not so very long ago, Biden was bragging about this stuff.\n\nCandidate Biden's website includes a plan , adopted from Elizabeth Warren, to \"make it easier for people crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy.\" But Senator Biden played a major role in making it so hard in the first place! He was one of the main Democratic champions of a bankruptcy bill so harsh it was opposed even by many centrist Democrats.\n\nIt's not hard to multiply these contradictions between Biden's career and his campaign website. (It should also be noted that, despite ludicrous claims that circulated at the time she was picked as Biden's running mate that Kamala Harris was one of the most progressive members of the Senate, her record isn't all that much better.) But perhaps none of this should be too discouraging to those who share Bernie Sanders's hope that Biden could become \"the most progressive president since FDR.\"\n\nIt's technically possible that Biden has undergone some sort of Road to Damascus-style conversion experience, and that he's now dedicated to opposing the establishment interests he's spent his life serving. That sort of thing does happen. Wendell Potter , for example, went from being a health insurance executive who lobbied against even incremental reforms to a passionate advocate of single-payer.\n\nOne problem with this hypothesis is that he's very recently acted like the same old Biden. If he did undergo some Potter-type transformation, had it happened yet in June 2019, when he notoriously promised a roomful of wealthy donors that he wouldn't \"demonize\" the rich, no one's \"standard of living\" would decline under his presidency, and \"nothing would fundamentally change\"? What about this March, when even in the midst of the initial chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, he told an interviewer that if both houses of Congress passed Medicare for All while he was president, he would veto it? While not technically incompatible with the half measures he's officially committed to on health care and higher education, these moments don't exactly scream \"changed man.\"\n\nOnly two weeks ago, various outlets reported that Biden's transition team is vetting several Republicans for prominent cabinet positions, including Charlie Dent, a former congressman turned lobbyist, and John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio. When Dent rushed to register as a lobbyist after the legally mandated one-year \"cooling off\" period following his resignation from Congress, the clients he disclosed were pharmaceutical companies and private health insurance providers. As governor, Kasich was a notorious union-buster.\n\nEven if it's an overstatement to say that \"personnel is policy,\" this isn't the sort of team you'd be likely to assemble for an all-out push for reforms like card check and a public option.\n\nA more superficially realistic way of making the case that the proposals buried on the Biden/Harris should be taken seriously goes like this:\n\n\"Sure, Biden isn't a changed man. He's a cynical opportunist, just like he's been his whole career. But the winds have shifted. He was tough on crime back when that was popular, and he's against mass incarceration now that that's popular. He was all for getting tough on poor people trying to declare bankruptcy in 2005 when that kind of personal responsibility rhetoric played well, but now that the party's moved left, he's moved with it. Since he doesn't have any principles of his own, he'll go with the flow - and right now, that means he'll govern as a progressive.\"\n\nThis is more or less what the Trump/Pence campaign has spent most of the year trying to scare conservative suburbanites into believing: that despite Biden's long career as a business-friendly centrist, he was now little more than a front for Bernie and the Squad. Most leftists rolled their eyes when Trump said things like that, but maybe we shouldn't have. Maybe Biden really will govern as at least Bernie Lite.\n\nThere are at least three reasons not to buy this argument. The first is that when a politician spends decades acting one way and then he claims in an election year that he'll suddenly start acting in a very different way, it's rational to suspect that he's not a pure chameleon - that he really does have policy preferences, and that they really were reflected over the course of his long career in public life.\n\nThe second is that, while the rise of Bernie's movement and the popularity of its policy proposals really is an exciting development, saying that \"the party\" has moved to the left severely overstates the case. Out of hundreds of Democrats in Congress, the members of the informal \"democratic socialist caucus\" can still be counted on one hand.\n\nThe third and most significant is that we don't have to speculate about what someone from the centrist wing of the Democratic Party making left-populist promises while running for president would do in office. We've seen this movie before. When what Biden likes to call \"the Obama/Biden administration\" came to power, Obama's campaign platform included both card check and a public option.\n\nThe story that was fed to the Democratic base was that Obama tried to get a public option until very late in the process of passing the Affordable Care Act, but it just wasn't possible to get sixty votes for one in the Senate. The awkward fact that the ACA ended up being passed via a reconciliation process that only required fifty votes was always a problem for this narrative, but in any case, it was later revealed that the idea of including \"a public plan\" was taken off the table as early as the summer of 2009 in negotiations with the insurance companies and the hospital association.\n\nCard check was dropped much more quietly. After what could only very generously be described as a \"push\" from the Obama administration, it never even made it to a vote. The administration's point man for that \"push\" was . . . Vice President Biden. Bad memories of that episode lingered last year when Biden was working to line up union endorsements for his run for president.\n\nWas Obama insincere in his support for these reforms? Maybe, maybe not. The structural problem is that even if he truly had a mild but genuine preference for card check over the current process for recognizing unions and for a version of the ACA that included a public option to one that didn't, it wouldn't have mattered. Serious attempts to push for such reforms would inevitably run into stiff resistance from moneyed interests, and it would be absurd to expect centrists like Obama or Biden to expend the political capital they would have had to expend and burn the bridges they would have had to burn to overcome that resistance.\n\nIt's even possible that Obama meant it when he promised to protect whistleblowers, and he said over and over during the 2008 election that as president he would \"close Guantanamo and restore habeus corpus .\" But structurally, similar problems would have arisen with any attempt to confront the national security establishment over those issues - and there was never any reason to think that Obama would go all in on such a fight.\n\nEven a hypothetical President Sanders could only have overcome capital's resistance to his agenda by means of a massive mobilization at the grassroots. The chances of President-Elect Biden calling such a movement into being and leading it to victory are less than zero.\n\nWe know how the movie ended last time. The Obama/Biden administration bombed weddings in Pakistan, pursued Edward Snowden around the world, and presided over a steady expansion of economic inequality at home. It coordinated with local officials to repress Occupy Wall Street , and it waged a quiet but effective war against teachers' unions.\n\nMaybe the sequel will be different. I'd love to be proven wrong about all of this, and I'd spend the next four years fighting with liberals about issues like whether Biden's newly enacted public option is good enough or we need to press on to Medicare for All. But we can't operate on that assumption. We certainly can't afford to hold off on attacking the incoming administration on the belief that Biden wants the things we want and he's trying his best.\n\nAs George W. Bush famously didn't quite manage to say, \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\"\n\nBen Burgis is a philosophy professor and the author of Give Them An Argument: Logic for the Left .

(Nate Smallwood / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nHere's a sad little secret about the current political moment: almost no one who talks about the \"rule of law\" actually cares about it. As with so many things in today's political discourse, Democrats use the \"rule of law\" - like \"authoritarianism\" and \"democracy\" - as little more than a partisan talking point for the narrow purpose of undermining Donald Trump and his presidential campaign.\n\nWhat else explains the across-the-board silence to President Joe Biden's flagrant, monthslong violation of US laws throughout Israel's war on Gaza?\n\nYesterday ProPublica reported that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has simply been ignoring his own officials' months-old recommendations to cut off military aid to Israeli military and police units accused of torture and other abuses, as is required by US law. These particular abuses - which include the torture and rape of a teenager and extrajudicial killings - aren't even related to the never-ending litany of atrocities the world has watched play out every day over the course of the campaign in Gaza: they purely concern incidents that happened before the start of the war, mostly in the West Bank, which is not controlled by Hamas.\n\nThere is no ambiguity here. The Leahy Laws passed in 1997, named after the long-serving Vermont senator Patrick Leahy who was their primary author, states flatly that Pentagon money \"may not be used for any training, equipment, or other assistance for a foreign security force unit\" if there is \"credible information that such unit has committed a gross violation of human rights.\"\n\nWhile the Biden administration has gone around this by simply claiming they \"have not seen any violations,\" the State Department officials that spoke to ProPublica , as well as the official documents that were provided to the outlet, show that this is plainly a lie: Blinken was informed about these particular abuses all the way back in December.\n\nLeahy himself, who retired in 2023, has effectively accused his own party's administration of breaking the law, after he was asked earlier this year if Biden's unceasing flow of weapons to Israel was in line with his legislation. \"No. Is that succinct enough for you?\" he replied , adding that \"the number of civilians who are being injured or killed by US paid armaments\" was a clear violation of its provisions.\n\nAs bad as this is, it's just one law that Biden has broken with his unconditional facilitation of the Israeli war.\n\nThe same month Blinken was informed about Israeli human rights abuses, Biden used emergency authority under the Arms Export Control Act to leapfrog Congress and sell more than $106 million worth of tank shells. But that law states specifically that US military assistance can be provided \"solely for internal security (including for anti-terrorism and nonproliferation purposes), for legitimate self-defense,\" or to take part in operations under the umbrella of the UN or those consistent with the UN Charter - none of which describes what Israel is doing in Gaza.\n\nOthers include section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act (which \"prohibits the United States from providing security assistance or arms sales to any country\" whose government restricts US humanitarian aid) and Biden's own Conventional Arms Transfer Policy from February 2023 (\"no arms transfer will be authorized\" when \"it is more likely than not that the arms to be transferred will be used by the recipient to commit . . . genocide; crimes against humanity,\" and other human rights violations), as well as a panoply of international humanitarian law treaties that the United States has signed and ratified, making them US law, too.\n\nAs of last month, Biden is also now officially in violation of the War Powers Resolution, passed by a Democratic Congress to rein in future renegade presidents after Richard Nixon secretly widened the war in Vietnam to carry out a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. Biden unilaterally started the now three-month-long (and counting ) war against the Houthis in Yemen without even a shadow of the legal justification that's been used historically to excuse presidents snatching this prerogative from Congress.\n\nHe was theoretically still within the law as long as he notified Congress about the war within forty-eight hours of starting it (which he did) and got congressional authorization down the line for it after sixty days (which he didn't). The Stimson Center's James A. Siebens has called it a \"latent constitutional crisis.\"\n\nNone of these violations have gotten even an iota of the attention or fiery denunciation as the most trivial of Donald Trump's criminal indictments (not to be confused with the very serious ones ), like the one surrounding his disguised payments to former porn star Stormy Daniels, the trial over which began this week. But hey: illegally starting wars, violating treaties, breaking prohibitions on facilitating human rights abuses - little matters like these hardly compare in importance to a presidential candidate paying hush money to his mistress.\n\nAs all of this should remind us, it's now deeply internalized in US politics across partisan lines and by politicians and the press alike that the rule of law simply doesn't apply to foreign policy, even though the US president's ability to embroil the country in foreign wars is arguably the office's single most consequential and far-reaching facet. Presidents have now gotten away with so much brazen lawbreaking in this sphere - whether George W. Bush's global system of torture dungeons and lying the country into Iraq, or Barack Obama's illegal war in Libya and claiming of the power to assassinate US citizens without due process - that any violations along these lines are now considered unremarkable, even a routine part of a newly sworn-in president's rite of passage .\n\nThat's why hardly anyone bats an eye when Dick Cheney, who lied the country into a war that killed thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, turns up in an ad admonishing Trump for having \"lie[d] to his supporters\" and charging there is \"no greater threat to our republic.\" It's why there was outrage over Trump's mishandling of classified documents, but almost nothing said about the fact that those documents laid out secret plans for war with Iran . George W. Bush's scandalous \"imperial presidency\" has now simply become the presidency .\n\nTo ( possibly ) paraphrase Mahatma Gandhi, a US commitment to the rule of law would certainly be a good idea. But as the collective yawn induced by President Biden's serial lawbreaking over the course of the Gaza war shows, there is no such thing. And the lack of pushback, let alone accountability, he's facing for it will serve the country much worse under presidential administrations to come.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It suggests that his policy has been not just morally monstrous but maybe politically disastrous too.\n\nA voter from the pro-Palestine uncommitted campaign rallies outside of a polling location at Maples Elementary School on February 27, 2024, in Dearborn, Michigan.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nA new poll of voters in five key battleground states has found that President Joe Biden's handling of the Israeli assault on Gaza is greatly impacting his chances of reelection - with some 20 percent \"less likely\" to show up for him at the ballot box in November.\n\nThe poll, released Tuesday and conducted by YouGov, was commissioned by Americans for Justice in Palestine Action (AJP Action), a political group, and voters were surveyed in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, where Democrats narrowly won in 2020, as well as in Minnesota, where Democrats and former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton edged out Donald Trump in 2016.\n\n\"What this opinion poll suggests is that Biden cannot continue to ignore the convictions and demands of a large segment of the Democratic electoral base if he wants to preserve his chances of winning,\" said Osama Abuirshaid, AJP Action's executive director.\n\n\"A large percentage of Democrats oppose his handling of the Israeli war in Gaza,\" Abuirshaid said. \"A larger percentage of them want to see a change in his policy and an immediate and permanent cease-fire.\"\n\nA news release about the poll from AJP Action noted that \"across all five states, a critical margin of voters - roughly one in five - are less likely to vote for Biden on account of his handling of the war in Gaza.\" The YouGov poll \"included a representative sample of 500 registered Democratic and Independent voters\" in each of the five states, according to a summary of the report from AJP Action.\n\nHalah Ahmad, who worked as a researcher on the YouGov poll, shared an analysis of the narrow vote differentials and margins for both the 2016 and 2020 elections for president in those five states.\n\nArizona, Ahmad reported, had a differential of 91,234 votes in 2016 and 10,457 in 2020. Pennsylvania showed 44,292 votes in 2016 compared to 80,555 in 2020, while the Uncommitted campaign there netted 57,951 votes. In Wisconsin, the vote differential was 22,748 in 2016 and was even smaller in 2020, when 20,682 votes separated Biden from Trump.\n\nMichigan saw a difference of 10,704 votes in 2016 and 154,188 in 2020, while some 101,436 voters chose \"uncommitted\" this year. Minnesota saw 44,765 votes in 2016 and 233,012 in 2020, along with 45,913 votes for \"uncommitted\" in the most recent primary.\n\nAll five states included in the poll have sizable Arab and Muslim American populations and contain large urban areas that will be key to Democrats' and President Joe Biden's efforts to secure enough votes to beat former president Donald Trump and overcome the typically narrow margins in those states.\n\nThose five states were also home to surprisingly successful primary campaigns that are part of the \"uncommitted\" national movement that has upstaged Biden in many states, even as he carried them.\n\nThe uncommitted movement first exploded in Michigan, which held its primary on February 27 and saw more than 100,000 people cast ballots for \"uncommitted,\" which was about 20 percent of all votes cast. Biden won Michigan by only about 150,000 votes in 2020.\n\nOn April 2, \"uninstructed\" received nearly 50,000 votes in Wisconsin, more than double the campaign's goal of 20,000 votes, which represented the slim margin of victory for Biden in 2020.\n\nThe uncommitted movement is still spreading, and there are even uncommitted delegates who will be at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The movement resonates with many Democratic voters who feel as though they cannot vote for Biden as long as his administration continues to fund, fuel, and enable the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"President Biden's backing of Israel's war in Gaza has fractured his party, with one in five voters less likely to support him in November,\" offered political analyst and Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid.\n\n\"However, Biden has a path to reuniting his coalition,\" added Shahid, the former spokesperson for Justice Democrats, \"by ending weapons transfers to [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu.\n\nSaqib Bhatti, the co-executive director of the Action Center on Race & the Economy, wrote in an opinion article for In These Times in late October that \"I am done voting for the lesser of two evils. I will not vote for Joe Biden in 2024.\"\n\nAt the time, some political observers believed that Bhatti's position was something of an outlier. But it soon became clear that Bhatti spoke for a large number of US voters who also felt that \"you're allowed to be a single-issue voter if the issue is genocide.\"\n\nBut even as the uncommitted movement gained traction and primary after primary showed how dejected many voters are with the Biden administration's support for the Israeli assault on Gaza, the poll released Tuesday illuminates the dramatic contours of the uphill battle Democrats face in their effort to keep Biden in the Oval Office.\n\n\"This puts Biden before a choice: either he does the morally and politically right thing and preserve his chances in the November elections, or he continues on the current path and risks jeopardizing his reelection bid,\" Abuirshaid said. \"What is certain is that the war in Gaza has turned into an electoral issue this year.\"\n\nReema Ahmad, a Palestinian organizer in Wisconsin who helped lead the uninstructed campaign, said the poll's results are \"not surprising\" but nonetheless \"sobering.\"\n\n\"It's always helpful to have data that reflects and sheds more light on conversations that we're having in community with voters,\" Ahmad said.\n\n\"We know that elections are close in Wisconsin, and that we can expect that they'll be close yet again in the general election in November. So these stats are sobering,\" she said. \"I hope it continues to put pressure on the administration to make the policy changes, to take the actions that a majority of Americans continue to push for - and certainly a majority of Biden's base that elected him in 2020.\"\n\nThe YouGov poll follows the release of Times /Siena polls about a week ago that also highlighted voters that were or may be abandoning Biden because of his position on Gaza.\n\n\"Around 13% of the voters who say they voted for Mr. Biden last time, but do not plan to do so again, said that his foreign policy or the war in Gaza was the most important issue to their vote,\" wrote Nate Cohn of the New York Times in the article \" Trump Leads in 5 Key States, as Young and Nonwhite Voters Express Discontent With Biden .\"\n\n\"Just 17% of those voters reported sympathizing with Israel over the Palestinians,\" wrote Cohn, who went on to quote a thirty-year-old Georgia voter who supported Biden at the polls in 2020 but currently plans to vote for a third party in November.\n\nThe new YouGov poll also found that at least 40 percent of Democratic and independent voters in each of the states surveyed \"say that imposing an immediate and lasting cease-fire, conditioning aid to Israel, and ensuring full entry of humanitarian aid would make voters more likely to vote for Biden in November.\"\n\nKyle Johnson, political director of the Milwaukee-based organization Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (BLOC), supported the uninstructed campaign and said that whether or not Biden takes those actions could successfully sway him to turn out for the incumbent. But, Johnson said, that would also depend on how Biden talked about those decisions and whether enough is done to address the harm his support for the genocide has already inflicted on many voters and communities across the United States.\n\n\"If it's referenced in more of a political manner or something to be celebrated as a victory lap, then that's crass and it's unacceptable,\" Johnson said. \"If it's a reckoning and a realization that this is something that we should have never even been participating in, in the first place, and the right time to address this harm was six, seven, eight months ago, but we're here now, then that's a different conversation to have. I think that would be meaningful for people.\"\n\nHalah Ahmad, the researcher, noted that \"these results are hard to dismiss.\"\n\n\"Even when taking into account the counterpoint, voters who approve of Biden's handling of the war also support a cease-fire and other de-escalatory policies,\" she said. \"While Israel has renewed its bombardment on Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza and other areas at levels we haven't seen since October, this poll is a stark reminder for the administration that voters in states that matter are paying attention - Biden can't afford to pretend otherwise.\"\n\nDahlia Saba, one of the organizers of the student encampment on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, said those actions \"would make people reconsider\" whether they would vote for Biden, but \"it's important to note that those criteria are the bare minimum for a lot of people.\"\n\n\"This is not an issue of messaging. This is an issue of policy,\" Saba said. \"If [Biden] wants to get reelected, he needs to make sure that his policy is in alignment with what young voters want, which is to stop supporting Israel - especially as it commits a genocide - and to protect the human rights of Palestinians.\"\n\nOmar Mussa, an organizer with the Pennsylvania uncommitted campaign, said that for the administration to take action now \"wouldn't hurt.\" But for some, it may be too late.\n\nMussa said that they \"have friends that lost ninety-nine family members since October\" and that others have \"lost forty, fifty\" friends and family members in the Israeli military's mass murder of Palestinians since October.\n\n\"What does it mean to lose not just mothers and fathers and sisters and cousins and aunts and uncles, but to completely obliterate an entire family line of family tree off the face of the earth?\" Mussa asked.\n\n\"What people are most devastated about is that we know the power of America,\" Mussa said. \"We know that a simple phone call from the president could have put a stop to this in October.\"\n\n\"Now is the time for this administration to make the policy changes on a whole host of issues, including on the genocide underway in Gaza,\" Ahmad said.\n\nRegardless of how many voters might be swayed by Biden taking clear actions that would represent a significant shift in his positions on Gaza, Ahmad said she returns to what is fundamentally a moral question that is in front of the president.\n\n\"Now is the time for this administration to make the policy changes on a whole host of issues, including on the genocide underway in Gaza,\" Ahmad said.\n\n\"Make those policy decisions now. There will be a time for voters to decide how and who they will vote for, but we have a whole five months for people to be making those decisions,\" she said.\n\n\"Meanwhile, every single day people are killed through our tax dollars. The very least that this administration could do is listen to what a majority of Americans have been calling for for the last seven months.\"\n\nChristina Lieffring is the news and politics editor at Tone Madison and a freelance journalist in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Dear Joe Biden: Here's How You Can Protect Reproductive Rights From Trump's Zealots\n\nMother Jones illustration; Michael Brochstein/Zuma; Bonnie Cash, Pool Via Cnp/CNP/Zuma\n\nTrump's reelection has been described by advocates and experts as a final blow to reproductive rights.\n\nThese fears are not unfounded. Trump appointed three of the five conservative Supreme Court justices who overruled Roe v. Wade , ending the constitutional right to abortion and unleashing a health care apocalypse . Vulnerable women found themselves in even greater danger thanks to abortion bans in more than a dozen states that have enabled abusers and left doctors fearful of prosecution if they intervene in pregnancy-related emergencies that require abortion care. ProPublica reported such bans appeared to have led to the deaths of several women in Georgia and Texas who were unable to get necessary abortion care when faced with dire medical complications. Add to this, Project 2025 -the 900-plus-page extremist guidebook to a second Trump term- recommends that various federal agencies take sweeping actions to roll back abortion access.\n\nTrump's convictions on abortion have been flexible throughout his career. During the presidential campaign, he tried to distance himself from Project 2025 and claimed he would leave abortion policy \"to the states.\" Immediately after the election, however, his acolytes admitted that \"Project 2025 is the agenda.\"\n\nGiven all this, reproductive rights experts and advocates agree that the future of abortion access is bleak. But there are several actions President Biden and his administration could take before Inauguration Day that could make it harder for the next administration to enact their absolutist anti-abortion agenda. \"Some of [the ideas] are just throwing monkey wrenches into the gears,\" says David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University whose scholarly work focuses on abortion access, \"and maybe with the chaotic Trump administration that helps delay some of the harm.\"\n\n\"Some of [the ideas] are just throwing monkey wrenches into the gears, and maybe with the chaotic Trump administration, that helps delay some of the harm.\"\n\nWhile Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned on \"restoring reproductive freedom,\" it's unclear if the Biden administration will prioritize these requests before the transition. The White House did not respond on the record to the specific proposals mentioned in this story, but pointed to the administration's record of defending and expanding reproductive rights. But some say there's more they can, and should, do. \"If the administration was hesitant or holding off, now is the time, I think, to not hesitate,\" Rachel Rebouché, reproductive rights legal scholar and dean of Temple Law School, says.\n\nHere's a look at some of what the administration could do to stymie the Trump administration's anti-abortion agenda before he's back in the White House.\n\nPreemptively Pardon Providers of Abortion Pills\n\nThe Comstock Act is a 19th-century anti-obscenity law still on the books that anti-abortion Republicans argue should be used to \"enforce federal law against providers and distributors of [abortion] pills.\" In December 2022, Biden's DOJ issued a memo arguing that the law cannot be used to prosecute abortion pill providers. Earlier this year, Democrats in Congress introduced legislation to repeal parts of the bill lawmakers say could be most relevant to abortion, but the measure has languished in House and the Senate committees.\n\nGiven that Project 2025 advises Trump's DOJ to invoke the Comstock Act to prosecute providers of abortion pills, some advocates suggest that Biden preemptively pardon anyone who could be implicated for doing so. Cohen, from Drexel, notes that a preemptive pardon \"would make it so that the people who have been mailing [abortion] pills, or mailing procedural instruments or supplies, are not at risk of being prosecuted.\"\n\nJodi Jacobson, founder and executive director of the initiative Healthcare Across Borders, described the proposal as \"a proactive thing that the Biden administration can do to automatically protect people over the five-year statute of limitations\" for federal offenses . Jacobson oversees a coalition that comprises several reproductive health advocacy organizations that plan to ask the Biden administration to issue the blanket preemptive pardon. \"This is a no-brainer-there is no reason not to do this,\" she says, adding that it would \"take off the table the immediate criminalization of folks who have been trying to save lives.\"\n\nTrump's Food and Drug Administration, though, could still revoke its approval of abortion pills, as Project 2025 recommends-but the preemptive pardon would protect providers who could otherwise face prosecution. Experts concede that while there would likely be legal challenges, \"pardon power is pretty plenary to the president,\" Cohen says. President Gerald Ford preemptively pardoned his predecessor, President Richard Nixon, for instance, which allowed Nixon to avoid Watergate-related charges (but ignited a national outcry). The Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the proposal from Mother Jones .\n\nPush to Fill V acancies in the Federal Judiciary\n\nBiden cannot shift the balance of the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority before he leaves office, but the president and Senate Democrats do have the power to attempt to fill the 47 vacancies for open seats in the federal judiciary, mostly in federal district courts.\n\n\"We know the federal courts will continue to be central in the fight for reproductive freedom; the administration and Congress must be vigilant now in safeguarding our rights as much as possible,\" Karen Stone, vice president of public policy and government relations at Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement provided to Mother Jones .\n\n\"We know the federal courts will continue to be central in the fight for reproductive freedom; the administration and Congress must be vigilant now in safeguarding our rights as much as possible.\"\n\nThe significance of these lifetime appointments for the future of reproductive rights becomes apparent when you consider Matthew Kacsmaryk. He's a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas who issued an anti-science ruling last year that paved the way for anti-abortion activists to bring a case to the Supreme Court challenging the FDA's approval of mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion. (The justices ultimately struck down the case, ruling that the anti-abortion plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit, as my colleague Nina Martin reported .)\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court sent the case on emergency abortion care back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals-a federal court in California with 10 Trump-appointed judges and jurisdiction over more than a dozen district courts in nine states. \"The power of lower court federal judges is immense,\" Cohen says, \"because the Supreme Court only deals with such a limited number of cases.\"\n\nOnce Biden makes a nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee, currently chaired by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), recommends whether to send nominees to a full floor vote, which is required for their confirmation. A spokesperson for Durbin's office said that, as of Wednesday morning, there were 16 nominees ready for a floor vote, and eight more who have had committee hearings and are waiting for a committee vote. The spokesperson added that Durbin \"aims to confirm every possible nominee before the end of this Congress.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, \"We are going to get as many done as we can.\"\n\nBut that won't necessarily be easy. Trump said in a social media post this weekend that \"no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership.\" Indeed, for Senate Democrats, time is of the essence. The next session of Congress begins January 3, just over two weeks before Trump takes office-so Biden's nominees would need to be approved by after the New Year to make it onto the bench. Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), whose vote is crucial in the tight Senate, may once again undermine Democrats' plans. He told Politico in March he would not support any Biden-nominated judge unless they have at least one Republican supporter.\n\nStill, several advocates say they hope Senate Democrats make the necessary effort to get as many Biden-nominated judges approved as possible, considering the influence they'll likely have on the future of reproductive rights. \"If [getting judges approved] means working over Thanksgiving, working over Christmas, working over New Year's-do it,\" Cohen says. \"This is not something that should be gifted to Trump.\" One way they could speed circumvent Republican opposition is by dispensing with a tradition known as \"blue slips,\" in which senators weigh in on whether or not they support the federal court nominees for their state. There is precedent for this: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), former chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, abandoned the tradition-to the ire of Democrats -to get two Trump-nominated judges confirmed despite opposition from their home states' Democratic senators. With only two months until the next Congress, Senate Democrats may not want to buck this tradition, though; they may want to keep \"blue slips\" as a weapon in their own arsenal as they anticipate Trump's nominees to the federal judiciary.\n\nFinalize Pending Reproductive Health-Related Rules for Federal Agencies\n\nThe Biden administration made headlines last month when it announced a proposed rule to allow 52 million women with private health insurance to obtain over-the-counter contraception for free under the Affordable Care Act. (Trump, on the other hand, has said he wants to \"replace\" Obamacare. And while he claims he would not restrict contraception access, it will face myriad threats in his administration, as my colleague Madison Pauly recently reported .)\n\nBut the contraception rule has yet to be finalized , and its pathway to becoming a reality is less straightforward than the optimistic White House press release suggests. After the public comment period-which has, so far, only attracted 2 people-ends on December 27, officials will analyze the comments and then write the final rule, which could then not even take effect for another 30 days.\n\nUnlike executive orders, which can be wiped out with the stroke of a pen, rules approved for federal agencies are typically harder to undo. That's thanks to the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines the process of how a proposed rule becomes a finalized regulation, and requires that federal agencies do not act in a way that is \"arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\" Rebouché, from Temple Law School, says the administration needs to aim to get the contraception rule-and any other similar ones-finalized as soon as possible. \"Any rule that's already in process, push forward,\" she says.\n\nKatie O'Connor, senior director of federal abortion policy at the National Women's Law Center, would like to see the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's promise to launch a rule focused on ensuring \"modern-day digital data brokers are not misusing or abusing our sensitive data\" come to pass. An investigation by the office of Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) earlier this year found that a data broker tracked visits by individuals to 600 Planned Parenthood locations across the country and then sold the data for an anti-abortion ad campaign. Even though the rule was promised last year, a CFPB spokesperson says they did not have any update.\n\nEven if the agency tried to ram it through, though, any rules that get finalized at this late stage of the administration are at risk of being overturned in the next session of the GOP-controlled Congress, thanks to the Congressional Review Act , notes Steven Balla, associate professor of political science at George Washington University and co-director of the school's Regulatory Studies Center. During Trump's first term, Congress used the legislation to overturn 16 rules issued at the end of the preceding Obama administration-the most of any administration, ever , Balla explains.\n\nComplete Investigations Into Hospitals A c c u s e d o f V i o l a t i n g Federal Law on Emergency Abortion Care\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court heard a case on whether hospitals must provide abortions to people whose lives or health are at risk, even in states with abortion bans, under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act , known as EMTALA. In a 6-3 decision -with Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissenting-the court sent the case back to a lower court, refusing to rule on the merits of the Biden administration's argument that EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency abortion care in states with post- Dobbs abortion bans that lack exceptions for a patient's health. Project 2025 proposes an alternative approach: The guidebook says that \"EMTALA requires no abortions\" and that HHS should stop investigating hospitals that have failed to comply with its interpretation of the law.\n\nAbortion rights advocates say Biden's HHS should complete as many investigations as possible into hospitals that may have violated their interpretation of EMTALA by not providing stabilizing abortion care when needed. Otherwise, the Trump administration would inherit them, a spokesperson for the Center for Reproductive Rights points out.\n\nThat spokesperson added that the organization has also submitted three recent complaints to HHS, focused on hospitals in Texas and Arizona that allegedly violated EMTALA by failing to provide medically necessary abortions to women in need. A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at HHS said the agency does not comment on ongoing investigations.\n\nBut even if these investigations were undertaken and completed before the transition, reports suggest they would be unlikely to face penalties from the Biden administration. Investigations recently published by the Associated Press found that more than 100 pregnant women were turned away from emergency rooms while they were in medical distress over the past two years, and that none of those hospitals were fined . Last year, HHS announced it was investigating two unnamed hospitals for allegedly violating the law by failing to offer a woman with a nonviable pregnancy the abortion care she needed. The National Women's Law Center said it filed the complaint on behalf of Mylissa Farmer and identified the hospitals as Freeman Hospital West in Joplin, Missouri, and the University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kansas. A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told Mother Jones Wednesday, \"Both hospitals are back in compliance,\" but did not clarify whether they had faced monetary penalties.\n\nOne thing that both advocates and officials agree on? Elections have consequences, and there's a limit to what Biden administration can actually do to mitigate the decades-long damage the Trump administration could do to reproductive rights once he takes office. \"The electorate was confused or didn't really care about abortion,\" Cohen says, \"and we're reaping the reality of it.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Biden Makes History by Commuting 4,000 Total Sentences in Last Days in Office\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks from the Oval Office of the White House as he gives his farewell address. Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP\n\nThis morning President Joe Biden announced that he is commuting the sentences of nearly 2,500 people serving longer prison terms for convictions related to crack cocaine. In doing so, Biden made history and set the record for the most total individual commutations by a president in history at over 4,000.\n\n\"Today's clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes,\" Biden said in a statement issued by the White House on Friday.\n\nThis distinction was set by a 1986 law drafted by then-Sen. Joe Biden that set a hundred-to-one ratio for sentencing for powder and crack cocaine. A 2010 bill lowered it to a still disproportionate eighteen-to-one and the 2018 Fair Sentencing Act reduced minimum sentences. Almost four in five people convicted of trafficking crack cocaine were Black in fiscal year 2021, compared to just 25 percent for powder cocaine.\n\nIn 2022, Biden's Justice Department announced that it would no longer differentiate between powder and crack cocaine when seeking charges, saying the disparity had \"no basis in science, furthers no law enforcement purposes, and drives unwarranted racial disparities in our criminal justice system.\"\n\nToday's actions retroactively reduce the sentences of those who would have faced shorter prison sentences if crack and powdered cocaine had been treated the same.\n\nPrison reform advocates are pleased. \"This action is an essential step toward righting historical wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities that overwhelmingly harm Black and Latino people, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending too much time behind bars,\" Maya Wiley, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said in a statement,\n\nEarlier this week, I spoke with Sarah Gersten , executive director of the Last Prisoner Project, about the push to get Biden to act in his final days as president.\n\nShe said in a statement that \"President Biden's actions remind us that meaningful change is possible when people work together and listen to what is needed to provide true justice through second chances.\"\n\nGersten added that she hopes Biden will extend clemency to those incarcerated for federal marijuana charges. In today's statement, Biden said he would continue to review commutations and pardons, indicating that more historic clemency could come in his last three days in office.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Biden Has Officially Appointed More Judges Than Trump\n\nPresident Biden has officially surpassed president-elect Trump's record of judicial confirmations...by one. Al Drago-Pool/CNP/ZUMA\n\nPresident Joe Biden has officially surpassed president-elect Donald Trump's record of judicial appointed to federal courts-by one single judge.\n\nOn Friday, the Senate Judiciary Committee, tasked with carrying out the confirmations of Biden's appointees, announced that it had confirmed Biden's 235th judge-one more than Trump during his term in office, when he blitzed the courts with white, male, right-wing judicial activists. \"We just beat Donald Trump's judicial confirmation record,\" the committee announced in a post on X. \"Our 235 judges confirmed under President Biden are diverse, fair, qualified, and will be a frontline of defense on attacks against our democracy.\"\n\nThe judges will be \"a significant protection for our civil rights and civil liberties to preserve our democracy\" in Trump's next term, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the committee, told reporters on Friday. As I have reported , the judges-who are appointed for life-play a significant role in deciding cases focused on reproductive rights, among many other issues of major importance to Americans; it was Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas, for example, who issued the anti-science ruling last year that paved the way for anti-abortion activists to bring an ultimately unsuccessful case to the Supreme Court challenging the FDA's approval of mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in a medication abortion.\n\nThe sheer amount of cases federal judges take on also contributes to their power: \"The power of lower court federal judges is immense,\" David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University, told me last month, \"because the Supreme Court only deals with such a limited number of cases.\"\n\nThe courts are also expected to play a particularly significant role in light of the threats posed by Trump, who has threatened to prosecute his political enemies, and the ultra-conservative Supreme Court that has enabled political corruption, as my colleague Pema Levy recently wrote .\n\n\"The rule of law, which we used to take for granted, is under enormous stress, and is really threatened,\" Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said Friday, \"and the importance of what we did is that we have 235 jurors who are committed to the rule of law-and that includes a respect for judicial restraint, a respect for the proper role of the legislative branch, and a willingness to step in when there's overreach, either by the legislature or the executive branch.\"\n\nAccording to the committee, the confirmed judges include 187 district court nominees, 45 circuit court nominees, one Supreme Court nominee- Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson , the first Black woman on the high court-and two Court of International Trade nominees. About two-thirds of the judges confirmed under Biden are women and about two-fifths are women of color-both records, the committee says.\n\n\"Judges shape our lives,\" Biden said in a post on X, announcing the record-setting confirmation. \"I'm proud of those who heeded the call to serve, and of the legacy I'll leave with the men and women I've appointed.\"\n\n\"These exceptionally qualified individuals are dedicated to upholding the rule of law,\" added Vice President Kamala Harris, \"and they reflect the diversity of America.\"\n\nTrump does not appear to have publicly commented on Biden beating his record-but he may be glad to know that there are still 36 judicial vacancies he can fill in the federal courts, all but 2 in the district courts. (A couple of Biden's nominees did not wind up being confirmed after he reportedly did not formally submit their nominations to the Senate in time.) Republicans are already preparing to squash Biden's newly-established record: \"On January 20 of 2029, Trump's going to brag about having 240,\" incoming Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told NBC News.\n\nTo Cohen, the law professor from Drexel, the news is more nuanced than either Democrats or Republicans would like it to be. \"Multiple things can be true at the same time,\" he told me Sunday. \"It's fantastic they confirmed so many judges to counterbalance the Trump cadre of judges. But also, there should be zero vacancies remaining.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Drug War Victims Have Been Incarcerated for Decades. Biden Has Just Days to Free Them.\n\nA demonstrator waves a flag with marijuana leaves outside of the White House in 2016 Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nPresident Joe Biden is running out of time, and so are federal prisoners awaiting clemency for marijuana-related criminal charges stemming from a tough-on-crime approach he helped promote.\n\nThat fact is on display, literally, on a website launched by the Last Prisoner Project, one of several advocacy groups that have called on the president to make use of his clemency powers before Donald Trump takes office on January 20.\n\nIn December, the president commuted the sentences for 37 inmates facing the federal death penalty to life in prison. That earned him the praise of advocates like Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, who called the move \"one of the seminal achievements of the Biden presidency.\"\n\nSince democrats lost last November's election, Biden has tried to make good on a campaign promise from the 2020 primary. Back then, he said, \"anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged.\" Biden commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people convicted of non-violent offenses who were serving out their time in home confinement.\n\nAt the time, while Biden's clemency action was historic, it still left behind thousands of people facing federal prison sentences for marijuana-related charges. And those facing longer prison sentences because of the racist disparity between the sentences for powder and crack cocaine. That disparity was set by a 1986 bill drafted by then-Senator Joe Biden which he later said he regretted . (The White House did not respond to questions about whether Biden was planning to issue additional pardons or commutations)\n\nSome people who had their sentences commuted by Biden received legal and financial assistance from the Last Prisoner Project. The organization's executive director,  Sarah Gersten, told me over email that clemency has \"transformative effects on people and communities across the country.\"\n\nGersten points to Flavio Tamez, who she says was able to better care for his children and help run the family business after having his prison time commuted while on home confinement.\n\n\"When a person goes to prison for a long time, it is not only that person doing the time; it is also the family,\" Tamez told the Dallas Morning News .\n\nGersten estimates that about 3,000 individuals still remain in federal prison because of marijuana-related charges. \"It is not too late for President Biden to undo the harms inflicted on families impacted by cannabis criminalization,\" she told me. \"The President has the opportunity to right history and restore justice by fulfilling his promise that no one should be incarcerated for cannabis.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "This Late-Breaking Biden Executive Order Could Further Empower the AI Oligarchy\n\nPresident Biden talks with then Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm during a tour of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Flatirons Campus in Arvada, Colorado, in 2021. Adam Schultz/Official White House Photo\n\nThis story was originally published b y High Country News a nd is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration .\n\nOn January 14, President Joe Biden issued an executive order directing the departments of Defense and Energy to make land available for private entities to construct gigawatt-scale \"frontier\" AI data centers. He also instructed the Interior Department to identify sites on public land for developing \"clean energy\" to power those centers and called for streamlined permitting for the power projects and their associated transmission lines.\n\nThat same day, the Biden administration began the process of withdrawing more than 300,000 acres of public land from new mining claims and mineral leases in the Amargosa Valley in Nevada, protecting it from future lithium mining and geothermal energy development.\n\nThe two initiatives stand in stark contrast with each other. In one case, Biden offered corporate entities federal land for building energy- and water-intensive data centers as well as solar, wind, geothermal or even nuclear installations. In the other, he sought to protect federal land from similar energy developments.\n\nWith the Biden administration now behind us, we can see that this kind of inconsistency was the rule, not the exception, for his term. He nixed the Keystone XL pipeline, heightened drilling restrictions in the Arctic and leased out less land for oil and gas drilling than any president before him-and then turned around and approved Alaska's Willow \"carbon bomb\" oil project and tossed out drilling permits in the Permian Basin like candy at a July Fourth parade. By establishing Ave Kwa Ame and Chuckwalla national monuments, he kept clean energy developers from exploiting those parts of the Mojave Desert, even as he green-lit dozens of massive solar and wind projects-not to mention lithium mines-on nearby land inhabited by Joshua trees and endangered desert tortoises.\n\nDisposing of public land like this sets a dangerous precedent, especially given that the Trump administration will now decide who gets to build the projects.\n\nI would argue that this apparent contradiction is deliberate, and that it echoes the strategy of the late Jimmy Carter . Both presidents protected vast swaths of public land and championed environmental initiatives. At the same time, they implicitly designated sacrifice zones by allowing and even encouraging the exploitation of some federal land, as if such a sacrifice was necessary to justify protecting the other places. Both politicians had the public interest at heart when they offered up public lands, with Carter striving for the ever-elusive goal of energy independence, while Biden clung to large-scale renewables as a solution to climate change .\n\nBiden appeared to believe that facilitating data centers would achieve a greater good, pointing to AI's \"rapidly growing relevance to national security.\" But tech companies don't seem to need a \"common good\" argument to encourage their projects. After all, data centers have been sprouting on private land with minimal resistance for years, even in arid places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, which together host at least 50 water-guzzling computer processor-packed warehouses. The centers are also popping up in the Northwest, where hydropower is plentiful, and in Wyoming, where less water and energy is needed to cool the equipment.\n\nTo his credit, Biden has acknowledged the outsized energy needs of these data centers. A single AI query uses about 10 times the power of a Google search, and even the old-school search engines aren't exactly energy misers. The Electric Power Research Institute found that data centers currently consume more than 150 terawatt-hours of electricity annually-enough to power tens of millions of homes-and by 2030 will gobble about 15 percent of the nation's electricity supply.\n\nThis sudden growth in demand has utilities scrambling to keep up, delaying and even canceling the previously scheduled retirements of some coal and nuclear power plants while still racing to develop other energy sources. Tech giants like Meta and Amazon are buying up the entire generating capacity of utility-scale solar, wind, and geothermal installations, and in some cases partnering with other entities to develop their own fleets of advanced nuclear reactors, all to feed the hungry AI beast.\n\nBiden's order aimed to put public lands on the menu, as long as the energy sources are \"clean,\" a category that includes solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal and nuclear-even natural gas and coal, as long as at least 90 percent of their carbon emissions are captured and sequestered. This means that, in theory, a corporation could build a gigawatt-scale data center powered by utility-scale \"clean\" power plants, or even coal-powered ones with carbon capture equipment, along with transmission lines, on federal lands, without having to go through the typical environmental review process.\n\nBiden's earlier, somewhat questionable moves-such as approving the Willow project-could be seen as cynical bids to garner oil industry support. The timing of this executive order, however, coming a mere week before he left political life for good, proves that his motives are sincere. AI is a powerful tool that has enormous potential for good, from diagnosing medical conditions to crunching huge datasets. It could also do tremendous harm, depending on who wields it. Biden did his best to at least mitigate the impacts of data centers' energy use by requiring developers to build their own climate-friendly energy installations.\n\nYet disposing of public land like this, no matter how noble the cause, sets a dangerous precedent, especially given that the Trump administration will now decide who gets to build these projects and where, without the slightest concern for how \"clean\" they might be. Regardless of Biden's good intentions and AI's possible public benefit, the biggest beneficiaries here will be the corporate tech giants and their human masters, i.e. the Musks, Zuckerbergs, Bezoses, and Altmans of the world.\n\nThese are the very same people Biden warned us about in his farewell speech, when he said: \"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead.\" It's a reminder that our public lands should serve as a buffer against oligarchy, not something to be exploited solely to nourish it.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Susan Walsh/AP\n\nToday, President Joe Biden announced that he will commute the sentences of almost 1,500 Americans for non-violent offenses-the most ever granted in one day. Those affected by the commutations are people released to in-home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, whom some Republicans have pushed to send back to prison. Biden also announced that he would pardon 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes including drug offenses.\n\nAs I previously reported , there has been pressure on Joe Biden to use his clemency power more broadly in the final months of his term-which intensified after he pardoned his son, Hunter. More than 130 civil and human rights organizations have called on Biden to commute the sentences of those on federal death row before he leaves office. Biden has openly opposed the death penalty, and those commutations would prevent the execution of 40 people-who, instead of being killed, would serve out the rest of their lives in prison.\n\nGroups have also called on Biden to free more people serving time for nonviolent offenses. Drug Policy Alliance, a non-partisan advocacy group, recently asked Biden to commute the sentences lengthened by the racist disparity in sentencing between powder and crack cocaine, which has disproportionately affected the Black community; the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit working for the release of all marijuana prisoners, joined members of Congress in November on the Capital Steps to call on Biden to rectify what they called \"draconian sentences given by judges\" in an accompanying letter to the president.\n\nIn response to today's announcement, the Last Prisoner Project's executive director, Sarah Gersten, said in a public statement, \"We are heartened to see the President using his clemency power more robustly, and are eager to see more action before he leaves office. It's clear from the White House's statement that the administration sees nonviolent drug offenders, and particularly those impacted by unjust cannabis offenses, as a critical category of clemency recipients deserving relief.\"\n\nBiden's announcement implied that more clemencies should be expected, saying that he will \"continue reviewing clemency petitions to advance equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Instead, he will open the convention Monday to make the case that Vice President Kamala Harris is the one to carry the torch.\n\nIt is a turnabout that Democrats are greeting with jubilation, melancholy, lingering hard feelings and, for some, outright anger.\n\nThe complicated dynamic has left convention planners and party leaders delicately navigating a display of respect to an outgoing president while building on newfound exuberance within the party over Harris' ascent.\n\nDemocrats are expected to honor him in their remarks throughout the week, using what they see as an act of selflessness as an inspiration for the party to rally behind Harris and push to defeat former President Donald Trump.\n\nWith his remarks set for Monday, Biden is positioned to be the one who bridges the divisions.\n\nIt will be \"a great opportunity to seize this moment of unity for the party,\" said Bill Russo, who worked in Biden's vice presidential office, on his 2020 campaign and in the State Department. For longtime \"Biden people,\" a message of unity coming straight from Biden \"will help cement it,\" he said. A Monday slot, Russo said, also \"gives him a place of prominence and respect, kicking off the programming for the week.\"\n\nThe extraordinary personal and political sea change Biden experienced in the last month is unlike that of any other president in recent history. He has gone from being a firmly entrenched leader of the party to relinquishing power voluntarily, without voters or term limits compelling him to do so in a rare move in modern politics.\n\nHis decision has set the campaign on a new trajectory. Harris has risen in the polls, drawn crowds of 10,000 or more in battleground states, attracted hundreds of thousands of new volunteers and exploded fundraising.\n\nBut Democrats say the party's deep gratitude for Biden's decision is overwhelming and predict the United Center will thunder with an extended standing ovation when he takes the stage.\n\n\"He's going to get a truly hagiographic and valedictory convention,\" said Wade Randlett, a longtime Democratic fundraiser. \"I expect there to be borderline deification of President Biden at the convention, with, like, 100 speakers in a row saying, 'Oh, my God, Joe Biden is so great.' And that will boost his stock in general.\"\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said, \"I and others recognize what courage and love of country that he exhibited in making this very tough decision.\"\n\nA Harris campaign aide said: \"He'll not be able to speak there will be so much applause. People in the Democratic Party value him more now than ever.\"\n\nEven at Biden's most trying times in office, Democrats agreed he delivered accomplishments, including guiding the nation out of a pandemic and passing a massive infrastructure package. After a devastating debate against Trump in late June, however, doubts about Biden's ability to run a vigorous campaign swelled. Calls within the party for his exit from the race steadily grew.\n\nIn early July, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., reportedly tried to assemble a group of Democrats to ask Biden to drop out of the race .\n\n\"I don't know anyone during those challenging weeks who didn't start with the premise that Joe Biden has been a great president and we owe him a lot,\" Warner said.\n\nIn a show of gratitude for Biden's contributions to the party, a series of tributes is planned during the convention, including from Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del.\n\nCoons said that in recent conversations, Biden has already shifted to planning how he wants to close out his time in office.\n\n\"He was already looking ahead, talking about what he could accomplish in the last six months of the term and how he could have the biggest impact. He was asking what are things I thought we needed to do, and he spoke positively about the Harris campaign,\" Coons said. \"He's excited to campaign. I think he's going to campaign hard in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\"\n\nChris Korge, national finance chairman of the Harris Victory Fund, said demand was through the roof for entry Monday night, when party members want to show \"their incredible respect for Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"People realize what Joe Biden has done as president over the last four years, and that is the foundation for why and how Kamala Harris will be the 47th president of the United States,\" Korge said. \"People see how selfless it was for Joe Biden. I've heard this from so many people who feel like he decided not to run - it wasn't because he didn't think he could win - he thought this was the right time for him, and he made the decision to let the next generation move forward.\"\n\nSome still harbor strong feelings about how circumstances unfolded. They include first lady Jill Biden, who has privately expressed dismay over how some Democrats treated her husband.\n\n\"I've talked to 100 early Biden people, from House members to senators to National Finance Committee members, who think he got totally screwed,\" said a source familiar with internal discussions, who requested anonymity to reveal private conversations. \"It was unfair and unwise and unjust. Those people who did it will not have this moment in history reflect well on their own behavior. ... I have a lot of hard feelings toward people who were pushing Joe out, but Kamala Harris is not one of them. She was not Judas at all.\"\n\nChris Dodd, a former senator from Connecticut and longtime Biden friend who had just spoken to him by phone, said Biden was forward-looking and wasn't focused on carrying grievances.\n\n\"I'd be shocked to hear that Joe Biden, the person I know, is walking around holding grudges against people,\" said Dodd, who has a 50-year friendship with the president. Dodd said he hopes the tributes that flood in Monday touch on Biden as a person as well as commemorate his time in office. \"In 50 years of public life, I can honestly say I don't know if I've ever met anybody in public life who was as decent, as kind, as thoughtful a human being as President Joe Biden.\"\n\nI am a politics reporter covering campaigns and issues affecting voters. I sometimes focus on Midwestern states and Nevada. Right now, I mostly report on the presidential race.\n\nPeter Nicholas is senior White House reporter for NBC News digital.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

No doubt the time between now and January 20 will be a time of reckoning and recriminations about how the Democratic Party failed to fend off a profoundly flawed authoritarian-for the second time.\n\nBut all the while, the White House will remain occupied by Joe Biden. And now the first one-term Democratic chief executive since Jimmy Carter has a few weeks to make a last-ditch effort to salvage his legacy-and shore up the governmental guardrails that Trump imperils.\n\nThere is far more good that the Biden administration could do in its waning days than can possibly be named here. (The list of worthy pardons alone would be staggering.) But in particular, President Biden has clear opportunities when it comes to reforming criminal justice, brokering global peace, protecting immigrants, taking climate action, and fending off authoritarianism.\n\nFirst, he can bring to fruition a reform he's already begun to explore: legalizing marijuana. Back in May, Biden initiated a review of cannabis's status as a Schedule I drug, a pivot away from his long-standing opposition . It's debatable exactly how much authority the president has to change marijuana's legal status. But Biden could certainly conclude his administration's needlessly lengthy review process-how long does it take to say, \"It's not a gateway drug\"?-and officially recommend de-scheduling to federal agencies. He could also pardon anyone currently languishing in federal prison for nonviolent drug offenses. Since these prospective pardon recipients are disproportionately Black , the move would advance not just criminal but also racial justice. And crucially, making such moves would deny Trump the easy victory of making any of them himself .\n\nIn another commonsense change that would undo decades of senseless policy, the president could also finally normalize relations with Cuba. That would mean the restoration of official diplomatic ties, removal of the island from the State Sponsors of Terrorism List , and honoring the 22 bilateral agreements signed during the Obama administration before being torn up by Trump. It would also mean lifting sanctions that have fueled Cuba's ongoing economic crisis , and providing robust aid to people beset by severe fuel shortages and food rationing. Closing Guantánamo Bay Naval Base and returning it to Cuba as a hospital would disassemble the starkest symbol of American domineering on the island. And though Trump will almost certainly seek to reverse any executive actions on Cuba, Biden could make that politically complicated by opening up private-sector investment there.\n\nThat's not the only unfinished diplomacy at stake. The backdoor conversations between Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu-and \"backdoor\" here means \" openly discussed \"-were dispiritingly evocative of the alleged Republican efforts in 1980 to delay the release of American hostages in Iran until after Reagan defeated Carter and took office . Now, whether the horrors escalate or a ceasefire is brokered that Trump gets undeserved credit for, this conflict is set to go down as Biden's signature foreign policy failure. But he still has time, in the twilight of his presidency, to assert some moral authority by enforcing the Leahy Law -which prevents the US from providing military aid to a country that has violated human rights -and halting, even temporarily, arms shipments to Israel.\n\nAs he makes his final efforts to curb humanitarian crises in Gaza and Cuba, Biden might also try to avert a future one along the United States' southern border. Trump has threatened to double down on the cruel immigration policies of his first term through \" the vast arsenal of federal powers .\" That could include the mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, as well as a resumption of his family separation policy at the border. President Biden can try to stymie this sadism by fast-tracking citizenship applications , reversing an executive order restricting asylum , and expanding work permits for undocumented immigrants. These compassionate reforms could profoundly change the outlook for many people who might otherwise be under threat in January and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile, with at least 3 million Americans already forced by extreme weather to become climate refugees, Biden has more than enough reason to declare a climate emergency. He claims to have \"practically\" done so , but actually doing so would enable him to circumvent a stubborn Congress to allot additional climate funding. Then, he can implement a raft of overdue executive orders, from more niche but nonetheless consequential reforms like decarbonizing the maritime industry , to sweeping (and promised) changes like banning offshore drilling . Such action would cement Biden's legacy as arguably the greenest president in modern history-and force Trump to make unfavorable headlines if he wants to undo that progress.\n\nFinally, Biden must take concrete steps to fend off the threat of authoritarianism that Trump's second term poses. American democracy may now be in its most vulnerable position since the Civil War. That's why filling all 46 judicial vacancies with judges who will uphold the rule of law is nonnegotiable. He can also reach across the aisle to address concerns about election integrity-before Trump takes that matter into his own paws-by replacing antiquated voting machines , conducting audits, and protecting poll workers and election officials.\n\nAbove all, a productive, placid lame-duck period would do much to demonstrate for the first time in eight years what a peaceful transfer of power looks like-even as Biden hands it back to the person responsible for that lapse.\n\nWeeks after he had conducted a different kind of transfer of power, on the first night of this year's Democratic National Convention, Biden summed up his hopes for his legacy: \"Let me know in my heart...that I gave my best to you.\" Between now and January, he can do his best to align that self-evaluation with history's judgment.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But it was entwined with a foreign policy that leaves his legacy drowned in blood.\n\nOn July 13, just eight days before he announced the end of his presidential reelection bid, a besieged and testy Joe Biden defended himself from critics within his own party by boasting about his mastery of foreign policy. During Biden's agitated Zoom call with moderate congressional Democrats, Colorado Representative Jason Crow-who as it happens voted with the president 100 percent of the time-cautioned him that voters were questioning his foreign policy leadership. Biden responded angrily: \"Name me a foreign leader who thinks I'm not the most effective leader in the world on foreign policy. Tell me! Tell me who the hell that is! Tell me who put NATO back together! Tell me who enlarged NATO, tell me who did the Pacific Basin!... We've got Korea and Japan working together, I put AUKUS together, anyway!... Find me a world leader who's an ally of ours who doesn't think I'm the most respected person they've ever-\"\n\n\"It's not breaking through, Mr. President, to our voters,\" Crow interjected respectfully.\n\n\"You oughta talk about it!\" Biden fired back, his bitterness intensifying. \"On national security, nobody has been a better president than I've been. Name me one. Name me one! So I don't want to hear that crap!\"\n\nThis scene distills, in brief, the nausea-inducing pathos of Biden's presidency. Fending off an uprising inside his own party, Biden sounded less like a confident leader than a raving Captain Ahab (from Moby-Dick ) or Captain Queeg (from The Caine Mutiny )-an unstable commander who needed to be removed from power immediately.\n\nBiden's self-celebratory view wasn't widely shared outside the White House: He had low approval ratings in general and particularly for his handling of foreign policy . Even among liberals and leftists who might otherwise give high marks to Biden's domestic policy, there has been widespread criticism of his militarism, especially his near-unqualified support for Israel's ferocious attacks on Palestinian civilians.\n\nFor his allies among liberals and the left, Biden is a figure not just of pathos but of genuine tragedy. It's hard to come to any easy judgment, because Biden's ambitious domestic agenda was inextricable from his foreign policy. Both sprang from the same holistic vision of fusing together military spending and domestic policy to return America to the strength it enjoyed during its Cold War peak of global dominance. Biden was not an enemy like Donald Trump who could be easily disavowed, but a more complexly dangerous figure, a semi-friend who entangled us in his folly.\n\nBut was Biden's team right in thinking that its foreign and domestic policies were inseparable? Or is there a way to build on Biden's domestic achievements while leaving behind his discredited foreign policy?\n\nBiden's conception of himself as a foreign policy giant-a modern Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger-was echoed by his staff. Just two days before the exchange with Crow, Andrew Bates, the senior deputy press secretary and deputy assistant to the president, posted on X: \"To answer the question on everyone's minds: No, Joe Biden does not have a doctorate in foreign affairs. He's just that fucking good.\"\n\nBates's exaltation of Biden was risible at the time and has become even more ludicrous in the wake of press reports documenting that Biden was mentally diminished for much (if not all) of his presidency. A devastating December 19 article in The Wall Street Journal makes clear that Biden was surrounded by a Praetorian Guard of enablers and deceivers who propped up the image of the president as still in control even as they covertly ran the Oval Office. According to the Journal , \"Senior advisers were often put into roles that some administration officials and lawmakers thought Biden should occupy, with people such as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan...frequently in the position of being go-betweens for the president.\" American foreign policy, it seems, was effectively run by a behind-the-scenes triumvirate of ultra-hawks made up of Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and adviser Brett McGurk.\n\nBiden's central belief was that his foreign policy was one of his greatest strengths, when in fact it was his Achilles' heel. In the final weeks of the race, Trump-whose internal polling showed that undecided voters didn't like the president's Middle East policy- styled himself as an anti-war candidate who would halt the Biden-Harris administration's rush to World War III. It was a cynical message, but one that resonated with voters weary of the unending wars that defined Biden's term in office.\n\nThe unpopularity of Biden's foreign policy can be seen in a Cato Institute poll done on the cusp of the election in three crucial swing states (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan), which showed that majorities of voters \"believed the US is 'too involved' in world affairs and global conflicts (WI: 53%, PA: 50%, MI: 52%); say US foreign policy does not put American interests first (WI: 62%, PA: 61%, MI: 60%); and think it's likely that the US is 'closely' approaching World War III (WI: 59%, PA: 51%, MI: 54%).\"\n\nBiden's approval numbers first took a steep dive after the botched withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan, a justified policy that was marred by bad execution. As the Journal reports, \"Some legislative leaders had a hard time getting the president's ear at key moments, including ahead of the U.S.'s disastrous pullout from Afghanistan.\" Biden and his tight inner circle ignored credible analysis that the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was likely to collapse quickly in the wake of an American pullout. With few plans prepared for this contingency, the Biden White House instead nursed delusions that there would be a \"decent interval\" of months or even years between the US withdrawal and Afghanistan's unraveling.\n\nWhile Biden took pride in his support for Ukraine after the Russian invasion, there is evidence that his administration undermined crucial negotiations between the two countries in the spring of 2022-a fateful decision that extended the fighting even as the war devastated Ukraine's landscape and population. The likely deal Ukraine will negotiate with Russia under Trump will be far worse than anything Ukraine could have achieved if Washington hadn't blocked negotiations in 2022.\n\nIn the Middle East, the killing fields of Gaza will be remembered as one of the great crimes of the era. Israel's war has already been classified as a genocide by numerous scholars of war crimes as well as by mainstream institutions such as the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and Amnesty International. Israel's indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians could not have happened on the scale it has without American aid, and Amnesty International (among other human rights organizations) has convincingly argued that this military aid was in violation of both international and US law. By refusing to follow his country's own laws, Biden himself is a partner to these war crimes. Like Lady Macbeth, his hands will be forever stained with blood.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nBiden's fetishization of alliances such as NATO and AUKUS was based on the dubious idea that the United States has an overriding interest in a renewed great-power competition with both Russia and China-a shift from the approach, which prevailed from the Nixon administration through the Obama presidency, of trying to assimilate China into global capitalism. Like Lyndon Johnson, Biden was a towering domestic president undone by a hawkish foreign policy. For both LBJ and Biden, domestic and foreign policy went hand in hand: As liberal hawks, they practiced military Keynesianism, the policy (embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike) of using military spending (which enjoys a unique protection from accusations of socialism) as a de facto industrial policy and economic stimulus. In this holistic vision, the home front must be reformed to make the empire safe-and it is the strength of the empire that allows domestic life to flourish.\n\nBiden's identity as a liberal hawk has roots in both his own political history and in the response his forward-looking foreign policy advisers, notably Jake Sullivan, developed to Trumpism.\n\nAlthough Biden entered the Senate in 1973 as a critic of the Vietnam War, he drifted to the right on foreign policy because of his relationship with Washington Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson. Cold War liberalism incarnate, Jackson was a fierce hawk who fought against Richard Nixon's policy of détente with the Soviet Union and was an unwavering supporter of Israel, while at the same time backing a robust welfare state and strong labor unions. In a 1983 eulogy on the Senate floor, Biden said that \"Jackson changed a major part of my political life\" by teaching him the importance of Israel to American foreign policy.\n\nAs vice president under Barack Obama, however, Biden seemed to be aware that the time of Scoop Jackson had passed. Though he remained pro-Israel, Biden cautioned the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \"Bibi, I gotta tell you, I'm coming under a lot of pressure back here. This is not Scoop Jackson's Democratic Party.\"\n\nBut the rise of Trump in 2016 persuaded Biden-as well as staffers like Sullivan-that there might be value in returning to Jackson-style liberal hawkery. Trump had won in part because he pried away white working-class voters upset about how trade deals had moved good manufacturing jobs to countries like China. Trump's revival of protectionism-part of his genuine economic pitch to blue-collar voters-discredited the long epoch of neoliberal ascendancy in the Democratic Party that stretched from Jimmy Carter to Obama.\n\nBiden and his team saw Trump as both an authoritarian threat domestically and part of a global resurgence of autocracy seen in nations like Russia and Hungary (whose leaders Trump often praised and seemed to emulate) as well as in the growing power of China. To fight Trumpism, they thought, something like a revived Cold War liberalism was needed: a robust foreign policy that eschewed Trump's America First rhetoric and reasserted American leadership of alliances such as NATO (whose members Trump had disdained as freeloaders) and AUKUS.\n\nDuring the period of triumphant neoliberalism, from 1991 to 2016, the United States had sought to integrate China into the American-led international order. Under the new dispensation, that policy would be replaced by an open pursuit of great-power competition with both Russia and China-a hubristic vision that recalled the American bid for global supremacy during the peak of the Cold War in the 1950s and '60s. Abandoning neoliberal trade policies, the United States would treat China as a competitor to be fought with counter-alliances and tariffs. The break with neoliberalism would include large-scale infrastructure spending to create manufacturing jobs that would revive working- and middle-class prosperity, bringing back the broadly shared wealth of mid-century America. A newly thriving middle class would then dampen the polarization and alienation that fueled Trumpism. Meanwhile, new infrastructure spending would focus on the transition to clean energy-addressing the climate crisis and offering the United States a chance to modernize its economy (and compete with China). With this fusion of the warfare state and the welfare state, democracy could be saved both at home and abroad. Scoop Jackson could look down upon his former protégé and smile.\n\nThe most cogent exposition of Biden's new military Keynesianism was a speech on \"a foreign policy for the middle class\" that Jake Sullivan delivered at the Brookings Institution on April 27, 2023. In that speech, Sullivan insisted on the importance of \"President Biden's core commitment-indeed...his daily direction to us-to more deeply integrate domestic policy and foreign policy.\"\n\nSullivan crafted an impressively cohesive foreign policy vision, one that linked a host of genuine domestic and international problems and seemed to offer a few core policies to address them while building a durable political coalition that could counter Trumpism. In practice, however, these ideas led to disaster.\n\nAs progressive and left critics have repeatedly pointed out, this foreign policy vision failed not just because of faulty execution but because of fundamental contradictions. The sharpest critics of Bidenism have been left voices such as Richard Beck (writing in New Left Review ) , Adam Tooze (in the London Review of Books ) , and Grey Anderson (in Sidecar ) and progressive critics like Nancy Okail and Matt Duss (writing together in Foreign Affairs ) . Despite their differing perspectives, these critics all focused on the internally contradictory nature of Bidenism: The problem with military Keynesianism is that, over time, the militarism devours the Keynesianism. As Beck observes:\n\nThe first pillar of the Biden administration's geopolitical strategy, \"a foreign policy for the middle class,\" which amounts in practice to a protectionist green-military Keynesianism targeting China, has been meaningfully undercut by the consequences of pursuing the second pillar, democracies versus autocracies. The Russia-Ukraine war has exacerbated an inflationary surge around the world, including within the United States. Even with historically low levels of unemployment and strong wage growth (at least relative to recent history), Americans have been outraged by levels of inflation not seen in decades, and their views on Biden's stewardship of the economy are particularly negative.\n\nBeck's analysis is compelling. While the initial cause of inflation throughout the world was the supply-chain shock triggered by Covid, the Dallas Federal Reserve noted on May 17, 2022, \"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dealt a blow to the global economy-weakening the postpandemic recovery and aggravating already-high inflation.\" Biden's failure to pursue a negotiated settlement to the conflict meant that this exacerbation of inflation would continue.\n\nBiden's claims that his foreign policy is essential to the global struggle between democracy and autocracy are belied by the enduring hypocrisies of American realpolitik. In light of the mass slaughter in Gaza and the intensifying brutality of the occupation in the West Bank, it's impossible for any rational person to take his claims about human rights seriously. Biden insists that he wants to refurbish and restore the liberal international order, but defending Israel at all costs has meant a constant attack on the very institutions that make up that order, such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. Not surprisingly, many in the Global South see the United States as hypocritical on international law, which has undermined Biden's efforts to create a coalition to oppose Putin's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nBiden's larger Middle Eastern policy has been one of bolstering not just the increasingly authoritarian Israeli government but also the Arab autocrats, whom the administration, following in the footsteps of the Trump administration, hoped to unite in a regional defense alliance with Israel under the compact known as the Abraham Accords (seen as a necessary move in the push toward a great-power competition with China). This policy meant that, even before the Hamas attack on October 7, Biden's administration had sidelined the Palestinians. The journalist Alexander Ward, in his book The Internationalists , a sympathetic study of Biden's foreign policy, quotes an administration official saying that they put \"not a fucking second of effort\" into pushing for a two-state solution.\n\nThe Abraham Accords meant the embrace of both the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (the blood-soaked tyrant known as MBS, whom Biden had previously promised to disavow) and Benjamin Netanyahu (the dominating spirit of an increasingly authoritarian ethnocentric state). As Ward reports, \"Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir told me that it was shameful of the United States to blame his nation for human rights abuses when Washington was responsible for atrocities around the world.\"\n\nIn addition to MBS and Netanyahu, the other autocrats whom Biden bear-hugged included South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Angolan President João Lourenço .\n\nBiden has accurately described climate change as an \"existential threat to all of us\" and \"the ultimate threat to humanity.\" Yet his pursuit of great-power competition with China suggests that climate change is not really a priority. As Beck notes:\n\nWith respect to climate change...this is not a problem that can be addressed through competition among nation states. What's required is coordination and cooperation, on a global scale, to decarbonize production as quickly as possible. Instead, the Biden Administration is wasting time trying to shore up domestic firms that are clearly inferior to their international counterparts, further delaying a decarbonization effort that is already hopelessly behind schedule.\n\nSome of Biden's ideological allies square this circle by stating frankly that defeating China is more important than saving the planet. David Shor, whose firm Blue Rose Research played a major role in vetting ads for the super PAC Future Forward, which had a budget of $950 million to support Kamala Harris's campaign, tweeted in 2021: \"I would much rather live in a world where we see a 4-degree rise in temperature than live in a world where China is a global hegemon.\" In 2024, Matthew Yglesias, whose Substack is closely followed in the White House, tweeted : \"We're just getting our butts kicked [by China] in a way that I think is bad and way more important than climate change.\" In its actions, if not in its rhetoric, the Biden White House operated according to this logic: that American global hegemony is more important than the survival of Earth as a habitable planet for humans. This is the equivalent of reacting to the iceberg hitting the Titanic by engaging in a battle to remain captain rather than helping passengers get into the lifeboats.\n\nIn the bitter aftermath of Biden's failed presidency, the broad Democratic coalition (both liberals and the left) will have to hammer out a new policy that eschews the nostalgic fantasy of permanent American hegemony. If the greatest threat to humanity is climate change, that has to be the organizing principle for foreign policy, which means abandoning military Keynesianism for true Keynesianism: large-scale spending not to bolster military power but to avert planetary catastrophe. That new foreign policy will mean the United States takes diplomacy far more seriously than Biden did: a diplomacy based not on reviving antiquated alliances like NATO and AUKUS, but rather on working with rising powers in the Global South to actually solve real problems such as pandemics, climate-induced migration, and decarbonizing the economy.\n\nBiden's nostalgia destroyed what could have been a great presidency. It belongs to a past that we have to leave behind if we want to survive.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

To be honest, I had hoped to unplug this week, to put aside the messiness of US politics. But your ongoing refusal to confront what have become the catastrophic implications of your presidential candidacy has pushed me to write on my week off.\n\nMr. President, let me tell you what I did earlier this week. I spent a morning at an elephant sanctuary, a place where majestic old elephants, far past their prime, are eased into retirement-earning their daily bread by letting tourists feed them watermelons and give them mud baths.\n\nThere was, I'll admit, something a bit sad about them-their ears were torn, the males' tusks had been hacked off, and there was a passivity to them that made me wish they still had the wherewithal to raise a ruckus. But, at the same time, they were safe and were being taken care of in their dotage. There are worse things in life than a comfortable retirement.\n\nJoe, when you got elected in 2020, I wept for joy. In defeating Donald Trump, you had saved the Republic; you had reinvigorated a dream that was in danger of morphing into a permanent nightmare. You had pitted liberalism against intolerance and darkness, optimism against Trump's American Carnage vision-and you had won. There was little doubt in my mind that you were a genuinely decent, kind, humane, even humble man-everything that Trump and his rancid administration were not. It's a rarity in the modern political environment that such traits win out over hard-right populism.\n\nFour years later, you are making me weep again. But this time around, I weep over the arrogance and selfishness you are demonstrating in claiming, despite all evidence to the contrary, that you and only you can prevent Trump's second ascent to power. I weep because you now so clearly lack the vitality and intellectual agility for the fight-but, while you have lost so much of your political skill set, you seem, somehow, to have preserved just enough wile and orneriness to cling to personal power like a hungry dog tugging on a bone. I weep because in 2020 you rose to the political moment to aggressively confront a terrible political peril, and in 2024 you are instead doing a star turn in your own version of Sunset Boulevard , sinking into a political quicksand of your own making that will destroy your legacy and return Donald Trump to office with an overwhelming mandate.\n\nAs I write this, it's been 12 days now since you made it abundantly clear, in front of a TV audience of 54 million people, that you no longer have what it takes to be either a president or a presidential candidate. Last week I wrote, in the conditional tense, that this performance could result in your losing overwhelmingly in November. This week, the poll numbers seem pretty unambiguous . If you remain the Democratic candidate you will lose overwhelmingly. There are states such as New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Virginia, even New Jersey, for God's sake, in play now for the Republicans, that a decent Democratic candidate would have locked up months ago.\n\nEach day you refuse to step aside for a new generation is a day of campaigning against Trump lost. The sands are fast slipping through the hourglass, and each defiant statement you make-that one about only God being able to get you to change your mind was a real doozy-and each absurd fundraising letter you send out ridiculing the concerns of those who believe you can no longer win adds to the volume of wasted effort. There are barely 100 days left until the election. The longer you remain the Democratic Party's candidate, the less chance the Democrats have of holding the White House, holding the Senate, or recapturing the House. You will either step aside too late for it to make a difference, or you will emerge as a nominee so damaged that no one will seriously expect you to win.\n\nI weep, Joe, because of your delusions. Bubbles are strange things to live within, and you and your family seem, now, to have become bubble captives, as delusional in your analysis of power as Louis XIV. L'État, c'est moi.\n\nTrump has always had the same idea. But he's never really pretended to be anything other than a narcissist. Self-absorption isn't just a byproduct for Trump; it's the whole deal. You, Joe, you sold yourself as something better. You've always said that this isn't about you, that you are fighting for the survival of this beautiful experiment in democracy and pluralism. That is why your grubby determination to hold onto power at all costs, even if it is simply for a short ride to a humbling electoral defeat, is ultimately loathsome.\n\nYou say you made a \"mistake\" in your debate performance against Trump, and you have pledged to do better. But what America saw for 90 minutes on June 27 wasn't a \"mistake\"-though, to be fair, you made your share of factual \"mistakes\" in your hard-to-follow comments-it was a textbook example of the ravages of time, the all-too-predictable consequence of putting up an 81-year-old for reelection to the toughest job on earth. What the world saw was a very old man grasping for basic answers, floundering in presenting his ideas, unable to project himself physically or mentally.\n\nI'm not a doctor and wouldn't presume to make a diagnosis. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. The public now has the perception that age has gotten the better of you-and that's a perception pretty much impossible to shake. You could wrestle alligators and come out victorious-the public will still see your frozen face and hear your stumbling, incoherent debate answers. And you will still, in consequence, lose millions of votes from people who otherwise would be voting Democrat in November-citizens who are longing to vote for the Democrats if only the party can present a credible presidential candidate.\n\nThere's no shame in getting old. You've had a phenomenal run at the center of power for more than half a century. You won the presidential election in one of the darkest moments in US history, and you have spent the past four years pushing for, and often getting, vital social reforms and public investments. You have placed liberal justices up and down the judicial system. You have done more to address climate change than any other president. You have done more to protect LGBTQ rights than any of your predecessors. You have every right to consider these four years a personal and political triumph.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBut there is a tremendous shame in trying to hoodwink the public, in claiming all is right in Bidenworld when that's clearly not the case, and in putting yourself above the interests of the greater community. Joe, what, for example, was that Parkinson's expert doing consulting with your physician time and again these past several months? Joe, how does a cold, or jet lag, or staying up late-or any of the other half-baked excuses your team keeps coming up with to explain away your debate disaster-turn you into the confused wreck on display two weeks ago? How does telling your staff that you need more sleep and can't schedule events past 8 pm put to rest public doubts about your stamina and your mental acuity?\n\nFour years ago, Joe, you became a true American hero in defeating Trump. Now, in your egoistic inability to gracefully leave the stage, you are all but guaranteeing another Trump administration. Each day that you stay on you make it more likely that the worst president in living memory will occupy the White House again come January. At this point, Joe, you are behaving in a more egomaniacal manner than Trump. The vast majority of your own supporters want you to step aside for someone younger. In not listening to them, in daring them to try to force you out, in pitting yourself against not just your political enemies but your erstwhile friends too, you are holding the country's future to ransom.\n\nJoe, I say this with all due respect: It's time. The elephants on the River Kwai have found retirement to have its blessings. I'm sure you, too, could find ways, other than permanently hogging the political spotlight, to enjoy your twilight years. You have a choice, and it's pretty clear: Retire now, and your legacy will be secure. Continue what has become a quixotic campaign for reelection, and you will trigger an electoral defeat of utterly catastrophic dimensions. The stakes-for your own legacy as well as for the public well-being-are simply too high for such a gamble to have legitimacy.

I'm grateful that your action ensures that Billie will be spared the very real possibility of being executed under the incoming Trump administration. After all, Trump ended his previous administration with an unprecedented spate of federal executions. However, Billie deserves more than a commutation. As a wrongfully convicted man, Billie deserves a pardon.\n\nMr. President, I'm sure you are aware of the injustice I endured. I was arrested in 1989 at the age of 15 and charged with the brutal rape and beating of a jogger in Central Park. There was no evidence whatsoever connecting me and the four other young suspects to the crime, but after being deprived of food, drink, and sleep for over 24 hours, and subjected to immense pressure, my codefendants falsely confessed. You may remember that Donald Trump called for New York to reinstate the death penalty after our highly publicized and racially charged arrest. I spent my formative years in prison, and was released in 1997. Five years later, I was exonerated after the real assailant confessed.\n\nYet, even as I was being released in New York, in another part of the country, 19-year-old Billie's ordeal was just beginning. Billie was arrested in March of that year, charged with bank robbery and murder. Billie had compelling evidence of his innocence, including but not limited to: negative results for traces of gasoline on his clothing, proving that he couldn't have been inside the gasoline-soaked getaway van; negative DNA test results, excluding both the victim and Billie as a source of blood spatter found at the crime scene; and a statement from a shopping mall security guard who told the FBI that he saw Billie at the mall at the time the crime took place. Despite this, Billie was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.\n\nI was made aware of Billie's story through my sister Aisha's friendship with Billie's sister, Yvette. Aisha would tell me how similar Billie and I are. We both love art and music, and share values of dedication to family, and empathy toward others in need. But above and beyond that, the core reason my sister wanted to introduce me to Billie was her conversations with him on the phone. \"When Billie told me he was innocent, I could hear the same pain in his voice that I used to hear in your voice, Yusef,\" she told me.\n\nAs someone who had been wrongfully convicted, I want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, yet I'm also soberly aware that even those who committed terrible crimes can make pleas of innocence. But Billie never asked me to take his professions of innocence at his word; he urged me to do my own research. I began reading details about his case. I talked to supporters who are convinced of his innocence, including actor Gbenga Akinnage, Khaliah Ali (daughter of Muhammad Ali), and Ollie Gordon, a cousin of Emmett Till who was with you as you signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. I listened attentively to an episode focused on Billie's case by record executive Jason Flom's Wrongful Convictions podcast. I spoke to Billie's legal team.\n\nI uncovered a story that is all too common, and painfully familiar. Billie's trial attorney neglected to present any of the evidence of his innocence that was available in the local police and district attorney's own files, and never pursued other evidence that could have been uncovered with even minimum effort. Post-conviction, Billie has fought for over 27 years for this exculpatory evidence to be considered, but the courts have repeatedly denied him on procedural grounds, consistently prioritizing finality over fairness. As Billie's attorney Michael Reyfield points out, \"It's easy to get convicted for something you didn't do, but twice as hard, at times impossible, to right that wrong in our legal system.\"\n\nI am free now, with a loving family and a rewarding career, but Billie is not. I cannot forget that the axe of injustice continues to fall on the necks of so many innocent people.\n\nMr. President, you have stood firm against injustice many times in your long years of public service. You have demonstrated concern for those who were ensnared in a system that does not always deliver true justice. I urge you, before you leave office, to review Billie Allen's case. Once you do, I am confident that you will agree with me: You should right the wrong in our legal system that Billie has endured, pardon him, and allow him to return home to his family where he belongs. This is Billie's only hope for justice.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

But Israel's assault on Gaza has been made possible by US support.\n\nPresident Joe Biden talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, July 25, 2024.\n\nPast the 20-foot-high aluminum doors of the Justice Department's Robert F. Kennedy Building, and down a long limestone hallway lined with art deco accents, Room B-206 has long served as the epicenter of the Biden administration's prosecutorial war against former president Donald Trump. Behind the heavy wooden door is the office of special counsel Jack Smith, a highly secure redoubt where attorneys spent years building criminal cases against Trump for allegedly attempting to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election, as well as for his alleged improper handling of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nBut now, instead of heading to trial, the prosecutors are scrambling to empty file cabinets and stuff their contents into cardboard storage boxes. As a result of Trump's election win, the prosecution is officially halted by the Justice Department's policy prohibiting the filing of criminal cases against a sitting president. But while President-elect Trump will likely never face the consequences of his alleged criminal actions, President Biden may one day face trial for his, albeit in a far different courtroom in The Hague.\n\nThree thousand eight hundred miles to the east from Washington sits the International Criminal Court (ICC), a complex of six modern towers in the Netherlands not far from Peace Palace and Europol in The Hague. In the largest building, Court Tower, are three courtrooms that carry out the institution's mandate: to prosecute perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, thereby providing justice to victims.\n\nAccording to Article 1 of the Genocide Convention, the Contracting Parties, including the United States and Israel, must prevent and punish acts of genocide. Under Article III , those punishable acts include \"Complicity in genocide,\" such as by knowingly providing the deadly weapons used to carry it out. In 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in a case involving Bosnia and Serbia, established that the obligation to refrain from providing weapons or other assistance begins the moment a state becomes aware of the existence of a serious risk that genocide may be committed.\n\nFor the Biden administration, that moment came in January, when the ICJ found that there was a \"plausible\" risk of genocide being committed in Gaza against the Palestinian people by Israel. Shortly after, in February, the Dutch Appeals Court halted the transfer of F-35 munition parts to Israel on account of the serious risk of International Humanitarian Law violations. Further notice came in May with the applications for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others by the chief prosecutor of the ICC, Kharim Khan. Among the charges against Netanyahu related to Gaza were crimes against humanity, including extermination, murder, starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, intentional attacks against a civilian population, and \"other inhumane acts.\" It was the first potential ICC arrest warrant issued for the leader of a Western-style democracy. Nevertheless, European countries including France and Germany issued statements affirming their support for the legitimacy of the ICC.\n\nDespite the clear indication that American weapons were being used to carry out an alleged Israeli genocide, the bombs continued to flow and the wholesale massacres never stopped. According to a report last week by the UN Human Rights Office, close to 70 percent of the fatalities in Gaza have been children and women, \"indicating a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law,\" said the report. Nizam Mamode, a retired surgeon with Britain's National Health Service who recently returned from working at a hospital in Gaza, testified last week to members of Parliament that he treated children \"day after day after day\" who had been deliberately targeted by Israeli drones following bomb attacks.\n\nIn July, an analysis published by the medical journal The Lancet estimated that the actual number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza, including those decomposing beneath the rubble of bombed-out hospitals, schools, and densely packed refugee camps, is likely more than 186,000. And if the deaths continue at the same rate, said Devi Sridhar , chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, the estimated deaths by the end of the year would total 335,500.\n\nIn spite of those grim statistics, the Biden administration last month decided to play politics with the lives of the desperate and starving survivors in Gaza, most of whom had been forced to flee from multiple Israeli evacuation orders. To help the Harris campaign with pro-Palestinian voters, Biden pretended to turn tough and issued a highly publicized letter giving Netanyahu a 30-day deadline to increase the flow of food and other aid to Gaza or face a potential cutoff in military support. But it was simply a scam, since the deadline would fall after the election was over. When the time limit expired last week, there was no longer a need for Biden to pretend that the United States would take action. Instead, his administration continued to deceive the American public by falsely claiming that it found no evidence that Israel was obstructing shipments of food and other aid into Gaza.\n\nIn spite of those grim statistics, the Biden administration last month decided to play politics with the lives of the desperate and starving survivors in Gaza, most of whom had been forced to flee from multiple Israeli evacuation orders.

When the time limit expired last week, there was no longer a need for Biden to pretend that the United States would take action. Instead, his administration continued to deceive the American public by falsely claiming that it found no evidence that Israel was obstructing shipments of food and other aid into Gaza.\n\nThe announcement was greeted with disbelief and anger by aid groups, including Save the Children, Oxfam, Refugees International, and Mercy Corps. \"Israel's actions failed to meet any of the specific criteria set out in the U.S. letter,\" said a joint statement . \"Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in Northern Gaza. That situation is in an even more dire state today than a month ago. The principals of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee now assess that 'the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.'\" According to an editorial in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , \"Israel is unleashing an apocalypse in Northern Gaza.\"\n\nFurther evidence of the Biden administration's deliberate cover-up of the ongoing genocide came days after the administration's announcement when a UN special committee released a report that said, \"The policies and practices of Israel during the reporting period [the past year] are consistent with the characteristics of genocide\" and \"Civilians have been indiscriminately and disproportionally killed en masse in Gaza.\" The report went on to say that there were also serious concerns that Israel was \"using starvation as a weapon of war\"-a fact made clear by numerous reports of humanitarian aid convoys being looted right next to the Israeli troops, who stand by and do nothing to stop it. Israel's decision to stop cooperating with UNRWA, the critical relief agency providing welfare services to Palestinians, is another clear war crime. \"Since the beginning of the war,\" the report concluded, \"Israeli officials have publicly supported policies that strip Palestinians of the very necessities required to sustain life-food, water, and fuel.\" The very definition of genocide.\n\nAlso last week, Human Rights Watch issued a report charging that Israel is using its frequent evacuation orders to cause the \"deliberate and massive forced displacement\" of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, actions that appear to \"meet the definition of ethnic cleansing\" as well as crimes against humanity. The report, entitled \"Hopeless, Starving, and Besieged: Israel's Forced Displacement of Palestinians in Gaza,\" went on to say that the group has collected clear evidence pointing to \"the war crime of forcible transfer [of the civilian population].\" They described these actions as \"a grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court.\"\n\nThat same evidence of genocide, starvation, ethnic cleansing, and forced displacement was clearly available to the Biden administration, yet it lied to the American public to hide its own criminal culpability in the war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\n\nThere is no statute of limitations when it comes to support for genocide, nor does it make a difference whether an individual is in or out of office. What matters is evidence of the crime, and there is more than enough for the ICC's chief prosecutor to issue an application for an arrest warrant for Biden, just as it did for Netanyahu. After all, it's the United States that builds the bombs, pays for them, ships them to Israel, provides intelligence on targets in Gaza, and supplies the planes that carry them. All Israel does is drop them, with US approval, on the tens of thousands of innocent civilians.\n\nBy June, the Biden administration had sent Israel at least 14,000 massively deadly 2,000-pound MK-84 bombs, made in Oklahoma and dropped on hospitals, apartment blocks, and crowded refugee camps. In addition, it sent 6,500 500-pound bombs, 3,000 Hellfire precision-guided air-to-ground missiles, 1,000 bunker-buster bombs, 2,600 air-dropped small-diameter bombs, and other munitions. Added to that is the approval of additional ground attack aircraft to Israel's existing American-made F-15s, F-16s and F-35s and Apache helicopters. And in January, following a visit to Washington by Eyal Zamir, Israel's Defense Ministry director-general, defense sources told the Times of Israel that Israel plans to procure a new squadron of 25 F35i stealth fighter jets, a squadron of 25 F-151A fighter jets, and a new squadron of 12 Apache helicopters.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nIn the end, it's the American taxpayers who are financing the genocide. According to Bruce Fein , an expert in international law, \"The United States has clearly become a co-belligerent with Israel in its war against Hamas-Gaza Palestinians by systematically supplying the IDF with weapons and intelligence without conditions.\"\n\nIf the ICC were to seek an arrest warrant for Biden before he leaves office or shortly thereafter, it would also serve as a warning to his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, who appears to have even less regard for the Palestinians. And his return to the White House will allow Netanyahu to not only speed up the genocide, but also to achieve his ultimate goal: the annexation of Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, illegal actions under international law.\n\n\"Netanyahu has stalled until Trump's election, and it paid off. Now there's nothing standing in his way,\" Palestinian political scientist Nour Odeh told Le Monde . He added: \"He can wage his war as he sees fit, especially as he has just sacked his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who had opposed him. As for Trump, he's not interested in the Palestinian Authority, the state of which is getting worse all the time, nor in a dialogue with Mahmoud Abbas, because they've already fallen out. He's going to do whatever Israel wants. And international law won't hold him back any more than American law will.\"\n\nAmong those overjoyed by Trump's triumph is far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. \"Trump's victory brings an important opportunity for the State of Israel,\" he told supporters at a conference of his Religious Zionist Party. During Trump's first term, he said, \"we were on the verge of applying sovereignty over the settlements\" in the West Bank. \"Now,\" he said, \"the time has come to make it a reality.\"\n\nAnd on November 12, Trump sent the same signal back to Smotrich and Netanyahu by naming as his new ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian. Shortly afterward, Huckabee said in an Israeli radio interview that \" of course \" annexation of the West Bank is possible in the next administration, but the policy hasn't been set. And in 2017, he claimed , \"There is no such thing as a West Bank. It's Judea and Samaria. There's no such thing as a settlement. They're communities, they're neighborhoods, they're cities. There's no such thing as an occupation.\" He went even further in a statement during his 2008 presidential campaign. \"Basically, there really is no such thing as-I need to be careful about saying this, because people will really get upset-there's really no such thing as a Palestinian,\" he said. \"There's not.\"\n\nAlthough neither the United States nor Israel recognizes the jurisdiction of the ICC, most other countries of the world, including in Europe, do. So, should Biden join Netanyahu on the ICC's wanted list, he would remain safe as long as he never leaves the country. But if he were to give a speech or attend a ceremony outside the country, an Interpol Red Notice would likely be waiting for him, followed by a quick trip to the ICC's Court Tower in The Hague. According to The Architectural Review , those awaiting trial at the ICC are confined in a \"dark gray holding cell complete with steel table and chair bolted to the floor, a slab for a bed, seatless stainless-steel prison toilet and sink.\" And there is plenty of room for both Netanyahu and Biden.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

My coplaintiffs included the human rights organizations Defense for Children International-Palestine and Al-Haq as well as Ahmed Abu Artema , Dr. Omar Al-Najjar, and others, and we were represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nFive days after I testified, the presiding judge, George W. Bush-era appointee Jeffrey White, found it plausible that Israel is committing genocide; however, he ultimately decided that he was powerless to review foreign policy decisions, calling it the most difficult judicial decision he's ever made.\n\n\"It is every individual's obligation to confront the current siege in Gaza, but it [is] also this Court's obligation to remain within the metes and bounds of its jurisdictional scope,\" he wrote in his decision . \"There are rare cases in which the preferred outcome is inaccessible to the Court. This is one of those cases.\"\n\nThe appeal is now scheduled to be heard on June 10.\n\nAlthough I knew the case would be an uphill battle, I testified to make a record of Israel's horrific slaughter of my family, the displacement and dispossession and starvation of the surviving members, the deliberate destruction of my hometown and everything that sustains life there, and ethnic cleansing targeting my people.\n\nI testified because I promised my surviving family members in Gaza-all of whom are enduring unspeakable conditions-that I would do everything in my power to advocate on their behalf, and because it is my prerogative but also my moral imperative, as a human being, as an American, and as Palestinian, residing in a country that is aiding and abetting a genocide.\n\nDuring the hearing, Judge White, citing the gravity of the matter, granted uninterrupted testimony to me and others; and he overruled every objection by the defense to expert testimony from the noted genocide and Holocaust scholar Barry Trachtenberg, affirming that Israel's actions in Gaza amount to the crime of genocide. As he wrapped up the trial, he concluded by looking us each in the face and telling us we had been seen and heard-a crucial validation by a government figure at a time when President Biden was denying our deaths and suffering, aiding in manufacturing consent by parroting debunked, incendiary Israeli disinformation, and greenlighting genocide.\n\nAs the case heads to appeal, it remains significant and historic for several reasons. First and foremost, it marks the first time a sitting US president has been found to be providing support for what Judge White called \"a plausible case of genocide\" and a military siege that is \"intended to eradicate an entire people.\" In his ruling, Judge White implored the defendants-President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin-to examine the results of their \"unflagging support\" and its human rights implications.\n\nThe case also marks the first time a US court has heard extensive \"uncontroverted\" testimony (in the court's words) by Palestinians about the Nakba (\"catastrophe\"), the term Palestinians use to describe their forced expulsion from their homeland during the establishment of Israel in 1948, and about what we refer to as the ongoing Nakba in Gaza.\n\nThe Biden administration, for its part, continues to argue that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review matters of foreign policy. It also continues to insist it is not responsible for any harm done to innocent civilians in Gaza and that Israel is not committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nInstead, the administration has continued to arm and fund Israel's military (the quantity of bombs dropped on Gaza has now surpassed the amount dropped on Dresden, London, and other cities during World War II, by some estimates); and it has insisted on providing unwavering diplomatic and political support by vetoing UN cease-fire resolutions and calling the ICC's arrest warrant applications of Israeli leaders \"outrageous,\" among other things, all while Israel has committed grave war crimes .\n\nIt has done so even when Israel has flagrantly violated the rare conditions the administration has attempted to impose on Israel's onslaught. In mid-May, Biden went ahead with a $1 billion arms sale to Israel even after he himself said that Israel was engaged in the \" indiscriminate bombing \" and that American weapons were used to kill civilians in Gaza, a damning admission of guilt if there ever was one.\n\nAs ordinary citizens, we are left wondering how we can hold the systems that have allowed this to happen accountable if they are beyond judicial oversight.\n\nAs a Palestinian, I struggle to balance the disgust and impotence I feel knowing that my tax dollars are being used to kill my family members in Gaza with an urgency to do everything in my power to demand an end to this administrations complicity in genocide.\n\nThe appeals court has a constitutional obligation to hear my claim that top US officials have failed to prevent-and are complicit in-Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza and the most well-documented , deliberate destruction of a society in recent history.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nRev.

He's Not the First.\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nOther American presidents have faced the delicate challenge of bidding farewell with grace after serving only one term in the Oval Office.\n\nBy Chris Cameron\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nGeorge Bush lamented in 1993 that \"losing is never easy - trust me, I know,\" after losing to Bill Clinton. Gerald Ford in 1977 allowed for the possibility of a political comeback after being defeated by Jimmy Carter (\"This report will be my last - maybe.\") Donald J. Trump was defiant in defeat four years ago, declaring that \"we will be back in some form.\"\n\nAs far back as the 18th century - when George Washington warned the young republic of the dangers of partisanship and called for national unity - presidents have used their twilight days in office to reflect on their records and accomplishments, pleading for the nation to build on their legacies for generations to come.\n\nThat parting message has been at times complicated by the outgoing commander in chief being succeeded by a political rival - especially when being beaten out of a second term.\n\nThe challenge President Biden navigated Wednesday night was similarly delicate, as he highlighted his achievements and reflected on America's future - even as he hands the reins of government over to Mr. Trump, an adversary whom Mr. Biden has declared a threat to democracy , and who has vowed to undo many of his policies.\n\nHere's how some single-term presidents approached their farewell speeches:\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson left office in a remarkably similar position to Mr. Biden: Shadowed by contentious foreign wars , and struggling to hammer out a peace agreement with an adversary , Johnson ended his re-election campaign and cleared the way for his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, to be chosen as the Democratic presidential candidate at the party convention in Chicago. (Humphrey was ultimately defeated by Richard Nixon after struggling to distinguish himself from Johnson.)\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Shear\n\nElection officials are urging patience. Counting the votes on Nov. 5 could take awhile .\n\nVoters in 10 states will consider abortion measures this fall.\n\nLaura Loomer , a social media instigator, is back at Trump's side.\n\nIt was not so long ago that President Biden expected to be the center of the world's attention right about now. Had he not been forced out after his debate disaster, he would be in the intense, final stretch of his re-election bid.\n\nInstead, this week underscored how quickly Biden has faded into the background, no longer perceived by many Americans as someone whose every political utterance should be debated at the dinner table.\n\nBiden remains the nation's president and commander in chief at a time when the world is confronted by war, economic fragility and rising tensions. The president is overseeing difficult negotiations aimed at ending the war between Israel and Hamas and bringing hostages home. He will attend the annual meeting of world leaders at the U.N. at the end of the month. And he is weighing whether to allow Ukraine more flexibility to use long-range weapons against Russia.\n\n\"We're working that out right now,\" Biden told reporters as he boarded Marine One at the White House this week.\n\nBut the focus is elsewhere. That's both a sign that the world is moving on and a fact that allows him to be a little more liberated.\n\nOn Tuesday night, while 67 million Americans watched Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump debate on their television screens (and likely millions more on phones and tablets), Biden spent the evening in a hotel suite at the JW Marriott Essex House in New York City, just a one-minute drive from Trump Tower. Earlier, he had attended a birthday party for his granddaughter, Finnegan, at Campagnola, a restaurant that says it specializes in \"country-style Italian dining.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But We Need a New Nominee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy George Clooney\n\nMr. Clooney is an actor, director and film producer.\n\nI'm a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I'm proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history. Barack Obama in 2012 . Hillary Clinton in 2016 . Joe Biden in 2020 . Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election. I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \" big F-ing deal \" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, whom we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nIs it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor who I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\n\nWe love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power, and all of the traits that made it so formidable with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Ask Me About Our Age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Clark Hoyt\n\nMr. Hoyt was a reporter, editor, Washington bureau chief and news executive for Knight Ridder and later served as public editor of The Times.\n\nPresident Biden and I have something in common: We were born on Nov. 20, 1942 - he in Scranton, Pa., I in Providence, R.I.\n\nHe and I once even joked about it, long before anyone could suggest we were too old for our jobs. He was vice president of the United States. I was a journalist.\n\nMr. Biden is having a very hard time right now, and I get it. That awkward, stiff walk of his? The White House physician says it's the result of \"wear and tear\" on his spine. Tell me about it. I've had to get shots into my spine to alleviate excruciating pain caused by a collapsed vertebra.\n\nThe president and I share other health issues common for folks our age. We have atrial fibrillation, an occasionally irregular heartbeat that can lead to a stroke. We take Eliquis for it. (Thank goodness for Medicare for me, the White House physician's office for him. It's an expensive drug.) We also suffer from sleep apnea, which can make you wake up over and over, snorting and choking, leaving you tired and unable to focus during the day. We're both being treated with continuous positive airway pressure that involves wearing a mask attached to a machine by the bed that pumps air into you all night. My wife laughingly calls me Mr. Hose Head.\n\nThere's more, but you get the point: Aging isn't fun. We do what we can. Mr. Biden works out five days a week. I work with a trainer twice a week and walk at least 10,000 steps a day. None of our physical problems would be disqualifying, perhaps, even for the most demanding job there is. Yeah, that gait might be embarrassing for the leader of the free world, but it's not disqualifying. But there's another aspect to getting old that few of us like to admit. It's the mental decline that goes with the physical.\n\nFor nearly half a century I was a journalist, reporting and editing the news. Put me at a keyboard, and the prose flowed. Now there are good days and bad - days when I know the word I'm searching for but just can't bring it up from the La Brea Tar Pit of memory. Sometimes, if I sit for a few minutes, it will pop out. Other times I have to resort to tricks, like Googling what I think might be synonyms or, when that doesn't work, reconstructing the whole sentence to circumvent the missing piece. When reading a news story, I'll often find myself asking \"Who?\" when someone's last name appears on second reference. Worse are those days when I read an entire page of a book and realize I haven't absorbed a bit of it.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He used to kid me about it, that I was the first national figure to endorse him in 1976, when he ran for president. What I find extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people all around the world, all over the world, feel they lost a friend as well, even though they never met him. And that's because Jimmy Carter lived a life measured not by words but by his deeds. Just look at his life, his life's work. He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home but around the world. Jimmy Carter was just as courageous in his battle against cancer as he was in everything in his life. Cancer was a common bond between our two families, as in many other families. And our son Beau died, when he died Jimmy and Rosalynn were there to help us heal. Jimmy knew the ravages of the disease too well. We talked and shared our beliefs that as a nation we have the talent, we have the talent and the resources to one day end cancer as we know it, if we make the investments. He believed that like I do. We'd all do well to try to be a little more like Jimmy Carter. You know, my mom - you've heard me say this before - she'd say: Bravery lives in every heart, and someday it'll be summoned.

      "text": "Doctors Are Increasingly Worried About Biden\n\nFrom the moment that Joe Biden announced his candidacy for President, in 2019, he has been attacked as being too old. At the time, Biden was seventy-six and cast himself as a \"transitional\" figure-a \"bridge\" to the next generation. Since then, he has governed admirably, passing more meaningful legislation than almost anyone thought possible with flimsy Democratic majorities in Congress. But, in the past year, concerns about his fitness have gained traction and credibility. Staff, donors, and elected officials have divulged mental lapses; in February, the special counsel Robert Hur labelled the President a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\" in a report about Biden's handling of classified documents. Last month, with more than fifty million Americans watching, Biden delivered one of the worst Presidential-debate performances in history, stumbling over numbers and words, losing his train of thought, and struggling to finish sentences. He often appeared unfocussed , with a slack jaw and blank eyes; afterward, the First Lady gingerly helped him off the stage.\n\nAfter the debate, Axios reported that before 10 A.M. and after 4 P.M. the President tends to tire and misspeak; Biden, who is eighty-one, said at a press conference, \"I just got to pace myself a little more.\" Meanwhile, supporters tried to excuse his performance by invoking jet lag, a cold, a busy schedule, poor preparation, too much preparation, and a blanket shield of \"good days and bad days.\" These are the kinds of difficult conversations one has when considering whether one's grandfather can safely drive-not whether someone should run the country. Democrats, meanwhile, have damned the President with a mixture of tepid endorsements and outright defections. After Biden reaffirmed his intention to stay in the race, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who is eighty-four and announced in 2022 that she would not again pursue the House Speakership, told MSNBC, \"It's up to the President to decide if he is going to run.\" At least twenty Democratic members of the House of Representatives have publicly called on Biden to withdraw from the race, and, last week, Peter Welch, of Vermont, became the first Democratic senator to do so.\n\nWe all experience fluctuations in how we feel and perform. But the frequency and the severity of fluctuations matter: occasionally misplacing your keys or forgetting a friend's birthday is far less concerning than regularly losing your train of thought, which can be a sign of an evolving cognitive impairment. Trajectory and rapidity matter, too: a gradual descent may portend a different prognosis than a swift and jagged decline. Since the debate , I've asked nine doctors-including an internist, geriatricians, neurologists, and a neurosurgeon-to reflect on President Biden's health. Most of them are, politically speaking, left of center; they practice in different parts of the country and range in age from their thirties to their sixties. They were careful to stipulate that they couldn't diagnose the President from afar, and none wanted to be quoted by name. But almost all of them were concerned about the possibility that Biden's symptoms might go beyond a gradual, aging-related decline, and could potentially be attributed to something more serious, such as a meaningful cognitive impairment or neurodegenerative condition. Most felt that an evaluation for neurological disorders would be reasonable. One neurologist, who practices on the West Coast and identifies as a Democrat, told me that Biden's debate performance troubled a large number of her colleagues. \"All of us had a gut reaction that this is not normal,\" the neurologist told me.\n\nIn my own practice, I often review a patient's clinical record before a visit, only to be surprised by the person I ultimately meet. Perhaps she's healthier or sicker than her chart suggests; maybe a symptom she shares during my exam upends the expected diagnosis. This is good, careful medicine, and a reminder that no doctor should confidently diagnose someone based solely on video clips. Many medical professionals understandably prefer not to comment on public figures. Openly dissecting a person's health feels intrusive and unseemly, and, even if a person is diagnosed as having a neurological condition, that is no reason to deny them participation in work and life. But it also seems reasonable, even unavoidable, for a different standard to apply when that person's actions could affect the lives of millions of people for years to come. Talking to the specialists about the President's health, I questioned whether their expertise should remain behind the veil of professional norms. My fellow-doctors were able to contextualize Biden's symptoms; they refined my understanding of what tests might be informative and what the next few years might look like. Doesn't the public deserve the same?\n\nPerhaps the central hallmark of aging is that, over time, physiological stressors-a cold, a fall, a bad night's sleep-have a deeper and more prolonged impact. Small disturbances start to make a big difference, an especially precarious prospect for those with jobs that require a steady hand-pilots and surgeons, yes, but also Presidents. One reason that performing at a debate is more difficult-and more telling-than performing at a rally is that the two draw on different cognitive resources. One is reading sheet music; the other, improvising a jazz solo. We prize mental agility in our leaders not only because it allows them to inspire and persuade but also because of what it implies about their proficiency when we're not watching. What kind of performance can Biden still deliver, and for how much longer? \"We're all talking about it in the neuro world,\" a neurosurgeon told me. \"But I don't think anyone wants to be the one to say something publicly.\"\n\nPresidential health has always been a matter of intrigue and obfuscation. Grover Cleveland once boarded a friend's yacht, ostensibly for a fishing trip, and had an oral tumor excised. (Surgeons removed part of his jaw but were careful to preserve his walrus mustache.) After Woodrow Wilson suffered an incapacitating stroke, his wife, Edith, shielded him from scrutiny and assumed many of his daily responsibilities. Ronald Reagan, who was given a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease after leaving office, reportedly showed such significant signs of impairment during his second term that his closest aides considered invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\nDoctors were once much less hesitant to comment on the health of public figures. In 1964, the magazine Fact surveyed more than twelve thousand psychiatrists about the mental fitness of Barry Goldwater, the Republican nominee for President. Around twenty-five hundred responded; nearly half said that he was unfit. In a forty-one-page article, the magazine published the results along with sensational quotes. (\"I believe Goldwater has the same pathological makeup as Hitler, Castro, Stalin, and other known schizophrenic leaders,\" one psychiatrist speculated .) Goldwater won a libel suit against the magazine, but he lost the election in a landslide. Some years later, the American Psychiatric Association advanced the Goldwater Rule , which holds that it is unethical for psychiatrists to offer their professional opinion about public figures whom they have not examined, and about whom they have not been granted permission to speak. It was intended, in part, to prevent speculative, unverifiable commentary under the guise of scientific expertise.\n\nSome physicians believe that the Goldwater Rule is in tension with another obligation: one's duty to use her knowledge to educate the public about issues of societal importance. In 2017, amid rampant speculation about Donald Trump's mental fitness, the A.P.A. reaffirmed its position, and the American Medical Association adopted a guideline stating that physicians in all specialties should refrain \"from making clinical diagnoses about individuals . . . they have not had the opportunity to personally examine.\" That year, however, Bandy X. Lee, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale, convened dozens of mental-health specialists at a conference called \"Duty to Warn\" to discuss the ethics of speaking out about Trump's psychology. Afterward, she edited and published a collection of essays , titled \" The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President ,\" in which writers discussed such conditions as sociopathy, malignant narcissism, and antisocial personality disorder. The book became a Times best-seller. John Kelly, Trump's second chief of staff, reportedly consulted it when trying to constrain the former President's erratic behavior.\n\nLee's contract at Yale, where she'd attended medical school and taught for nearly two decades, was not renewed. But she told me that the Declaration of Geneva, adopted by the World Medical Association in the wake of the Second World War, compels doctors to speak out in the face of a looming threat. \"It's not about diagnosing a person,\" Lee said. \"It's about protecting the public health. A President has the power to destroy the world several times over. A leader who is unstable presents a clear and present danger. How can we stay silent?\" Lee argued that Trump's behavior was more worrying than Biden's current health, and she may be right. Her argument about the duty to warn, however, seems to apply equally to Biden.\n\nMost of the doctors I spoke with said that comprehensive neuropsychological and motor testing, along with imaging, would be needed to secure or dismiss a particular diagnosis. This would involve a suite of tests-administered in the course of hours, possibly days-that examine a person's attention, memory, mood, and semantic fluency. (Such tests would go beyond the one that Trump often brags about having \" aced \"-the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a screening test, not a diagnostic exam, whose results are influenced by a person's educational background. \"A Nobel laureate with dementia could score perfectly on that test,\" one geriatrician in the Northeast told me.) When I asked another doctor whether pressure to receive testing could fuel ageism, she told me that much of her work aims to fight age-related biases. But, \"in recent months, this has clearly become a question of function, not just of chronological age,\" she said. She added that she had treated many patients with similar symptoms who ultimately deteriorated.\n\nThe President's medical team, which has actually evaluated him, has consistently said that he does not show signs of a neurodegenerative condition. In February, Biden's physician, Kevin O'Connor, attributed the President's stiff gait to spinal arthritis. He wrote that the President had undergone an \"extremely detailed\" neurological exam, and that there were \"no findings which would be consistent with\" a central neurological disorder such as Parkinson's. He did not say whether a cognitive assessment was performed; he noted that Biden had received \"radiologic imaging,\" but didn't specify which kind, or what parts of the body were being scanned. (An MRI of the brain can sometimes detect neurological abnormalities.) Earlier this month, the Times reported that a motor-disorders expert had repeatedly visited the White House in the past year; the White House said that most of these visits were to treat other personnel, not Biden, and that the President has met with the expert no more than three times, as part of his annual physicals. Biden's physician also emphasized that the expert was selected \"not because he is a movement disorder specialist, but because he is a highly trained and highly regarded neurologist.\" Then, in an interview released on Wednesday, the President said for the first time that he would consider withdrawing from the race if he had \"some medical condition that emerged . . . if doctors came to me and said, 'You got this problem.' \" No such diagnosis has been rendered. (That day, Biden also tested positive for COVID and cancelled a campaign event in Las Vegas. O'Connor indicated that the President has experienced only mild symptoms so far.)\n\nWhen I contacted the Biden campaign and White House for comment about my conversations with doctors, a White House spokesperson told me, in part: \"As he has proved by earning the strongest record of any modern President, Joe Biden is unflinchingly capable and fighting for American families, with sharpness and resolve, across his busy schedule-whether it's managing rapidly-evolving national security events in the Situation Room or calling members of Congress late at night to pass the biggest climate investments in history.\" The spokesperson cited Biden's recent \"whirlwind meetings\" with NATO leaders in Washington, D.C., and his travels in the U.S.\n\nIn the absence of more details about Biden's condition, many doctors have been left to speculate. When I spoke with the neurologist on the West Coast, she told me that during the Presidential debate she was driving and turned on NPR. Listening to Biden, she immediately thought of the speech patterns of some of her patients. \"It activated my clinical Spidey sense,\" she said. In subsequent days, she grew more concerned and, with some neurology colleagues, she drafted an open letter expressing concern that the President could have a cognitive impairment.\n\nIn the end, they decided to stand down. None of them had personally examined the President, and, whatever their worries about Biden, they judged Trump's behavior to be a larger threat. They also weren't sure that their letter would make any difference. CNN's Sanjay Gupta, probably the most famous doctor in America, had just called on the President to undergo a cognitive exam. \"If Sanjay Gupta can't move the needle,\" the neurologist thought, \"how is our letter going to help?\"\n\nIn 2016, Terri Fried, a geriatrician at Yale, wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine about the ways in which doctors ought to help patients make decisions. Conventional wisdom holds that doctors should make strong recommendations when there's a high level of certainty (for example, when advising parents to vaccinate their children), but should encourage patients to make their own choice when the evidence is mixed (as in the case of certain cancer-screening tests). This model, Fried argues, has it exactly backward. It is precisely in moments of ambiguity that people benefit most from the persuasive guidance of professionals. Experts exist to offer expertise when the right answer isn't obvious.\n\nOf the doctors I spoke to, a neurologist in New York was the most confident in his assessment. He told me that, after reviewing footage of Biden from the past ten years, he would \"take the odds\" that the President has a neurodegenerative condition. \"In medical school, they teach you about syndromes,\" he told me. \"What makes a syndrome? It's the concatenation of multiple symptoms, which by themselves are not that concerning but together are a cause for concern.\" He asked me to imagine a neurologist taking a board exam with a question asking about an eighty-one-year-old man with a shuffling gait, decreased arm swing, and progressive impairment in the ability to speak clearly and remember words. \"If you said, 'That's a healthy older gentleman with some spinal stenosis,' you would fail,\" he said.\n\nDoctors think through complex diagnoses using a form of reasoning known as Bayesian inference, named for the eighteenth-century English statistician Thomas Bayes. Bayes's key insight was that the baseline probability of something being true should influence the way you evaluate information. When I encounter a patient with a high temperature in New York, I generally don't expect them to have malaria, because malaria mosquitoes aren't prevalent in the United States. But my priors should change if, for example, the feverish patient recently returned from a safari in Tanzania, or if mosquitoes are colonizing new habitats in a warming world. Bayesian logic is powerful because it prevents wild swings in appraisals or an excessive focus on anomalous data-and also because it allows for the gradual updating of one's views.\n\nWhen it comes to Biden's health, Republicans and Democrats have long reasoned from different Bayesian priors. Conservatives' baseline intuition has been that Biden is an aging and diminished man, incapable of discharging the duties of his office, whereas progressives have seen him as an elder statesman-slower, perhaps, but basically capable, and at times exceptional. It's possible that both these perspectives contain elements of the truth. But, given the vicissitudes of aging-the shifting proportion of good and bad days, the baseline probabilities of advancing age-it's hard to avoid the conclusion that one is growing truer than the other.\n\nBiden has responded to worries about his age by telling the public to \" watch me .\" He has argued, correctly, that the most telling indication of his fitness is not a cognitive exam but his performance in office and on the campaign trail. A specific diagnosis, should one exist, is less important than a holistic assessment of whether he is up to the job. But his Administration has so restricted his unscripted appearances-he has held fewer press conferences and given fewer interviews than any President since Reagan-that the public has had little opportunity to refine its judgments. The problem for Biden now is that the test we'd been waiting for, the debate that his campaign itself had insisted on, returned with such a politically devastating diagnosis. As many as eighty-five per cent of Americans, and most of his own party, believe that he is too old for the job. A supermajority of the electorate, including large numbers in nearly every demographic group, thinks that it's time for him to step aside. \"He's fading in front of us,\" the New York neurologist said. \"You don't need to be a neurologist to see it.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Was Biden's Decision to Withdraw \"Heroic\"?\n\nJon Meacham is a Pulitzer Prize-winning Presidential historian who has written biographies of Andrew Jackson and George H. W. Bush. He's had a long career in publishing and journalism, serving as editor-in-chief of Newsweek and an executive editor at Random House. More recently, Meacham has been an informal adviser-and friend-to President Joe Biden, and has helped him craft speeches. On Sunday, Biden announced that he would no longer seek reëlection, and endorsed his Vice-President, Kamala Harris. The next day, Meacham published a piece in the Times that called Biden an \"American hero.\" He wrote, \"His decision is one of the most remarkable acts of leadership in our history, an act of self-sacrifice that places him in the company of George Washington, who also stepped away from the presidency.\"\n\nI spoke by phone with Meacham about Biden's legacy and his decision to step aside. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why Biden took so long to announce that he was ending his campaign, how past Presidents have dealt with questions about whether to run for a second term, and why Biden's historical legacy could be dependent on defeating Donald Trump in November.\n\nWhat is your relationship with the President? How did it start, and what is it now?\n\nLet's see. [ Ten-second pause .] I'm pausing because I hate the self-reference. Let's see. I had known him casually in the Senate and as Vice-President. He kindly reached out to me almost twenty years ago after I published a book called \" American Gospel ,\" that was an argument for a respectful and moderate, as opposed to extreme, understanding of the role of religion in American history and politics.\n\nThe more recent, deeper relationship began in 2017. I did an event with him for his book about the loss of his son, and we ended up talking for three hours afterward. That year, we had the same reaction to Charlottesville, which was that this was a manifestation, a dangerous manifestation, of perennial forces in American life, and that we had to confront them. We had to confront the worst of forces with the best of our instincts. And so I wrote a book called \" The Soul of America .\"\n\nEvery author obviously believes that every person who reads their book and thinks it's good is a particularly discerning critic, which is what happened here. And as Biden began to run for President, he would call with an occasional historical question. I do not mean to sound pretentious; I do not mean to sound self-important.\n\nDon't worry about it.\n\nTo say \"we shared a view\" makes me sound more important. I don't mean that, but I believe, as Churchill once said, that history tells us that Americans tend to get things right once we've exhausted every other possibility. While democracy is a frail, fragile thing, it has proven to be the most durable way for us to pursue justice and to create a \"more perfect union,\" to borrow a phrase from Gouverneur Morris. You did not have Gouverneur Morris on your bingo card.\n\nI did not.\n\nBut I'm here for that. So I am helping him with speeches on occasion, all volunteer, all informal. I'm not a political guy. I'm not a policy guy. I'm not a Democrat. But, to me, the Trump Presidency represented, and a prospective second Trump Presidency represents, an unacceptable risk to the country and the Constitution that I value. And President Biden stepped into the breach at a critical moment. I was honored to answer the call.\n\nHave you talked to him much this past month?\n\nI have.\n\nAre you willing to share anything about those conversations?\n\nI am not.\n\nIn your op-ed, you framed Biden's decision to step aside as an incredible act that we should look at historically. You mentioned George Washington stepping aside. Why do you believe it was so important?\n\nIt is a fact of human nature, which the Greeks understood best, that the traits, the characteristics, the appetites, the ambitions that lead people to seek power make it very, very difficult for those people to walk away from power. That's what a tragic flaw is. That which makes us great can also undo us. And so what President Biden did here was unusual in that he respected fate, he respected reality, and he respected us by putting what he sees-and what I believed him to be correct to see-as the good of the country above his own pursuit of a second term. Very, very few people do this. Washington walked away from the Presidency. Coolidge could have run.\n\nL.B.J.\n\nHarry Truman could have run in 1952 and decided very late not to do it. And President Johnson, who people talk about a lot, is a complicated analogy because we know from the record that he expected, or was certainly open to, revisiting that decision should the Party call upon him. What President Biden has done is highly, highly unusual.\n\nThere may be something immediate that we all want. If you're a Republican voter in America, you may want lower taxes. But there's a larger issue today in this election, which is that we need to support, secure, preserve, the rule of law.\n\nThe historian Adam Tooze recently wrote , \"I honestly don't get what is heroic here. ... Biden and his team around him made a historic mistake with disastrous implications. Why, after the shambles of the last few weeks, are we giving 'big-boy' merit badges for this belated admission?\" What do you make of that argument?\n\nWe live in a fallen world. All of us are imperfect. Most of us make the wrong decisions all day long. What's remarkable about human nature and history is that people get to the right decision at all. And so I find that criticism overly glib.\n\nIf you look at news reports from the past weeks, and even some of Biden's own comments, it seems to me that the national interest was not front and center in his mind. And his ultimate decision could work out, and Kamala Harris could win the Presidency, but there wasn't a real nominating contest. This is all very rushed. She starts at a disadvantage in the polls. And so it does seem that the way Biden and his people have dealt with the past few weeks, and indeed maybe the past year, the unwillingness to step aside , has really potentially put the country at risk.\n\nIt's a totally fair argument to make, and we should wrestle with it. It would be intellectually dishonest not to. My position, my view, personal opinion, is that what matters is where you get in the end. And this is why Reinhold Niebuhr is so important. Right?\n\nI was just saying that to myself.\n\nNiebuhr said that \"the sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.\" My view is that we are imperfect people. We are fallible people. And I think what's remarkable about human history and politics is that just enough of us get to the right place at all, much less early and all the time.\n\nYou said earlier, essentially, that what matters is where you get in the end. And in your op-ed, you write, \"Here is the story I believe history will tell of Joe Biden. With American democracy in an hour of maximum danger in Donald Trump's presidency, Mr. Biden stepped in the breach. He staved off an authoritarian threat at home, rallied the world against autocrats abroad, laid the foundations for decades of prosperity, managed the end of a once-in-a-century pandemic, successfully legislated on vital issues of climate and infrastructure and has conducted a presidency worthy of the greatest of his predecessors.\" It does seem to me that the story of Biden's Presidency, both in terms of policies and symbolism, does really come down to what happens in November. It'll be hard for me to say that this was a successful Presidency in some major way if it ends with Donald Trump being elected. And I don't just mean that because Biden's policy in Ukraine or the Inflation Reduction Act might not last.\n\nHistory is fluid because human nature is fluid. Often our judgments in the present are amended, sometimes upended, by subsequent events. President Truman left Washington with a minuscule approval rating, and yet now every President would love to be Harry Truman. Right? George Herbert Walker Bush failed to win a second term, but when we look back on his record, I can't imagine any American President would not be thrilled to have accomplished what he accomplished.\n\nHistory and headlines don't move in tandem. The question you raise is totally legitimate, totally relevant, and totally unanswerable in the short term. I believe what I wrote. To approvingly quote myself-\n\nPlease.\n\nIt's difficult. It's fraught. It reminds me of the story where a preacher in the pulpit said, \"As Jesus remarked, and rightly . . . \" So take this for what it's worth. Bill Clinton is the person I first heard say that Presidents get one sentence, usually. \"Lincoln saved the Union.\" F.D.R. gets a compound sentence: \"He rescued democratic capitalism and won World War Two.\" \"Nixon went to China, but had to resign.\"\n\nA little passive there for Nixon. But go ahead.\n\nIn the midst of a global pandemic, in the midst of incredible danger, President Biden stepped into the breach and he did the things that I described there. We do not yet know whether President Biden decisively turned back the dangers of Trumpism. Let me put it that way. Or whether he, President Biden, represents a caesura.\n\nI think the difference between George H. W. Bush and Harry Truman is that there was no concern that if they lost, or paved the way to a loss, to Eisenhower or to Clinton, that American democracy would be at risk in some way, which I think that Biden himself, and you, think is at risk with Trump. And so the importance of having the political skill or ability or just motivation to be able to win this election and making sure that that happens does seem like it will be a bigger part of Biden's legacy, and not just for policy reasons.\n\nWe just don't know yet. We're in the middle of it.\n\nYou brought up Charlottesville earlier. I'm going to take Biden at his word that that was really the reason that he decided to run in 2020, as he's often said. It just seems that, symbolically, taking him at his own word, his Presidency was in some sense about defeating Trumpism. It seems that how we view his Presidency historically will be in large part about that, too.\n\nSo here's a place where the President and I disagree. President Biden likes to say that Charlottesville's not who we are. Tragically but inescapably, I believe that that is very much part of who we are. And the battle, the struggle, the dialectic of history is whether our better angels can prevail over our worst instincts. It is a perennial struggle, because democracy, America, is not a clinical enterprise but a human one. And since Genesis, we have been dealing with the relative struggle between human appetite and the rule of law.\n\nMaybe even before that.\n\nThere was a piece of fruit.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe were told not to take it. We took it because we wanted it. And that's what human nature is. It's a battle about giving and taking, and it's a lot more fun to take. And so, to me, the miracle of human nature, and of American history, is that we give as much as we do.\n\nThe fact checker may have some issues with the Genesis story, but we can figure that out.\n\nBiblehub.com.\n\nIf what you're saying is right, that Biden did something really heroic by stepping aside, offering the Party and the country the best chance to beat Donald Trump in November, I think what irks me is my fear that the people around Biden, and you can include yourself or not, but his staff, his friends, his family, would not be denouncing it as a giant risk to the Republic if he had decided to stick it out. I feel like they would be showing loyalty to him more than to the needs of the country.\n\nI think your being irked is now a hypothetical. It's a totally reasonable line of argument. I totally get what you're saying. But the fact of the matter is that the decision has been made, and would the country be running a larger risk if President Biden had stayed in?\n\nYes.\n\nBut he didn't. I want to be clear, because this is interesting. I'm not minimizing the concern you're articulating. I'm not dismissing it. It is totally legitimate. I absolutely see how people would be wrestling with that. But in point of fact, it's no longer an issue. We could hypothetically argue about this at panels where people give out free fleece vests for the next couple of decades. Right now, a man charged with ultimate responsibility made the responsible decision.\n\nI think the only way to respond to that is to say a version of what you said earlier, that we just need to see what happens in November and how this election plays out, what does or doesn't give people the best chance to defeat Trump.\n\nCall me back in a hundred and six days.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, a lot of people will point to Gaza as one area where the White House stumbled. I interviewed Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official who has worked for a bunch of Administrations, who said that he thought Biden didn't care about Palestinian life as much as Israeli life. As someone who admires President Biden and talked about his humanity so much, what do you think about this?\n\nI do not believe that. I do not . . . Let me not say it negatively. I believe President Biden cares very much about Palestinian lives. This is not a blindingly original insight, but the Middle East is among the most intractable and tragic geopolitical and human spheres that the world has ever known, certainly the modern world has ever known. And so that region has flummoxed generations of Western leaders. I know he worked . . . I know President Biden spends an enormous amount of time and intellectual and even emotional energy on these issues. And I think the story's still unfolding. I would argue that in the . . . If you're assessing . . . Let me put it this way. I would argue that scholars and observers will be studying the Biden foreign policy for as long as the American republic endures.\n\nSo until next year.\n\nAnd that, like everything else, it will be an honest assessment, and one that gives them credit for this and demerits for that. The stand against Putin in Ukraine is, I believe, epic. Afghanistan must be studied, contemplated, and included in this assessment.\n\nLet me say something that I would really appreciate if you would get in somewhere here. I am not a reflexive defender of everything that the Biden Administration has done. There are things the Administration has done, or wanted to do, with which I disagree. The only reason you and I are talking in this way is that, all in all, taking everything that we have faced as a country over the last eight years and continue to face, it is my assessment as a citizen and as someone who spends most of his time thinking about the past, that President Biden has represented the best possible. . . .\n\nAngels of our nature?\n\n. . . Means by which an imperfect, but durable, constitutional order can prevail. So I am not President Biden's Baghdad Bob . I'm not. But he is my friend, and he has been a consequential President who has gotten a lot more right than he's gotten wrong. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Bernie Sanders Wants Joe Biden to Stay in the Race\n\nJoe Biden has been trailing Donald Trump in the polls for months, and after a calamitous debate on June 27th he has faced calls from members of his own party to step aside as the Democratic nominee. Most members of Congress have maintained silence or issued cryptic remarks about whether Biden should continue his campaign. Some of his highest-profile supporters have, surprisingly, come from the Party's left, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, of New York and Minnesota, respectively, and the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nSanders, who competed against Biden in the 2020 Democratic Presidential primaries, has been harshly critical of the President's support for Israel's war in Gaza. And yet he has remained a vigorous proponent of Biden's candidacy. This past weekend, in an opinion essay in the Times , Sanders wrote, \"Despite my disagreements with [Biden] on particular issues, he has been the most effective president in the modern history of our country and is the strongest candidate to defeat Mr. Trump.\" (The Washington Post reported last week that Sanders had recently met with Biden aides to discuss adding more progressive policy items-such as expanding Social Security benefits and erasing medical debt-to Biden's second-term pitch. Biden has begun campaigning on those policies.)\n\nI recently spoke by phone with Sanders. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why he is backing Biden, whether the media has focussed too much on Biden's age, and why he refuses to say whether he has concerns about Biden being too old to govern in a possible second term.\n\nIn your op-ed, you wrote, \"But for over two weeks now, the corporate media has obsessively focused on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world.\" What point were you trying to make?\n\nWhat I was trying to say is that we live in a difficult and complicated world. What the media should be doing, in my view, is focussing on the contrast between Joe Biden, what his record is and what his vision is for the future, not just what happened in a debate. And if you want to talk about cognitive capabilities and you want to talk about things that people say, take a hard look at Donald Trump as well.\n\nHow would you respond to people who agree that we should be focussed on the platforms of the two candidates, on what policies they will enact, but that the problem is Joe Biden has consistently trailed Donald Trump in the polls, so we'll never get to enact those progressive-\n\nHold it, hold it, hold it. It is true that Biden has been behind Trump. That was true before the debate as well.\n\nSure was.\n\nAnd, in fact, what is very interesting to me, and what I think people should see as a very positive thing, is that despite the disastrous debate my understanding in looking at these polls is he's not any worse off today than he was before, which tells me that there are a lot of people who are not enthusiastic about voting for Donald Trump. [ Biden has lost about two points, in an average of national polls, since the debate. ] And given these really horrific several weeks that Biden has had since the debate, where Democrats are busy attacking him, the media is busy attacking him, if he's not any worse off today than he was before the debate, I think that he has a very good chance to win.\n\nHe's dropped a little bit in the polls. But, I think, one response to that would be that Donald Trump had never led in national polls in previous elections-he didn't even lead in them against Hillary Clinton-and he has already been leading President Biden for most of the year. So we were already in a worst-case scenario before the debate. It's possible Biden didn't have that much further to fall. It also suggests that big events might not shake up the race at all, which is pretty worrisome when you're down.\n\nNo, but let me just add something to this. I have been critical of the Biden campaign-above and beyond the debate, which everybody understands was a disaster. The truth of the matter is Biden's record, in my view, is the strongest record of any President in modern American history. I don't think they've done a particularly good job of getting that out.\n\nNo. 2-and I've been extremely critical of this and I see it beginning to change now-it's not good enough just to talk about what you've done in the last three and a half years. The American people are hurting. Sixty per cent of our people live paycheck to paycheck. Young people are worried, appropriately, about climate change; women are worried about their reproductive rights. What the President has got to do is get out there and say, \"You know what? You reëlect me, give me a Democratic House, give me a Democratic Senate, and let me tell you what we're going to do.\" Did you happen to hear the speech in Detroit on Friday?\n\nI did.\n\nI thought that was, between you and me, an excellent speech. And I think it was the kind of speech that he needs to take all over this country. He talked about an agenda for the first hundred days, which speaks to the needs of a long-forgotten working class in this country. And he's prepared to take on powerful special interests. If he does that, he's going to win this election.\n\nTo merge the question about him selling his agenda with the question about his age: I watched President Biden with Lester Holt Monday night, and I watched him on \"360 with Speedy Morman,\" and he is definitely getting out there more than he was the night after the debate. But just to be honest, Senator, I mean, the guy has trouble completing a single sentence.\n\nHe does.\n\nEvery time he was attacking Donald Trump's record, he would just pause. I mean, the idea that this candidate, who's going to be eighty-two this year, is going to-\n\nMay I?\n\nYeah, please.\n\nI'm not aware that anyone thinks that Joe Biden is the best candidate in the history of the world, or that he's an ideal candidate, and nobody will argue with you that he has a . . . [ trails off ] He admitted it. Sometimes he gets confused about names. You're right-sometimes he doesn't put three sentences together. It is true. But the reality of the moment is, in my view, he is the best candidate the Democrats have for a variety of reasons, and trying, in an unprecedented way, to take him off the ticket would do a lot more harm than good.\n\nAnd then there's this substantive question about whether he can be President for four more years. You have no concerns about that?\n\nLook, I have concerns about everything, you know? And everybody should have concerns about everything. As a nation, we do a very poor job, both in Congress and in the media, of focussing on issues that impact the working class. So I would much prefer to have somebody who can't put three sentences together who is setting forth an agenda that speaks to the needs of working-class people: raising the minimum wage, making it easier for workers to join unions, dealing with the existential threat of climate change, protecting women's reproductive rights, building millions of units of affordable housing-\n\nRight, but you have to get elected for all these things to happen.\n\nAll right, but I am saying that the American people are not stupid and they understand that substance matters. They understand what you have accomplished and what you want to accomplish is enormously important. And my criticism of the media, and some of my colleagues in Congress, is that we're not focussing on that. So let's focus on substance.\n\nYou say in the op-ed that Biden has had the most substantive achievements of any President in recent American history, and yet his approval ratings have been horrible for years. If substance matters to the American people, why is that? What's the problem?\n\nI'll tell you what the problem is. That's a very good question. It's an excellent question. We have a government, which is, to a significant degree-and the American people understand this-beholden to large corporate interests, and the very rich, and ignoring the needs of the working class of this country. O.K.?\n\nBut why do they blame Joe Biden for that?\n\nProbably because he is the President of the United States. And they blame me, and they blame everybody.\n\nYou're pretty popular in your state, and most of the Senate Democrats running for reëlection are popular.\n\nHold it, hold it, hold it, hold it! Do you want me to interview you or are you interviewing me?\n\nGo on.\n\nCongress has a twelve- or fourteen-per-cent approval rating . People are hurting and they are not seeing their government respond. He is the head of their government.\n\nIf Biden is so unpopular because he's the head of the government, that suggests that maybe Democrats should run someone else.\n\nNo, no! That's exactly wrong. What it suggests . . . You tell me. All right, you follow these things. The Democrats control the Senate, right?\n\nYep.\n\nO.K. You tell me their achievements in the last year.\n\nWell, they don't control the House. It's hard to pass things when you don't have the House.\n\nYeah, but tell me what they have done in the Senate and taken to the House.\n\nWhat does it matter what they take to the House? Nothing would pass the House.\n\nIt matters a great deal because it would suggest that a party stands for something. If the Democrats had raised the minimum wage to seventeen dollars an hour, made it easier for workers to join unions, expanded Social Security, that's what the country might be talking about, if the media covered it.\n\nBut you're the one who said that Biden has the most achievements of any President in recent American history and people don't seem to be responding.\n\nWell, what I'm telling you is that given the corruption of our political system, given the dominance of the oligarchs in our economic system, that's the reality that we face.\n\nIn an NBC poll from this past weekend, sixty-two per cent of all Democrats say that Biden should not be the Party's nominee. Of Democrats who voted for you or Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 primary, that number is eighty per cent. There seems to be a gap between very progressive voters, who seem even more eager for Biden to leave, and progressives like yourself in Congress. How do you understand that?\n\nI think it's a couple of factors. I think there's no question that many of my supporters-and I can't speak about Elizabeth-but my supporters are very upset, and justifiably so, at the President for his position on the war in Gaza. And I pointed that out in my op-ed. I think what's going on there is a humanitarian horror show. I think Netanyahu should not get another nickel, but that is not the White House's position. And I think there are a lot of people, young people, people of color, who are very unhappy with the President for that-and I should say the Democratic Party as a whole.\n\nBiden said in an interview on Monday that he'd done more for Palestinians than anyone, which made me a little concerned.\n\nLook, this war is a total disaster. What's going on in Gaza is unspeakable.\n\nIt's unspeakable. But Biden saying that had me a little concerned.\n\nWell, I think what he was perhaps talking about-he is reiterating the goal of a two-state solution. And what's not talked about enough, by the way-I've been critical of the Administration from Day One on this war, but you know what? The President at least believes that we ought to feed starving children in Gaza and get humanitarian aid there. You've got Republicans who don't even want humanitarian aid to go in there. Maybe somebody would want to talk about that as well. Maybe that's what he means. I don't know.\n\nIn your recent op-ed, you mentioned \"corporate media,\" and it seemed like you were saying that the only people who would care about-\n\nNo, that's not what I meant by that. No, no, no. Look, of course, anyone who watched that debate is going to be concerned. Of course. It's not some kind of conspiracy theory on the part of the corporate media, but it has gone on and on and on.\n\nWhen you yourself say that you have concerns about whether Joe Biden would be able to finish a second term, I think it's hard to ask people to-\n\nI didn't say that. I did not. Didn't say that.\n\nYou said, \"I have concerns about everything\" when I asked you about that, implying that that was one of your concerns.\n\nWell, don't . . . Well, yeah, I am. I am. I'm concerned about the existential threat of climate change.\n\nI'm concerned about that, too. I would like a President-\n\nI'm concerned about your health, and I'm concerned about my health. Don't take that as whether I'm worried about-\n\nO.K., so you're not concerned about whether Joe Biden can be President in 2028, early 2029. You're not concerned about that?\n\nI'm concerned about a lot of things, but, yeah, Joe Biden will get elected. If Joe Biden gets elected-everybody's health is in question. You don't know what's going to happen, right?\n\nI would just say that you not being able to say this clearly is a reason that people might have doubts about whether he should be the nominee, and feel that the Party should choose someone who people feel confident can finish their term.\n\nYou are doing exactly what I've been faulting. If you want to make the case that Biden is not the perfect candidate for a dozen different reasons, go ahead, and you're right, but, tell me, you've got a better path forward? I don't think you do, because I don't think there is a better path forward. I think he is the best candidate, and I think if he runs a strong, effective campaign focussed on the needs of the working class of this country, he will win. And I think there's a chance he could win big. ♦\n\nWhy Bishop Mariann Budde wanted to speak to Donald Trump .\n\nLena Dunham's change of pace .\n\nTim Walz might run for President in 2028 if you ask him nicely .\n\nMaya Rudolph is ready to serve .\n\nSarah McBride wasn't looking for a fight on trans rights .\n\nThe liberated life of Colman Domingo .\n\nSupport The New Yorker's award-winning journalism.

      "text": "Bidenomics Is Starting to Transform America. Why Has No One Noticed?\n\nAmong Joe Biden's afflictions and miseries, his wormwood and gall, there are the insults (about his diminished capacities), and then there are the compliments unpaid (about his achievements). We are exposed to more of the first, but it seems that to him the second are more painful. In his first interview after he withdrew as the Democratic Presidential nominee, Biden-wounded, proud, self-pitying, defiant-said, by way of defending his record, \"No one thought we could get done, including some of my own people, what we got done. One of the problems is, we knew all the things we did were going to take a little time to work their way through. So now people are realizing, 'Oh, that highway. Oh, that . . .' \" He trailed off for a moment and then recovered. \"The biggest mistake we made, we didn't put up signs saying 'Joe Did It.' \" He ended this with a bitter chuckle. Biden isn't wrong. Objectively, and improbably, he has passed more new domestic programs than any Democratic President since Lyndon Johnson-maybe even since Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nIn the early weeks of 2021, very few people saw Biden as the obvious winner in the large field of potential candidates for the 2024 Democratic nomination. His victory over Donald Trump had not been overwhelming. The Democrats had lost seats in the House even while maintaining a narrow majority, and got to fifty votes in the Senate only after two runoff elections in Georgia broke their way. Then, with nothing close to a mandate, Biden passed domestic legislation that will generate government spending of at least five trillion dollars, spread across a wide range of purposes, in every corner of the country. He has also redirected many of the federal government's regulatory agencies in ways that will profoundly affect American life. On Biden's watch, the government has launched large programs to move the country to clean energy sources, to create from scratch or to bring onshore a number of industries, to strengthen organized labor, to build thousands of infrastructure projects, to embed racial-equity goals in many government programs, and to break up concentrations of economic power.\n\nAll of this doesn't represent merely a hodgepodge of actions. There is as close to a unifying theory as one can find in a sweeping set of government policies. Almost all the discussion of \"Bidenomics\"-by focussing on short-term fluctuations of national metrics such as growth, the inflation rate, and unemployment, with the aim of determining the health of the economy-misses the point. Real Bidenomics upends a set of economic assumptions that have prevailed in both parties for most of the past half century. Biden is the first President in decades to treat government as the designer and ongoing referee of markets, rather than as the corrector of markets' dislocations and excesses after the fact. He doesn't speak of free trade and globalization as economic ideals. His approach to combatting climate change involves no carbon taxes or credits-another major departure, not just from his predecessors but also from the policies of many other countries. His Administration has been far more aggressive than previous ones in taking antitrust actions against big companies.\n\nWhat would you call these policies? One apt label might be \"post-neoliberal,\" a term that does not resonate at all with the public. Another way of thinking about Biden's approach is through terminology devised by the political scientist Jacob Hacker: it rejects redistribution as a guiding liberal principle, in favor of \"predistribution,\" an effort to transform the economy in a way that makes redistribution less necessary. Predistribution entails understanding the economy as something that structures the balance of power among institutions, rather than as a natural phenomenon that must be managed in order to lessen its harmful effects on individuals. So Bidenomics has overturned a number of unwritten rules that you previously had to follow if you wanted to be taken seriously as a policymaker: economic regulation is usually a bad idea; governments should balance their budgets, except during recessions and depressions; subsidizing specific industries never works; unions are a mixed blessing, because they don't always promote economic efficiency; government should not try to help specific regions of the country or sectors of the economy.\n\nAt least in domestic affairs, nobody makes policy without thinking about politics. One grand ambition behind all the Biden economic initiatives is to usher in a political realignment that would make the Democrats competitive again in the more sparsely populated parts of the country, which have disproportionate political power. The idea is that Americans are not as motivated as you might think by notions of \"opportunity\" and \"mobility\"-that such liberal rhetoric has limited appeal among people who want to live safely and securely in the communities where they grew up, surrounded by strong institutions that are not subject to relentless economic and social disruption. (According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, ninety-two per cent of Americans say that financial stability is more important to them than upward mobility.) What people see happening around them matters far more than what the latest statistics tell us about the state of the economy. As Elizabeth Wilkins, who worked in the Biden White House, told me, \"It's national G.D.P. numbers versus how people feel about their lives, their families, their communities. It's their job, the jobs of the people around them, what those jobs pay-not the aggregate numbers. We fully embraced that in our policy orientation.\" And that meant shoring up specific places and institutions as a primary political strategy.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe irony of Bidenomics is the vast gulf between its scale-measured in money and in the number of projects that it has set in motion-and its political impact, which is essentially zero, even though a major part of its rationale is political. It has become a standard talking point of the engineers of Bidenomics that it will take at least five years, maybe ten, possibly even longer, for the public to understand its effects. \"That's the way it was with the New Deal,\" Steve Ricchetti, one of Biden's closest and longest-serving aides, said. \"It wasn't just three or four years of new programs. It was leveraged for twenty or thirty years into the future.\" But the short-term politics worked out a lot better for Franklin Roosevelt; he carried all but two states in his first reëlection campaign. There is little evidence that the Democrats will be similarly rewarded in 2024. Only late in the race, when she was spending much of her time in the Midwest, did Kamala Harris begin speaking regularly about Biden's major economic initiatives. It's unclear how committed to them she will be if she becomes President. Trump has promised to repeal many of them. Still, President Biden can rest assured that many signs are being put up. They just don't say \"Joe Did It.\" They say \"Investing in America.\"\n\nOver the summer, I accompanied two Biden Cabinet members, Julie Su, the acting Secretary of Labor, and Pete Buttigieg, the Secretary of Transportation, as they travelled around the country promoting the Administration's projects. These visits took place away from the coasts, mainly in small towns. Watching the Biden officials in action made me feel like a time traveller transported back to the social-realist days of the thirties and forties. At every stop, it seemed, we'd come upon a tall chain-link fence and drive through an open gate, past a guardhouse, and then down a long, lonely road leading to a factory. All around would be forklifts, cranes, pickup trucks, huge metal sheds, silos, and lengths of pipe so wide that you could stand up inside them.\n\nOn a Friday morning in July, I went to Fort Valley, Georgia, the seat of Peach County, to watch Su promote a new factory that will build electric school buses. If the over-all goals of Bidenomics sound abstract, this project makes for a good concrete example, because it unites all the major ideas. Fort Valley is a majority-Black town in a rural swing county, in a historically Republican state that the Democrats have targeted. The biggest business in town is the Blue Bird Corporation, one of the country's largest manufacturers of school buses. During the next five years, nearly a billion dollars in grants will be awarded to dozens of school districts nationwide through the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program, some of which will go toward the purchase of Blue Bird's electric buses, and Blue Bird will receive eighty million dollars from the Department of Energy's Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains. In essence, the Administration is generously funding a private business. Because the money will go to electric vehicles, the plan is part of both the transition to clean energy and the Administration's project of bringing manufacturing back to the American heartland-rather than letting it happen, in particular, in China. And Blue Bird, for the first time in its ninety-seven-year history, has coöperated with its employees' effort to unionize, a development that aligns with Biden's support for unions.\n\nFor the event in Fort Valley, there was a temporary canopy to protect the audience from the summer sun, a few rows of folding chairs, a makeshift podium in front of a yellow school bus, and \"Investing in America\" signs posted at every possible location. The mayor, Jeffery Lundy, opened the event by saying that he was \"excited and ecstatic\" about the new plant. He thanked the federal government, the Blue Bird Corporation, and God, and ended by quoting a few lines of Scripture. Then came Yvonne Brooks, the president of the Georgia A.F.L.-C.I.O. Finally, Su, who has a brisk, cheerful charm, took the podium and said that the plant would help solve the climate crisis, create jobs for the local community, and give schoolchildren a chance to breathe cleaner air.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Su and I found a room where we could talk for a few minutes. She is a lawyer who started her career in civil-rights organizations and then worked in state labor agencies in California. (Her liberal past has made it difficult for her to be confirmed by the Senate, and that is why she is the \"acting\" Secretary.) She told me about the amount of effort that had gone into making the Fort Valley announcement possible. Phil Horlock, Blue Bird's C.E.O., had been brought to the White House for a meeting with Biden. Then, this spring, Su had come to Fort Valley to urge Horlock to speed up his slow-moving negotiations with the United Steelworkers. Was the conclusion of the negotiations connected to the eighty-million-dollar grant to build the electric-bus factory? \"I'm going to answer this way,\" Su said. \"The way you asked me implies conditions. Whether workers want to join a union depends on them . Politicians should not interfere. It is not a condition. What I said to Phil was 'There's no reason not to have a contract after a year of negotiations.' They got that done. The company took it seriously. Phil said, 'We heard the Julie Su challenge, and we accept.' \"\n\nHow did this new era in economic policy come to pass? How did Biden, the most familiar of politicians, and previously not seen as someone with sweeping policy ambitions, become the organizer of such a big program? In retrospect, it's possible to see what happened as the convergence of a number of forces that have been building for fifteen years. It's a story line that seems clearer now than it did as it was unfolding.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama swept into office with three hundred and sixty-five electoral votes and firm control of both the Senate and the House. It seemed as if the Democrats were on their way to securing a lasting majority, as they did in the New Deal era, this time with a coalition of educated urban and suburban voters and racial and ethnic minorities. The last stage of Obama's campaign and the beginning of his Administration took place against the backdrop of the worst financial crisis in eight decades, but Obama seemed well equipped to handle it. He and a team of experienced economic advisers got Congress to pass a large stimulus bill, aimed at preventing another Great Depression. But we wound up having a Great Recession. The unemployment rate rose to a peak of ten per cent in October, 2009; it took until 2017 for employment to recover fully. The recession generated populist revolts on the right (the Tea Party movement) and the left (the Occupy movement), and made what had appeared to be broad public acceptance of pro-market bromides seem like an illusion. In the 2010 midterms, the Democrats lost six seats in the Senate and sixty-three seats, along with the majority, in the House.\n\nDemocrats concerned with economic inequality began identifying what they saw as the Party's original sins. There was the Clinton Administration's enthusiastic embrace of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and its lengthy negotiations to bring China into the World Trade Organization. Bill Clinton delivered a healthy economy as measured by the standard national statistics, but inside it were large pockets of woe, thanks to rising inequality and the departure of manufacturing jobs for Mexico, China, and other locations abroad. \"We saw that this approach-get government out of the way, don't give business a reason to invest here-led to inequality and massive dislocation,\" Lael Brainard, the head of Biden's National Economic Council, who also worked in the Clinton and Obama Administrations, told me. \"You saw a downward spiral of investment.\" Deregulation of the financial system made it less risk-proof and helped to set the stage for the 2008 crisis. Some argue that, if Obama's stimulus package-initially estimated at seven hundred and eighty-seven billion dollars-had been bigger, the Great Recession, and the resulting level of political discontent, would have been less severe.\n\nObama was reëlected easily, in 2012, but the Democrats' bill came due in 2016. During the primary season, Bernie Sanders, a politician whom the Democratic establishment didn't take seriously, performed unexpectedly well by running to the left of Hillary Clinton on economic issues. In the November election, Trump-another outsider, running as a right-wing populist-peeled off enough formerly Democratic voters, especially white working-class men, to win. It wasn't just that the Republicans flipped contested states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania; formerly competitive states, among them Florida, Iowa, and Ohio, now seemed to be moving permanently out of the Democrats' reach. Hacker describes the mood around that time this way: \"Trump gets elected. You can't understate this. People woke up. Nothing concentrates the mind as much as the prospect of losing your democracy. We lost the heartland.\"\n\nAfter a defeat, parties often rethink their strategies. The 2016 election was such an extreme shock to the Democrats that the rethinking had a special urgency. \"Sanders and Trump tapped into something,\" Elizabeth Wilkins noted. \"We had to speak to economic populism as we hadn't before.\" People who had expected to be working in a Hillary Clinton Administration \"spent a lot of time coming up with policy proposals because after 2016 they had nothing to do.\" There was an explicit focus on finding ways to address people's problems in their own communities-particularly in the places where the political tide had turned against Democrats. As Hacker put it, \"A lot of America had been devastated by trade and by inequality. You lose civic capital in places. It's one thing to compensate the losers. But, if you don't, it's a total fucking disaster.\"\n\nIn high-level policy circles, a number of Democrats took up efforts to reconnect with the working class and distanced themselves from past economic policies. Jake Sullivan, now Biden's national-security adviser, conducted a public self-examination after the 2016 election; he wrote an article in which he argued, \"The American electorate as a whole is moving to embrace a more energized form of government-one that tackles the excesses of the free market and takes on big, serious challenges through big, serious legislation.\" Even before 2016, John Podesta, another Clinton-Obama veteran now back in the White House, had co-founded a think tank called the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.\n\nThe argument that the Democratic Party can win by moving to the center is a staple of op-ed pages, and it seems to be shaping the Harris campaign. But inside the political world the economic left had earned significant clout by proving that it could produce new policy ideas and win votes. In 2020, Sanders ran another spirited Presidential campaign, and his reward for dropping out of the race and endorsing Biden was the creation of two Unity Task Forces, one populated with some of his supporters and the other with some of Biden's. Senator Elizabeth Warren's Presidential campaign had ended earlier, but the broad array of policy proposals that she put forth, generated by a network of young lawyers she had cultivated over the years, gave her a great deal of influence, too. The Unity Task Forces jointly released a hundred-and-ten-page set of potential policies in July, 2020. Biden didn't wind up trying to enact everything in this document, but just about everything he has proposed is in there somewhere.\n\nAlso in July, 2020, Biden made a few economic-policy speeches that clearly signalled his retreat from neoliberalism-one on reviving American manufacturing, one on climate and infrastructure, one on racial economic equity, and one on the \"care economy.\" There was, at the time, a sense of forces within the Democratic Party and external events converging to yield a new political consensus. The COVID pandemic, and the high level of alarm about Trump throughout the Party, meant that the Biden Administration was coming to power during a dire national emergency. No prominent Democrats were arguing that it was a time for the government to exercise restraint. As one member of a rising generation of activists, who ended up working in the Biden White House, put it, \"It's not clear that there's a neoliberalism to go back to.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nOne feature of this post-neoliberal period is that super-ambitious, impeccably credentialled Administration officials now feel the need to demonstrate that they have not become clueless creatures of the coastal élite. Jake Sullivan's wife, Maggie Goodlander, another former White House official, is currently running for Congress to represent a district in northern New Hampshire, and if she wins he would presumably join her there. Buttigieg has moved to Traverse City, Michigan, the home town of his husband, Chasten Glezman Buttigieg.\n\nOver the summer, I visited Brian Deese, another high-ranking official in the Obama and Biden Administrations, in his new home town, Portland, Maine. During the Obama era, Deese, a onetime aide of Larry Summers, was seen as a neoliberal; during the Trump years, he worked for BlackRock. Biden appointed Deese, then in his early forties, as the director of the National Economic Council, a business-facing unit of the White House which Bill Clinton created. I met Deese-a slight, bearded, blue-eyed man who has the informal manner and the intensity of a Silicon Valley executive-at a new graduate school created to promote the development of tech companies in Maine. He gave me his version of the origins of Bidenomics: \"Two things were going on in the spring of 2020: Biden secured the nomination, and COVID . He did something that's unusual in politics. He shifted his policy vision to be more expansive. Usually, it's the other way around.\"\n\nThe result was the American Rescue Plan, a $1.8 trillion bill-more than double the size of Obama's stimulus legislation. It came only a year after Trump had signed a bill of equivalent size, in the early days of the pandemic, that was also meant to prevent a recession or a depression. And, indeed, the COVID recession was far shorter and less severe than the recession that followed the financial crisis. There were many items in the bill that signalled Biden's priorities beyond just getting through the worst of COVID . Nearly ninety billion dollars went toward increasing the child tax credit, eighty billion went to shoring up union pension funds, eighty-eight billion went to infrastructure projects, and three hundred and fifty billion went to state and local governments.\n\nThe rap on the rescue bill is that it set off several years of inflation-now finally under control-which made Biden's management of the economy widely unpopular. Jason Furman, who was Obama's last chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and now teaches at Harvard, has been a persistent public critic of the bill, especially for its provisions authorizing more than four hundred billion dollars in checks to be sent to families with annual incomes of less than seventy-five thousand dollars. \"Nobody could defend it as the right policy,\" Furman told me. \"The idea of sending people two-thousand-dollar checks was invented by Trump.\" (Economists prefer tax credits.) \"Nancy Pelosi and Biden adopted them to troll the Republicans and to win the Senate races in Georgia. People already had money in the bank because they couldn't buy anything,\" with stores closed and supplies short, on account of the pandemic. So the price of everything rose.\n\nBy that time, it was clear that more traditional economic voices like Furman's would not be dominant in Biden's White House. On economic policy, most of the people who served under Clinton and Obama had been, as Furman put it, \"Robert Rubin\"-a former head of Goldman Sachs and the first director of the National Economic Council-\"and his children and grandchildren,\" figuratively speaking. (He's one of the grandchildren.) But the ferment of the years after the financial crisis had produced a new talent pool, associated especially with Elizabeth Warren. Former aides and allies of Warren's, and former staff members at think tanks like the Economic Policy Institute, wound up on the Council of Economic Advisers, working for Deese at the National Economic Council, or at many of the federal regulatory agencies. Jobs that customarily had gone to economists, who are predisposed to trust in markets, went instead to lawyers (like Deese), who are trained to focus on rules and institutions.\n\nI asked Deese whether he considers himself a repentant former neoliberal. He wasn't willing to agree to that, but he did say that some of the ideas he was charged with implementing in the Biden Administration would not have been given serious consideration under Obama. \"If you had said to me in 2010 that I would be supervising industrial strategy, I would have said, 'That's crazy. Nobody would listen,' \" Deese told me. \"If you wanted to say 'industrial strategy,' you couldn't. It was 'picking winners.' \"\n\nDeese said that his perspective changed when he was in the Obama White House, working to keep General Motors and Chrysler in business during the financial crisis. \"That made me see the potential for government to shape the economy,\" he said. \"I gained a deeper and more ground-level sense of what it meant to have economic capacity and why it's essential. Those ideas were made super real for me by seeing an industry in free fall. We have intervened time and again in the auto industry, including in the Reagan Administration. Saying we don't do that is a wrong description of what we've done as a country.\"\n\nThe Biden Administration passed three more colossal bills in 2021 and 2022: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ($1.2 trillion), the CHIPS and Science Act ($280 billion), and the Inflation Reduction Act (originally estimated at $380 billion, now thought to have an actual cost of more than $800 billion). Together, these laws have hundreds of provisions. But, broadly speaking, the first is intended to fund bridges, roads, harbors, and other building projects; the second brings semiconductor production back to the United States; and the third finances the transition to non-carbon-producing energy sources. In our conversation, Deese argued that the three initiatives should be thought of as one big legislative package. They share the same goal: to rebuild and redirect the industrial capacity of the United States. \"We don't just want the economy to grow,\" Heather Boushey, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said. \"Growing from the middle out means that what we make and how we make it matters.\"\n\nThat idea animates many other things the Biden Administration has done (and one thing it hasn't done: negotiate any new trade agreements). In addition to passing legislation, the White House has issued a number of significant executive orders. Probably the most important came in July, 2021-an order on competition which stands as the strongest Presidential statement on monopoly and antitrust in American history. Biden also filled the country's regulatory agencies with appointees from the economic left of the Party. The best known of these is Lina Khan, of the Federal Trade Commission, but similar appointees are running the Justice Department's antitrust division, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and all the environmental agencies. The Obama Administration opened an antitrust investigation of Google and then dropped it. The Biden Administration sued Google and won. Obama, after recruiting Elizabeth Warren to design the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, rejected her request to be nominated as its initial director. Biden appointed to the position Rohit Chopra, one of Warren's aides from those days.\n\nThen there are parts of the government that are practically unknown to the outside world-Biden remade many of those, too. One example is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which Clinton established in the first year of his Presidency, to reduce the number of federal regulations. Obama's head of the O.I.R.A. was Cass Sunstein, a law professor and the co-author, with the behavioral economist Richard Thaler, of the book \"Nudge.\" That selection was a gesture in the direction of light-touch regulation. Biden reversed course by putting K. Sabeel Rahman, a Warren ally, in the job, and approving a new way for the government to calculate the cost-benefit ratio of initiatives, giving more weight to social benefits. Such considerations are embedded in the Biden legislation. The CHIPS Act allowed the government to mandate company-paid child care for the workers in the new factories it's financing, and for the construction workers building them, too. Forty per cent of federally backed climate investments are required to be made in disadvantaged communities. \"We were trying to fuse the realities of race and other structural inequities with economics,\" Rahman told me. \"Some people say, 'Just talk about the economics of it.' But we were trying to put these economic programs together in a way that would actually address structural inequalities.\"\n\nBiden's most dramatic departure from past Democratic policy might be on climate change. For decades, incentive systems have been the dominant idea for reducing carbon emissions. Leah Stokes, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who's also a prominent climate activist, said, \"It's wildly unpopular to make fossil fuels more expensive. You put up the cost of everything.\" The Obama Administration's major climate initiative was based on cap-and-trade, which allows companies to buy and sell emission allowances. The proposal never came to a vote in the Senate, and Biden wound up abandoning these ideas entirely. John Podesta, who's now responsible for climate policy in the White House, said that any Biden proposal \"had to be politically viable, and to show a path forward for American workers. So we flipped the politics of it-shifted from 'What do we need to shut down?' to 'What do we need to build?' \"\n\nThe way this played out was determined in the summer of 2022. The American Rescue Plan had passed quickly, though with no Republican votes, and the infrastructure bill had followed, but another four trillion dollars in Biden proposals remained. Most of it was divided into two parts, called the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan. The Democratic House passed a bill combining the two, called Build Back Better, but it died in the Senate. The senator with the key vote, Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, made it clear that he opposed the American Families Plan-which included child care, paid family leave, and free community college-because he considered it to be a series of handouts. But he opened negotiations on the American Jobs Plan, which was devoted mainly to business-friendly, globalization-skeptical clean-energy provisions. It was eventually renamed (actually, misnamed) the Inflation Reduction Act and passed that August. \"It came together, and we were able to get it over the finish line,\" Deese said.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act heavily bears Manchin's stamp. At its core are generous tax credits to businesses, mostly but not entirely in clean energy, and West Virginia will do very well. Once you get past understanding it simply as a landmark piece of climate legislation, the act is a large, unkempt thing. With the exception of a couple of relatively minor provisions, it penalizes no one for anything. Some of its provisions will benefit fossil-fuel companies. More than eighty per cent of its projects are being built in Republican districts-partly because they have more empty land and looser regulatory environments. (Conversely, around the country, feuds have broken out between environmentalists who want to push the clean-energy revolution forward and environmentalists who are opposed to, say, establishing mines to extract the minerals used in electric-vehicle batteries.) The projects have been rolling out slowly. One reason that the law will cost so much more than was estimated when it passed is that some of its subsidies come in the form of uncapped tax credits-anybody below a fairly generous income ceiling who wants a seventy-five-hundred-dollar tax credit for buying an electric vehicle can have one, and the credits can't be applied to cheaper Chinese E.V.s, because of the Administration's ethic of \"build American, buy American.\" European allies are upset because the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits are so generous that they are enticing businesses in their own countries to build new factories in the United States.\n\nThe White House says that, by the end of this decade, the bill will reduce carbon emissions from 2005 levels by forty per cent, and that it has created three hundred thousand new jobs across more than three hundred projects. Deese told me that more than five per cent of all new investments in the United States are now being made in clean energy, up from about one per cent in 2018, because of how powerfully the Inflation Reduction Act's tax incentives change the economic calculus for private companies.\n\nBack in the New Deal days, the Democrats were straightforwardly the party of labor, and the Republicans were the party of business. That simple division became much more complicated in the nineties. The Biden Administration showed its loyalties by doing a lot for at least some businesses, and for labor, and for all its other major constituencies and hoped-for constituencies. Whether that approach is sustainable, especially with Biden gone, is another question.\n\nKamala Harris hasn't spent a lot of time on the campaign trail visiting Biden Administration-funded infrastructure projects. That duty falls primarily to her former rival in the 2020 Presidential campaign, Pete Buttigieg. He is the public face of the infrastructure bill, which got sixty-nine votes in the 50-50 Senate, partly because it's hard for politicians to oppose noncontroversial building projects in their districts. (By contrast, no Republicans voted for the Inflation Reduction Act.) Buttigieg has held public events at infrastructure sites in all fifty states. I spent the better part of a week touring the Midwest with him, visiting Administration-funded projects.\n\nIn Menominee, Michigan, we went to a small, privately owned port on Lake Michigan that often ships large wind turbines. It got a twenty-one-million-dollar grant, its first ever from the federal government, to deepen and upgrade its shipping channel. In Manitowoc, Wisconsin, a local malt company is applying for an infrastructure grant that would help it ship products from the city's small port. In Milwaukee, the port got nine million dollars in federal funds to help Wisconsin farmers send their crops through waterways to markets around the world. In Kokomo, Indiana, an auto manufacturer showed off facilities for its transition to producing electric vehicles, one of which has been awarded a two-hundred-and-fifty-million-dollar grant from the Department of Energy. In each of these cases, the project bundled multiple Biden goals: clean energy plus working with business plus unionization plus rebuilding the Midwest's industrial base.\n\nButtigieg-crewcut, trim (he's a triathlete), dressed in a dark-blue suit, a white shirt, and a tie-is very good at being the Midwestern boy who left and then decided to come home. He's polite, punctual, respectful, and fully briefed, scrubbed of all traces of the attitudes that Midwesterners find suspect in people from the coasts. At each stop, he found a way to mention his local roots and his military service in Afghanistan-but not the Republican-zinging appearances that he's been making on Fox News. On the south side of Milwaukee, Buttigieg met a group of farmers at a restaurant-mainly beefy guys with beards who, while they were waiting for him, chatted about the upcoming state fair. Buttigieg walked in at 7:45 A.M. and shook hands. \"Thanks for stayin' up late to see me,\" he said. (Farmers wake up well before dawn.) Then he sat down at a long table and spent an hour hearing from everybody. In the background, on a wall-mounted television with the sound turned off, an ad came on for Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin's more-popular-than-you'd-expect Democratic senator, pointing to her role in instituting price caps for inhalers. Buttigieg and the farmers talked about five-axle versus six-axle trucks, the economic potential of processed soy meal, and Port Milwaukee's ability to handle non-containerized cargo. A couple of times, Buttigieg tried gently to steer the conversation toward the larger themes of the Biden Administration, specifically climate change and antitrust efforts. The farmers were polite, but these issues obviously didn't resonate with them at the same level as immediate, practical matters. After the breakfast, Buttigieg went to the port for a public event, where, in front of a pair of enormous corrugated-metal silos and an \"Investing in America\" sign, flanked by local dignitaries, he told a small audience about the eight hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that the Administration had created.\n\nAfterward, Buttigieg and I met in an empty conference room in the port's office building, and I asked how he explains the long-running industrial decline that the Administration is working to reverse. \"I think in most accounts the familiar culprits are globalization and automation,\" he said. \"I would put it a little differently, though. More than anything, it was an unwillingness to invest in the kind of industrial policy and the kind of infrastructure development that made our original industrial economy possible.\" Brian Deese had made a similar point: industrial strategy is a venerable American tradition, going back to the days of the Erie Canal, one that was forgotten for a few decades, with terrible effects, and is now being revived. As Buttigieg said, Biden's economic policies recover \"some of the things we were wrong to walk away from, like industrial policy, support for labor unions, support for big investments in shared things like infrastructure.\"\n\nI asked Buttigieg whether he could offer a single rubric that would encompass all the Administration's economic policies. He said that he'd been thinking about this. \"What I landed on,\" he said, \"was the idea that we'll one day come to remember this as the Big Deal. There's the New Deal. There's the Square Deal\"-Teddy Roosevelt's name for his domestic programs. \"Now we've got the Big Deal, because in some ways its bigness is the defining factor.\" In infrastructure-building, at least, \"the prior examples were more one mode at a time. The interstate highway system was massive, but that was confined to highways. The transcontinental railroad was massive, but that was about one mode: railroads. The Big Deal is more multimodal.\"\n\nThat brings us back to the question of why the world hasn't thought to call the Administration's programs the Big Deal, or even to consider them a big deal. In Kokomo, I had another conversation with Buttigieg, in an empty classroom at a community college that trains people to work in electric-vehicle production, and I asked him about this. He gave the standard argument of Administration officials who are leading the implementation of the new economic programs: it will take a while for their political effects to arrive.\n\n\"Two things I think are going to happen in terms of political impact,\" Buttigieg said. \"They're totally separate and apart from 'Oh, you did the bridge, we're going to support you now.' I don't just mean project-level political impact. The two things I would point to are more subtle, but I think very powerful. One of them is public trust. If you look-as we often do as Americans on the left and center left-to the Nordic countries, one of the things you find there is a high level of confidence that the system is fair, partly because they use tax revenue to deliver services that people appreciate. And so you have a higher level of social and political trust, because things are delivered. There's a virtuous cycle where, if people see something for their tax dollars, they're more likely to be confident that they can and should support public things with their tax dollars.\"\n\nHe went on, \"The other is when you reduce inequality, and especially when you reduce inequality across social lines, like racial wealth gaps, that is conducive to a better political environment for everybody. Tony Judt, in 'Ill Fares the Land,' put forward some data showing that, even on the same average income, the society with more inequality will have worse public-health outcomes, more violence, you name it. So, for example, the data we've seen on the reduction in the racial wealth gap between 2019 and 2022 is really important. I'm not saying that a voter consciously gives the elected official who engineered that credit twenty years down the line, but I do think it just creates a better environment for all of our political processes to play out.\"\n\nIf you squint, you can see the outlines of a new post-neoliberal Democratic coalition. Fast-growing clean-energy industries-wind, solar, batteries, hydrogen, electric vehicles-could join Hollywood and Silicon Valley in supporting the Democratic Party. Purple-tinted states, such as Georgia and Arizona, which are getting lots of clean-energy projects (Georgia is in the \"battery belt,\" Arizona in the \"hydrogen belt\"), could turn bluer. (The Biden Administration even has plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars reviving the steel industry in J. D. Vance's home town of Middletown, Ohio.) The Administration's insistence on union labor in its building projects could begin to reverse the long decline of private-sector unionization. (The national rate is currently six per cent, down from about a third in the fifties.) A more successful push for the policies that were part of the American Families Plan could bolster not just family incomes but also the care industry and its employees' unions. All these policies would help Black and Latino families, and so might shore up their wobbling loyalty to the Democratic Party.\n\nLink copied\n\nHere's a specific example of the way Democrats are hoping things work out politically. On January 23, 2017, the first full workday of the Trump Administration, Sean McGarvey, the president of North America's Building Trades Unions-a muscular, heavily male zone of the labor movement which the Republican Party has been wooing intermittently for decades-stood in front of the White House, at the head of a platoon of union leaders and members in the construction industry, and made a brief, exuberant public statement: \"We just had probably the most incredible meeting of our careers with the President, and the Vice-President, and the senior staff. . . . The respect that the President of the United States showed us-and when he shows it to us he shows it to three million of our members across the United States-was nothing short of incredible.\" Five years later, McGarvey took the podium at a convention of the building-trades unions and offered up half an hour of ardent love for the Biden Administration. I asked McGarvey what happened. Trump, McGarvey said, \"never did anything he said he was going to do. He never did infrastructure. His National Labor Relations Board was laden with anti-labor ideologues. He never did pensions. Pretty much you name it. That first meeting was all the things he was going to do. And then we had four years of a knife fight in a phone booth.\" The Biden Administration, by contrast, had \"delivered every possible thing we could ever possibly ask for or imagine. There have been things they did for us that we wouldn't have had the chutzpah to ask for.\" Partly because of the Administration's projects, the building-trades unions have added fifty thousand new members in the past year-their most significant growth since the fifties.\n\nIn the view of the designers of Bidenomics, this kind of shift would be just the beginning, because, once you put into place the idea of the government remaking the economy, policy and politics will begin to operate together in a continuous self-reinforcing loop. But that's far closer to being a hope than a certainty.\n\nWhere we are now, near the conclusion of the 2024 campaign, is profoundly strange. People love to complain that politics organizes itself around perception, not reality. Here's the reality: one party, the G.O.P., ditched its establishment, embraced a form of economic nationalism and populism, and surprised everybody by winning a Presidential election. This wasn't just a freak event; versions of the same thing happened around the world. In the United States, the Trump Administration, once it was in power, mostly pursued not what it ran on but an old-fashioned Republican program of tax cuts and deregulation. Meanwhile, the Democrats began competing for the voters Trump had attracted, and, after this helped lead to a victory in 2020, they enacted an ambitious program aimed at the economic lives of working- and middle-class Americans. And still, outside a limited cadre of activists and policymakers, none of this is the dominant narrative of American politics. Another complaint that people make about politicians is that they are all talk, no action. With Biden, on these issues, it has been almost the opposite: lots of action, very little talk. As Harris's campaign wore on, she began speaking more about economic issues, especially during her visits to Midwestern states, but her language has been quite different from that of other Biden officials. If Biden's actual economic policies were the main topic of the campaign, perhaps the outcome of the election would determine their future. Their absence from the election makes their fate more of a mystery.\n\nIf Harris wins, will she stay the course that Biden has set? Biden hasn't been articulate enough lately to lay out his economic vision, and Harris's instinct is to present all her ideas, including economic proposals, in specific, tangible, personal terms. Rohini Kosoglu, a former policy director for Harris, told me, \"Sometimes she tells people who work for her to imagine going to someone's wedding and then being invited to their house and seeing the wedding album on a table. If you open it, what are you going to be looking for? A picture of yourself at the wedding. The American people want to know that we see them when we think through our policy.\" Harris's earliest economic proposal, a ban on price gouging in supermarkets, meets the wedding-album test-you can see yourself in the policy-but nobody thinks of it as a major economic reimagining. Her economic background and Biden's bear little resemblance. He comes from a downwardly mobile family who had to relocate to the declining blue-collar city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and who lost everything after the Second World War. Her parents were upwardly mobile immigrants, and her home ground is the booming, innovation-celebrating Bay Area. People who work with Biden say that he has an instinctive mistrust of economists, especially those from élite universities. Harris is the daughter of successful academics; her father is an economist who worked for years at an élite university.\n\nHarris's career has not centered on economic issues, as Sanders's and Warren's have, and she has strong ties to Silicon Valley, which is skeptical of Biden's economic policies, especially on antitrust, trade, and unions. (Her brother-in-law Tony West is a senior executive at Uber, now on leave to work on the campaign.) Economically oriented Democratic policymakers have been obsessively parsing her every move for clues about how post-neoliberal she will or won't be. Having become the nominee much later than Biden did in 2020, she hasn't had time to set a full policy agenda or to create a cadre of future officials for her Administration. Gene Sperling has left the White House and joined her campaign full time-but Karen Dunn, the lead lawyer for Google in one of the Administration's lawsuits against the company, was on the small team that prepared her for her debate with Trump. Harris frequently says that she wants to create an \"opportunity economy,\" which isn't language that post-neoliberals would use-they'd prefer \"shared prosperity.\" She has ratcheted down a Biden proposal on capital gains and corporate taxes, to lower the rates, and she has been notably silent on the activities of regulatory agencies, such as the S.E.C. and the F.T.C., that are intensely unpopular with business. Warren, in an interview on a Boston radio station back in January, declined to say whether she thought Biden should renominate Harris as his running mate; it seems unlikely that Harris would use Warren as an informal personnel director the way that Biden has. On the other hand, Harris is obviously enthusiastic about care-oriented policies like the child tax credit and paid family medical leave. She gives no hint of being a limited-government person on principle.\n\nHarris rarely talks about antitrust, or industrial policy, or trade, or the larger idea that the government should actively structure the market economy. Because these are rather technical issues, she can promise to help the middle class without being very specific. In the debate, she was vague about her economic plans, but she took pains to mention that Goldman Sachs, the Wharton School, and many prominent economists prefer her plans to Trump's. That wasn't a very Bidenesque message. In Harris's first major economic address as the Democratic nominee, in North Carolina in August, she attacked Trump for levying tariffs that would \"in effect\" raise taxes on the middle class. This seemed to imply that she accepts the standard view of economists that tariffs are taxes and are a bad idea. But Biden has imposed heavy tariffs on, for example, Chinese electric vehicles. (As Buttigieg put it in one of our conversations, \"There is a legitimate national interest in insuring that these programs create American jobs, even if that interest is not free of charge.\") Will Harris keep these tariffs? Will she retain Lina Khan, the bête noire of the Democratic donor class, at the F.T.C.? Did Harris's one anodyne line about unions in her first speech-\"you should be able to join a union if you choose\"-signal a loosening of Biden's intimate embrace of organized labor?\n\nIf Trump wins, will he dismantle Bidenomics? Maybe not, or not entirely. Trillions of dollars' worth of tax cuts that Trump passed during his Presidential term will expire at the end of next year. If Trump gets another term, he will likely try to extend them, and that will constrict what the government can do. But Biden's major legislation is designed to be difficult to repeal. The money is legally committed, and there are quiet efforts under way to speed up the slow pace of project launches, and to make project cancellations legally difficult, in order to Trump-proof the Biden program. Because so much of the spending is going toward the kinds of projects that elected officials love, and is in Republican-held political territory, and is aimed at the voters Trump claims to represent, it's meant to be difficult for Republicans to abandon.\n\nAlso, underneath the bluster, threats, and theatrics, Trump is running on an economic program that would have been unimaginable coming from any previous Republican nominee, including him. He is now officially devoted to preserving Obamacare, which he spent his previous term trying to overturn. He has promised not to cut Medicare, to increase Social Security by making its benefits tax-free, and to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay. He wants to impose new tariffs that would be much larger than the ones he put in place when he was President. J. D. Vance has proposed more than doubling the child tax credit, to five thousand dollars, a move that would cost trillions. The most vulnerable of the major Biden bills is the Inflation Reduction Act, but Trump has stopped short of promising to repeal it. Its largest provision is a subsidy for domestically produced electric vehicles, and one of Trump's richest and most vocal supporters is the leading manufacturer of them, Elon Musk. Consistency has never been Trump's hallmark.\n\nA great deal depends not just on who is elected President but on whom that person puts in key economic positions, and on the results of the House and Senate elections. A divided Congress and a sense that the country isn't immediately in crisis would not make for favorable weather for major changes. Still, American politics feels very different from the way it did at the turn of the millennium-we have been through the political version of climate change. In his 1996 State of the Union Address, Clinton declared, \"The era of big government is over.\" Inside the daily chaos of politics, there seems to be a new invisible foundation: the era of the era of big government being over is over. Both parties have accepted the premise that the government has failed voters without a college degree, especially in the middle of the country, and both are actively wooing them-partly because they determine the balance of power in American politics. (That's why Trump and Harris chose the running mates they did.) Both accept that the wrong to these voters was done through excessive faith in unfettered markets. That faith isn't miraculously going to reappear as the controlling principle of American politics anytime soon, but that hardly leaves matters settled. The parties have radically different ideas-different in substance, different in values, different in methods, maybe also different in sincerity-about how to achieve what they present as the same goal. The question that will dominate the years to come is whose version of the new, enlarged role of government will prevail. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why Robert Hur Called Biden an \"Elderly Man with a Poor Memory\"\n\nWhen I first approached Robert Hur for an interview, soon after his appointment as special counsel, fourteen months ago, he demurred, saying, \"I'm boring.\" Then his circumstances changed. When we finally met, he pulled up in an armored black government S.U.V., accompanied by two U.S. marshals. Hur had completed his report on whether President Joe Biden had mishandled classified documents-he had declined to prosecute Biden but had impugned the President's memory in the process-and members of both parties were furious. \"I knew it was going to be unpleasant,\" he told me this past week, \"but the level of vitriol-it's hard to know exactly how intense that's going to be until the rotten fruit is being thrown at you.\"\n\nHur's report stated that his investigation \"uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice-presidency when he was a private citizen.\" Yet Hur concluded that \"the evidence does not establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" He reasoned that \"at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" In Hur's view, \"it would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him-by then a former president well into his eighties-of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.\"\n\nThe report was designated confidential, but the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, had already promised to make as much as possible of it public. When he did so, on February 8th, Biden immediately held a press conference, which turned chaotic. Reporters yelled over each other, and Biden pushed back on Hur's characterization of him, saying, \"I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing.\" The President was particularly incensed by Hur's claim that he did not recall what year his son Beau had died: \"How in the hell dare he raise that.\" Afterward, the White House continued to fight back, calling the references to the President's memory \"unnecessary, inflammatory, and prejudicial statements\" that are \"unsupported personal opinion criticism on uncharged conduct that is outside the Special Counsel's expertise and remit.\" (The Justice Department immediately defended Hur's report as entirely consistent with legal requirements and Department policies.)\n\nThis past week, during a four-hour hearing in Congress, lawmakers from both political parties rebuked Hur. Republicans accused him of going easy on the President by not charging him despite the evidence of criminality; Democrats alleged that, because Hur could not indict the President, he had set out to hurt Biden politically. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, claimed that Hur had deliberately played \"into the Republicans' narrative that the President is unfit for office because he is senile.\"\n\nDuring his time as special counsel, Hur refused to speak to the press, but, shortly after he gave his congressional testimony, we sat down for a conversation, in which we spoke about his approach to prosecution, his commitment to the United States as the son of Korean immigrants, and why he took the special-counsel job. As we delved into how he wrote the report-and I shared some of my own concerns about his approach-it became clear to me that we were talking across something of a disconnect, between what the public needs from a special counsel and how a well-trained Justice Department prosecutor conceives of the role.\n\nFrom the beginning, the investigation into President Biden has been double-edged: it was always about both Biden and Donald Trump. In September, 2022, after the F.B.I. found that Trump had taken boxes of classified documents from the White House and stored them at Mar-a-Lago, Biden called Trump's conduct \"totally irresponsible.\" Two months later-shortly before the special counsel Jack Smith was appointed to investigate Trump's alleged election interference and retention of classified documents-Biden's lawyers alerted the government that boxes of materials from the Obama Administration had been found at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank where Biden spent time after his Vice-Presidency. The boxes contained some classified documents, and subsequent searches found more, at Biden's Wilmington home and at the University of Delaware. In January, 2023, without informing the President, Garland appointed Robert Hur to investigate Biden's retention of classified documents.\n\nAccording to Justice Department regulations, a special counsel must be a lawyer selected from outside the federal government \"with a reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking\" and \"appropriate experience.\" Hur was an obvious choice. At fifty-one, he had spent a total of fifteen years at the Justice Department, including roles as the top aide to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein-which involved work on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election-and as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland. Hur, a registered Republican, was nominated to the U.S. Attorney role by Trump (and confirmed unanimously by the Senate), but he insists that he does not have a partisan mind-set. \"I'm just doing the work,\" he told me. \"I don't have a particular ideology or crusade that I'm trying to go after.\" When news broke of his appointment as special counsel, many of his friends, Democrats and Republicans alike, were supportive but said it was a little crazy to take such a thankless job. It was guaranteed that \"this part of the country, or that part of the country,\" he said, raising his arms to shape the two swaths, would be angry with him.\n\nI asked Hur why he accepted the appointment. He explained that much of it had to do with his family's history. His mother's family fled from North Korea to South Korea shortly before the Korean War. Hur's parents arrived in the U.S. in the early seventies, and he was born soon after. His father, now retired, was an anesthesiologist, and his mother, who trained as a nurse, managed her husband's medical practice. \"I know that my parents' lives and my life would have been very, very different if it were not for this country and American soldiers in Korea during the Korean War,\" Hur said. \"There is a real debt that my family and I have to this country. And in my view, if you're in a position where the Attorney General of the United States says there is a need for someone to do a particularly unpleasant task, if it's something that you can do, ethically and consistent with your own moral compass, then you should do it.\"\n\nHur grew up in the Los Angeles area, where he attended Harvard School for Boys (now a coed school called Harvard-Westlake). He recalled that the actor Tori Spelling was at the sister school: \"There were lots of Hollywood people. I felt very much an outsider from all of that because of my strict Korean upbringing.\" He explained, \"It was quite stern. Excellence was expected. Fun was severely optional.\" He played piano and violin. \"I played drums, too, for a while,\" he said, \"because that was my form of rebellion.\"\n\nHur went to Harvard for college, where, he said, he was \"regularly floored by how effortlessly classmates of mine could become fluent in things that took me quite a while to get on top of.\" He continued, \"I've never been the person whom people look at and say, 'That person is a rare generational brain.' But I'm going to work harder and grind it out.\" He started out studying premed but was \"weeded out\" by a course in organic chemistry. He went on to study English, and wrote a thesis that was \"an ethical analysis of William Faulkner's 'Absalom, Absalom!' \" Hur traces his interest in literature to his high-school English teachers, who included the journalist Caitlin Flanagan. Flanagan remembers Hur, too-she recently chided him on \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" saying, \"As I taught Robert and so many students fortunate enough to benefit from my tutelage, when writing, the most important thing in an essay is we keep related ideas together.\" She continued, to big laughs from the studio audience, \"Robert, the assignment is 'Should criminal charges be issued for this thing?,' not 'Can you give us an armchair neurological report of the man you're investigating?' \"\n\nContrary to the stoic persona he displayed at the congressional hearing, Hur is lively and humorous in person. But I couldn't help but connect his self-described fun-optional upbringing-and the unspoken pressures of being the first nonwhite person in this very prominent job-with his insistence that his work as a prosecutor is plodding and not creative. \"I view it almost like an engineering task or a construction task. I am building a case,\" he told me. \"There are planks and nails and hammers. How does this thing get built with the requisite solidity and seaworthiness that it actually will hold up?\" His goal, as special counsel, was to call as little attention to his work as he could. He resigned before his congressional testimony, he explained, simply because his predecessors had. \"Look, if Mueller did it this way, then there must be some reasons,\" Hur said. \"I don't want to make history here.\"\n\nHur's report was refreshingly blunt and direct, but it still led to misunderstandings. The White House and Democrats have managed to spin his conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to convict Biden as something separate from his observations about memory and forgetting. Republicans who wanted Biden to be charged are similarly motivated to see the two issues as distinct, so that they can depict him as both criminal and senile. But the failing-memory issue was not extraneous to the evidence in this criminal matter; indeed, it was integral to Hur's decision to not recommend indicting Biden. Hur concluded that the evidence is not sufficient to convict Biden in large part because of his memory.\n\nThe federal crime for which Biden was being investigated makes it a felony for a person who has \"unauthorized possession\" of a document \"relating to the national defense\" to \"willfully retain\" it. After Biden left the Vice-Presidency, in 2017, he was no longer authorized to possess classified documents. Hur found-and Biden has not disputed-that Biden did possess them, at his home and offices. The only open question in this investigation was whether his retention of the documents was \"willful.\" The answer would have been a clear, easy, and resounding \"no\" if Biden was unaware that classified documents were in his home or office, or if he discovered them and promptly reported their presence. The trouble is that Hur's evidence included an interview recorded in 2017, in which Biden told a ghostwriter, \"I just found all the classified stuff downstairs.\" Hur also found, on recordings, that Biden read aloud classified information from a notebook to the ghostwriter \"on at least three occasions.\"\n\nGiven these findings, one has to wonder why Hur didn't charge Biden. Based on my reading of Hur's report and conversations with him, the answer is that Hur believed that Biden-who certainly knew that he possessed classified documents in 2017-may have forgotten about them. The report points to where some documents were found: \"in a badly damaged box in the garage, near a collapsed dog crate, a dog bed, a Zappos box, an empty bucket,\" and so on. This, the report notes, \"does not look like a place where a person intentionally stores what he supposedly considers to be important classified documents, critical to his legacy.\"\n\nThen there are Hur's observations that Biden's \"memory was significantly limited\"-that, in interviews with Hur and the ghostwriter, he displayed \"limited precision and recall.\" After reading the transcript of Hur's interview with Biden, many Democrats noted with relief that the President remembered a lot: from the details of a home renovation to a 2011 visit to Mongolia. Reading the transcript, I was at first surprised that his attorneys had let him ramble to that extent-having represented clients in interviews with federal prosecutors, I wanted to bury my head in my hands. At one point, Hur even said to Biden, \"Sir, I'd love-I would love, love-to hear much more about this, but I do have a few more questions to get through.\" But I eventually surmised that Biden's lawyers had been right to allow him to make the impression of a highly likable man with diverting stories and fuzzily selective recall. My impression, from examining the evidence of his conduct regarding the classified documents, is that Biden came uncomfortably close to being indicted. Hur's most damning words-that a jury would perceive the President as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" and thus be unlikely to convict-seem to have saved him from that outcome.\n\nIn Congress, Hur defended his report's discussion of Biden's memory by saying, \"I had to show my work.\" In our conversation, I suggested to Hur that he might have been able to avoid some misunderstandings if he had shown his work even more. Hur's report rolled the prosecution case and the defense case together into a realism-oriented prediction of what an eventual jury could conclude-that \"the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" I proposed that he might instead have laid out, step-by-step, as one would for a law student, how the evidence he found went to each element of the crime, including the key element of willfulness. He might then have drilled down on how the defense-which had already emphasized to Hur that Biden forgot about the classified documents-could successfully undermine proof of willfulness with arguments about Biden's memory, bolstered by his likely demeanor at a trial years from now. Hur told me, \"I didn't write it for law students. I didn't write it for the lay public, and I didn't write it for Congress. I wrote it for the Attorney General of the United States, who himself was an experienced prosecutor.\" Hur was aware that Garland had said he was \"committed to making as much of his report public as possible, consistent with legal requirements and Department policy.\" But Hur insisted that his audience was still Garland alone, citing a regulation which states that the special counsel should prepare a confidential report for the Attorney General.\n\nA confidential report that everyone understands will become public seems like a paradox, but it reflects the long-standing norms and blinkered training of people who do the job of special counsel. Hur worked the case like he would any other criminal investigation, and he wrote his report in the way he would have written many memos as a federal prosecutor. But the potential defendant he was investigating was the President of the United States. At the hearing in Congress, Hur refused to \"engage in hypotheticals,\" but he has previously prosecuted people for the same crime, including an N.S.A. employee who kept classified documents in his home and was convicted and sentenced to more than five years in prison. Hur's decision not to charge Biden was based on the view that he could not realistically persuade a jury to convict not just any defendant but this particular President. The job was inevitably special. And its special obligation-to undertake a federal investigation of the boss who oversees the Justice Department, an inherent conflict of interest, while maintaining public trust-can come into conflict with the D.O.J.-molded circumspection that characterizes special counsels and certainly came through in my interview with Hur.\n\nThe White House has attacked Hur's report with the goal of winning the Presidential election-but, in doing so, may have put Biden at greater risk of prosecution in a future Trump Administration. The more Democrats insist that Biden is in fact sharp as a tack, the more they suggest that he may have been guilty of \"willfully\" retaining classified documents that he knew he wasn't authorized to have. And, conversely, the more Republicans insist that Biden is \"senile\"-though Hur never used that word, nor the word \"unfit\"-the less likely he is to have willfully retained the documents. For both parties, the political and legal risks point in opposite directions.\n\nBiden and Trump, however, are in certain respects aligned in their legal defenses. In his report, Hur appeared to think that jurors would be convinced that Biden sincerely believed his notebooks containing classified information were his personal property. (In the interview, Biden noted that Ronald Reagan kept diaries containing classified information in his home after leaving the Presidency, without having been investigated or required to return them.) Trump has also claimed that classified documents he retained were his personal property, and the parts of Hur's report that seem lenient toward Biden's \"my property\" notion may throw a bit of a lifeline to Trump's defense. Indeed, it wouldn't be outlandish for Trump's defense attorneys to subpoena Biden to testify as to his belief that he was entitled to keep notebooks containing classified information. (As a matter of law, there is no relevant distinction between notebooks containing classified information and documents that are marked classified.)\n\nHur declining to prosecute Biden has another implication for Trump's defense. At trial, Trump's attorneys may well be able to present him, too, as an old man with mental impairments that undermine the prosecution's proof of willfulness. Trump is only a few years younger than Biden-and, in 2017, a broad perception that Trump suffered from mental deterioration led Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman and former constitutional-law professor, from Maryland, to propose establishing a body to determine that the President was unfit for office. (At this month's hearing on Hur's report, Raskin rebuked Republican colleagues for \"being amateur memory specialists giving us their drive-by diagnoses of the President of the United States.\") If Jack Smith's case against Trump goes to trial, it would be surprising if Trump's attorneys didn't raise his impairment in his defense, especially now that we have the Justice Department precedent of declining to prosecute an elderly President based on what a jury would likely think of his memory. Smith would probably insist that Trump's mind and memory are just fine. There may be uncomfortable moments for Biden if the Trump case goes to trial, with the Justice Department all but claiming that Trump's mental faculties are superior to Biden's.\n\nHur's conclusion, as spelled out in his report, was ultimately not that Biden's memory is actually failing (or abnormal for a man his age). It was, rather, a trial lawyer's assessment that a jury, with persuasion from defense lawyers, might not be able to rule out that Biden just forgot he had the documents. But that imagined jury has a lot in common with us as voters, distressed about our choices and concerned about the candidates' age. Biden in particular is perceived even by a majority of Democrats as too old to be President. Hur himself was tight-lipped about how the report resonated with the public. But, whether we are talking about Biden or Trump, Hur's report has forced us to contemplate voting for a candidate while believing that he is impaired enough to fall short of a \"willful\" mental state. Perhaps Hur, while doing a thankless public service, also offered a generational lament at our gerontocratic government. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "A Congressional Democrat Explains Why He's Standing with Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden's catastrophic debate performance two weeks ago, the Democratic Party has been arguing over his future, and whether he should step down as the Party's nominee. Biden had already been losing to Donald Trump even before then, and since that time his polls have gotten worse. Moreover, Biden's unwillingness to do White House press conferences, combined with the way he's limited unscripted appearances, has made many Democrats concerned that he is incapable of both beating Trump and governing the country effectively for four and a half more years.\n\nWhile most congressional Democrats have either remained silent or spoken only in generalities about what should happen now, the President has some vocal supporters on the Hill. One of them is Representative Robert Garcia, the first-term California Democrat, who has been outspoken in his backing of the President. Garcia and I recently spoke by phone. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed whether Garcia has any concerns about Biden's age, the White House's media strategy for the Presidential campaign, and whether Biden supporters are prioritizing loyalty over the chance to defeat Trump.\n\nRight after the debate, a lot of Democrats felt concerned, and a lot of them said that he needs to go out and show he can take the fight to Trump. How do you feel that's going, two weeks later?\n\nI think everyone agrees that it was a bad night, and I certainly think we have seen fighting Joe Biden since then. I think his remarks and his activity in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Wisconsin have been really strong, and it's been a fiery Joe Biden. If Donald Trump's going to punch at Joe Biden, I want Joe Biden to punch Donald Trump in the nose twice as hard, and I think we're seeing that, and I think we'll continue to see that.\n\nRight, he waited eight days to do an interview, and then did one with George Stephanopoulos, which people thought didn't go that great. He hasn't held a press conference. It doesn't seem like the White House is still interested in mounting a full Presidential campaign. Is there concern about that, at least?\n\nI think there's absolutely a focus on a full Presidential campaign. I mean, I think you've seen multiple events by the President. There's obviously the NATO press conference. The Vice-President has been all over the country, including Nevada. So I think they're very engaged in the campaign, and going out to all the constituencies and just reinforcing that Joe Biden is here to fight, and to fight hard, all the way through November.\n\nDo you have a sense of why he hasn't held a news conference in so long?\n\nI mean, I obviously don't know when he holds news conferences. I think he's holding a news conference at the NATO summit. And he's done a couple of interviews since, and, obviously, he does interviews all the time.\n\nI was just struck that the day after the debate he didn't have a news conference or do a round of interviews. It fits into concerns that I think people have had. There's been reporting that Biden aides say he's best between 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. He himself told a bunch of governors that he needs to make sure there's nothing scheduled so he can get his sleep after 8 P.M. Does that concern you at all?\n\nWell, in fact, I think my governor, Gavin Newsom, himself said publicly that he thought the President was actually making a joke when he said that. But, honestly, I don't know that it matters. I personally don't like doing a lot after 8 P.M .\n\nHe's the President though, right?\n\nThat's right. I'm also obviously a lot younger. I'm not concerned about when the President wants to do events or not. I think the proof is in the record. I think that the President has so much to show, whether that's health care or fighting for abortion rights and infrastructure. He's only been President now for three and a half years, and he's accomplished an enormous amount.\n\nWe saw the debate, and the reports I mentioned about his work abilities, and then pieces that have come out discussing European allies' concerns about his energy at summits. But you have no concern-not today, not tomorrow, not even January 19th, but three years from now-about Joe Biden being President when he's eighty-four?\n\nNo, I see that Joe Biden has had an incredible record the past three and a half years and-\n\nWhat about the next three and a half years?\n\nAnd I expect the same will happen for the next four years. The President of the United States has some of the best doctors and medical folks in the world surrounding him. I trust the White House, I trust the physicians and their assessments of the President. Look, the President himself has said and made jokes that yes, he's older, and, yes, he's a little slower. I think we're all aware of that. Also, with that age comes incredible wisdom, comes incredible experience-\n\nWisdom, you said?\n\nYeah, I said wisdom and experience. And I think we would not have the progress that we've made in the past four years had it not been for his incredible wisdom.\n\nThe American people overwhelmingly say in polling data that Joe Biden is too old to do the job. And, in fact, the polls I've seen lately suggest that around half of Democrats want him to step down as nominee, in large part because of his age. Where do you think the people who think this are going wrong?\n\nWell, first, I respect everyone's perspective and opinions, and I think that we have a diverse country and certainly a diverse party in which people are going to have different perspectives. My perspective is that Joe Biden is an experienced, accomplished person with a real record of results and he's made a great President and will continue to be a great President.\n\nDonald Trump is also, of course, not that much younger than Joe Biden is. We have two nominees who are a lot older, including one in Donald Trump, who also can't put together a sentence, can't speak at rallies, is literally a lunatic who wants to destroy the country. And I think it's important for us to focus on the fact that Donald Trump is an actual danger to the world and to our democracy.\n\nI didn't bring up Trump because I think you and I agree that he should remain very, very far from the White House, but, when you said that he \"also\" can't put together a sentence, you implied that Joe Biden can't put together a sentence, either. I do wonder whether the American people are also concerned, as you put it, that Biden can't put together a sentence . That just seems worrisome to me.\n\nI didn't say that Joe Biden can't put together a sentence.\n\nYou said Donald Trump \"also\" can't put together a sentence.\n\nNo. What I'm saying is that Donald Trump can't put together a sentence. Look, Joe Biden had a really tough day. He's older. We all know that. I also think we've seen Joe Biden deliver for the American people, over and over again, especially in the past few days. Trump is insane and crazy. This was always going to be a tough election. I remind folks this was a tough election before the debate.\n\nYeah, Biden was losing before the debate.\n\nBefore the debate.\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnd continues to be, and we've got to fight like hell.\n\nOne thing I've heard a bunch of Biden supporters say is, essentially, He's had our back and now we're going to have his. What do you think that phrase means?\n\nI've heard folks say that as well. I think part of what it means is that Joe Biden is someone with a long history of working with communities. Take a look at the support that he has within the Black community and the Congressional Black Caucus. It is intense, it's strong, it's real.\n\nHe's polling worse with African Americans than any Democratic Presidential candidate in modern history.\n\nWell, again, we were already looking at those numbers prior to the debate, and so I think that we have a lot of work to do in all communities of color. I think that's really important, but what I think is critical is that Joe Biden has built a relationship and a real record with a lot of communities, whether it's labor unions, whether it's the African American community, whether it's working-class folks.\n\nYour colleague Adam Smith said, \"The idea that we are going to slow-walk into fascism because we don't want to hurt somebody that we respect's feelings-I cannot even begin to tell you how angry that makes me.\" You said earlier that Joe Biden is important to various communities and that they feel loyalty to him. But the Smith comment is saying that loyalty is not what this should be about; what this should be about is beating Donald Trump. The idea that the calculation here should be anything other than how to beat Donald Trump is to misunderstand what a party is for, and what the Democrats are supposed to unite around.\n\nWell, there's absolutely a piece of the loyalty factor that people feel toward Joe Biden. Of course, people have loyalty in those relationships, but I think it's important to be crystal clear that people are supporting the President because they believe in him and they support the record. I mean, does the African American community feel loyalty to President Biden? Absolutely. But they also feel like he's the best President at this moment, has delivered the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice, and the first African American woman on a ticket. Loyalty will play a part, but I absolutely don't believe that loyalty is the overarching reason that people support the President.\n\nWhat do you think of Adam Smith's comment?\n\nWell, I disagree with Adam. I like Adam, by the way. He's a great colleague, and I have a good relationship with him. I respect him, and I respect that point of view. I just happen to have a different one.\n\nI think most Americans really can't imagine the person they saw at the debate being President four years from now. When I hear people like yourself, it almost seems like there's something strange going on, where people are just not facing up to reality.\n\nWell, first, I think the Democratic Party has had a wide-ranging debate and conversation. We are a big-tent party, and people are going to have different perspectives. I don't think we should be afraid of that. I think that what you're seeing right now, internally in Congress, is an overwhelming number of members of Congress and leadership, governors, mayors, and union leaders standing behind the Biden-Harris ticket. I'm hearing directly from folks who support the President and think that we've got to focus on beating Donald Trump. I think something you said earlier, that we can have a debate about Donald Trump and who'd be better-to me, there's no debate. Donald Trump is a madman, a conspiracy theorist, and a criminal.\n\nNo, I said I didn't think we needed to debate that, because we agree.\n\nO.K. I'm saying Joe Biden has beaten him before, and he's going to beat him again.\n\nSo you have no concerns that the Biden White House can execute this campaign forcefully and aggressively?\n\nI think the Biden White House has, since the debate and before the debate, and will continue to execute this campaign forcefully. I have encouraged them and will continue to fight as hard as possible to see the Joe Biden that we've seen in the last few days. That's the Joe Biden that we need to see every day to win. ♦\n\nWhy Bishop Mariann Budde wanted to speak to Donald Trump .\n\nLena Dunham's change of pace .\n\nTim Walz might run for President in 2028 if you ask him nicely .\n\nMaya Rudolph is ready to serve .\n\nSarah McBride wasn't looking for a fight on trans rights .\n\nThe liberated life of Colman Domingo .\n\nSupport The New Yorker's award-winning journalism.

      "text": "Did Joe Biden's ABC Interview Stanch the Bleeding or Prolong It?\n\nAt what point does political conviction curdle into something closer to denial? When I interviewed President Biden in January, I was struck most by the defiant confidence he had in himself: his dismissal of concerns about his age, his belief that he was \"the one\" to keep Donald Trump from regaining the Presidency, his rejection of warnings that he was behind in the polls. On Friday night, Biden sat down with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News. It was startling to hear the President make many of the same points again, as if the siege of the past eight days had barely registered.\n\nMoments into the conversation with Stephanopoulos, it became clear that Biden had a limited desire to take away any lessons from his debate with Trump on June 27th, which pummelled the confidence of Democrats and stirred frantic talk of replacing him on the ballot. \"Did you ever watch the debate afterward?\" Stephanopoulos asked.\n\n\"I don't think I did, no,\" Biden said. It was a casually astonishing reply. In 2012, when President Barack Obama flopped in his first debate against Mitt Romney, Obama's advisers arranged for him to sit through a tape of the spectacle, to grasp what his critics-and voters-had absorbed. This time, either Biden has not wanted to, or his advisers have not pressed him to.\n\nStephanopoulos wanted to know whether Biden understood, during the debate, how badly it was going, or, after, the impression it left on the Americans he had challenged to \"Watch me\" when judging his fitness for another four years in office. Biden replied by asking, in effect, for forgiveness: \"After that debate, I did ten major events in a row, including until two in the morning.\" He went on, \"Large crowds, overwhelming response, no slipping. And so, I just had a bad night.\" He chalked it up to exhaustion and a cold-a \"bad episode\" but not an indication of a \"serious condition.\"\n\nMost of Biden's responses in the interview were in that vein-a little meandering, demanding of recognition, presented far more lucidly than he had managed on the debate stage, but not with the kind of nimble, commanding presence that would silence the chorus of Democrats who want him to step aside. If it has come to be accepted that the eighty-one-year-old President of the United States has, in the language of the moment, good days and bad days, this was, in the strictest sense, a good day. In other words, as Michael Tomasky, the editor of The New Republic , put it in a comment on X, \"That was the worst possible outcome: not anywhere near good enough to settle matters, but also not quite bad enough to be a slam-dunk that he has to go tomorrow.\"\n\nThe interview was twenty-two minutes, surprisingly short for such a high-profile moment, when Biden and his advisers have been accused of hiding from the press, and he might have benefitted from showcasing more energy and stamina. But it was more than long enough for Biden to make his essential point: He is nowhere close to getting out of the race. \"If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump, will you stand down?\" Stephanopoulos asked. Biden laughed, and said, \"If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\"\n\nFor now, Biden remains in political purgatory. The debate performance has been searing, and his recovery has been fitful. No President in recent memory has gone on to win reëlection with approval ratings this low. It hardly helped that, on Wednesday, in a meeting with Democratic governors, Biden said that he needed more sleep and planned to stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. On Thursday, in an interview with a radio station in Philadelphia, he made the kind of flub that might have been shrugged off at another time, saying he was proud to be \"the first Black woman to serve with a Black President.\" By Friday, donors were going public with plans to withhold or redirect their dollars.\n\nThe Party's patience may be running short. A handful of Democratic members of the House have called for Biden to step aside. Though no senators have yet done so, in frantic private conversations they have questioned whether the President's aides are shielding him from the full depth of concern. Not long before Biden sat down for the ABC interview, the Washington Post reported that Senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, had begun to assemble a group of colleagues to ask Biden \"to exit the presidential race.\" Details were scant, but the report was the clearest sign yet that more than a week of efforts to solidify support was failing, especially among lawmakers who worried that Biden's woes could damage Democrats' chances in down-ballot races. At his core, Biden is a creature of Capitol Hill, and the thought of harming his party's chances in Congress could shake his resistance. The other route past his pride might be to frame the risks to his historical legacy; he often invokes, as a solemn oath, \"My name as a Biden,\" and if he leads the Democrats to failure against Trump, that fact will forever accompany his name.\n\nThe prospect of Warner's delegation evokes the scene in August, 1974, when Republican Senator Barry Goldwater and colleagues visited the White House to tell President Richard Nixon, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, that he no longer had the votes to survive impeachment. Nixon announced his resignation the next day. According to the Post, \"There's a growing consensus among Senate Democrats that the situation with Biden at the top of the ticket is untenable.\"\n\nIn truth, consensus, in the absence of actual votes, can be hard to measure precisely. On Friday afternoon, Representative Gerry Connolly, of Virginia, was asked, on CNN, if he believed that Biden still gives Democrats the best shot to win in November. \"I don't think we know that yet,\" he said. It was a remarkably ambivalent assessment. The coming week, he added, will be \"very consequential in hopefully putting to rest-or not-the questions that have arisen.\" David Chalian, CNN's political director, noted that conversations among elected Democrats and strategists about replacing Biden have progressed to the point of weighing the value of various potential running mates. \"This is not a party that is rallying around Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\nStill, though an overwhelming majority of the electorate feels that Biden is too old to serve another term, there are signs that at least some elected officials might be metabolizing the drama faster than the general public. Not long after Connolly signalled his openness to the possibility that Biden might not finish the race, Representative Debbie Dingell, of Michigan, called in to say that she had encountered constituents who are unnerved by the prospect of primaries being, in effect, nullified by an effort to replace the nominee. \"Today, I got screamed at, and reminded of how many millions of people had voted to nominate Joe Biden,\" she said. \"This is a very complicated issue.\"\n\nBiden himself has indicated that he just might try to rally voters against political grandees who move against him. A few hours before the ABC interview, in a feisty speech at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, he said, \"Millions of Democrats like you just voted for me in primaries all across America. You voted for me to be your nominee. No one else.\" He went on, \"Despite that, some folks don't seem to care who you voted for. Well, guess what? They're trying to push me out of the race. Well, let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race!\"\n\nWho, exactly, he meant by \"they\" was unclear. The rally was attended by a spirited crowd, which cheered Biden's posture of insistence, even though the camera caught sight of a lone young man with a hand-drawn sign that said \" PASS THE TORCH, JOE .\"\n\nBy the time Biden's interview with Stephanopoulos finished airing, he had deflected the most immediate calls for change at the top of the ticket. (That conversation is all but certain to resume in Washington next week, when Congress is back in session.) But Biden also said enough to distress Democrats who worry that he is on a losing path in November. He declined to agree to an independent medical evaluation with neurological tests (\"I get a full neurological test every day\"), dismissed concerns that he wasn't healthy enough to serve a second term, and said that he does not believe the polls, which have him far behind his standing at this point in the 2020 election. But the exchange that might linger longest if Biden ultimately loses to Trump was this one:\n\nStephanopoulos: \"If you stay in, and Trump is elected and everything\nyou're warning about comes to pass, how will you feel in January?\"\n\nBiden: \"I'll feel, as long as I gave it my all, and I did as good a\njob as I know I can do, that's what this is about.\"\n\nIs it? If time has robbed Biden of too much of his power to protect the country against Trump, is giving it his \"all\" what Americans need? Campaigns require conviction-an audacious belief that one can and should be President. On a tactical basis, that conviction can take the form of spin and unshakable self-confidence. But it must also coexist with a capacity to absorb bad news and well-founded doubts, to pull out signal from noise. Without that check, conviction is prone to self-indulgence and failure-a combination bad enough for any campaign, and potentially catastrophic given the stakes of this one. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Biden's Last-Minute Move on the Equal Rights Amendment Does Nothing\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nCongress overwhelmingly passed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would enshrine gender equality into the Constitution, way back in 1972. But the requisite 38 states did not ratify the amendment until 2020, when the Virginia Legislature became the last to approve it. By that point, however, five other states had rescinded their ratifications-and the congressional deadline for approval had long since expired. Feminist advocates have nonetheless pressured President Joe Biden to declare that the ERA is now a formal part of the Constitution, especially after the fall of Roe v. Wade and a climate of revanchist anti-women legislation. On Friday, with two days left in his term, Biden finally did so, albeit without any executive action to back it up.\n\nOn this week's Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus , Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed Biden's move and its legal force (or lack thereof). Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: On Friday morning at 10 a.m., we got a mysterious announcement from President Joe Biden. I'll just quote him: \"It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people. In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.\"\n\nSo we have President Biden affirming that the ERA is the \"law of the land\" because, he says, it has been correctly ratified. I don't know what that means exactly. Mark, you and I did a show on this, and I think we both felt pretty strongly that there just wasn't a sound legal or constitutional basis from which to force the national archivist to publish the amendment, as advocates demanded. And, regardless, Biden has not, in fact, directed the national archivist to publish the ERA. So I guess my first question for you is: Does President Biden's eleventh-hour announcement have any legal force at all? Is this going to change the legal landscape? Is this just symbolic? My follow-up question is: Oh my God, why did he wait until two days before the end of his presidency to do this thing?\n\nMark Joseph Stern: I think anything Joe Biden did on the Equal Rights Amendment was going to be symbolic. Activists were pressuring him to tell the national archivist to simply decree that this has been ratified and is part of the Constitution. But that really would not have any true legal effect; it would be challenged and blocked in the courts. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, under both Biden and Trump , separately looked at this issue, and said that the president cannot just make the ERA law. That's because, as much as we wish otherwise, Congress set a deadline for ratification. It then extended the deadline. But that second deadline is long passed. We are beyond the time range when Congress allowed states to ratify this amendment. Unfortunately, I think Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was correct when she said , before she passed, that the deadline is expired, and this has to \"start over.\"\n\nWhat Biden's doing is expressing a personal view. I respect that view, even if I disagree with it. He's saying he thinks the ERA is part of the Constitution, but he's not even attempting to back that up with any legal force. I think that's because the very smart lawyers around him have explained that if he does try to give it legal force, it will be defeated in court-and that's if Donald Trump doesn't get into office and reverse it first. So we have a president saying he loves the ERA and believes it is real, but that doesn't give anybody any more rights than they had yesterday.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot since we did our show about it, and my overwhelming sense is: I cannot believe that 1972 is the high-water mark for women's rights in America. We are so deep in this crazy conversation about manliness and masculinity and Pete Hegseth saying that women can't serve in combat in the military because they're too distracting, and also that but for the love of a good woman, there's nothing to redeem rape-y men. We are in such a dire, dire moment when it comes to how we think about masculinity and what it is to be a man, and what we think about equality, and what Mark Zuckerberg thinks about Sheryl Sandberg. It is just so shocking to me that the high-water mark for women's equality in this country happened at a time when we were singing Peter, Paul, and Mary songs. It's incredibly depressing.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

It could be a shitty test result, confirming something you'd previously been able to deny.\n\nOr it could be last Thursday's presidential debate, which revealed that President Biden is indeed an old man who appears to be in no condition to be running this country, even now-not to mention in another four years.\n\nThe debate was shocking, upsetting, nearly impossible to watch. Based on my anecdotal research, lots of folks turned it off after 10 minutes, unable to witness the humiliating performance by our current president. Others held out hope it would turn around in real time, that Biden's jaw would be vacuumed shut again, eyes refocused. Still more of us had the sinking, correct assumption: This would not come to pass. We knew what was happening. We were watching the president of the United States, un-teleprompted, fail in a spectacularly human way in front of us. He was not OK. Which meant the impending presidential election was more like an impending disaster.\n\nBut even worse than those unbearable 90 minutes has been the spin that followed. Democratic operatives and Biden's friends in high places came to his defense; Barack Obama himself brushed off the president's dismal performance, posting on Twitter that \"bad debate nights happen.\" C'mon. Yes, a bad debate night happened to Obama when he was running again in 2012. A bad debate night is not what happened last week.\n\nPushing this line is offensive, and contemptuous of the American voting public. Everyone saw the same debate: It was reality rubbing human mortality in our faces. Biden is old, and the process of his aging seems to be accelerating, as it is wont to do. We all know old people. We know how different the 60s are from the 70s, and the 70s are from the 80s. We've all witnessed the decline that comes in the slow march toward the end, likely in circumstances that were unbelievably personal and sorrowful. What I am trying to say is: We know what we saw last Thursday. And like those relationship-changing texts and bad test results, we cannot unsee what we saw.\n\nThe effort to convince us that it really wasn't that bad will continue. Biden's campaign will keep reiterating that those closest to the president-his wife Jill and son Hunter, first and foremost-are standing by him, urging him to stay in, because they are the ones who know what he is \"really\" like, and they think he's up for it. But the swell from the media is building to counter that, and that's good. It's our job to say what is really happening out there, even if it is unpleasant and inconvenient.\n\nCould we have been more forcefully pushing on Biden's age before? Sure, and some reporters have been trying. But even with the evidence of the number-Biden is 81-pressing too hard seemed to be edging into a hypothetical space. He seemed good; the State of the Union was a success, he looked invigorated at rallies. Only now does it feel so obvious that in those encounters, Biden was scripted, prompted, controlled. Everything mediated by people motivated to protect him personally and politically. Now, we regular folks have seen him unplugged. It's not pretty. Aging only goes in one direction.\n\nOn Friday morning, my 78-year-old mom, a rational, registered independent in Pennsylvania, texted me: \"We are not Trump fans, but poor Biden was so bad last night... I felt sorry for the man.\" That is kindness from a fellow senior citizen. But I felt rage, and still do. My anger isn't even really at Biden himself. I am mad at the Democratic Party, which seems to truck along with a mission of its own while remaining wedded to the past. I know what it feels like for voters to be energized by their candidate. Remember 2008? It was seemingly against all odds that Barack Obama became the Democratic nominee, beating Hillary Clinton who ... then became the predetermined candidate in 2016. And that time, the energy was different. I got on board and voted for her, don't get me wrong. But everything about that candidacy was locked down. There was little room for a prospective challenger. Bernie Sanders, whose candidacy I dismissed too easily (because I thought he was too old!) and Martin O'Malley (remember him?) were the only two to step up. It was Hillary's turn. We got with the program. And then we lost.\n\nNow, we are being urged again to get on board and do this thing. Finish the job! We need to go with the guy with the record, with the experience, with the delegates. He beat Trump before-no one else has done that, don't you realize that? No one else can do that, Biden defenders keep telling us.\n\nWell, who knows. But I do know that trying to wish last Thursday night away is only going to make me angrier. I'm up for rolling the dice. We can't unsee what we saw. And I, for one, don't want to see it again.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The DNC's Thanks for Joe Biden Were Laid on Very Thick. One Wonders if He Minded.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election, Teresa Saavedra Woorman, a Maryland state legislator and a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, got a call from the Biden campaign asking if she was still on board with his candidacy. When the alerts came in 20 minutes later that Biden had dropped out, she thought, \"Whoa, OK. That was quick.\"\n\nNumerous delegates I spoke to Monday, on the first day of the DNC, similarly had their temperature taken in the last weeks of the Biden campaign. Tim Allison, the executive director of a teachers union in California, said it happened \"multiple times.\" Megan Kerr, who serves on the Long Beach City Council, also had gotten \"some calls\" about what her intentions were.\n\nThey all said they would support Biden. These were, after all, Biden delegates that the president had won through the primary process, and their support was pledged to him.\n\n\"I told them straight up,\" Allison said, \"the decision is the president's. He has earned the nomination of the party, and the decision is his. I was elected as a delegate to Joe Biden . So I was with Joe Biden until he said he was no longer in the race.\"\n\nMany delegates remember vividly where they were when Biden said-or rather, submitted a letter announcing-that he was quitting from the race. Kerr was on a bike ride with a group, which they stopped for a few minutes to sit down and check their phones. Cindy Yoe, a Maryland county party chair, heard the news as she was getting on a plane home from Montana, so missed the next several hours of rapid-fire developments. Larry Olsen, the South Dakota state party treasurer-whose camo \"WALZ\" hat earned him a compliment from Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar while we were speaking-said he was \"probably doing some kind of work on the farm.\"\n\nWhile some of them first had panicked thoughts-what's going to happen next? Is there going to be an open convention free-for-all?-Biden's ensuing endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris soon cleared up any confusion. Within the next few days, most state party delegations would officially endorse and then formally vote to nominate Harris to replace Biden atop the ticket. Allison proudly noted that in the California delegation's virtual meeting, he seconded Nancy Pelosi's motion to pledge support to Harris. Once Biden threw his support behind Harris, Biden delegates did too, without a second thought.\n\nIf you think of Harris' delegates, then, as Biden delegates first-people chosen for their roles because of presumed loyalty to Joe Biden-it's almost surprising that there isn't more resentment within the DNC toward the way he was shown the door. I didn't pick up much of it. Yoe, from Maryland, said she \"had a little problem with the ageism thing,\" saying that as she's \"getting older, it hits home a little closer.\" But there wasn't any appetite for Donald Trump's fantasy scenario, in which Biden emerges at the convention wanting to \"take the convention back.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a night for nostalgia,\" Allison told me. \"He's been a strong president who's done remarkable things for the country, and I think he did one last remarkable thing for the country by deciding it was time to hand off the baton.\"\n\n\"Nobody's perfect,\" Olsen, of South Dakota, said. \"But do I think he was a competent leader? Yes. Do I think he got a tremendous amount of things accomplished? Yes. Do I think he could have continued? Yes. But I think he made the right choice for himself, made definitely the right choice for the country. Unselfish sacrifice.\"\n\nSimilar homages were made through the first evening's programming.\n\n\"Thank you, Joe, for your lifetime of service and leadership,\" Hillary Clinton said.\n\n\"President Biden, America is so much better because of you-a true patriot who has always put the people first,\" Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said. \"Thank you, Joe!\"\n\n\"Mr. President, thank you- thank you -for elevating a great leader in Kamala Harris,\" Biden's top ally in the Senate, Chris Coons, said in his speech introducing the Biden family segment of the evening.\n\nI've wondered how well Biden-the candidate on whom the party has just turned out the lights-takes it when it's laid on this thick. It's not like he was left with a much of a choice on the matter by the time he dropped out. The party had abandoned him and had the ability to keep ratcheting the heat up further. And Monday, while speakers were feting him with their deepest thanks for hour after hour, they were also delaying his speaking window until after prime time on the East Coast. But they did so from the bottom of their hearts.\n\nBiden took the stage at 10:26 p.m. Central Time to a minuteslong standing ovation. Every delegate was holding up a \"WE <3 JOE\" sign-notably including a member of the California delegation sitting in the front row, Nancy Pelosi. Members of the Delaware delegation put on aviators.\n\nMost of Biden's speech could've been taken-and likely was-from a draft of a renomination speech. He reiterated the stakes of the race, ran through his legislative record, and made the case against Trump. There were calls to put Harris and Tim Walz in office. But not really much, ultimately about as much as the sum total of the unscripted \"not a joke,\" \"not hyperbole,\" and \"I mean that literally\" asides scattered throughout. After about 50 minutes, speakers and delegates didn't need to thank him. They just needed to let him finish.\n\n\"I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected a 29-year-old United States senator,\" he said toward the end of his speech as it stretched into the one-hour mark.\n\n\"I was too young to be in the Senate,\" he then ad-libbed in a joke, \"and too old to be the president.\" Biden had come out firing in his speech but had been beginning to sag a bit as things went on. But he delivered that joke well. Perhaps because it was no joke at all, and he meant that literally.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Joe Biden Can Preemptively Halt One Brutal Trump Policy\n\nThere are 40 men on federal death row who have been convicted of capital offenses by the federal government going back as far as 1993. The offenses committed by federal death row inmates include drug-related murders, a murder in a national park, killings during terrorist attacks, and the fatal shooting of a bank guard during a robbery. Eighteen of them are white; 15 are Black; six are Latino; one is Asian.\n\nAll told, there have been 50 federal executions in the past century, 13 of which were carried out by the Trump administration between July 2020 and January 2021.\n\nIn contrast, Biden has a mixed record on capital punishment. Unlike his predecessor, he has not carried out any federal executions, but, as the Atlantic's Elizabeth Bruenig explains, \"neither has he instructed [Attorney General Merrick] Garland to stop pursuing new death sentences, or to stop defending ongoing capital cases.\"\n\nNow that the 2024 election is over and Trump will be returning to the White House, it is even more important that President Biden do as I urged him to do last July and use his clemency power to empty the federal death row . He should make sure that none of the men now there will ever be put to death.\n\nSometimes it is hard to get out front and do the right thing. But in this case, Biden can follow in the footsteps of several governors who waited until late in their terms to issue mass commutations to people awaiting execution in their states.\n\nThat is the least that America's first abolitionist chief executive can do . Like those governors, Biden has ample grounds to use his clemency power to advance the cause of justice and to save lives.\n\nAs former Sen. Russ Feingold wrote last year:\n\nA blanket commutation would realize Mr. Biden's anti-death-penalty stance and move the United States further along the path to abolition. It would also prevent another federal execution spree such as that carried out in the Trump administration. The commutation of federal death row sentences could be a defining feature of Mr. Biden's legacy of, as he describes it, restoring \"the soul of the nation.\"\n\nHe can take inspiration from many sources, including former Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who commuted the sentences of all 17 men on her state's death row in December 2022 on her way out of office. At the time, Brown said : \"I have long believed that justice is not advanced by taking a life, and the state should not be in the business of executing people-even if a terrible crime placed them in prison. ... This is a value that many Oregonians share.\"\n\n\"Unlike previous commutations I've granted to individuals who have demonstrated extraordinary growth and rehabilitation,\" she explained, \"this commutation is not based on any rehabilitative efforts by the individuals on death row. Instead, it reflects the recognition that the death penalty is immoral. It is an irreversible punishment that does not allow for correction; is wasteful of taxpayer dollars; does not make communities safer; and cannot be and never has been administered fairly and equitably.\"\n\nTo offer one other example, Biden could learn from what Republican Illinois Gov. George Ryan did in 2003 when he emptied his state's death row by issuing a blanket commutation to all 167 inmates. At the time, Ryan acknowledged his own journey, a journey like Biden's, from death penalty supporter to critic .\n\nUnlike Brown, Ryan did not condemn state killing itself. Instead, he focused on what he saw as crippling defects in its administration.\n\nHe noted that \"In Illinois last year we had about 1,000 murders, only 2 percent of that 1,000 were sentenced to death. Where is the fairness and equality in that? The death penalty in Illinois is not imposed fairly or uniformly because of the absence of standards for the 102 Illinois State Attorneys, who must decide whether to request the death sentence.\"\n\n\"Should geography,\" Ryan asked, \"be a factor in determining who gets the death sentence? I don't think so but in Illinois it makes a difference. You are 5 times more likely to get a death sentence for first degree murder in the rural area of Illinois than you are in Cook County. Where is the justice and fairness in that? Where is the proportionality?\"\n\nAnd the Illinois governor called special attention to miscarriages of justice in the death penalty system, including its racially discriminatory history and the fact that Illinois had, at that time, released 17 men who had been falsely convicted from death row.\n\nOther governors who have done what Brown and Ryan did, and what Biden should do, include Lee Cruce, governor of Oklahoma from 1911-1915, Winthrop Rockefeller, governor of Arkansas from 1966-1970, and Tony Anaya, governor of New Mexico from 1982-1986. Each of them took advantage of the period immediately before they left office to do what might have been too much of a political risk to do when they had to stand for reelection.\n\nAnd now it is President Biden's turn.\n\nMany of the problems highlighted by Brown and Ryan when they commuted death row apply to the federal death penalty as well. Moreover, the federal death penalty has been afflicted with the same problems of racial injustice that have plagued the states where it is also legal.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union reports that \"Defendants of color make up the majority of federal death row and the majority of modern federal executions. Furthermore, modern Attorneys General seek the death penalty at far higher rates if the victim is White, and White federal defendants are far more likely to have their death charges reduced to life sentences through plea bargaining.\"\n\nThese issues, along with the injustice of a government putting anyone to death, provide ample reason for Biden to issue a mass commutation. But so far Biden has not seemed eager to wield his clemency power in this or any other area.\n\nWriting in September of this year, law professors Rachel Barkow and Mark Osler note that \"Biden has granted 25 pardons and commuted the sentences of 131 other people. ... That is a mere 1.4 percent of the petitions he has received. ... No modern U.S. president, going back to Richard Nixon, has had a rate so low.\"\n\n\"Clemency,\" they argue, \"is more important than ever in an era of grossly excessive punishments and mass incarceration. Timidity is not a path to legacy.\"\n\nLike the governors who overcame such timidity and granted clemency in capital cases, President Biden, now facing the end of his time in the White House, has, as Bruenig correctly observes, \"the freedom to act on his values and save dozens of lives.\" He ought to use his clemency power \"to keep his campaign promises, and to honor the dignity of human life.\"\n\nPreventing another gruesome Trump execution spree is one final thing the president has the power to do. It's an opportunity he must not pass up.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It's the State of the Union. Biden Should Consider a Reset.\n\nThis is Totally Normal Quote of the Day , a feature highlighting a statement from the news that exemplifies just how extremely normal everything has become.\n\n\"President Joe Biden's team is increasingly taking extraordinary steps to minimize disruptions from pro-Palestinian protests at his events by making them smaller, withholding their precise locations from the media and the public until he arrives, avoiding college campuses and, in at least one instance, considering hiring a private company to vet attendees.\" -An NBC News report describing the nature of one of Biden's recent campaign pivots .\n\nPresident Joe Biden is about to give his third State of the Union address, and he doesn't seem too concerned about the prospect that it could be his last.* Just look to the crazy-making calm of his inner circle , which seems content to dismiss current polling and bet that the electorate will \"choose normal\" at the ballot box this fall. (Remind me how 2016 turned out , again?)\n\nEveryone else who cares about the state of our union, however, has been especially alarmed as of late.\n\nBiden is still tied with or trailing Donald Trump in the polls, and his overall approval rating remains troublingly low . A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found that a \"majority\" of Biden's 2020 coalition now perceives him as \" too old to lead the country effectively .\" The electorate at large remains largely unaware of the genuinely historic accomplishments Biden has achieved on popular issues like economic recovery, infrastructure protection, climate change, and gun control. Super Tuesday saw more important states for Biden-North Carolina and Minnesota-rack up impressive voting margins for \"uncommitted\" in the Democratic primary, adding tangible numbers to the national disaffection over Biden's stance on the Israel-Hamas war (something that was already expressed quite clearly by a significant share of Michiganders in last week's primary). Israel's indiscriminate bombing of the Gaza Strip has now killed more than 30,000 Palestinian Arabs, the majority of them \"women and children,\" as even Biden's administration officials have admitted -a fact that's inflaming important swaths of the Democratic voting base.\n\nAnd all the while, the Supreme Court is slowing the momentum of Trump's federal trials and allowing him to seriously argue that he could be immune from his many alleged crimes, simply because he was the president while he was doing them. So the current president is losing any advantages there.\n\nBiden clearly needs to make some big changes and repair his broken relationship with much-needed voters. His vice president-who called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza-says so. His congressional allies-from progressives like Ro Khanna to pro-Israel moderates like Haley Stevens-say so. The majority of all voters-Jewish or Muslim, left-wing or centrist-say so. So, is Biden actually shifting his tack to win voters back?\n\nDepends on how you classify the act of hiding from the very constituencies he needs to court!\n\nAccording to an NBC News report published last week, Biden and his campaign team have been so rattled by the ubiquitous presence of pro-Palestine supporters at their rallies that they're all but running for cover. Biden's reelection effort has \"postponed\" plans to hit more college campuses, and is instead keeping rally locations secretive, increasing the prices of fundraising dinners, and \"discussing whether to hire a private company to vet attendees,\" per the network. (Surely a great use of funds as small-dollar donations remain low .)\n\nTo take it from NBC's sources, Biden's new protester-avoiding accommodations \"have resulted in zero disruptions\" over the past few weeks. However, this has also \"meant that Biden is appearing in front of fewer voters and not personally engaging with some of the key constituencies whose support he is struggling to gain, such as young voters.\" Look, Jack: I've never managed a campaign but ... that seems bad!\n\nIt's not just Biden who's facing down Israel protests; even Gaza-sympathetic Dems like Raphael Warnock , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , and Maxwell Frost have tangled with morally outraged constituencies this year. But here's the thing: It's Biden who, more than anyone else, needs to assure the American people that he's 1) physically up to snuff and 2) willing to engage with the critical voters he's been losing. And it has to go beyond mere words: A senior adviser to Biden (anonymously) told NBC News' Mike Memoli last week that \"President Biden shares the goal of many of the folks who voted 'uncommitted,' which is an end to the violence and a just and lasting peace. ... They want a President who listens and delivers. That's Joe Biden.\"\n\nIs it, though? Because it sure as heck sounds like he's not doing much listening on this issue, much less delivering.\n\nSome pundits or Biden aides will point out the fact that older voters turn out more in presidential contests anyway, which is true, and that younger voters are generally a low-turnout bloc , which is also true. But young voters have consistently been an important part of the Democratic coalition over the past few years. As the Democratic polling firm Catalist has measured , Biden's ability to beat Trump where Hillary Clinton couldn't depended a lot on improved youth numbers, with those voters making for 31 percent of the 2020 voting electorate, versus 23 percent in 2016. Biden simply can't afford to cast aside the people who have supported him and are now begging him to take action. So if, per a \"Biden ally\" quoted by NBC News, \"the point is to reach as many voters as you can, and those small events don't,\" then what in the Sam Hill are we doing here?\n\nThe State of the Union offers Biden some ways to turn things around. The already media-shy president needs to take the moment to speak to those voters who, he well knows, are upset with him and pleading for something better . He should harness his famed empathy to show he understands why they are upset, instead of just throwing out stock lines. Biden's reported plan to list out wonky bits of his legislative agenda won't cut it-that's not what the voters are looking for right now. The president can demonstrate, in a substantive way, that he gets it. Or he can continue to duck things and see how that works out for the country.\n\nCorrection, March 8, 2024: This piece originally misstated that Biden was about to give his fourth State of the Union address. Thursday's address was his third SOTU; Biden's early-2021 congressional address was not a SOTU.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Biden Fails a Death Penalty Abolitionist's Most Important Test\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThe mystery of Joe Biden's views about capital punishment has finally been solved. His decision to grant clemency to 37 of the 40 people on federal death row shows the depth of his opposition to the death penalty. And his decision to leave three of America's most notorious killers to be executed by a future administration shows the limits of his abolitionist commitment.\n\nThe three men excluded from Biden's mass clemency-Dylann Roof, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and Robert Bowers-would no doubt pose a severe test of anyone's resolve to end the death penalty. Biden failed that test.\n\nIn a statement announcing his clemency decision, the president said, \"I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\"\n\nBut Biden cannot stop the use of the federal death penalty by leaving Roof, Tsarnaev, and Bowers behind. He can't prevent the Trump administration or its successors from resuming executions by refusing to commute their sentences.\n\nStill, we should recognize that it is never easy for a political leader to spare the life of someone who has murdered an innocent victim. That is why presidents do it so rarely. Over the past 25 years, only three other federal death row inmates have been granted clemency.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2001, his last day in office, President Bill Clinton commuted the death sentence of David Chandler . He did so after the key witness against him \"recanted his testimony and acknowledged committing the murder himself.\"\n\nIn 2017, Barack Obama granted clemency to Abelardo Arboleda Ortiz and Dwight Loving. In the Ortiz case, Obama granted clemency \"on the grounds that Ortiz was intel­lec­tu­al­ly dis­abled, his right to con­sular noti­fi­ca­tion under the Vienna Convention had been vio­lat­ed ... and he had been denied effec­tive assis­tance of coun­sel at tri­al.\" Like Ortiz, Loving received clemency because he also had received ineffective assistance from his trial lawyer. But also because of \"racial and gender bias in the selection of mem­bers of his court-mar­tial.\"\n\nWhat Biden did for 37 people on federal death row is in itself momentous. And, as the Washington Post observes, \"Biden's decision to intervene in even one death penalty case caps a remarkable turnaround for him on this issue.\"\n\nLeading opponents of the death penalty quickly and lavishly praised the president for this turnaround. For example, Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said , \"President Biden took a historic and courageous step in addressing the failed death penalty in the United States-bringing us much closer to outlawing the barbaric practice once again. By commuting the sentences of 37 individuals on death row, President Biden has taken the most consequential step of any president in our history to address the immoral and unconstitutional harms of capital punishment.\"\n\nBut Romero said nothing about Roof, Tsarnaev, and Bowers.\n\nNeither did Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative and one of America's leading abolitionists. Stevenson commended Biden \"for recognizing that we don't have to kill people to show that killing is wrong, that we can and should reduce violence in our communities by refusing to sanction more violence and killing in our courts and prisons.\"\n\nMartin Luther King III also lauded Biden for taking \"meaningful and lasting action not just to acknowledge the death penalty's racist roots but also to remedy its persistent unfairness.\" He, too, was silent about the fate of the three people who were left out of Biden's clemency.\n\nAs a matter of tactics, such silence is not surprising. Commuting the death sentences of Roof, Tsarnaev, and Bowers would have unleashed a firestorm of protest .\n\nAnd in the long run, it might have done damage to the campaign against the death penalty by associating it with three of America's most heinous killers. Taking on those kinds of cases might, as I have previously warned , also have diverted attention from the damage capital punishment does to our democracy and our culture.\n\nStill, can one really be against state killing and not oppose the execution of people whom law professor Robert Blecker calls \"the worst of the worst\"? Apparently, Biden thinks so.\n\nSince Biden became president, many have tried to discern his real views and the meaning of his administration's actions in capital cases. As a candidate in 2020, Biden promised to \"work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level and incentivize states to follow the federal government's example.\"\n\nToday, he did more. But in my view, not enough\n\nThe White House made clear that Biden \"believes that America must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level, except in cases of terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\"\n\n\"Except.\" We should have known that there was an \"except\" in Biden's opposition to the death penalty from actions the Justice Department has taken to defend the convictions and sentences of Roof and Tsarnaev and to proceed with the prosecution of Bowers.\n\nAbolitionists have made great strides in changing the situation of capital punishment in this country by focusing on problems like false convictions, racial disparities in death sentences, and botched executions. But they will never get this country to rid itself of the death penalty if they join Biden in making exceptions, especially for those whom others would see as most deserving of death.\n\nThe president of all people should understand this. His Catholic faith should have instructed him .\n\nLast week, Biden spoke to Pope Francis about many things, including the decision he faced about whether to commute the sentences of the people on federal death row.\n\nWhile we cannot know exactly what the two leaders said, the Vatican News was perfectly clear about the Pope's position. The Pope, it said, \"has described the death penalty as an act 'at odds with Christian faith' and one that 'eliminates all hope for forgiveness and rehabilitation.' \"\n\nOn Dec. 8, one day before he talked to Biden, \"the Holy Father called on the faithful to 'pray for the prisoners who are on death row in the United States.' ... 'Let us pray,' he said, 'that their sentence be commuted, changed.

      "text": "The Fox News Star Who Can Actually Get Biden to Talk\n\nPeter Doocy, Fox News' White House correspondent since 2020, has made a name for himself with pointed and at times heated questioning of Biden administration officials at briefings and other events. Doocy's first interactions with former press secretary Jen Psaki became news stories themselves , like when he asked what Biden would call his own COVID travel bans after calling Trump's \" xenophobic .\" His questions tend to earn candid-if not exasperated-responses, especially from Joe Biden, who once said himself , \"I know he always asks me tough questions, and he always has an edge to them, but I like him anyway.\"\n\nPolitico magazine once asked of Doocy, \" Is Fox's Peter Doocy Just Asking Questions-Or Trolling the White House? \" I'd be lying if I said I hadn't asked myself a similar question. But watching his work in the briefing room beyond sound bites, you start to see more craft in it, especially in moving ahead stories the Biden administration prefers not to discuss. And you can begin to understand why despite it all, Biden officials themselves haven't stopped calling on him. Though he doesn't see himself as the opposition, Doocy does think it is his role to put pressure on the administration, and in a recent phone conversation, he said he doesn't give much thought to how that makes him look-or whether people tend to associate him with the talking heads at Fox. We discussed his off-the-cuff interactions with the president (who also, for good measure, once called him a \" stupid son of a bitch \"), how to get Biden to talk, and whether he'd change his approach under a President Trump. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nWhen you're in the briefing room, what is going on in your head? Are you rehearsing your questions beforehand? Is there a certain strategy?\n\nPeter Doocy: The first question is always good to establish what topic we're interested in that day, especially because a lot of times we are going to be covering topics that, even if the briefing has been going on for an hour, haven't come up yet. That second question is where we can really start to probe why something is happening that maybe the press team has not prepared for the press secretary or for the president as part of an official response. And I try to get as much information out of that second question and the third question, knowing that if we're lucky, we will get three questions to the press secretary.\n\nHow does that usually turn out for you?\n\nMore often than not, I think we are able to generate exchanges that actually inform the audience about something that is going on, even if Karine [Jean-Pierre] or the president don't really want to give a ton of detail, and maybe they don't have a ton of detail yet because there's some breaking news, but if you play a little bit of the question and the meat of the answer, I think people that don't sit around watching the whole briefing at Whitehouse.gov are actually going to figure out, \"OK, I didn't know that this was going on, that's an interesting answer.\" And then they can decide whether or not they agree with it or disagree with it.\n\nHow much of your question-crafting process is your curiosity versus generating an interesting sound bite for a Fox News audience? Are you thinking about how audiences and voters are going to be thinking about these answers at all?\n\nIt's all my curiosity. I think that's reflected in that my question 99 percent of the time is going to be something different than anybody else has covered that day. And a lot of the times, it's stuff that we haven't even covered on the channel yet. If I have an ability to find a story that nobody is talking about yet and get an interesting answer from somebody at the White House, that is great to start the next day with, and then we can get reactions from others to what the White House said. But I would say that every day is just driven by my curiosity.\n\nIt's your first election year as a White House correspondent. How has that changed your job?\n\nWhen we got here to the White House-and when I say we, I mean me and Joe Biden-it was very different because it was peak COVID. There were only 13 of us at a time in the press briefings, all socially distanced, which meant that every briefing I would get at least five minutes of questions. I could cover so many different topics and have so many follow-ups, and it was great. And it was a very, very small press pool that rotated for presidential events, but there were never any invited guests and the staff was so limited that it would just be a small group of us and the president speaking in the East Room or in the State Dining Room. And more often than not, in that first year and the second year, he would engage at least a little bit.\n\nNow that we're in an election year, there are fewer opportunities for access to President Biden. All of his events have invited guests, and most of the time, as soon as he's done talking, they will push a button and start playing \"Hail to the Chief,\" volume 100. So even if there weren't all these guests in between us at the press riser and the microphone, there's music playing. And so he's very rarely going to hear a question from the press.\n\nCampaign folks have talked about this. It is part of their strategy. They want quality over quantity. But it has been a change this year, and it makes every chance that we get with the president so much more precious. And he does make a lot of news when he decides to stick around at the microphone. A couple weeks ago, the day that the special counsel's report came out, I got to ask him about the line that's in there where Robert Hur says, \" He's a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory .\" I asked him, \"How bad is your memory?\" And he said, \"My memory is so bad I let you speak.\" Which is a funny line that also makes news. And so, he can do it. The staff just seems like it wants to really limit it in an election year.\n\nAre you having a harder time getting answers from his people, too?\n\nOne of the big challenges is talking about the election. Half the story is Donald Trump, but officials here at the White House, from the podium and in their official capacity, have an escape hatch because of the Hatch Act. and they can say, \"Can't talk about an election. Can't talk about Donald Trump. He is a candidate in the election. What else do you want to know?\" Luckily, the Biden campaign folks in Wilmington are very good and they are very responsive when we have questions and that is very helpful this cycle. But we still do need to know what President Biden himself is thinking about a lot of these things, and he is here at the White House. That's why it's so important to get to him.\n\nIn fact, two or three weeks ago, I was the TV pool in the Oval Office and it was the first day of the Trump trial in New York. I think maybe it was jury selection. And I asked Biden if he was watching any of the Trump trial and he just shook his head, \"no\" with a smile. And really, in a transcript, if you look, that's nothing. But we'll take what we can get.\n\nDo you collaborate with other journalists in the White House briefing room to get tough questions in? I've heard that you all sometimes game it together, especially if you feel like they're not going to get to what you want. Is that true?\n\nThat is true. When it is going to be a very, very small pool because we're going to be in a small space like the Roosevelt Room or the Oval Office, the thought has become that President Biden is more likely to engage on at least one topic if people aren't shouting over each other and he can hear one clear question. It seems like the results have been mixed with that. But in terms of my relationship with the other reporters, they have relied on me from time to time to be the one person, I think mostly because of my height and the volume of my voice.\n\nOther reporters say to you, \"Hey, you're the tallest one here, you've got to ask this one question\"?\n\nIt's more who wants to go first, in hopes that everybody is going to get a question eventually, if it's limited to four or five people going into the room. It's who wants to go first with a question that he can clearly hear, and then who wants to go second. When it's a larger group of press, it's like the Wild West, and that is truly when people are shouting over each other and I just have to hope that I am shouting the loudest.\n\nYou weren't there for the transition from Trump to Biden, but I was trying to figure out what that transition must've been like, and I came across this quote from April Ryan. She said, \"It's a breath of fresh air to not have people personally attacked on a regular basis.\" Would you say that that's been your experience?\n\nThere have definitely been some exchanges that can at least come across on TV as very heated. But from the president himself on down, the folks here have been good about touching base afterward to make sure that there are no hard feelings.\n\nAre you referencing Biden's hot-mic moment when he called you a \"stupid son of a bitch\"?\n\nThat was one of them.\n\nCan you walk me through that moment from your perspective? What were you thinking when you heard that?\n\nI didn't actually hear it happen. I was at this event for the economic competition council and everything was so very COVID-heavy, but at the time I had a couple of questions about crime. The Ukraine war was bubbling up and somebody yelled to him about Ukraine. He essentially said, \"I'm not going to take any questions off-topic.\" I didn't have any economic questions handy, but I had heard somebody say something about inflation. So I asked him, \"Do you think inflation is a political liability ahead of the midterms?\"\n\nThat's it. They're ushering us out: \"Press, you got to go, the meeting has to continue, you have to go.\" They take us down the stairs and at some point, in the bowels of the basement of the White House, my phone lost cell signal, which it does at different places on campus. And I walked back into the door toward my little workspace, which is the door to the briefing room. And there were some reporters there looking at a pool note from the broadcast and somebody said, \"Oh Peter, he called you an SOB.\" I'm thinking, What? Who? I didn't hear anything. I still hadn't seen the clip. And then I went down to the desk that I sit at, which is in the basement of the press area, and my wife had sent me a text. She said, \"Is this you? Was he talking to you?\" And I was so puzzled. And then I saw the pool note and I saw the clip.\n\nI immediately got a call from The Five . They wanted me to come up and react to it, which I did. And I remember-I think it was Dana Perino-asked me during the broadcast if anybody from the White House had called, and I said, \"I don't think anybody's going to call,\" because until that point, after years of being on the Biden beat and some pretty heated exchanges on the campaign trail about various things, I had not heard from him on the phone directly. But sure enough, about half an hour after I said I didn't think a call was coming, my phone rang and somebody asked if I had time to talk to the president. He told me \"It was nothing personal, pal.\" And we had a nice chat for a few minutes.\n\nCan you say anything else about you chatted about?\n\nI told him in the call, \"Mr. President, I am still going to always try to ask questions that nobody else is asking about.\" And he laughed and he said, \"You've got to.\"\n\nYou've previously said, about Biden's first press secretary, Jen Psaki, that \"it never feels like I'm getting smacked down or vice versa.\" Would you say the same thing about Karine Jean-Pierre?\n\nYeah, I would. Her job is to defend the president, and my job is to try to figure out how they can either explain or justify certain positions. She can push back as hard as she wants about a topic or about the way that I ask a question, but there's always going to be a follow-up. And to her credit, there are no topics that they say that they won't touch that I can remember, with the exception of election stuff because of the Hatch Act. But everything policy-wise or Biden-wise, they're good about answering.\n\nDo you have any mixed feelings about how people characterize your interactions with Karine basically as combative clashes? Fox News sometimes frames them that way.\n\nNo. People can call them whatever they want. I am very confident every day when I go into the briefing room with my questions. If they watch my questions, her answers, I think people will actually learn something that can help them make up their mind about how they want to vote in November. So I know that they get characterized different ways by left-leaning outlets and by right-leaning outlets, but I'm very confident in the questions and the news that they make.\n\nCan I ask about your dad, Steve Doocy? Donald Trump, who praised him in the past, recently called him \"an unwatchable RINO.\" Can you explain what's happening here?\n\nI don't think my dad's approach has changed at all the whole time that he's been doing the show, and I pay as close attention as anybody. When I was starting out in this job, I looked at how he prepared as a broadcaster and the approach that he took, and it's always been very, very helpful to me. I have not noticed anything. When he is getting ready, he is basically trying to communicate to the American people either things that he thinks are interesting or things that the butcher at Market Basket told him about a big news story. And I don't think that that has changed.\n\nIt could be that this time next year you're dealing with a Trump press secretary. Do you expect that to be very different?\n\nDifferent how?\n\nWell, one of Trump's previous officials, Kash Patel, recently said that Trump will \"criminally and civilly\" go after his foes in the media.\n\nMy role and my approach would not change at all. In fact, I was in Iowa right around the time of the Democratic primaries and caucuses in January 2020. I had already interviewed every major Democratic candidate. Trump was doing a counterprogramming rally, and I reached out to see if Trump had a couple minutes for an interview, because then that way we would've talked to everybody. He agreed, and I asked him about the stuff that allegedly really annoys him. At the time, somebody asked Michael Bloomberg, \"Is the country ready for another race between two New York billionaires?\" And Bloomberg said, \"Who's the other one?\" I asked Trump about that and he had an answer and we made a lot of news. I think I was the second person to ever ask him on camera about COVID. And so I think the approach would be the same that I have with this president, where you want to know how exactly they're approaching a huge news story, but you also want to know how they feel about the stuff that people are talking about.\n\nDoes the Trump \"enemy of the people\" rhetoric scare you at all?\n\nTo be honest, I truly am so consumed with all things Biden. I haven't seen every single thing that Trump has said. But I would say if he reached the White House, I would expect him to have the same approach as last time where he wants to be the face and the voice of all of these administration policies. I would expect him still to look for opportunities to be out there talking about everything every day, just because that's how he approached it last time. And so I think the big difference would be Donald Trump wants to be his own spokesman. He thinks that he is his best spokesman, and that was a 2020 to 2024 way of looking at things, whereas President Biden takes a traditional approach. He might set the agenda privately, but he wants professional communicators out there as the face and the voice of these policies.\n\nHave you had to fight to separate yourself from the opinion side of Fox at all?\n\nI am not here in this job to be best friends with anybody in the West Wing, but I'm also not trying to make things more personal or nasty than they have to be. I have seen people take that approach, and I don't think it really yields better results, in my opinion. I am overwhelmingly, I think, known as being an affable guy, but I've shown the president and his team that I'll always be standing next to the camera with a question. And they could have stopped calling on me a long time ago, but they haven't. The fact that there are so few events with President Biden is a separate issue, but they could have decided that they don't want to engage us at all. And it doesn't seem like they've decided that. And so that's pretty much my entire approach in a nutshell, in terms of separating myself from a different department or from others. It's really not something I think about.\n\nDo you think that Biden is hiding away? Do you think that they are hiding him away?\n\nI think you can just look at the schedule and look at how many interesting things about current events you've heard him say this year and it's way fewer than his first year, his second year, and most of the third year. It's just less and less. And so it seems like it is probably something the folks in Wilmington want as part of an election year. And it's possible that they change course, and they go to the convention and the polls haven't turned around and suddenly it's like, \"Oh boy, we've got to get this guy out there a bunch more.\" And maybe it'll work, maybe it'll be too late. Don't know.\n\nIt is tough because he, for those first couple years, I remember almost every event that he would give remarks at in the East Room, in the State Dining Room, he would stay at the mic and listen for a question and he would engage multipart questions all the time. And I think he really likes having the chance to do that.\n\nWhen you put him like that, he doesn't sound so \"sleepy.\"\n\nYou said it! I think about this often because we see so little of the president. Right after my paternity leave ended last summer, my first day, I flew to New Mexico for an event with President Biden and there wasn't a ton of press there. And pretty much all press had left and I was just hanging on the press riser and I was trying to get the president's attention. I waved to him and he waved me over and the Secret Service told me that I could jump over a bike rack. And I went up and I asked him a question about some congressional testimony and he didn't like the question, but he answered it and then he walked away. And John Kirby said he did an interview the next day and he said to Martha MacCallum, \"The president knows Peter's not going to ask some softball question about how his vacation was.\" And I think the president should get some credit for that, where he's got Secret Service and he's got control of the drone fleet. They could get rid of me they wanted to.\n\nWord? That's terrifying.\n\nNo, no, no.

      "text": "The Special Counsel's Biden Comments Were a Political Hit Job\n\nOn Thursday, special counsel Robert Hur issued his report on President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents when he was out of office. Much of the focus on the report has been about Hur's description of Biden's memory, which he used as part of his justification for declining to issue a call to prosecute Biden.\n\nIt's a misguided focus. Too little has been said about the Department of Justice's central reason, as described in the report, for declining to issue a charging recommendation against the president: his lack of culpability. It's in stark contrast with the superficially similar other recent case, Donald Trump's alleged criminal mishandling of classified documents following the end of his presidency.\n\nThe key fact in Biden's case is that he cooperated fully in retrieving, turning over to the FBI, and answering all questions about classified documents in his possession, upon his lawyers' discovery of such materials in January 2023. Contrarily, as the report emphasizes, Trump is charged with obstructing the government's 2022 efforts to retrieve all highly classified documents he willfully retained at Mar-a-Lago. He refused to disclose them, provide full information about them, or return them .\n\nThat is why a grand jury indicted Trump in August 2023 for obstruction of justice. The difference with Biden's cooperation couldn't be clearer. Full cooperation signals to prosecutors a person without a criminal state of mind. That's plainly the real reason why Hur, a former Trump-appointed United States attorney , recommended against prosecuting Biden.\n\nHur's 340-page report was released on Thursday. It was the result of a 13-month investigation over the classified documents that President Biden's lawyers found in his office and home last year after Biden instructed them to conduct the search and then to voluntarily return all such documents.\n\nIn another sharp contrast with Trump, Biden also cooperated fully and transparently in Hur's investigation of how it happened. The president even declined the opportunity to redact embarrassing information from the report. Most tellingly, Biden did not even assert executive privilege during his two-day interview with Hur in October.\n\nThere is no mystery about what Trump would have done if still president. He refused to be interviewed when special counsel Robert Mueller investigated the Trump campaign's cooperation with Russia during the 2016 election. And Trump's voluminous history of unsuccessfully asserting executive privilege to shield truth from the American people could fill his presidential library.\n\nBiden's transparency about such information-and his full cooperation in an investigative process that holds a president to public account-was a model for the way honest public servants should conduct themselves in confronting their own mistakes.\n\nConversely, Trump doubled down on far more serious misconduct. For example, he stored highly sensitive national security secrets in places accessible to his country club visitors-and allegedly continued to lie and scheme about them, moving classified documents from place to place to conceal them from federal authorities.\n\nSo let's recognize as partisan talking points the Republican claim that there is some kind of \"double standard\" in Hur's declining to prosecute Biden while a Florida grand jury has indicted Trump for obstructing an investigation. This views the special counsel report through a distorted lens for Republicans' partisan advantage.\n\nThat's not to say Biden's handling of the documents was acceptable before he returned them. Hur's investigation uncovered a February 2017 conversation between Biden and his book ghostwriter. In it, Biden said that he had 'just found all the classified stuff downstairs.'\"\n\nBiden should have immediately returned the documents. In interviewing Biden, Hur found the president's memory of the events from 2017 less than clear, which he characterized as indicative of Biden's age and mental acuity. Memories, however, about events six years earlier are often incomplete, even by witnesses much younger than Biden. Lawyers soundly advise witnesses to say \"I don't recall\" if they have any doubt.\n\nIncomplete recollection was indeed part of Hur's reasoning for concluding that the evidence failed the Justice Department's standards for a prosecution.\n\nMr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury ... as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory... It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him.\n\nBiden pushed back hard Thursday on Hur's description. No doubt Hur provided fodder for Trump and his allies. Doing so was completely unprofessional. The American Bar Association standards of prosecution state :\n\nThe prosecutor may make a public statement explaining why criminal charges have been declined or dismissed but must take care not to ... prejudice the interests of ... . subjects of an investigation.\n\nFor all the world it looks like Hur  learned the wrong lesson from what happened with Hunter Biden's special prosecutor, David Weiss, another Republican, after MAGA world went after Weiss for negotiating a plea deal with Hunter Biden that conformed to prior DOJ settlements of prosecutions for the same crimes. Hur seems to have had a goal of preempting similar attacks on him for exonerating Biden the father-by feeding red meat to MAGA wolves.\n\nA frightened prosecutor is a failed prosecutor.\n\nFor those concerned about the rule of law, it is important to keep our eye on the ball. President Joe Biden corrected his error and cooperated. He did not obstruct. That is why he is not being prosecuted.\n\nIn other words, after making mistakes in 2017, he behaved during this investigation like a president who does not consider himself above the law. That is the polar opposite of Donald Trump.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Biden just quit the race and endorsed Kamala Harris. What happens now?\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDemocrats are taking a leap into the unknown.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nAfter weeks of pressure, conjecture, and handwringing at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, President Joe Biden has decided to step aside from the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe president issued a written statement Sunday afternoon , saying he believes it is in the country's best interest for him to step down, adding that he will address the nation later in the week about his decision. Biden's decision comes after weeks of public and private entreaties from Democrats who have concluded that he is unlikely to defeat former President Donald Trump.\n\nMoments later, Biden released another statement endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to take his spot atop the ticket. Some other leading Democrats - Bill and Hillary Clinton , the Congressional Black Caucus , Sens. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) - quickly endorsed Harris, too, revealing a desire in the party to quickly unite behind her.\n\nSuch endorsements do not make Harris the presidential nominee - the new nominee will be officially chosen by the thousands of delegates attending the Democratic National Convention beginning August 19. But if such endorsements keep piling up, they may deter any other prominent Democrats from challenging Harris and make her nomination all-but-assured.\n\nAlternatively, other Democrats could put their names in contention. What would happen after that is unclear. Some in the party have spoken of a \" blitz primary \" or a truly \" open convention \" where delegates are freed up to support whomever they like. Others view this as chaotic folly. Whether this is at all likely will first depend on whether anyone else jumps in, though.\n\nWhat is clear is that the presidential contest is entering uncharted territory for the modern era. Since the rise of the modern nomination process in the 1970s, no winner of the primaries has quit the race before the convention. And no major-party nominee has entered the race so close to November.\n\nIt's worth pausing to appreciate just what a dramatic turn of events this has been. It was just a few short months ago that President Biden sailed through the primary season with barely any opposition. But now, his party support has collapsed under him to the point where he effectively can't continue his campaign.\n\nPresident Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.\n\nThe catalyst for this collapse was Biden's June 27 debate performance , which will surely now go down as the most catastrophic general election debate in US presidential history. But what the debate actually did was supercharge concerns about Biden's electoral prospects, stamina, health, and capacity that have long simmered below the surface of Democratic politics.\n\nThe doubts about Biden did not begin with the debate, but the debate suddenly made them impossible to ignore - and spurred the party to take action.\n\nWhat will happen next, though, is far from clear. Some Democrats profess to believe that Biden was a uniquely flawed nominee because of his age, and that a different nominee could perform much better against the unpopular Trump . But others are more pessimistic, suspecting that the party faces deeper electoral problems and that any replacement nominee is going to have a very tough road ahead.\n\nAt the start of Biden's first term, many in the political world questioned whether he would run for a second term, for two reasons: One is his age, since he's already the oldest US president ever and would be 82 by Inauguration Day. The other is his bad polling numbers; his job approval has been dismal since late 2021 .\n\nBut Biden doesn't ever appear to have seriously considered not running. He said from the start of his term that he intended to run again, and when Democrats' midterm election performance was better than many expected, it seemed to bolster his case that he could. So he made his reelection campaign official in April 2023 .\n\nAll the party's rising stars opted against launching a risky primary challenge to an incumbent president - doing otherwise would have earned them intense criticism in the party for dividing Democrats and damaging Biden's chances in the general election. So Biden easily fended off challenges from the likes of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) and author Marianne Williamson.\n\nBut doubts remained. Biden skeptics raised eyebrows at his skipping the president's traditional pre-Super Bowl interview, at his reluctance to do press conferences, and at a special counsel report's claims that he seemed to have a poor memory. In February, New York Times columnist (and Vox co-founder) Ezra Klein caused a stir by writing that Democrats should choose a different nominee at the convention, because Biden did not seem up for the rigors of the campaign.\n\nThen, Biden gave a reasonably spirited performance at his State of the Union address in March, temporarily putting those concerns to rest. But it did not improve his polls - by then, he'd consistently trailed Trump nationally and in almost every swing state for months . He looked on track for defeat.\n\nThat's reportedly why Biden's team made the surprising proposal to debate Trump so early, a very unusual move. The hope was that Biden could, with a vigorous performance, reset the race, refocus attention on Trump, and address concerns about his age again.\n\nThe opposite happened: Biden's halting performance put a spotlight on his capacity to campaign (and serve another four years) that never went away.\n\nHe lost the media first. In the hours after the debate, various liberal commentators called on him to quit the race. Mainstream journalists, sensing scandal and a cover-up, intensely focused on reporting out Biden's true condition .\n\nStill, Biden hoped that he could keep the party on board by doing a flurry of interviews and public events, showing the debate was a one-off. Some of these went reasonably well , others less so . But his fundraising plummeted , and the public and private pressure from Democrats urging him to step aside just kept increasing - until Biden finally saw the writing on the wall.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nObviously, much will depend on who the nominee is. Clearly, Vice President Harris is the top contender at the moment. If the party simply falls in line behind her, there may not be much suspense by the time the Democratic convention kicks off on August 19. If there is a serious contest, though, strap in for a roller coaster ride over the next month.\n\nBut there's another big underlying question that we don't yet know the answer to. Namely, how much are Democrats' electoral woes about Joe Biden himself - and how much reflect deeper problems for the party as a whole?\n\nSome argue that Democrats are doing fine, and that it's only Biden that's been the problem; that voters have soured on the president because of his age or perceived incapacity to serve another four years, and because Trump remains flawed and unpopular, and another Democratic nominee would likely beat him. For instance, Democratic Senate incumbents are polling significantly better than Biden. That implies to some that with a different name at the top of the ticket, the party would be in great shape.\n\nOthers argue that Democrats' problems will likely outlast Biden. Unhappiness with inflation under Biden, as well as unfolding foreign tumult , may have convinced voters that Trump wasn't so bad after all. Public opinion on key issues has moved right. And there isn't much polling showing any possible Democratic alternative beating Trump.\n\nSome of these pessimists still believe it was worth pushing out Biden since he had little prospect of turning things around, but they emphasize that any replacement would be the underdog and face a very tough road ahead.\n\nAll we know for sure now is that Democrats have decided to roll the dice, ditching their unpopular nominee in hopes of improving their odds in a contest they were on track to lose.\n\nUpdate, July 21, 3:50 pm: This piece was originally published earlier on July 21 and has been updated to include more information about the Democratic National Convention's options going forward.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIn an Oval Office speech, Biden said his farewells. But his job isn't done yet.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday night in the culmination of a pivotal few weeks that saw him relinquish the Democratic presidential nomination - an act that may one day be the defining moment of his political career.\n\nThe speech was an attempt to exit political life gracefully, but it also served as a reminder that only days after the president announced his unprecedented decision, the nation has already moved on.\n\nDemocratic delegates quickly consolidated behind Biden's chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, and nearly 90 percent of Democratic voters surveyed said he made the right choice in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS . The media limelight has shifted to Harris, the new presumptive Democratic nominee, and what her presidency would look like . And Democrats have been able to refocus with renewed enthusiasm on their task at hand, which is beating former President Donald Trump.\n\nThat's left Biden suddenly in the role of elder statesman. Under extraordinary circumstances just months before the 2024 election, he's unexpectedly fulfilled his 2020 promise to become a \" bridge \" to the next generation of leadership.\n\n\"I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said in his speech. \"It is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nNow that he's done so, the question arises: What, if anything, is left for an outgoing president to do?\n\nBiden himself insists that his work is not done, and made it clear Wednesday night that he wants to tie up loose ends on policy. For instance, he promised to continue his efforts to protect democracy, at home and abroad. And he's vowed to deliver a ceasefire in Gaza before he leaves office.\n\nBut beyond Biden's legacy - and the needs of the country - there's still a campaign going on. So what role can he play in both?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.\n\nStrategists and pollsters agree: Biden can be useful to Harris on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden clearly thinks so too. On Monday, he said at a campaign event in Delaware via teleconference, \"I'm going to be on the road, and I'm not going anywhere.\" He reiterated his support for Harris Wednesday night: \"She's tough; she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\"\n\nChuck Rocha, a former senior adviser for Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign, said that Biden has an opportunity to help Harris with union members and white working-class voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan - groups that helped power his 2020 victory .\n\nEvan Roth Smith, lead pollster for Blueprint, said that Biden also needs to speak to the voters who have been most loyal to him, even over the course of the last month, and tell them that it's important that they not just turn out to vote for Harris, but knock on doors on her behalf.\n\nFernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster, said that Biden can reassert the successes of his administration as a \"political wind behind the sails of the Kamala campaign,\" emphasizing her role in getting things done.\n\nBut Harris also has the unusual opportunity to get a second chance at a first impression and to define herself outside of being Biden's vice president. Voters don't associate her as much with the issues on which they rated the administration poorly, like inflation and immigration, Roth Smith said.\n\n\"So she has this important opportunity to distance herself a little bit,\" he said. \"It's important to not squander that and not overly tie her to Biden.\"\n\nBiden also risks generating further questions about whether or not he should continue as president until the end of his term if he participates in the kinds of campaign events in which he has proven more likely to commit verbal flubs, Amandi said. Though Amandi added that he believes Biden wouldn't complete his term if the president and his doctors didn't think him capable, Republicans have recently argued that Biden is not fit for office and should step down now .\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure on Biden to get out there, particularly following the debate performance, and do the kinds of events that he was less comfortable doing,\" Roth Smith said. \"He doesn't need to do those kinds of events anymore ... We don't necessarily need him all over the campaign trail.\"\n\nThat's especially the case given that, soon, Harris will have another major surrogate on her team in the form of her vice presidential candidate. Once she chooses a running mate, \"there will literally be three people who can help bring this thing home for November for the Democrats,\" two of which - Harris and her vice presidential pick - can provide \"a fresh-faced contrast to Donald Trump,\" Rocha said.\n\nEssentially, the move for Biden experts say, is for him to help out Harris where he can, but not overexpose himself. Biden seemed to recognize Wednesday that it was time for him to take something of a step back. \"I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,\" he said. \"There is also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. That time and place is now.\"\n\nStrategists and pollsters told me that Biden should focus on being president for the remainder of his time in office, and as he noted in his speech, that's what he intends to do.\n\n\"An important role for the president is to be this statesman, to show that Democrats can govern,\" Roth Smith said.\n\nBeing competent, while finding opportunities to remind voters of the accomplishments of his administration - from the Inflation Reduction Act to the bipartisan infrastructure law - is one of the best ways he can support Harris.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration has a fantastic story to tell,\" Amandi said. \"It was a story that had been undermined by the legitimate concerns about whether or not the president could continue another four years.\"\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that \"Biden's ability to do anything truly substantive is muted\" given that he faces a divided Congress and election season is in full swing. But there are certain things that the president can do unilaterally.\n\nFor one, Americans are depending on his vast foreign policy experience at a tenuous moment for the Middle East and Europe. In his speech, he said he would seek to \"bring peace and security to the Middle East\" and keep rallying a coalition of nations to stop the Russian takeover of Ukraine, bolstering NATO and US allies in the Pacific. All that may not be achievable in five months, but he can work on making visible progress.\n\nBiden may also look for domestic policy wins on issues that had dogged his candidacy, including immigration and inflation, which seems to be improving in time for the Federal Reserve to likely cut interest rates later this year. He can also highlight accomplishments on lesser-known, but still incredibly popular policies such as negotiating decreases in drug prices for Americans on Medicare. On Wednesday, he highlighted proposed Supreme Court reforms and his cancer \"moonshot\" among his priorities.\n\nAnd as the administration makes progress, Biden needs to make sure he is \"sharing the stage,\" Roth Smith said.\n\n\"If there is going to be a great inflation report or a consumer confidence report, [Harris] needs to get credit for that,\" he added.\n\nThat also serves the dual purpose of solidifying Biden's legacy and increasing his approval rating, which Kondik said is also helpful to Harris.\n\n\"I think President Biden will leave office in January with significantly higher approval ratings because the one obstacle to judging him in the context of his success has now been removed, which is the concern that he would seek reelection at an age where his physical limitations wouldn't allow him to continue,\" Amandi said.\n\nThe stakes are still high for Democrats. Biden's remaining time in office has the potential to lay the groundwork for a smooth transition to another Democratic administration that could protect the policies he set in motion. But as Biden himself has put it, before anyone - even Harris - can take over, he has to \" finish the job .\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

      "text": "Democrats are finally taking on Biden - and giving the party a chance to win\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nPelosi, Schumer, and Obama have all signaled to Joe that it's time to go.\n\nby Eric Levitz\n\nIn late June, Democrats throughout the country simultaneously realized that their presidential nominee could no longer reliably speak in complete sentences.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's age was no secret, but the extent of his cognitive and rhetorical decline had been closely guarded . The president spoke in public far less often than his predecessors. He repeatedly turned down Super Bowl interviews , rare opportunities to convey his message to a massive national audience.\n\nThis limited calendar set off alarm bells among some pundits . Still, it was possible to imagine that the White House team was unduly risk-averse. Biden's age was undoubtedly a liability, and his rhetorical chops significantly diminished, but maybe he was still okay. Given widespread doubts about his vice president's electability , unifying behind Biden was plausibly the party's best bet.\n\nUntil it wasn't.\n\nThe president's disastrous debate performance broke through Democrats' collective denial. The simplest explanation had been the correct one: The White House had been hiding Biden from the public because he had something to hide.\n\nThere was no precedent for the challenge this posed to the Democratic Party, and there was no straightforward mechanism for resolving it.\n\nFor weeks, Democratic leaders floundered in search of a consensual path forward. Some entertained blindly following Biden into the wilderness.\n\nAfter some delay, however, party leaders prioritized their constituents' interests in victory over their own desire to avoid blame or interpersonal conflict. Over the past 24 hours, it has become clear that the Democrats are in array.\n\nOn Wednesday, ABC News revealed that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had personally told Biden last Saturday that he could best serve the party by getting out of the race. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told him the same . Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, told the president that polling showed he could not beat former President Donald Trump and that staying in the race would destroy Democrats' prospects of winning back control of the House.\n\nWhen the president refused to take this advice, all three Democratic leaders evidently let word of their views leak. When confronted with reports of their private conversations with Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, and Jeffries all pointedly refused to deny the accuracy of such news stories.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has come under mounting pressure from Democrats to reconsider his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg - who has served as Biden's campaign adviser and conduit to deep-pocketed Democrats in Hollywood and finance - told the president that donors were withdrawing their support out of a conviction that he cannot win, a development that would make it difficult to sustain an adequate presence on swing-state airwaves through November.\n\nAround the same time, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) scrapped plans to formally confirm Biden as the party's nominee in a virtual roll call vote next week. That event had initially been scheduled when it looked as though waiting until the Democratic National Convention in late August to officially nominate a candidate would deprive the Democratic nominee of access to the ballot in Ohio. But the DNC persisted with plans for a roll call even after Ohio passed a law resolving that issue . The virtual nomination process therefore came to be seen as a tool for Biden to run out the clock and foist himself upon a mutinous party.\n\nSchumer and other top Democrats implored the DNC to postpone the roll call, which is now scheduled for the first week in August.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, the Washington Post reported that former President Barack Obama had \"told allies in recent days that President Biden's path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy.\" When asked about this revelation, a spokesman for Obama declined to deny it.\n\nThis concerted pressure campaign from blue America's most powerful political and economic actors appears to be paying dividends.\n\nThe Times reported Wednesday that Biden has \"become more receptive in the last several days to hearing arguments about why he should drop his re-election bid,\" and \"been willing to listen to rundowns of new and worrying polling data and has asked questions about how Vice President Kamala Harris could win.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Axios reported that several \"top Democrats privately tell us the rising pressure of party congressional leaders and close friends will persuade President Biden to decide to drop out of the presidential race, as soon as this weekend.\"\n\nWhether Biden does, in fact, step aside remains to be seen. But whatever the president does from here, the Democratic Party as an institution has done its part. Congressional leaders cannot drag Biden kicking and screaming from the campaign trail, but they are doing just about everything in their power to depose him and give their party a better chance of keeping Trump and his allies out of power.\n\nI've been critical of the Democratic leadership's apparent complacency in recent weeks, but there is no question that Biden's decline put them in a genuinely difficult position. American political parties are weak and disorganized. Power is much less centralized within national leadership than it is in most parliamentary democracies. And unlike parliamentary parties, Democratic congressional caucuses cannot remove politically damaged presidents through a vote of no confidence.\n\nRemoving a presidential nominee - against their will, after they have already won an overwhelming majority of primary votes - is a task for which American parties have no manual.\n\nThus, to mount a concerted campaign to push Biden to the sidelines, Democratic leaders had to be willing to stick their necks out, without the protection of any legitimizing precedent. It was entirely plausible that they might lack the will to do this.\n\nAfter all, the president did not bend in the face of his fellow Democrats' doubts and attacked those calling for his exit as \" bedwetters \" and anti-democratic \" elites .\" Meanwhile, few in the party had much confidence in the electability of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat best positioned to inherit the nomination should Biden step aside. And although Biden lost support in national public polls following his debate performance, Trump's advantage stayed below 3 percentage points in polling averages. Harris has been performing slightly better than Biden in polls against Trump, but the difference is fairly marginal.\n\nThus, for self-interested, risk-averse politicians, it would have been tempting to conclude that the party was going to lose no matter what they did, and it would be better to let Biden take the blame than claim ownership of Harris's inevitable loss.\n\nRejecting such fatalism required both commitment to the best interests of the party writ large and a modicum of sophistication in political analysis.\n\nHarris does appear most likely to inherit the Democratic nomination, should Biden step aside. And it's true that she does not currently look like an especially formidable candidate. But her disapproval rating is lower than Biden's . Voters' views of her are less fixed. She therefore offers a higher upside. And when you are heading toward near-certain defeat with a candidate who's been losing in swing-state polls for months - and is physically incapable of communicating effectively with the public - it's better to roll the dice on a candidate with a higher ceiling, even if she has a potentially lower floor.\n\nThat said, if Democratic leaders believe that the party could consolidate around a stronger standard-bearer - perhaps, one with a proven record of winning office in a swing state - they should work toward achieving that outcome.\n\nIn any event, persisting with Biden would be profoundly damaging for the Democratic Party. It would force many Democrats to repeatedly tell a lie, and one that an overwhelming majority of voters recognize as such: that Biden is clearly fit to serve another four years as president.\n\nAccording to the Times , one recent internal Democratic poll indicated \"that voters are deeply distrustful of elected officials who vouch for the president's mental capacity and endorse him.\" Whatever one makes of Harris's odds, avoiding tainting down-ballot Democrats' perceived integrity in the eyes of swing voters is grounds enough for making the switch.\n\nIt is still conceivable - if doubtful - that Biden will refuse to step down. At this point, his persistence will tell us more about his personal pathologies than those of his party.\n\nFaced with an unprecedented political crisis, Democratic leaders unified behind a coherent strategy to advance the party's best interests, in defiance of a president who struggled to recognize the unsustainability of his position. With Biden's belated help, and further strategic ruthlessness, they will give their coalition a fighting chance to win in November.

      "text": "Biden's new Supreme Court reform proposals are mostly useless\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe president is finally going after the high court, but his ideas are pretty weak.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nOn Monday, President Joe Biden announced three proposals to reform the Supreme Court : term limits for justices, a binding code of Supreme Court ethics, and a constitutional amendment overturning the Court's decision allowing sitting presidents to violate the criminal law . Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee, also endorsed the proposals .\n\nBut if you're hoping these ideas will rein in a Court that's essentially become the policymaking arm of the Republican Party , expect to be disappointed. Amending the Constitution is virtually impossible - it requires approval from three-quarters of the states - so Biden's proposal to amend the Constitution to overturn the presidential immunity decision in Trump v. United States (2024) is almost certainly dead on arrival. Similarly, the term limits proposal is at odds with Article III of the Constitution, which provides that justices \" shall hold their offices during good behaviour ,\" language that's historically been understood to protect judges unless they engage in serious misconduct . So that proposal is equally dead.\n\nProposing a constitutional amendment is not entirely useless. By proposing two amendments targeting the Supreme Court, Biden makes clear that his Democratic Party opposes much of the Court's recent behavior, much like President George W. Bush used a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in 2004 to communicate to voters that Republicans were the anti-gay party. But Bush's amendment was never enacted, and Biden's amendments almost certainly won't become law, either.\n\nThe call for a binding ethics code, by contrast, could potentially impose some limited constraints on the Court. The Constitution states that most of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction must be exercised \" under such regulations as the Congress shall make .\" So Congress should have the power to enact a Supreme Court ethics code with an ordinary statute, rather than with a constitutional amendment.\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nIt's unclear, though, whether the justices would follow such a code if Congress enacted one. At least one justice, Samuel Alito, has claimed that such an ethics code would be unconstitutional . If Congress were to pass such a code, and the justices wanted to ignore it, all they'd need to do is sign onto whatever argument Alito came up with to justify striking down the code.\n\nEven if the same justices who concluded that presidents are above the law decided not to declare themselves immune from ethical reform, a binding ethics code would do little to cure the Court's partisanship. While two of the justices, Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas, accepted lavish gifts from Republican billionaires , seven of the nine justices have thus far not been caught in similar scandals. Four of the Court's six Republicans might not be affected in any serious way by an ethics reform law.\n\nWhile a binding ethics code might stop Thomas from sailing around the world on billionaire Harlan Crow's yacht , it wouldn't stop him from voting to, say, eliminate freedom of the press .\n\nBiden's proposals, in other words, are mostly symbolic. The ethics proposal is meaningful but limited in scope. And the two other proposals? They won't accomplish anything that couldn't also be accomplished by a presidential press conference denouncing the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Constitution, according to University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson, \"is the most difficult to amend or update of any constitution currently existing in the world today.\" Three-quarters of the states must ratify any constitutional amendment , a requirement that virtually ensures that either major political party can block any amendment, even if the other party wins supermajorities in Congress.\n\nThis explains why the Constitution has only been amended 27 times in all of American history, and 10 of those amendments was the Bill of Rights, which was enacted almost immediately after the Constitution took effect. The last time the Constitution was amended was more than 30 years ago, in 1992 . And that was a very minor amendment involving congressional pay.\n\nAs President Franklin Roosevelt once said, \"No amendment which any powerful economic interests or the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to oppose has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable time.\" Indeed, as a practical matter, any amendment is likely to fail if it garners opposition from any substantial interest group. American history is replete with popular proposed amendments that failed because of strong but narrow opposition from such a group.\n\nIn 1924, supermajorities in Congress proposed a constitutional amendment to overrule the Supreme Court's decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918), which struck down a federal ban on child labor. The amendment died largely due to opposition from cotton mill owners, but oddly enough also because of opposition from the Catholic Church, which feared that a child labor amendment would lead to federal regulation of parochial schools.\n\nSimilarly, the Equal Rights Amendment, which would have written gender equality into the Constitution, seemed destined to become law after Congress proposed it in 1972 . In one year alone, 22 states ratified it. But then anti-feminist activists like Phyllis Schlafly organized against it , spreading fears that the amendment would mandate unisex bathrooms and even lead to (gasp!) same-sex marriages.\n\nIn the end, the required 38 states did ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, but not before a 1982 deadline set by Congress .\n\nThere is, however, a lesson to be garnered from these two failed amendments. A federal child labor ban is now law , not because proponents of the child labor amendment eventually overcame opposition from the cotton mills but because the Supreme Court overruled Hammer in 1941 after Roosevelt appointed several new justices to the Court .\n\nThe ERA is not part of the Constitution, but a series of Supreme Court decisions - many of which were argued by future Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg - established that \"a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an 'exceedingly persuasive justification' for the classification .\" Thus implementing a prohibition on sex discrimination by the government that is almost as strong as the prohibition proposed by the ERA.\n\nIf Democrats want to overturn the Supreme Court's error in the Trump decision, in other words, their best bet is to follow the same playbook Republicans followed to overturn decisions like Roe v. Wade .\n\nBecause it is virtually impossible to amend the Constitution by writing a new amendment into the document, constitutional disputes in the United States are resolved by the judicial appointments process.\n\nWhoever controls the Supreme Court controls the Constitution.\n\nPresident Biden's term limits proposal calls for \"a system in which the President would appoint a Justice every two years to spend eighteen years in active service on the Supreme Court .\" This is a longstanding proposal that has, at times, enjoyed bipartisan support. Former Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry, for example, offered a similar proposal in a 2010 book .\n\nIt's hard to imagine such an idea garnering Republican support today. Republicans, after all, enjoy a supermajority on the current Supreme Court. Term limits endanger GOP control of the judiciary.\n\nThe Constitution is widely understood to allow justices to serve for life. That said, there are some academic arguments that the Constitution's language allowing justices to keep their \"office\" during \"good behaviour\" isn't entirely airtight.\n\nI've argued, for example, that future appointees to the Supreme Court could potentially be term-limited without a constitutional amendment because they could be appointed to a different \"office\" - one that only allows them to sit on the nation's highest Court for 18 years before they are rotated onto a lower court . But even if this argument is correct, it won't do anything about the Court's current 6-3 Republican supermajority.\n\nOther scholars have made other arguments that could support imposing term limits with an ordinary act of Congress. Yale law professor Jack Balkin, for example, suggested that justices who have served more than 18 years could be stripped of most, but not all, of their authority to hear cases .\n\nBut let's be realistic. If Congress does enact an ordinary law imposing term limits on the justices, the constitutionality of that law would ultimately be resolved by the Supreme Court. And unlike, say, Donald Trump's arguments that he was allowed to commit crimes while he was president , the argument that justices serve for life actually has a strong basis in the Constitution's text.\n\nSo the likelihood that the justices would allow themselves to be term-limited, at least without a constitutional amendment, is vanishingly small. The justices obviously have an interest in keeping their jobs. And the text of the Constitution is actually on their side.\n\nEthics reform would do nothing to make the Supreme Court less partisan or less ideological, but it could prevent Justice Thomas from taking millions of dollars in gifts from Republican billionaires. It could also stop Justice Alito from going on another $100,000 trip paid for by a different GOP billionaire.\n\nThese are worthy goals. Thomas's and Alito's corruption would not be tolerated in any other part of the federal government. Members of Congress and their staff, for example, are typically forbidden from accepting gifts worth more than $50 .\n\nThere are, however, good reasons to doubt whether the justices would comply with a law prohibiting corrupt behavior. In a 2023 interview published in the Wall Street Journal, for example, Alito claimed that \" no provision in the Constitution gives [Congress] the authority to regulate the Supreme Court - period .\"\n\nAlito is incorrect. Article III of the Constitution provides that the Court must exercise its authority to hear appeals from lower courts \" under such regulations as the Congress shall make .\" But the text of the Constitution also means little if a majority of the justices are willing to ignore it.\n\nThus far, moreover, the Court has allowed Alito to get away with defying Congress. Last May, after Alito was caught flying two flags associated with the MAGA movement and efforts to overturn President Biden's victory in the 2020 election (Alito has blamed the flags on his wife), several members of Congress asked Alito to recuse from cases involving Trump's failed attempt to steal the election and the January 6 insurrection.\n\nAlito's recusal was arguably required by a federal statute, which provides that \"any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned .\" But in his letter refusing to recuse, Alito rather pointedly ignored this statute, instead pointing to the Court's non-binding internal ethics code, which states that \"a justice is presumed impartial and has an obligation to sit unless disqualified,\" to justify remaining on two cases.\n\nAlito, in other words, seems to believe that only the Court gets to decide which ethical rules the justices must follow. And no justice stepped in when Alito thumbed his nose at the recusal statute enacted by Congress.\n\nWhich isn't to say that Alito's misbehavior is a reason for Congress to stay its hand. No government official should be allowed to accept lavish gifts from politically interested billionaires. And a federal statute could potentially open corrupt justices like Thomas or Alito to real consequences or even prosecution, even if that prosecution were eventually struck down by Thomas and Alito's fellow justices.\n\nBut the fact remains that ethics reform would be limited in scope. It would not stop the justices from implementing Republican Party policies from the bench. And it would likely lead to a protracted battle with justices who believe that ethical constraints are for people less important than them.\n\nOne pathology of the Constitution is that it does not permit moderate judicial reforms such as term limits, but it absolutely permits highly disruptive solutions such as adding more seats to the Supreme Court and immediately filling them with Democrats. The Constitution permits Congress to decide how many justices there will be, and that number has varied from as few as five to as many as ten.\n\nBut court-packing is a dangerous proposal that threatens to delegitimize the entire federal judiciary , including decisions that are far less reckless than the Court's decision in Trump . And it could trigger massive resistance in red states that may not voluntarily comply with a decision that, say, reinstates abortion rights - at least if that decision comes from a packed Court. It could also set off a cycle of retribution where each party adds seats to the Supreme Court whenever it controls Congress and the presidency until the Court has dozens of justices, all of whom are political hacks.\n\nI've argued that court-packing is justified if the justices become an existential threat to US democracy but it is a weapon that Congress should deploy only as a last resort.\n\nCongress does have other ways to rein in a rogue judiciary. While the Constitution forbids Congress from reducing the justices' salaries , it could strip the Court of its staff and evict the justices from their government-provided office space. The Constitution also permits Congress to make \"exceptions\" to the Court's jurisdiction, a provision that arguably allows it to strip away the justices' power to hear certain matters .\n\nStill, a jurisdiction-stripping law could run into the same problems that could face a congressionally imposed ethics code. If the justices don't want to be bound by it, they could simply strike it down.\n\nRealistically, in other words, the most promising way to eradicate decisions like Trump and to fill the Court with justices who will not mimic Thomas or Alito's corruption is the same way that Republicans eliminated decisions like Roe that they disapprove of. Democrats need to win elections while simultaneously organizing against Supreme Court decisions they don't like .\n\nTrump was a 6-3 decision. It is two Supreme Court appointments away from becoming a bad memory of a more authoritarian era.\n\nMen like Thomas and Alito, in other words, are likely to be defeated at the polls or not at all. If voters do not want to be ruled by these men, they can frustrate them by voting to elect Kamala Harris and a Democratic Congress in November. And then they can keep doing so until Republicans are in the minority on the Supreme Court.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "President Biden pardons family members in final minutes of presidency\n\nBiden issued pardons to several family members Monday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued pardons to several close family members Monday in the final minutes of his presidency .\n\n\"My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me -- the worst kind of partisan politics,\" Biden wrote in a statement. \"Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end.\"\n\n\"That is why I am exercising my power under the Constitution to pardon James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,\" he continued. \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\"\n\nThe five preemptive pardons were issued to James Biden, Joe's younger brother; Sara Jones Biden, James' wife; Valerie Biden Owens, Joe's younger sister; John T. Owens', Valerie's husband; and Francis W. Biden, Joe's younger brother.\n\nWhile he was sitting in the Capitol Rotunda attending the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, Biden announced the preemptive pardons for his siblings and in-laws.\n\n\"I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics. But baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage their reputations and finance,\" Biden said.\n\n\"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,\" Biden said.\n\nThis comes after Biden issued a controversial pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, in early December over tax evasion and federal gun charges. Biden had repeatedly said he did not plan to pardon Hunter.\n\nJames Biden, 75, has especially come under fire from Republicans.\n\nCongressional Republicans have pressed the incoming Justice Department to bring charges against James Biden for allegedly lying to Congress as part of its impeachment inquiry into the outgoing president and his family.\n\nPaul Fishman, an attorney who represents James and Sara Biden, said in a statement to ABC News, \"Jim and Sara Biden did not seek this pardon because they have never committed any crimes. But for the reasons the President described, they have accepted it.\"\n\nJames Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, wrote to incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday seeking to hold James Biden accountable for \"having misled Congress regarding Joe Biden's participation in his family's influence peddling and deserving of prosecution under federal law.\"\n\nComer and his Republican colleagues had already issued a criminal referral for James Biden to the Justice Department. Comer reacted to the preemptive pardons of Biden's family, saying they serve as \"a confession of their corruption.\"\n\nThe pardon warrant, signed Jan. 19, excuses James Biden and the other family members of \"ANY NONVIOLENT OFFENSES against the United States which they may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014, through the date of this pardon.\"\n\nThese were the second preemptive pardons issued by the outgoing president on Monday, not an unusual act for departing leaders. He also issued pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 committee.\n\n\"Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy,\" Biden said in a statement. \"Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties.\"\n\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The President's Daily Brief is no longer being provided to former President Biden.\"\n\nAndrew Weissman, who has most recently been a commentator on MSNBC, served as the chief prosecutor in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mark Zaid is a national security lawyer who represented the whistleblower at the heart of the Trump first impeachment inquiry involving Ukraine. Eisen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an attorney and a CNN legal analyst and co-founder of the States United Democracy Center.\n\nIn February, Trump issued an executive order to start the process of revoking security clearances held by dozens of intelligence officials he says falsely claimed in a letter during the 2020 election season that Hunter Biden's laptop contained Russian disinformation.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What might President Biden's legacy be?\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  January 19, 2025 / 11:17 AM EST / CBS News\n\nOn the eve of President Joe Biden's departure from the White House, we've asked historian Douglas Brinkley for his assessment of our 46th president:\n\nWhen President Richard Nixon died in 1994, most Americans thought instantly of one word: Watergate. They didn't think of the EPA, the vital government agency Nixon created. Nor did they think of China, the country he visited as president and strengthened diplomatic ties with. No, the country remembered him, above all, for his foulest political blunder.\n\nWhether the same fate will befall Joe Biden remains to be seen.\n\nHis achievements are tangible and numerous. Enrollment in the Affordable Care Act has nearly doubled from four years ago. Biden got more federal judges confirmed than any president in a single term (save Jimmy Carter). His steadfast support for Ukraine and NATO expansion, at a time of creeping autocracy in Europe, was heroic.\n\nBut Biden's mistakes cost him, and his country, dearly. He appointed an attorney general, Merrick Garland, whose painstaking scrupulousness delayed, and ultimately doomed, the DOJ's prosecution of Donald Trump. Furthermore, Biden undermined his own credibility by pardoning his son after repeatedly vowing not to.\n\nAnother broken promise proved far more consequential. Biden's implicit campaign pledge in 2020 that his presidency would serve as a \"bridge\" to a new generation of leaders rang hollow when he ran for re-election four years later. When he reluctantly handed the reins to his vice president, Kamala Harris, he put her in an inauspicious position from which she didn't recover.\n\nBiden's mistaken conviction that he, and he alone, could defeat the man he considered a threat to the democratic order is the very reason that man will place his hand on the Bible tomorrow.\n\nOver his 50 years of public service, Joe Biden has proved himself a patriot. But for all his basic decency, history may come to remember him for another trait: hubris.\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Robert Marston.

      "text": "New book on Biden by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson reports a 'cover-up' about his decline\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nThe day after Donald Trump won the 2024 election, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson decided to co-author a book about what had led the Democratic party to defeat, with a focus on former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe deeply sourced reporters found what they call a \"cover-up\" of the former president's \"serious decline.\"\n\nThe resulting book, titled \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" is coming out on May 20.\n\nThe book's publisher, Penguin Press, announced the project on Wednesday.\n\n\"What you will learn makes President Biden's decision to run for reelection seem shockingly narcissistic, self-delusional, and reckless - a desperate bet that went bust - and part of a larger act of extended public deception that has few precedents,\" Penguin said in a press release.\n\nBiden, \"his family, and his senior aides were so convinced that only he could beat Trump again, they lied to themselves, allies, and the public about his condition and limitations,\" the press release stated.\n\n\"Toni Morrison once said 'If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it,'\" Jake Tapper said in a statement. \"That's what inspired this book: we wanted to know more about what we all just lived through. More than 200 interviews later, Alex and I have a much better idea. And soon you all will too.\"\n\nTapper had a unique vantage point as the co-moderator of the June 2024 CNN debate that led Biden to drop out of the presidential race a few weeks later.\n\nTapper and Thompson write in the book that \"what the world saw at Joe Biden's one and only debate was not an anomaly - it was not a cold, it was not someone who was under or overprepared, it was not someone who was just a little tired. It was the natural result of an eighty-one-year-old man whose faculties had been diminishing for years.\"\n\n\"Biden, his family, and his team let their self-interest and fear of another Trump term justify trying to put an at times addled old man in the Oval Office for four more years,\" the authors write. \"What was the extent of it? Was it a cover-up? Was it a conspiracy? We will let the facts speak for themselves.\"\n\nThe rest of the book is subject to a strict embargo, as is often the case with forthcoming releases that contain big scoops.\n\n\"Original Sin\" is one of several forthcoming books relating to the 2024 election. During Biden's four years in office, there was a general impression among editors and publishers that the book-buying public had little appetite for books about Biden - in sharp contrast to the hunger for books about all things Trump.\n\nThompson, who is also a CNN contributor, actually had an earlier book deal to write about Biden's presidency, and his original publisher, Simon & Schuster, withdrew the contract in 2023. Politico called it \"a further reflection of the soft market for books\" about Biden.\n\nBut book industry perceptions changed after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris, and even more so after Harris lost to Trump.\n\nTapper and Thompson decided to zoom in on what they dub Biden's \"original sin\" - his decision to run for a second term.\n\n\"The irony is biting: In the name of defeating what they called an existential threat to democracy, Biden and his inner circle ensured it, tossing aside his implicit promise to serve for only one term, denying the existence of health issues the nation had been watching for years, dooming the Democrats to defeat,\" the publisher stated in the promotional material for the book. \"The decision to run again, the Original Sin of this president, led to a campaign of denial and gaslighting, leading directly to Donald Trump's return to power and all that has happened as a consequence.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Inside Biden's unprecedented exit from the presidential race\n\nFollow:\n\nIn the end, President Joe Biden exited the political stage in isolation.\n\nAfter weeks of fighting for his political life - insisting he wasn't going anywhere following a disastrous debate performance - the president's about-face did not come in an Oval Office address or a speech on the campaign trail. Instead, it came in letter posted to social media as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware.\n\nIt was a low-key way to reveal one of the most historic decisions in modern American politics, but time was not on Biden's side to reach a decision or make an announcement. Never before has a president left a reelection race this close to Election Day - and for 24 days it seemed as if he were stubbornly planning to ride out the storm that followed the June 27 CNN debate in Atlanta.\n\nHe spent the three weeks after the debate repeating that he was staying in the race against former President Donald Trump . The president dug in. He insisted he could beat Trump. His inner circle shrank to his closest aides and family. He was forced to retreat to Delaware, where he reached a decision in the last day and a half, finally conceding that a man loyal to the Democratic Party for more than half a century was seen as a drag on the ticket.\n\nRelated article What are your questions about the presidential election now that Biden is out?\n\nBut in the end, the pressure on Biden from party leaders, rank-and-file lawmakers and donors - and the polling showing the perilous and potentially insurmountable path Biden faced amid a growing deficit with Trump - ultimately proved too much. Described as being more isolated than he had ever been , Biden could not withstand the push behind the scenes and in public. The blunt reality became a chorus of voices calling for the president to exit the race, like a boulder rolling down a mountain that only picked up momentum with each passing day.\n\nThe president's team wanted the June CNN debate with Trump - months earlier than typical presidential debates - to shake up a race that Biden was trailing. They succeeded, but not in the way they had intended.\n\nInstead, Biden's campaign unraveled over the course of the next 24 days. Everything the president and his team tried to do to calm Democrats' fears simply failed to shed the perception that Biden's age was too advanced, and his health too fragile, for him to stay in the race.\n\nWith two posts on X Sunday afternoon, Biden bowed out of the race and threw his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, in the hopes of quickly coalescing their party and moving past the chaos that had engulfed Democrats since the debate.\n\nIt's a high-risk, high-reward gamble for Democrats, resetting a campaign Biden was losing with a new nominee just 107 days before the election. It comes as Trump is at his strongest point in the campaign, coming out of a completely unified Republican National Convention with a base rallying around him after the attempt on his life .\n\nBiden's final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone while recovering from Covid. A source familiar with the matter said the plans to exit the race began Saturday night and were finalized Sunday.\n\nThe adviser said the president \"was not dug in\" but was studying the data coming in and became convinced he would \"weigh down\" the ticket and be a complication to defeating Trump.\n\nBiden's decision did not have to do with any medical issues, a senior White House official told CNN.\n\nWhen Biden huddled with his two closest advisers Saturday, the information they provided on polling and where top Democratic officials stood underscored that a path to victory was \"basically nonexistent,\" according to another person familiar with the matter.\n\nThere wasn't any single poll number, wavering Democratic official or fundraiser presented in the meeting with longtime aides Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti that pushed Biden toward his decision, the person said.\n\nInstead, the information highlighted that the path back to a viable campaign had been severely damaged by declining national and swing-state poll numbers, along with party defections that were likely to rapidly accelerate. The information included polling and details gathered from outreach outside Biden's inner circle.\n\nUnlike 2015, when Biden wrote in his book \"Promise me, Dad\" that Donilon told the then-vice president he shouldn't launch a 2016 bid for president as he grieved the death of his son Beau, neither aide explicitly told Biden he should get out of the race, according to the person.\n\nRelated article What happens in the Democratic nomination now that Biden has left the race\n\nBiden made clear before the end of the meeting that he was planning to pull out of the race and asked his aides to start drafting the letter he posted Sunday afternoon and preparing the plans for the rollout.\n\nStill recovering from a Covid diagnosis, Biden remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend with his wife, first lady Jill Biden.\n\nBiden did what he always planned to do before any crucial decision: He held a family meeting Saturday night. He has spoken to all of his family since making his decision to drop out of the race, and his daughter Ashley and son-in-law Howard drove to Rehoboth earlier Sunday, according to a source.\n\nHe confirmed that decision Sunday morning and, with Ricchetti by his side, started making calls to key players outside of his close-knit group of senior-most aides and family members, the other person familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden consulted only a very small number of close aides on the decision. Some members of his inner circle were left in the dark until minutes before he posted his announcement on social media, including one of his closest communications advisers, Anita Dunn.\n\nMultiple sources told CNN that Dunn and a small group of senior aides became aware of Biden's announcement in the minutes before the post. Many rank-and-file staff found out when the post came out. Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, were among Biden's debate prep team and had faced the ire of the president's family in the aftermath of the performance. A Biden aide disputed that her exclusion had anything to do with the debate, telling CNN that she, along with other top aides, was not in Rehoboth Beach, and that \"the president told his aides that neither he or his family blame them for debate performance.\"\n\nBiden and Harris spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of his announcement, according to a source familiar with the matter. Biden also held separate calls with chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign co-chair Jen O'Malley Dillon informing each of his decision.\n\nIn Washington on Sunday, Zients led a White House senior staff call with all assistants to the president in the midafternoon, as well as a call with members of Biden's Cabinet. Zients is expected to hold an all-White House staff call Monday morning and to speak with political appointees across the executive branch.\n\nBut even his vice president, and pick to succeed him, didn't find out until the day he announced his decision.\n\nIn the end, Biden was confronting an untenable path forward: More than three dozen Democrats had publicly called for him to exit the race. Party leaders had told him he couldn't win. And the money was drying up from donors who said they felt betrayed by the lack of disclosure around the condition of Biden's health.\n\n\"I don't know one big donor who is going to write a check for $100,000 or more. And I know a lot of those guys,\" one major Democratic donor told CNN before Biden dropped out.\n\nBiden and his team tried to play off the debate performance as a \"bad night.\" He and his aides blamed the president's overseas trip. He said he would debate again and do better. And he returned immediately to the campaign trail, traveling to North Carolina the following day and delivering an energetic speech while acknowledging his debate shortcomings.\n\n\"I know I'm not a young man. I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden huddled with his family at Camp David the weekend after the debate for a previously scheduled get-together, during which they encouraged him to stay in the race.\n\nBut in Democratic circles, panic had already set in. The issue problem was plain as day: Biden's biggest problem with voters was they didn't feel he was up to the job for the next four years. The debate had confirmed their fears and brought Biden's biggest political weakness to the forefront. No policy or statement or criticism of Trump could change that.\n\nEven as Biden insisted there was nothing that could convince him to get out of the race, Democrats began laying the groundwork and keeping the door open to a change. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on MSNBC, saying: \"I think it's a legitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition?\"\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas on July 2 became the first elected Democrat to call for Biden to withdraw. The following day, Biden met with a group of Democratic governors, telling them he needed more sleep and should stop scheduling events after 8 p.m.\n\nOn July 5, Biden sat down for an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, in an attempt to demonstrate he was able to keep campaigning. In the interview, Biden said only the \"Lord Almighty\" could convince him to leave the race, a comment that angered many Democrats.\n\nIt was the first of several attempts from Biden's team to put the president in the public eye and quell the growing discontent. All failed to do so.\n\nAfter July 4, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, quietly tried to gather a group of Democrats who would hold a meeting with Biden, potentially urging him to exit the race. The idea died, however, when the effort leaked.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a call with House Democrats over that weekend, during which several lawmakers said that Biden needed to step aside.\n\nOn July 8, Biden fired off defiant a letter to congressional Democrats saying he would continue his reelection bid. \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" he wrote.\n\nThe calls for Biden to leave soon started coming from outside Washington. On July 10, George Clooney, penned a New York Times op-ed calling for Biden to step aside. Even more devastating for the president, Clooney said the Biden he saw at a June fundraiser was the same Biden the world saw at the June debate and that the president had declined since taking the Oval Office.\n\nPelosi also continued to raise questions about Biden, declining to endorse him in an MSNBC interview the same day as Clooney's op-ed. \"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run,\" she said, even if that was a decision Biden had already seemed to have made.\n\nRelated article The delegates will decide the next Democratic nominee as a groundswell forms for Harris\n\nSeveral news outlets, including CNN, reported that Pelosi and former President Barack Obama had privately expressed concerns about the future of Biden's campaign.\n\nOn July 11, Biden held a solo news conference on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington. He opened the door a bit further to the possibility he could drop out, saying he would consider doing so if data showed he cannot win.\n\nBiden also made several small verbal slip-ups, including calling Harris \"Vice President Trump.\" Earlier in the day, he had referred Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"President Putin,\" before correcting himself.\n\nAfter Biden's news conference, a handful more congressional Democrats called for him to drop out, growing the number to 15. The list included Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he deliberately waited until after the NATO meeting.\n\nThat weekend, Biden met and held calls with various Democratic caucuses, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the moderate New Democrat Coalition. The call with moderate Democrats was tense, as Biden got into it with Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who bluntly told him that voters are concerned about his vigor and strength, especially as it is perceived on the world stage.\n\nThe president responded to Crow - an Army Ranger who served two tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq - that he knows Crow is a Bronze Star recipient like his late son Beau, but that \"he didn't rebuild NATO.\"\n\nAt one point, Biden told Crow, \"I don't want to hear that crap\" in addressing the lawmaker's concerns.\n\nMore Democrats had been expected to publicly call for Biden's exit that weekend, but the chatter came to a halt in an instant when an attempted assassin's bullet came within millimeters of killing Trump at his Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.\n\nThe assassination attempt turned the political world on its head, draining the public focus on Biden's ability to govern for a second term and turning it squarely onto the bullet that grazed Trump's ear, raising a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to shoot at the Republican nominee for president five days before he was to accept the nomination.\n\nThe pause would not last.\n\nBehind the scenes, Democratic pollsters circulated memos showing Biden was on track to lose the election, and - importantly to congressional Democrats - damage candidates in ballot races, too. Some polling showed other Democrats outpacing Biden in battleground states.\n\n\"Lose everything,\" was how one Democrat described a polling memo Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg had sent to Biden's inner circle.\n\nThe dam reopened on Wednesday when California Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic Senate candidate and leader of Trump's first impeachment, became the first lawmaker to join the public calls for Biden to withdraw from the campaign after the assassination attempt.\n\nSchiff's place in the party - as a potential soon-to-be senator and close ally to Pelosi - made his voice among the most significant to that point.\n\n\"While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nMore voices soon followed. And arguably more importantly, the private pleas for Biden to leave the race became part of a public cacophony of voices urging his withdrawal.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland House Democrat who led Trump's second impeachment, confirmed that he had written a letter to Biden on July 6 encouraging the president that there was \"no shame in taking a well-deserved bow\" out of the 2024 presidential election - and making his argument with comparisons to George Washington and Red Sox pitching great Pedro Martinez.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that Pelosi privately told Biden that polling showed he could not defeat Trump and that he could destroy Democrats' chances of winning the House in November. Biden pushed back, saying he had seen polls indicating he could win. At one point, Pelosi asked Donilon, Biden's longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data.\n\nThat same day, ABC News reported that Schumer told Biden in their Saturday meeting that it would be best if he bowed out of the presidential race. And a person briefed on the meeting between Biden and Jeffries said that the Democratic House leader stopped short of calling on him to step aside - instead pinning the suggestion on his members.\n\nThe White House and congressional officers tried to tamp down the reports, issuing statements of denial. But the stories about the party leaders delivering Biden a message had their effect. On Friday, a dozen new Democrats released statements saying Biden should exit the race.\n\nAmong them: Another close Pelosi ally, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. A source with direct knowledge described Biden on Friday as \"seething\" at Pelosi, a sentiment that only grew in light of Lofgren's letter.\n\nThe public statements from Democrats illustrated one element of Biden's challenge to stay in the race - but just as important were the defections from his donors that would have dried up fundraising in the home stretch of the campaign.\n\nMajor Democratic donors were skeptical of Biden's viability, and multiple said their concerns had received an icy reception from Biden campaign officials.\n\n\"How do you think we feel?\" a Democratic donor close to the Democratic National Committee and the White House told CNN before Biden dropped out, explaining the mood among donors. \"We all feel betrayed that they were not honest with us about his health.\"\n\nTwo sources told CNN on Thursday that furious donors were also telling House and Senate Democratic campaign committees they would freeze contributions unless and until party leaders took stronger steps to get Biden to step aside.\n\n\"Yes, that card has been played,\" a senior House Democrat told CNN on Thursday night.\n\n\"They believe if Joe is at the top of the ticket, the House and Senate are gone, too,\" said a Democratic strategist intimately involved in big-dollar fundraising. \"They don't want to throw good money after bad.\"\n\nMoments after Biden's announcement, donors abruptly began reaching out to advisers, pouring in money, according to sources involved in the discussions. In the lead-up to Biden's decision to exit the 2024 race, multiple donors had reached out to Harris' team proactively to signal they would be willing to support her if she ran at the top of the ticket, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\nUp until the moment he dropped out, Biden and his team insisted he was staying in.\n\nBiden's team created a public schedule for the president over the past week that was intended to show his ability to stay in the race.\n\nOn Monday, he held another television interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, where he acknowledged his subpar debate performance while criticizing the media for focusing on his gaffes instead of Trump's falsehoods. Biden again said he had no intention of stepping aside.\n\nBiden then traveled to Las Vegas for campaign stops, speeches planned at the NAACP National Convention and the UnidosUS annual conference, and interviews with BET and Univision. Biden told BET News' Ed Gordon that the only thing that would push him to reconsider his reelection bid would be a \"medical condition.\"\n\nThe president spoke at the NAACP conference, but before he could make his speech Wednesday at UnidosUS, he was dealt another blow: the positive Covid-19 diagnosis.\n\nThe president returned to his Rehoboth Beach home that day to isolate, his public schedule shuttered indefinitely while he recovered.\n\nRelated article Here's what happened the last time a president chose not to run for a second term\n\nOn Friday, Biden issued a statement that he would be back on the campaign trail the following week, while Biden campaign chair O'Malley Dillon went on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" to say Biden was \"absolutely\" staying in the race.\n\nThe campaign also put out a memo saying there was \"no plan for an alternative nominee.\"\n\nBiden called some Democrats over the weekend who were out on TV on his behalf. Two told CNN that the president voiced his gratitude and then his anger at those who were trying to push him out. \"There was some hurt in his voice but mostly anger,\" one of the Biden loyalists said.\n\nEven on Sunday, Biden's team continued to publicly maintain he wasn't going anywhere. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a key Biden ally, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that Biden and Harris \"have received over 14 million votes to be our standard bearers. That's where we are,\" Clyburn. The congressman's 2020 endorsement of Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary was widely seen as instrumental in Biden's victory.\n\nBiden spoke to Harris on Sunday before announcing his decision, which came in two messages: The first saying he was dropping out, and the second endorsing his vice president to be the Democratic nominee.\n\nBiden told his senior-most team he was getting out around 1:45 p.m., and the public letter went out right around then, a source familiar with the timing told CNN.\n\n\"Before that, it was all steam ahead that he's running,\" the same source said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's Kayla Tausche, Dana Bash, John King, Jamie Gangel, Betsy Klein, Sam Fossum, Manu Raju, Samantha Waldenberg, Donald Judd and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Biden says Trump privately praised parts of his economic record\n\nIn a newly-published interview with USA Today days before he's set to leave office, President Joe Biden said President-elect Donald Trump praised of a portion of his economic record during a private meeting.\n\n\"He was very complimentary about some of the economic things I had done,\" Biden said. \"And he talked about - he thought I was leaving with a good record.\"\n\nBiden in the interview didn't specify exactly what policies Trump praised, and the gesture could've simply been an element of the courtesies that presidents and president-elects generally extend to each other when discussing a White House transition.\n\nThe president during the interview also issued a warning for his predecessor and soon-to-be successor regarding tax policy and the economy overall.\n\n\"I think if he moves on the tax cuts of $5 trillion, I think if he moves on dealing with increasing tariffs across the board, all they are is increasing costs of consumers in America,\" Biden said. \"And if he decides to do away with some of the major programs, whether it's dealing with the rescue plan or infrastructure or the climate law, I think he's just going to, you know, hurt himself, hurt the economy.\"\n\nThroughout the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump hammered President Biden over his economic record, repeatedly needling the commander-in-chief on issues like inflation and housing affordability.\n\nWhen Biden stepped aside as the Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris became the party's standard-bearer, Trump pursued the same strategy, tying voter dissatisfaction with the economy to Biden's No. 2.\n\nThe president-elect in November was victorious in the major swing states - making significant gains with groups that had long backed Democrats - in large part because of his focus on the economy.\n\nTrump during his first term pledged to get an infrastructure agenda in place and even sought to work with congressional Democrats on the issue.\n\nHowever it was Biden - an ardent Amtrak fan - who oversaw passage of the gargantuan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law . The law is one of the biggest domestic accomplishments of Biden's presidency, and one that's poised to reshape his economic legacy years - and potentially decades - after he leaves office later this month.\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung in a statement to Business Insider said Trump was elected to a second term to \"continue the massively successful economic policies\" of his first administration.\n\n\"Joe Biden's disastrous policies led to record inflation and an economy that left behind all Americans,\" Cheung said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The economic projects that could reshape Biden's legacy\n\nAs he enters his final few weeks in the Oval Office, President Joe Biden 's political standing remains far below what it was when it entered office. Major infrastructure projects, however, could enhance the president's legacy long after he's left office.\n\nBiden signed into law a highly consequential infrastructure bill, a goal that eluded President-elect Donald Trump. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, is already a defining aspect of Biden's presidency. And the CHIPS and Science Act, designed to once again make the US a leader in semiconductor manufacturing , could also change some minds on Biden's overall economic record.\n\nWhile many of the upgrades are already in the works, the ramifications of these investments may not be felt for years.\n\nHere's a look at some of the projects that could eventually reshape Biden's domestic legacy:\n\nCalifornia has long been known for its car-centric culture.\n\nHowever, in recent decades, there's been a major effort to bolster public transit throughout the state. In LA, the Los Angeles Metro Rail system is expanding its D Line . And a planned extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, or BART, into Silicon Valley is poised to be a critical link in the San Francisco region.\n\nA newer part of California's transit equation is high-speed rail.\n\nThe California High-Speed Rail project, which will connect San Francisco to the Los Angeles Basin as part of its first phase, is currently under construction.\n\nAnd then there's Brightline West , a separate under-construction high-speed rail route that will link Las Vegas, Nevada, to Southern California.\n\nIn September 2024, the Federal Railroad Administration signed an agreement that'll direct $3 billion to the Nevada Department of Transportation for Brightline West. The signing came after a December 2023 announcement that the project would be awarded funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law .\n\nBrightline West is expected to begin operations in 2028, just in time for the summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Airport Infrastructure Grants (AIG) program is part of the $25 billion allocated for airport and air traffic control improvements within the infrastructure law.\n\nThese investments will address some of the most pressing needs at airport facilities across the US. A slew of airports, from the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia to Hawaii's Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport at Keahole, have already received funding from the program.\n\nAs part of the program, $20.1 million was awarded to the Atlanta airport in August 2024 to improve its taxiways and taxi lanes, while $49.6 million was granted to the Ellison Onizuka Kona airport to rehabilitate its Runway 17-35 that same month.\n\nThe John A. Blatnik Bridge serves as a vital transportation link between Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin. The bridge opened for traffic in 1961 and is in dire need of repairs.\n\nBiden visited Superior in January 2024 to announce that $1.06 billion will be allocated to replace the aging bridge. A new bridge will allow for increased capacity and the construction project is expected to boost the area's economy in a considerable way.\n\nAccording to the White House, the bridge in its current state was set to close by 2030.\n\n\"For decades, people talked about replacing this bridge, but it never got done, until today,\" Biden said during his visit to the Midwestern locale.\n\nThe bridge is set to be closed for construction for four years, beginning in 2027, according to the Minnesota Department of Transportation .\n\nThe Interstate Bridge, also known as the Columbia River Interstate Bridge, carries Interstate 5 between Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe bridge is a critical economic link in the Pacific Northwest and regional leaders for years have sought funding to replace the two spans.\n\nThrough the infrastructure law, the project in December 2023 was awarded a $600 million grant from the National Infrastructure Project Assistance program, also known as the Mega Grant program. The program was designed to set aside federal funding for complex projects that are likely to boost the economy.\n\nIn July 2024, the US Department of Transportation announced that the Interstate Bridge replacement project would also receive roughly $1.5 billion in funding from the Federal Highway Administration's Bridge Investment Program.\n\n\"Under the Trump administration, 'infrastructure week' was just a punchline, but President Biden turned it into a historic legacy of investing in America and American workers in states across the country,\" Democratic National Committee deputy communications director Abhi Rahman told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nBiden during his term in office has placed a major emphasis on strengthening the US' hand regarding advanced chip manufacturing.\n\nAnd in November 2024, his administration finalized $6.6 billion in funding for the Arizona subsidiary of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The award will fund the construction of three factories in Phoenix.\n\nBiden in November said the projects would create thousands of jobs , calling it the \"largest foreign direct investment in a greenfield project in the history of the United States.\"\n\nThe investment is significant as it comes before Trump - who in the past has criticized the CHIPS Act - is set to return to office in January.\n\nThe Georgia-based bus manufacturer Blue Bird in July 2024 was awarded $80 million from the US Department of Energy to bolster its production of electric school buses.\n\nBlue Bird received the funding as part of the Biden administration's $1.7 billion investment to transform shuttered or at-risk auto manufacturing plants into facilities that can produce electric and hybrid vehicles. The dedicated funding was part of the Biden-backed Inflation Reduction Act, which the president signed into law in 2022.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia in a statement said that the investment is slated to bring 428 manufacturing jobs and 250 construction jobs to Fort Valley.\n\n\"This is about converting fleets of diesel-powered school buses into clean energy vehicles for the future,\" the senator said.\n\nJump to"

And that's the deal that will be in front of us,\" Waltz said.\n\nHe suggested an executive order could be used to protect it, but offered few details on how this might work in practice.\n\nLast month, Trump called on the US Supreme Court to pause the ban. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the ban on Friday.\n\nFollowing the ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew posted a video to TikTok thanking Trump for his commitment to working with TikTok to keep the app running in the US.\n\nThere have been several potential TikTok buyers , but it's unclear if or to what extent ByteDance has sought to divest. ByteDance and TikTok have not publicly shown any interest in a sale.\n\nDemocratic former Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday that more time was needed to find a US buyer.\n\n\"It's clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans, of so many influencers who have built up a good network of followers,\" Schumer said.\n\nIt's also unclear what will happen to the app on Sunday if Biden, Trump, or the Supreme Court do not step in before then to save it.\n\nThe legislation passed last year requires platforms in the US such as Apple or Google to stop offering the app or updating it when the sale deadline passes, meaning it'd effectively \"go dark\" or be unavailable.\n\nJump to"

A mass IT outage is affecting flights, banks, and supermarkets around the world. American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta grounded some of their flights. The issue appears to be linked to the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike .\n\nIn today's big story, President Biden's comeback plan isn't working , and Democratic leaders are ready to move on .\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nBut first, the walls are closing in.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe US presidential election will be decided in November, but one candidate's race could end shortly.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's reelection campaign appears to be on its last legs as calls within his party have grown from whispers to shouts since his disastrous debate last month.\n\nThe president has worked hard over the past three weeks to quiet the doubters, but it's proved futile , writes Business Insider's Brent D. Griffiths.\n\nEven those in Biden's corner aren't necessarily helping his cause. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who voiced his support for Biden, acknowledged Biden sometimes \" doesn't put three sentences together .\"\n\nThat's led some Democratic leaders to take a more aggressive approach to get Biden off the ticket , writes BI's Bryan Metzger.\n\nReports emerged that Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and Nancy Pelosi have all privately spoken to Biden about concerns the party has with him staying the race , writes Sarah Gray and Kelsey Vlamis.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest blow to Biden's reelection campaign came with the news that his former running mate has doubts. Former President Barack Obama reportedly told allies he worries about donors' and voters' waning support .\n\nBumping Biden isn't just about the presidential election.\n\nYes, the majority of Democrats don't want Biden to run anymore , according to one new poll. And yes, an analysis by FiveThirtyEight of national polls has Trump leading Biden by 2.7 percentage points.\n\nBut for some Democrats, the risk of Biden continuing his reelection campaign could extend from the White House to Capitol Hill.\n\nSchumer and Jeffries reportedly voiced concerns to Biden about the risk the president was putting on down-ballot Democrats vying for seats in Congress. Case in point: Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for Senate this November, called on Biden to drop out .\n\nStill, despite mounting pressure, Biden's campaign has remained steadfast about his reelection bid. \"He is not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision,\" Quentin Fulks, deputy campaign manager, said at a press conference Thursday morning.\n\nAnd while the future of Biden's campaign ultimately sits with Biden, there is one outside factor that could play a role in his decision: his doctors .\n\nBiden has previously said a medical condition could be something that would cause him to reevaluate running. So a recent COVID-19 diagnosis, his third in two years, could be what ultimately has Biden change his tune.\n\nThe Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

      "text": "Biden's final student-loan forgiveness action has arrived\n\nStudent-loan forgiveness under President Joe Biden has officially reached the end of the road.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden's Education Department announced over $600 million in debt cancellation for 4,550 borrowers on income-based repayment plans and 4,100 borrowers who the department found were defrauded by DeVry University.\n\nThis latest announcement marks the final student-loan forgiveness action under the Biden administration.\n\n\"Four years ago, President Biden made a promise to fix a broken student loan system,\" Education Sec. Miguel Cardona said in a statement.\n\n\"We rolled up our sleeves and, together, we fixed existing programs that had failed to deliver the relief they promised, took bold action on behalf of borrowers who had been cheated by their institutions, and brought financial breathing room to hardworking Americans-including public servants and borrowers with disabilities,\" Cardona said.\n\nThursday's announcement brings total student debt relief under Biden to $188.8 billion for 5.3 million borrowers. It follows a series of debt relief actions earlier this week, including $4.5 billion in relief on January 15 for defrauded borrowers and $4.2 billion in relief on January 13 for additional defrauded borrowers, along with government and nonprofit workers and those with total and permanent disabilities.\n\nThe Education Department also announced on Thursday that it had completed the account adjustments for borrowers on income-driven repayment plans, which corrected borrowers' payment counts and ensured their progress toward forgiveness was up-to-date. The department said that borrowers who recently transitioned to different servicers might see an additional one or two months of payments credited in the coming weeks.\n\nWith Biden's final actions on student-loan forgiveness, a key chapter for millions of borrowers is closed. President-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to prioritize broad student-loan forgiveness - he previously criticized Biden's efforts - meaning borrowers will likely continue their payments without expanded avenues for relief.\n\nMeanwhile, the 9 million borrowers enrolled in Biden's SAVE plan , which he introduced in 2023 in an effort to make payments more affordable, are awaiting a final court decision on the plan, and they remain in forbearance in the meantime.\n\n\"For decades, the federal government promised to help people who couldn't afford their student loans because they were in public service, had disabilities, were cheated by their college, or who had completed decades of payments,\" Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal said in a statement. \"But it rarely kept those promises until now.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The 5 people to watch as Joe Biden weighs leaving the race\n\nPresident Joe Biden is clear that he is not leaving the 2024 race.\n\nOn Friday, Biden rallied with supporters in Wisconsin as he continued his effort to hold onto power amid a growing number of megadonors and Democratic officials questioning whether he is still the best candidate to beat former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"You voted for me to be your nominee, no one else,\" Biden said at the rally. \"You, the voters did that. And despite that some folks don't seem to care who you voted for, well guess what, they're trying to push me out of the race. Well, let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race.\"\n\nBiden's disastrous debate performance has sharply highlighted voters' biggest concern about reelecting the 81-year-old, who would be 86 if he left office in January 2029.\n\nSo far, influential voices like former President Barack Obama remain behind him. There's still time for Biden to change course. Still, it's unlikely that another current party leader would nudge him out of the race in a meeting like the famous 1974 meeting Sen. Barry Goldwater and top Republicans held with President Richard Nixon, letting him know that he would not survive the Watergate scandal.\n\nInstead, Biden may only be swayed by someone within his insular orbit - many who have served at his side for decades. In the end, it may only be a fellow Biden who could change his mind.\n\nThe president is \"Jill Biden's husband\" in every sense of the phrase. Like many modern first ladies, Jill Biden is described as one of the most powerful voices in the White House.\n\n\"There is little doubt among those who know her that Jill Biden's highest priority is shielding her husband and family from danger,\" journalist Katie Rogers wrote in her book about modern first ladies.\n\nSince the debate debacle, the first lady has also been clear that she remains dedicated to Biden staying in the race.\n\nOver the years, Biden has been described as the hard edge to the man who has spent decades glad-handing people around Washington. She has often been referred to as the keeper of family grudges, including when she needed to be convinced that Vice President Kamala Harris didn't cross a line when she called out Biden's past statements on race during a heated Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nAfter Dr. Biden helped fend off protestors in 2020, the then-former vice president joked that his wife \"is my Secret Service.\"\n\n\" Whoa, you don't screw around with a Philly girl, I'll tell you what,\" Biden said at the time.\n\nPresident Biden has often cited his father's admonition, \"Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end.\" His younger sister, Valerie Biden Owens, knows that better than most.\n\nShe has been involved in Biden's political career from the beginning. Owens managed Biden's upset 1972 US Senate campaign and his first presidential run less than two decades later.\n\n\" Val is kind of the connective tissue throughout the course of the campaigns from '72 to today ,\" Kate Bedingfield, then-Biden's deputy campaign manager, told BuzzFeed News in 2019.\n\nBiden Owens joked at the time about how hard it was not leading her brother's ultimately successful run, given that she had run his campaigns dating back to high school.\n\n\"This is the first time I haven't managed the campaign, and I want to tell you, it's damn frustrating!\" she said, per BuzzFeed.\n\nAn unnamed Democratic official told Axios that if there were a quiet campaign to nudge Biden aside then one of the few people to make the case should be the president's sister.\n\nFormer Sen. Ted Kaufman of Delaware might be one of Biden's few actual contemporaries.\n\nBiden has been in office so long that few if any, current Democratic leaders can match his longevity, especially given his complicated relationships with former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as The New York Times points out.\n\nKaufman has been at Biden's side for decades, starting during the 1972 campaign. Just a few years after Biden's election, Kaufman became his chief of staff. When Biden left the Senate after being elected vice president in 2009, Kaufman replaced him.\n\nHe's been described as Biden's best friend and his alter ego. Kaufman has also told Biden the harsh truth before. In 1987, it was Kaufman who urged the then-senator to drop out of the presidential race amid a plagiarism scandal.\n\n\" There's only one way to stop the sharks and that's pull out,\" Kaufman told Biden, according to The New York Times.\n\nBiden often returns to Delaware on the weekends. According to The Times, when the president goes home he seeks out Kaufman.\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Ron Klain is at the center of Biden's debate debacle.\n\nKlain has prepped Democrats for presidential debates for decades. He took time away from his new job with AirBnb to help prepare his old boss.\n\nThe Indiana native has worked for Biden almost nonstop since graduating from Harvard Law School in 1987. Under Biden's leadership, he was chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. After serving as Vice President Al Gore's chief of staff, Klain returned to the role during the Obama administration.\n\nKlain's decision to back former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 Democratic primary over Biden, who was still musing about his run, was considered a deep act of betrayal.\n\nBut Klain returned to the Biden orbit and realized his long-held ambition of being the top aide to a president. It's their closeness that might make it hard for Biden's former chief to pressure his long-time boss to step aside.\n\n\" He's like a father to Ron Klain. What do you say to your father? This is tough, very tough,\" Elaine Kamarck, a longtime member of the Democratic National Committee, told The Times.\n\nAccording to The Times, Biden still talks to him once a week to figure out the best ways to attack Trump.\n\nLike others in Biden's small orbit, Mike Donilon has been at the president's side for decades.\n\nAccording to The Times, Biden calls Donilon almost daily to get his take on the news. Donilon, who was a senior White House advisor, left the administration to join Biden's reelection campaign.\n\nHe played a major role in shaping the message for Biden's successful 2020 run.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Biden's plan to overhaul the Supreme Court is 'dead on arrival'\n\nPresident Joe Biden's pitch to rein in the Supreme Court is off to a rough start.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has already sworn to fight the Biden administration's proposal to overhaul the Supreme Court , calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\n\nBiden's proposal, announced in a White House press release on Monday, calls on Congress to make three major changes to the high court: setting up 18-year term limits for all justices, creating a binding code of conduct for those justices, and approving a constitutional amendment that explicitly says former presidents aren't immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in office.\n\nCiting \" recent ethics scandals \" among the court's justices and its recent decisions overturning \"long-established legal precedents protecting fundamental rights,\" Biden wrote that these changes were necessary to \"restore trust and accountability\" in both the president and the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court has been a source of frustration for Democrats, with the conservative-led panel handing former President Donald Trump and his allies victory after victory - culminating in a decision that ruled sitting presidents are granted presumptive immunity from prosecution.\n\nThat ruling snarled the various criminal cases against Trump, who was convicted of fraud in New York and faces allegations of mishandling classified documents and conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTwo of the Supreme Court's conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, have also been tied up in scandals. Thomas was gifted lavish vacations from a GOP megadonor without disclosing them, and his wife communicated with Trump aides before the Capitol riot. Meanwhile, a flag bearing symbols linked to pro-Trump movements flew over Alito's house about the time of the riot; he's since blamed his wife.\n\nDespite the push from Biden for changes to the court, Johnson threw cold water on the idea immediately.\n\n\"President Biden's proposal to radically overhaul the U.S. Supreme Court would tilt the balance of power and erode not only the rule of law, but the American people's faith in our system of justice,\" Johnson wrote Monday on X .\n\nHe added: \"It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with some of the Court's recent decisions. This dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris Administration is dead on arrival in the House.\"\n\nBiden's plan includes adding a \"No One is Above the Law\" amendment to the Constitution, which would dictate that no president has \"immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as President,\" the press release said.\n\nBut amending the Constitution isn't easy; it's been done only 27 times, most recently in 1992.\n\nThere are a few ways to propose a change to the Constitution that the Founding Fathers outlined. The first requires two-thirds support from members of both the House and Senate - a feat that would be nearly impossible to accomplish with Republicans controlling the House.\n\nThe GOP has largely supported the Supreme Court's conservative majority and has rebuked Democrats' attempts to limit its power.\n\nThe second option requires two-thirds of state legislatures to call a convention to propose a change to the Constitution.\n\nAnd that's just to get the amendment proposed - to get it ratified, three-fourths of state legislatures must support the amendment.\n\nThis would also be a tough task with 23 states controlled by Republican trifectas (meaning the GOP runs both branches of a state's legislature and the governor's office) and 10 states having divided governments; only 17 states are controlled by Democratic trifectas, according to Ballotpedia .\n\nBiden's plan for the Supreme Court includes term limits under which a new justice would be chosen every two years.\n\nIn an op-ed for The Washington Post, Biden wrote, \"Term limits would help ensure that the court's membership changes with some regularity. That would make timing for court nominations more predictable and less arbitrary. It would reduce the chance that any single presidency radically alters the makeup of the court for generations to come.\"\n\nBiden also said in the Post that \"the court's current voluntary ethics code is weak and self-enforced\" and that a binding, enforceable code of conduct should require justices \"to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.\"\n\nThe court's current ethics code , implemented in November, is not binding and does not contain any enforcement mechanism.\n\nA measure for both term limits and a stricter ethics code for justices would require the Republican-controlled House to not only allow a floor vote on the issue but also then pass it. Even if the House approved the bill, Republicans in the Senate could filibuster it, stopping it in its tracks.\n\nDemocrats would likely need to throw out the filibuster - something they already lack the votes to do - to even bring the legislation to a vote.\n\nWith powerful Republicans like Johnson already pushing back, getting all three of Biden's proposals implemented in the Supreme Court looks like a losing battle. But Biden's plan has gotten support from Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, which all but guarantees that Democrats will use it on the campaign trail as a contrast to Trump.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "The Bidens want back in\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Former President Joe Biden has told some Democratic leaders he'll raise funds, campaign and do anything else necessary for Democrats to recover lost ground as the Trump administration rolls back programs the party helped design, according to people close to him.\n\nBiden privately met last month with the new Democratic National Committee chairman, Ken Martin, and offered to help as the party struggles to regain its viability amid polling that shows its popularity has been sinking, the people said.\n\nSo far, Biden's overture seems to have fallen flat. Democrats find themselves adrift, casting about for a compelling messenger.\n\nWhoever that is, it's not Biden, many party activists and donors contend. He's tethered to the 2024 defeat and, at 82, is a symbol more of the party's past than its future, they argue.\n\n\"Who's going to want Joe Biden back in the game?\" said a major Biden supporter, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about him.\n\nA spokesperson for the DNC didn't provide a comment or make Martin available for an interview.\n\nA new NBC News poll shows that the Democratic Party's popularity has dropped to a record low. Only 27% of registered voters said they held positive views of the party - the lowest figure in the network's polling dating to 1990.\n\nAsked about the prospect of Biden re-entering the political sphere, President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday, \"I hope so.\"\n\nFormer first lady Jill Biden is also prepared to campaign and raise money for fellow Democrats as she and her husband settle into life back home in Delaware, a person close to her said.\n\n\"She recognizes that serving in the capacities that she served is an honor and it comes with responsibilities to the party. And she's prepared to help in any way she can,\" the person said.\n\nBoth Bidens are carving out post-presidential lives aside from the partisan political work they've volunteered to take on.\n\nEach plans to write a book. As Biden develops a theme for his memoir, he has been consulting former senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior White House advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti.\n\nHe has been splitting his time between Delaware and Washington for meetings in office space supplied by the federal government. As was his habit as a U.S. senator, he often commutes via Amtrak.\n\nThe onetime first couple were shocked when Trump abruptly announced this week that he was ending Secret Service protection for their two adult children, Hunter and Ashley, the person close to Jill Biden said. They'd gotten no warning, another person familiar with the matter said. Their first question was whether their two children would be safe.\n\nThe Bidens have been out of office for only two months. After Trump's first term ended in 2021, then-President Biden extended protection for Trump's adult children for six months.\n\nThough Biden is willing to help, Democrats aren't unanimous in wanting them to. Some party activists believe Biden is an admired figure who remains a draw inside a grateful party.\n\nJane Kleeb, a vice chair of the DNC, said in an interview: \"If you were to call any state party chair and ask them if they wanted Joe Biden to be a keynote speaker for their annual dinner, the answer would be yes. He is beloved by the party and beloved by the voters.\"\n\nOthers argue that reminding voters of a 2024 campaign that went sour isn't the best strategy for a party that is grasping for a message and searching for new, younger leaders. A CNN poll this month asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents which leader best reflects the party's core values. Only 1% chose Biden.\n\nWhat's more, the wounds of 2024 are still fresh, with many Democrats aggrieved over Biden's decision to run again and remain in the race until just a few months before the election, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris little time to organize a campaign of her own.\n\nAlan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser from Philadelphia, said in an interview: \"There are plenty of people in the Democratic Party who were obviously very frustrated with how things played out last year, but there are plenty of people who still love Joe Biden.\"\n\nAt the \"appropriate time,\" Biden can be an asset to the party by campaigning in selected areas, such as his hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, but now isn't it, Kessler added.\n\n\"It's time to move on with new leadership,\" he said.\n\nBiden has no pangs of regret, a person familiar with his private conversations said. He remains defiant and believes Trump's victory shows the party did itself no favors by pushing him to drop out of the race, the source said.\n\nOne person in particular seems eager to see Biden return to the political stage: Trump. The new president has used his massive following to ensure that Americans don't soon forget the old one.\n\nTrump has publicly mentioned Biden, Biden family members or the Biden administration an average of seven times a day since the start of his second term, according to an NBC News review of his remarks, interviews and social media posts.\n\nOverall, Trump has invoked his predecessor in some form more than 400 times since the inauguration on Jan. 20. In most instances - more than 325 - Trump has mentioned Biden alone. In about 75 cases, Trump has mentioned Biden family members or the Biden administration.\n\nThe context in which Trump brings up his predecessor often involves immigration, inflation, elections or foreign wars, as well as issues involving the Justice Department.\n\nSpeaking at the Justice Department last week, Trump questioned Biden's use of an autopen to sign documents, calling it \"disrespectful to the office\" and \" maybe not even valid .\"\n\nThe Justice Department blessed the use of an autopen in a memo in 2005, and the Constitution carries no requirement that the president sign documents by his own hand.\n\nVice President JD Vance also uses Biden as a foil. At a tech summit this week, Vance took time in his speech to take a swipe at Biden's mental acuity - an issue that dogged the former president throughout the campaign.\n\n\"In defense of Joe Biden, he was asleep most of the time. I don't think he totally realized what he was doing,\" Vance said.\n\nAsked why Trump speaks about Biden so frequently, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"We still very much are fixing so many of the problems created or started by the Biden administration. It's important to remind the American people and media why these problems exist.\"\n\nA defense that Trump supporters use in rationalizing his attacks on perceived political foes is that he's a \"counterpuncher.\" But here, Biden has already left the ring. He hasn't thrown any public punches since Trump escorted him to the helicopter on Inauguration Day for his departure from the U.S. Capitol grounds.\n\nIndeed, Biden's first speaking event since he left office came last week with no fanfare whatsoever. He appeared in New York City for a conference of the National High School Model United Nations in Manhattan. Six months after having spoken before the actual U.N. for his last time as president, Biden gave a speech to its high school facsimile in a hotel ballroom. He also took questions and posed for pictures with students.\n\n\"He asked me about my future, and I told him how much he inspired me to go into the field of politics,\" said Suzy Radzinski, 18, a senior at Brighton High School in Utah, who met Biden on the photo line.\n\nA Facebook video from the event showed a group of excited students waving to Biden. \"I met you on your book tour!\" one shouted to him as he stood onstage in a suit and tie. \"All right!\" said Biden, prompting appreciative laugher.\n\nInside Biden's close-knit circle, advisers have concluded that it's not wise for him to respond publicly to every insult or accusation Trump throws his way. Doing so would personalize the issue, turning it into a contest between Trump and Biden, as opposed to keeping the focus on whether Trump is being truthful or not.\n\nBiden's approach for now is to let surrogates respond to Trump's broadsides. Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic strategist, said that's the right posture.\n\n\"It makes no sense for Joe Biden to respond to Donald Trump,\" she said in an interview. \"The American people are not looking backward; they're looking forward.\"\n\nRather than take the attacks personally, Jill Biden has found a new role for herself: soothing those who are unnerved by the tumult in Washington, the person close to her said.\n\n\"She is finding herself comforting people. More and more, as she's out and about, people come up to her who are looking for reassurance,\" the person said.\n\nPeter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News.\n\nCarol E.

      "text": "'One of the great tragedies of American politics': Biden ends 5 decades in public life\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nJoe Biden ascended to the highest office in America with a pledge to unite the country, strengthen his party and defend democracy.\n\nInstead, in the 82-year-old's Oval Office denouement, he leaves a nation divided , a party in tatters and the American people questioning the self-described institutionalist's respect for the rule of law.\n\nMany Democrats are blaming Biden for handing the White House to Donald Trump, criticizing the aging politician for staying in office too long and reeling after he pardoned his son . Exacerbating the frustrations, Biden recently expressed doubt about his ability to serve another four years after dismissing voters' concerns about that very issue as he sought re-election.\n\nThe president harbors similar resentment toward members of his own party. After the November election, he privately mused about the idea of pardoning Trump as a magnanimous move, according to a person directly familiar with his comments, though it's not clear he seriously considered it. A White House official said \"to our knowledge, this was not raised.\" At the same time, Biden is not on speaking terms with some of his closest allies.\n\nIt is all an inglorious coda to five decades in public office.\n\n\"The Joe Biden story is one of the great tragedies of American politics. I really mean that. He should be having a glorious, well deserved, highly acclaimed retirement. And he's not,\" veteran Democratic political strategist James Carville said. \"It's hard to blame anybody but him.\"\n\nBiden plans to write another book, providing him with the opportunity to tell his version of his presidency and its conclusion. Despite public polls showing in 2023 that Democratic voters did not want him to run again, he went forward anyway, with the backing of party insiders . He was later forced to step aside in July following a cataclysmic debate that seemed to expose his cognitive state . His late departure gave Vice President Kamala Harris just 107 days to build an ultimately unsuccessful campaign against Trump. Throughout his presidency, Biden granted fewer interviews than his recent predecessors and is ending his term the same way: He does not plan to hold the traditional final formal news conference.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Biden is proud of the number of interviews and impromptu question-and-answer sessions he's held with reporters.\n\nIn the White House, the mood feels \"like a morgue,\" according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don't appreciate. Privately, he has vacillated from feeling melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy, two people close to him said.\n\n\"He's totally dejected and the people around him are, as well,\" another person close to the president said. One White House official attributed the glum atmosphere to Trump's impending return to the Oval Office and noted that Biden's aides warmly reacted with cheers when he surprised them at a staff party earlier this week.\n\nAnother White House official depicted personnel as holding back on emotions until Jan. 20 actually arrives.\n\n\"It's hard to reflect, it's hard for it to sink in that we're done here - until we're actually done and out the gates with our stuff,\" said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. That's their mood ... it hasn't sunk in for people who are still here yet because we're working until the last minute.\"\n\nOnce the elder statesman who was to serve as a bridge to the next generation of leadership, Biden departs with an array of fractured relationships. He is estranged from some of the people who were once among his most powerful allies. He harbors, along with first lady Jill Biden, a simmering resentment toward former President Barack Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several former aides, including Bob Bauer and Anita Dunn, all of whom he believes either failed him or pushed him out of the 2024 race, according to several people close to him.\n\nBiden hasn't spoken in months to Dunn, a former top adviser who was among the few notable Democrats willing to back him if he decided to mount a 2016 campaign to challenge Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination, according to multiple people familiar with the dynamic. Dunn departed the White House during the summer as part of the fallout from Biden's June debate performance.\n\nBiden's relationship with Bauer, his longtime personal lawyer who is married to Dunn, also has deteriorated since the debate and tensions related to the criminal trials of his son Hunter Biden, the people familiar with the situation said. Neither Bauer nor Dunn attended a large black-tie dinner the Bidens hosted in November to thank longtime supporters. And Bauer will no longer represent Biden once he leaves office, three people familiar with the decision said.\n\nAsked about this deterioration of his relationship with Dunn and Bauer, a Biden aide said, \"Anita and Bob are well regarded and loyal to the president.\"\n\nWhile Biden and Pelosi have crossed paths at social events since she pushed for him to end his candidacy in July, they have not had a substantive conversation, according to a Pelosi aide.\n\n\"That relationship is permanently damaged,\" a person close to Biden said.\n\nBiden has not expressed his frustrations with Obama directly to him, a person familiar with their conversations said.\n\nOne former top Obama aide who publicly argued after the June debate that Biden should drop out pointedly noted this week that Biden recently named aircraft carriers after former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, he has not offered any similar honor to Obama.\n\n\"Barack H. Obama did not get a f---ing personnel carrier named after him,\" Ben Rhodes said on the podcast \"Pod Save The World.\"\n\nBefore he left office, Obama surprised Biden by awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in an emotional White House ceremony.\n\nAsked about the president's frustrations with Pelosi and Obama, Bates, the White House spokesperson, said in a statement, \"President Biden's focus is squarely on making as big of a difference as he can in the lives of American families - not events from the campaign.\"\n\nBiden went back on his promise to protect the norms he said undergirded the nation's stability by pardoning his Hunter Biden on federal gun and tax charges. The president blamed \"raw politics\" for his son's prosecution, saying it \"infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,\" tapping the kind of language Trump often uses. Biden was surprised, and angered, by Democrats' criticism of the pardon, according to multiple people familiar with his reaction. Dunn was among those who publicly criticized the move.\n\nThroughout his term, Biden felt the tug-of-war between his White House inner circle and his family members. Some of his family felt at times that the president was not being served well by his team, which has included Dunn, former top White House aide and then campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and longtime close advisers Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon. That was particularly the case as the 2024 campaign got into full swing and Biden's approval rating continued to sag while Trump gained ground among voters.\n\nBiden didn't make changes to his team until after he dropped out of the 2024 race. In the weeks and months after that gut-wrenching decision, anger intensified from some of his family members toward his closest aides.\n\nIn some instances, it flowed both ways. Dunn and Bauer resented being unceremoniously cast out of the president's inner circle and blamed two Biden family members in particular for that - Hunter Biden and Jill Biden.Aspects of the family drama could continue into the next administration. Some members of the president's staff are bracing for possible congressional investigations into Hunter Biden's pardon and accusations, denied by the White House, that administration officials covered up the extent of Biden's mental decline.\n\nBiden has argued that he set up the country for long-term economic success after shepherding major pieces of legislation through Congress - even if Americans don't feel the benefits now. He also sees his efforts to unite U.S. allies around Ukraine after Russia's invasion as a critical foreign policy achievement.\n\nIn a major development Wednesday, Israel and Hamas struck a deal for a ceasefire after 15 months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack. Biden worked to achieve a ceasefire deal for months, but he now shares some credit for it with Trump, given their two teams coordinated on the round of negotiations that secured the agreement.\n\nWhen reporters asked Biden at a Wednesday news conference whether he or Trump deserves credit for the ceasefire, Biden turned and smiled : \"Is that a joke?\"\n\nBates, the White House spokesperson, said of the president's record in office: \"President Biden put his unique qualification and his whole heart into delivering for the American people, and the results are the strongest record of any modern administration.\"Critics have relentlessly hit Biden for softening border policies early on in his administration, prompting a surge in illegal crossings. While he later tightened controls at the border, public opinion had already swung against him .\n\nSome Democrats said Biden missed the mark early on when it came to the economy. He should have spent more time railing against greedy corporations rather than trying to convince the public the economy really was better than it thought, said Pete Giangreco, a veteran in presidential Democratic politics.\n\n\"There was always this internal struggle from the day he walked into the White House: Was he Joe from Scranton, the populist, union guy? Or is he Joe the senator from Delaware, which is corporate friendly?\" Giangreco said. \"He could never make up his mind who he was. If he had been Joe from Scranton from day one and stayed Joe from Scranton from day one, it might have been a different outcome.\"\n\nBiden paid a political price for the pandemic-era policies of the last two presidencies, said Lynn Vavreck, an American politics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Many voters became accustomed to the subsidies the Trump and the Biden administrations doled out and then watched prices go up as the subsidies ran out - a double whammy that hit when Trump was long gone from office.\n\n\"They believed that they were better off financially during the Trump presidency,\" Vavreck said. \"That is probably true for very, very many people because of those government stimulus payments and all of the support\" for aid programs.\n\nBut another longtime ally, prominent Democratic donor John Morgan, said that Biden is right to feel bitter by the lack of fanfare around his presidency, pointing to massive investments in infrastructure, a booming stock market, low unemployment and for having navigated the pandemic \"masterfully.\"\n\n\"Objectively, I believe it was a great presidency. You know they believe it. You can hear it in the president's voice,'\" Morgan said. \"You look at all the statistics and it's like: 'Why aren't you all carrying me on your shoulders?'\" In the immediate term, it has all done little to move the public. Biden is poised to leave office with a 36% approval rating, according to a CNN poll released Wednesday. Low approval numbers dogged him throughout his presidency and now he's particularly smarting over leaving office without his standing with Americans having improved, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn an alternate universe, one in which Biden would have stepped aside as the Democratic nominee in 2023, the president would have ridden waves of accolades in his final weeks, cutting ribbons at airports named in his honor or banking hundreds of millions of dollars for an Ivy League policy center in his name, Carville suggested.\n\n\"Joe Biden had many successful acts in his life. Unfortunately, you get remembered for your last act,\" Carville said. \"Right now, he's remembered as the guy who stayed too long.\"\n\nNatasha Korecki is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nCarol E.

      "text": "Biden's family starts discussing his possible exit plan from the 2024 race\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Members of President Joe Biden's family have discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe overall tone of the conversations has been that any exit plan - should Biden decide to take that step, as some of his closest allies increasingly believe he will - should put the party in the best position to beat former President Donald Trump while also being worthy of the more than five decades he has served the country in elected office, these people said.\n\nBiden's family members have specifically discussed how he would want to end his re-election bid on his own timing and with a carefully calculated plan in place. Considerations about the impact of the campaign on his health, his family and the stability of the country are among those at the forefront of the discussions, the people familiar with those discussions said.\n\nThe prospect of Biden's considering stepping aside, much less that his family is gaming out a possible exit plan, is an extraordinary development that comes after he has repeatedly said he would not relinquish his position as the presumptive nominee of the party.\n\nBut concerns have mounted among party leaders, donors and even officials who are part of his re-election effort with every day that has passed since a devastating debate three weeks ago. At the same time, Democrats are watching Republicans rally around Trump, who just survived an assassination attempt and accepted his party's nomination Thursday night.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates denied that any such exit discussions are happening among the family.\n\n\"That is not happening, period,\" he said. \"The individuals making those claims are not speaking for his family or his team - and they will be proven wrong. Keep the faith.\"\n\nOn MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged that the campaign has seen some \"slippage,\" but she said it's been \"a small movement\" and insisted Biden is \"absolutely\" still in the race.\n\nRon Klain, Biden's former White House chief of staff and an adviser to him for decades, said in an interview that Biden is hearing the public and private calls for him to exit the race.\n\n\"I think he's feeling the pressure,\" said Klain, who has spoken to Biden recently. \"I want him to stay in.\"\n\nKlain's take is that it makes no sense for Biden to be pushed aside. He said some in his party underestimate Trump at their own peril and undervalue the fact that Biden is the only one who has beaten him.\n\nBiden and the people closest to him have felt burned by efforts to push him out that they see as backhanded and disrespectful . The family is distraught and moving through the stages of anger and grief over how people they perceived to be friends have treated the president.\n\n\"There was a much more dignified way to do this if this is what they wanted,\" a Biden ally said. \"This is no way to treat a public servant who has done a lot for this country.\"\n\nDiscussions about how to game out a fitting plan for Biden to step aside have also played out among senior staff members, not just the president's family, according to a person close to the re-election effort. Bates also denied these discussions are happening.\n\nThe family members Biden has relied on most include first lady Jill Biden, his son Hunter and his sister, Valerie Owens, as well as a few longtime close aides who have been at the core of the discussions.\n\nThe conversations about Biden's political future have raged while he remains at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sidelined after he tested positive for Covid on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, some of Biden's closest aides were calling trusted allies to get a sense of where they thought his political standing is, according to a person familiar with the phone calls.\n\nA Democratic lawmaker described Biden in this moment as \"reflective.\" A third person close to Biden described the president as politically \"fighting for his life.\"\n\nThere are growing expectations among some allies that if Biden were to exit, it could be in the coming days. But they also caution that it still is up to him to make the decision and that he is not wired to quit even when he faces seemingly insurmountable adversity.\n\nAbout the possibility any announcement is imminent, a person close to the Bidens said, \"We don't even know what we're doing tomorrow.\"\n\nStill, Biden is not insusceptible to the mounting pressure from his own party, and he has said himself since the debate that he may consider leaving the race if there were no path for him to win.\n\n\"I think it's inevitable,\" a second person close to the re-election effort said of Biden's withdrawing from the race.\n\nAs reports surfaced, including from NBC News , that Biden had shown signs that he could budge from his insistence that he remain the nominee, rumors and reports - some that the president's allies flatly denied - began to fly. They included speculation about timing of a potential exit, whether Biden would immediately endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and who was on the shortlist to be her vice presidential running mate.\n\nAmong the reports: that longtime speechwriter and historian Jon Meacham was writing Biden's exit remarks.\n\nMeacham rebuffed the account.\n\n\"The report is totally false,\" he said.\n\nAmid the turmoil the Biden campaign sent out talking points to Democrats, according to a Democratic strategist: \"President Biden has not spoken to congressional leadership today. The president is his party's nominee, having won 14 million votes during the Democratic primary. He's running for re-election, and that will not change until he wins re-election.\"\n\nAs many in his own party turned against him, Biden continued this week to check in with allies and gauge their sentiments.\n\n\"With all the rumors that I'm leaving, I'm not,\" Biden told the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, in a phone call Monday, Sharpton said.\n\n\"I will support whatever you decide,\" Sharpton said he told the president.\n\nSharpton said in an interview Thursday that legacy is something Biden \"has to think of\" as he contemplates his political future. \"If there's anyone that could make a comeback ... it's Joe Biden. Whether he chooses to or not, I don't know.\"\n\nSome in Biden's camp had hoped he would be able to weather the storm of pressure for him to step aside - that news events, including the Republican National Convention, would turn the national conversation away from whether and when he might end his campaign. But even the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday did little to quell the furor around Biden. If anything, Democrats have since turned up the heat.\n\nA major factor driving the private pressure on Biden is the fear among Democrats that his candidacy could rob them not only of the White House and the Senate but also of a chance to flip the House to their control. That helps explain why senior lawmakers have pushed on Biden to reconsider his decision to stay in the race.\n\n\"The House is on the brink,\" said Brian Wolff, the treasurer of the House Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting House Democratic candidates. \"These candidates don't deserve that.\"\n\nWolff said Democratic incumbents and challengers in tough races cannot risk splintering their own voter coalitions by publicly taking one side or the other as Biden considers his options.\n\n\"They can't afford to alienate the base that wants to support Biden or the base that wants someone else,\" he said.\n\nCarol E. Lee is the Washington managing editor.\n\nMonica Alba is a White House correspondent for NBC News.\n\nSarah Fitzpatrick is a senior investigative producer and story editor for NBC News. She previously worked for CBS News and \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nJonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nNatasha Korecki is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Joe Biden ends 2024 trying to define his legacy at home and abroad\n\nTamara Keith\n\nPresident Biden's legacy at the end of his time in office is complicated by the fact that he stayed too long.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: President Biden soon finishes his term in a way that almost no other president ever has - Biden will be replaced by the president that he replaced. And that's a big factor in any assessment of Biden's legacy. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith covered Biden's entire term. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When Joe Biden entered the race for president in 2019, he was explicit about why he was running - to make Donald Trump a one-term president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. KEITH: Biden was elected in the midst of the COVID pandemic, promising stability and competence at home and abroad. And in his first two years in office, with Democrats in control of Congress, he was able to do a lot. BEN LABOLT: He passed legislation that will have an impact for decades. KEITH: Ben LaBolt is White House communications director. He points to the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. LABOLT: But many of these things will take years to come to fruition - the semiconductor factories opening, the transition to clean energy and all the jobs that come with that. And so there will be a lasting impact here long past the moment that the president leaves office in January. KEITH: The unemployment rate is much lower than it was when Biden took office. Crime is down. Wages are up, but so are prices. And globally, alliances may be stronger, but war is raging in the Middle East and Ukraine. Biden has begun talking about how he hopes to be remembered. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Let me say it's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. KEITH: Biden was elected in the midst of the COVID pandemic, promising stability and competence at home and abroad. And in his first two years in office, with Democrats in control of Congress, he was able to do a lot. BEN LABOLT: He passed legislation that will have an impact for decades. KEITH: Ben LaBolt is White House communications director. He points to the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. LABOLT: But many of these things will take years to come to fruition - the semiconductor factories opening, the transition to clean energy and all the jobs that come with that. And so there will be a lasting impact here long past the moment that the president leaves office in January. KEITH: The unemployment rate is much lower than it was when Biden took office. Crime is down. Wages are up, but so are prices. And globally, alliances may be stronger, but war is raging in the Middle East and Ukraine. Biden has begun talking about how he hopes to be remembered. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Let me say it's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes.

Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

Crime is down. Wages are up, but so are prices. And globally, alliances may be stronger, but war is raging in the Middle East and Ukraine. Biden has begun talking about how he hopes to be remembered.

KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies.

So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

KEITH: This was Biden speaking at a recent Democratic National Committee event in Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: The one thing I've always believed about public service, and especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, have we left the country in better shape than we found it? Today, I can say without - with every fiber of my being, with all my heart, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Yes. KEITH: But the way Biden is ultimately remembered, after a 50-year career in public service, may well come down to what happened at the end. His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return.

His decision to run for reelection, despite low approval ratings - that devastating debate performance against Trump, where Biden froze in a way that shocked even his close allies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: With the COVID - excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to deal with - look, if we finally beat Medicare... KEITH: Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Harris with only about 100 days left to go. Presidential historian Tevi Troy says Biden's legacy flipped on Election Day - from the guy who defeated Trump to the one who enabled his return. TEVI TROY: Biden went from the dragon-slayer to the one who brought the dragon back. KEITH: Troy is a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute and has written several books about the American presidency. TROY: The people of a conservative mindset just see him as a failed one-term president because they don't like what he did. The people of a more liberal mindset will look at him and say, he kind of enabled this whole situation that brought back Trump. So he's going to be facing the ire from both sides, and I think that will very much complicate his legacy. KEITH: Veteran Democratic strategist Donna Brazile goes back with Biden more than 37 years and takes a more charitable view. DONNA BRAZILE: I don't blame Joe Biden for the return of Donald Trump. This was a decision by the American people. KEITH: She says the focus now may be on how Biden's political career is ending. But eventually, he will be remembered for what he did in office. BRAZILE: Many of those projects are in red states, congressional districts led by Republicans. Biden doesn't care if it goes to a blue state or a red state. He just want to help everyone across the board. And that's been his history, and it's been his legacy. KEITH: Historian Michael Beschloss says he expects Biden's legacy will forever be tied up with Trump's. MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The way that Joe Biden will be viewed in the future will have almost everything to do with the successes or failures of Donald Trump. KEITH: He notes Trump has promised to reverse some of Biden's biggest accomplishments, like the green energy investments of the Inflation Reduction Act. BESCHLOSS: If all those things are dismantled by Donald Trump, who chooses a very different route, then if Donald Trump is viewed by future generations as a success, it'll count against Joe Biden. KEITH: But Beschloss cautions it's hard to know now how history will remember Biden. There's a reason historians usually wait several decades before digging into a presidency. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

      "text": "After half a century in politics, Biden bids farewell in an Oval Office address\n\nBy\n\nAsma Khalid\n\n,\n\nJason Breslow\n\nPresiden Biden delivers his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident Biden delivered his farewell address to the nation on Wednesday, taking to the Oval Office for one last opportunity to frame his legacy and to deliver a warning about the threat from unchecked abuse of power and wealth and what he described as an emerging oligarchy.\n\nSpeaking from behind the Resolute Desk, Biden sought to sound an alarm about \"a dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people\" that he said risks undermining the very fabric of American life.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy. Our basic rights and freedoms. And a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" he said.\n\nThe address was an echo of the farewell address that then-President Dwight Eisenhower delivered to the nation in 1961, in which he famously warned about the dangers of an emerging \"military industrial complex.\" Today, Biden said, the threat he sees is coming from a \"tech industrial complex.\"\n\nBiden said that the consequences of this emerging concentration of power can already be felt across the nation in myriad ways.\n\nThe fight against climate change was one of several examples he pointed to.\n\n\"Powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit,\" Biden said. \"We must not be bullied to sacrifice in the future, the future of our children and our grandchildren.\"\n\nBut the dangers are evident in other areas as well, the president said. While praising the achievements of U.S. advances in technology, Biden also spoke about how notions of truth are being undermined.\n\n\"Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power,\" Biden said. \"The free press is crumbling, editors are disappearing. Social media is giving up on fact-checking. The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.\"\n\nBiden spoke about artificial intelligence as the \"most consequential technology of our time, perhaps of all time,\" yet simultaneously cautioned of the technology's potential dangers without adequate safeguards in place. Without those protections, he said, \"AI could spawn new threats to our rights, our way of life, to our privacy, how we work and how we protect our nation.\"\n\nBiden also used his remarks to make the case for various reforms in the nation's capital. He called for \"dark money\" to be eliminated as a form of campaign contributions, for a ban on stock trading by members of Congress and for 18-year term limits for members of the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd without mentioning President-elect Donald Trump by name, he said the Constitution should be amended \"to make clear that no president - no president - is immune from crimes that he or she commits while in office.\"\n\nBiden's remarks marked a coda to a political career that spanned more than half a century - a career that took him from a blue-collar upbringing in Scranton, Pa., to the halls of power in the U.S. Senate; from two terms as vice president under former President Barack Obama to his own improbable victory in 2020.\n\n\"America can be defined by one word: 'possibilities,' \" Biden said. \"Only in America, do we believe anything is possible, like a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pa.; Claymont, Del., sitting behind this desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States. That's the magic of America.\"\n\nBiden ran for president insisting the soul of the nation was at stake. \"That's still the case,\" Biden said ahead of his remarks in a letter to the American public . \"History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden, 82, had hoped for another four years at the White House, but his reelection chances were hurt by high inflation, disenchantment over illegal immigration and questions about his age. Weeks after a disastrous debate performance last June, he announced he would give up his bid for a second term.\n\nHe is leaving office deeply unpopular, and in less than a week will turn power over to Trump - a leader Biden had vowed to make a one-term president. After losing to Biden four years ago, Trump will now return to the White House promising to undo broad pieces of Biden's accomplishments.\n\nBiden touched on a number of those achievements over the course of his address Wednesday night. He said he was proud of his accomplishments, noting the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, historic investments in infrastructure, lowering prescription drug prices and gun-safety legislation.\n\nBiden delivered his remarks hours after announcing a diplomatic breakthrough in the war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. The conflict has at times dominated his presidency - and also eroded his support among many Arab Americans. But speaking from the White House earlier in the day, Biden was able to announce a ceasefire agreement designed to end more than 15 months of bloodshed.\n\nHe called the opportunity to serve as commander in chief \"the highest honor of my life,\" and said that after 50 years of public service he continued to have faith in the future of the nation.\n\n\"I give you my word: I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands, a nation where the strengths of our institutions and the character of our people matter and must endure,\" Biden said.\n\nBut as he prepares to leave the White House, he said it is also time to pass the torch.\n\n\"Now it's your turn to stand guard. May you all be the keeper of the flame. May you keep the faith. I love America. You love it, too.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Here's what he has planned.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: President Biden has less than 60 days left in office. And with so much focus on the Trump transition, the current president has diminished from view. So we wanted to know how he's spending his time, what he has planned. I'm joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Hey there. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: OK, so two months and counting to go. How is President Biden spending his time, treating this period? We're in lame duck days here. KEITH: Yeah. In short, he's trying to get as much done and locked in as possible before his time is up. Biden and his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, held a call last week with about 2,000 political appointees throughout the administration. And a White House official tells me that Biden acknowledged the emotion they might be feeling after the election, but said he needed them to bring the same purpose they had throughout their time in the administration and to harness it to get as much done as they can in the closing days. Zients then brought his business world jargon, asking them to focus on execution, execution, execution, adding, let's finish strong. KELLY: Finish strong. This sounds like a pep talk my ninth grade softball team got. I'm assuming the White House has something slightly more ambitious in mind? KEITH: Yeah. In some ways, it's a lot of what the administration has been doing for the past two years. Early in the Biden administration, Congress passed these big pieces of legislation - the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes a lot of clean energy investments; the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; the CHIPS and Science Act. And the administration has already obligated a lot of that money, awarding grants and signing contracts, and we're going to see more of that happening in the weeks ahead. They're also trying to get the word out about popular parts of these laws. For example, in January, a provision goes into effect that caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors at $2,000 a year. Trump has said he wants to roll back a lot of this Biden-era legislation, so the Biden team is trying to use its remaining time to make that harder to do. KELLY: Well, and speaking of legislation, is the Biden team trying to get any more legislation passed before they leave office? KEITH: They are, but it's not much more than the bare minimum needed to keep the government functioning. They need to pass a temporary government funding bill. There's a defense policy bill that comes up annually. And the White House has asked Congress to pass billions of dollars in additional funding for disaster relief because funds to help people recovering from hurricanes and wildfires are running low. Perhaps the most significant push is in the Senate, where Democrats are trying to confirm as many of President Biden's judicial nominees as possible. This is something Republicans did at the end of Trump's term. These are lifetime appointments, and Biden doesn't want to give Trump the gift of judicial vacancies to fill with conservative judges. So Trump is complaining mightily about this on social media, but Democrats are doing their best to plow ahead, including some very late-night votes. KELLY: OK. So as President Biden plows ahead in these last few weeks, is he staying put in Washington? Does he have travel, any vacations? KEITH: Oh, he's totally going on vacation. He's going to be in Nantucket this week with his family. And then he is doing a formal - a more formal trip. He's traveling to Angola next month. He had promised to visit the continent of Africa earlier in his term. He has missed his deadline on that, but he is getting it in under the wire. KELLY: Any last things you are watching for? KEITH: Yeah. Pardons and commutations are a power of the presidency often exercised at the very end. The White House has insisted the President won't pardon his son Hunter, but Biden has used this power, the pardon power, to send a signal about inequality in the nation's drug laws, and he could do something like that again. I'm also expecting him to deliver a farewell address, as most presidents have done. One thing he hasn't done yet since the election is hold a press conference. That had been a tradition up until Trump. We don't know why he hasn't, but I can guarantee if he does, he will be asked about his legacy and why his tune changed on Trump being a threat to democracy once the votes were counted.

And a White House official tells me that Biden acknowledged the emotion they might be feeling after the election, but said he needed them to bring the same purpose they had throughout their time in the administration and to harness it to get as much done as they can in the closing days. Zients then brought his business world jargon, asking them to focus on execution, execution, execution, adding, let's finish strong. KELLY: Finish strong. This sounds like a pep talk my ninth grade softball team got. I'm assuming the White House has something slightly more ambitious in mind? KEITH: Yeah. In some ways, it's a lot of what the administration has been doing for the past two years. Early in the Biden administration, Congress passed these big pieces of legislation - the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes a lot of clean energy investments; the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; the CHIPS and Science Act. And the administration has already obligated a lot of that money, awarding grants and signing contracts, and we're going to see more of that happening in the weeks ahead. They're also trying to get the word out about popular parts of these laws. For example, in January, a provision goes into effect that caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors at $2,000 a year. Trump has said he wants to roll back a lot of this Biden-era legislation, so the Biden team is trying to use its remaining time to make that harder to do. KELLY: Well, and speaking of legislation, is the Biden team trying to get any more legislation passed before they leave office? KEITH: They are, but it's not much more than the bare minimum needed to keep the government functioning. They need to pass a temporary government funding bill. There's a defense policy bill that comes up annually. And the White House has asked Congress to pass billions of dollars in additional funding for disaster relief because funds to help people recovering from hurricanes and wildfires are running low. Perhaps the most significant push is in the Senate, where Democrats are trying to confirm as many of President Biden's judicial nominees as possible. This is something Republicans did at the end of Trump's term. These are lifetime appointments, and Biden doesn't want to give Trump the gift of judicial vacancies to fill with conservative judges. So Trump is complaining mightily about this on social media, but Democrats are doing their best to plow ahead, including some very late-night votes. KELLY: OK. So as President Biden plows ahead in these last few weeks, is he staying put in Washington? Does he have travel, any vacations? KEITH: Oh, he's totally going on vacation. He's going to be in Nantucket this week with his family. And then he is doing a formal - a more formal trip. He's traveling to Angola next month. He had promised to visit the continent of Africa earlier in his term. He has missed his deadline on that, but he is getting it in under the wire. KELLY: Any last things you are watching for? KEITH: Yeah. Pardons and commutations are a power of the presidency often exercised at the very end. The White House has insisted the President won't pardon his son Hunter, but Biden has used this power, the pardon power, to send a signal about inequality in the nation's drug laws, and he could do something like that again. I'm also expecting him to deliver a farewell address, as most presidents have done. One thing he hasn't done yet since the election is hold a press conference. That had been a tradition up until Trump. We don't know why he hasn't, but I can guarantee if he does, he will be asked about his legacy and why his tune changed on Trump being a threat to democracy once the votes were counted.

He had promised to visit the continent of Africa earlier in his term. He has missed his deadline on that, but he is getting it in under the wire. KELLY: Any last things you are watching for? KEITH: Yeah. Pardons and commutations are a power of the presidency often exercised at the very end. The White House has insisted the President won't pardon his son Hunter, but Biden has used this power, the pardon power, to send a signal about inequality in the nation's drug laws, and he could do something like that again. I'm also expecting him to deliver a farewell address, as most presidents have done. One thing he hasn't done yet since the election is hold a press conference. That had been a tradition up until Trump. We don't know why he hasn't, but I can guarantee if he does, he will be asked about his legacy and why his tune changed on Trump being a threat to democracy once the votes were counted.

KEITH: They are, but it's not much more than the bare minimum needed to keep the government functioning. They need to pass a temporary government funding bill. There's a defense policy bill that comes up annually. And the White House has asked Congress to pass billions of dollars in additional funding for disaster relief because funds to help people recovering from hurricanes and wildfires are running low. Perhaps the most significant push is in the Senate, where Democrats are trying to confirm as many of President Biden's judicial nominees as possible. This is something Republicans did at the end of Trump's term. These are lifetime appointments, and Biden doesn't want to give Trump the gift of judicial vacancies to fill with conservative judges. So Trump is complaining mightily about this on social media, but Democrats are doing their best to plow ahead, including some very late-night votes. KELLY: OK.

      "text": "Trump won. Here are 3 Biden priorities under scrutiny\n\nAsma Khalid\n\nThen-President Donald Trump signs an executive order related to reforming the hiring process for federal jobs on June 26, 2020. Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said during his campaign that he wants to roll back a number of policies championed by his soon-to-be predecessor in the White House.\n\nAhead of the election, the Biden White House tried to \"Trump-proof\" some of its key priorities. Here's a look at three of them.\n\nTrump has long railed against what he calls the \"deep state\" - opposition to his plans from within the civil service.\n\nIn the final weeks of his first term, Trump issued an executive order creating a new class of federal workers known as Schedule F who would be exempt from the United States' traditional merit-based civil service program. The Biden administration saw this as a blatant attempt to politicize and dismantle the traditional nonpartisan federal workforce.\n\nPresident Biden rescinded that executive order in his first week on the job. The Office of Personnel Management - the government's human resources department - issued a final rule in April to further solidify job protections and make it more difficult to overhaul the federal workforce for ideological reasons.\n\nThen-OPM Director Kiran Ahuja said the new rule would help \"ensure that people are hired and fired based on merit and that they can carry out their duties based on their expertise and not political loyalty.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nAn OPM official speaking on the condition of anonymity ahead of the November election told NPR that they believe the current regulation is \"extremely strong\" and that any effort to repeal it would have to go through multiple steps.\n\nOnce a rule is on the books, it can't just be changed via executive order, so the new Trump administration would have to propose a new rule - a long and somewhat tedious regulatory process that could take months or even years.\n\n\"They would have to put it out for public comment, and they then would have to issue a final rule that survived judicial scrutiny, because it would almost certainly be challenged,\" said Howard Shelanski, who was the head of the federal Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration.\n\n\"I actually think it would take a fair bit of luck for a Trump administration to actually rescind the rule and get that affirmed by a court within the one presidential term he would have,\" said Shelanski. \"But it's certainly possible.\"\n\nAn electric vehicle charges at a public Electrify America direct current fast charger in Los Angeles on May 16. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP hide caption\n\nTrump has threatened to gut the Inflation Reduction Act , the landmark climate legislation passed by Democrats in 2022 that contains the largest federal clean energy investment in U.S. history.\n\nThe law includes more than $300 billion in spending to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and spur investments in clean energy. As part of that package, it offers tax breaks for consumers and subsidies for manufacturing.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has already talked about trying to rescind elements of the law.\n\nParticularly vulnerable are tax credits for people who want to purchase electric vehicles and incentives to build electric-charging infrastructure.\n\n\"Trump has a weird obsession with those two policies,\" said Josh Freed, senior vice president of climate and energy at the left-leaning think tank Third Way.\n\n\"And there's an enormous tax bill that will be negotiated in 2025 that would give a Trump administration a pathway to do just that,\" Freed said in an interview.\n\nBut the Biden administration believes that the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred investments in manufacturing projects in a large number of Republican congressional districts - and influential private companies have already built the tax credits into their business plans. That could make rollbacks politically unpopular, a senior administration official told NPR, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly ahead of the election.\n\nA group of House Republicans underscored these points in a letter to Johnson, the House speaker, a few months ago. \"Prematurely repealing energy tax credits, particularly those which were used to justify investments that already broke ground, would undermine private investments and stop development that is already ongoing,\" they wrote.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Biden met with world leaders on Sept. 25 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images hide caption\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the White House quickly came to Ukraine's aid. Biden repeatedly said that U.S. support for Ukraine would not waver.\n\nCongress approved more than $112 billion in support for Ukraine during that year. But when that money ran out, Biden had to fight for months to get another $61 billion package across the finish line as Republicans balked.\n\nTrump, who has long campaigned on the idea of American isolationism, has criticized the scale of this financial support. He has not explicitly said he would cut off all aid, but he has called for an end to the war and has suggested that there would be changes when he takes office.\n\nOver the last several months, knowing the election would create uncertainty about support for Ukraine, the Biden White House took a series of steps.\n\nThis summer, NATO took on a larger role in coordinating military support and training for Ukraine - an effort that previously had largely been spearheaded by the United States. Then, in September, Biden announced that he would ensure all remaining funds for Ukraine would be allocated by the end of his term, leaving no money for the next president's discretion. And a month later, the G7 announced a new plan to provide additional support for Ukraine - a $50 billion loan . The United States plans to provide $20 billion of that total, getting the money out the door beginning in December, ahead of Inauguration Day.\n\nThe loan would be paid back with interest earned on frozen Russian sovereign assets. \"In other words,\" Biden said in a statement, \"Ukraine can receive the assistance it needs now, without burdening taxpayers.\"\n\nThe situation on the battlefield might also look different by the time Trump takes the oath of office, said Elizabeth Hoffman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"A big question in my mind is: Will the Biden administration, before they leave, authorize any kind of deeper strikes into Russia? That could really make a difference, too,\" Hoffman said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Something I hope we can do, no matter who you voted for, is to see each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans.\"\n\nThe president acknowledged the disappointment of the election results, calling it a setback. But he said \"giving up is unforgivable.\"\n\n\"You're hurting. I hear you and I see you, but don't forget - don't forget all that we accomplished. It's been a historic presidency, not because I'm president, because of what we've done, what you've done,\" he said. \"We've changed America for the better.\"\n\nHe said the successes of his administration will be felt years down the road, and he said the administration was leaving behind the strongest economy in the world.\n\nBiden said there were still 74 days left of his administration to keep working for the country.\n\n\"Let's make every day count.

Handout/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption\n\nPresident Biden, in a much anticipated interview Friday with ABC News, attributed his terrible debate performance to \"a bad episode\" and a \"bad night\" and defiantly said he would not drop out of the presidential race.\n\nHe was working to try to reassure his fellow Democrats, fielding tough questions in a 20-minute interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, which was aired in its entirety.\n\nBiden defended his record, said he was the candidate best placed to defeat former President Donald Trump in November, and declined to take an independent medical evaluation - including a neurological and cognitive test - to show he's fit to serve another term.\n\n\"I have a cognitive test every single day,\" Biden said. \"Not only am I campaigning, but I'm running the world,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether he would stand down if he could be convinced that you cannot defeat Trump, Biden was defiant: \"Well, it depends if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that - I might do that.\"\n\nBiden, 81, said he \"was exhausted\" during last week's presidential debate against Trump, and added there was \"no indication of a serious condition.\" He had been \"feeling terrible\" ahead of the debate, but medical tests determined it was just a \"really bad cold.\"\n\nAfter the debate, Biden said, his doctor looked at him and said: \"You're exhausted.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was the same man today as he was when he took office in January 2021, Biden replied: \"Yes. I also was guy put together a peace plan for the Middle East. ... I was also the guy that expanded NATO.\" He said the economy had grown during his administration.\n\nAsked if he had shown signs of decline in the last few months, as reported by several news organizations, Biden replied: \"Can I run 110 flat?

Mark Warner, D-Va., was working to try to get a group of Democratic senators to ask for Biden to leave the campaign.

I have a different perspective.\"\n\nBut Warner wasn't the only voice. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey urged Biden Friday to evaluate whether he was the party's best hope to beat Trump. \"Healey didn't say anything when I was in the room,\" Biden told reporters, referring to a meeting he had with the nation's Democratic governors this week.\n\nPresident Biden's motorcade arrives at a campaign rally at Sherman Middle School in Madison, Wis. on July 5.

Sherrod Brown, who said the intraparty drama was a distraction from issues important to voters in his tough reelection race this fall.\n\nBiden was isolating in his beach house after getting COVID earlier this week. But he said in a statement on Friday that he would be back on the campaign trail next week.\n\nHis party has gone through an excruciatingly public deliberation over the past three weeks after Biden froze up during a debate with former President Donald Trump. Top leaders in Congress have failed to publicly deny a steady drip of leaks that they've appealed to Biden to step aside for a younger candidate because they think he can't win the election.\n\nAsked about the scores of headlines reporting that Biden is considering whether to leave the race, his campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon told MSNBC's Morning Joe that party leaders should consider the strong grassroots support for Biden and resolve their doubts over whether he should stay in the race for a second term.\n\n\"You have heard from the president directly time and again. He is in this race to win and he is our nominee and he's going to be our president for a second term,\" O'Malley Dillon said.\n\nThere are now four senators who have asked their former long-time colleague to step aside. On Friday - the morning after Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention -  Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., joined the list.\n\n\"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\" said Heinrich, who is running for reelection in what is supposed to be a safe seat for the party.\n\nA group of four prominent members from the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the progressive caucus called on Biden to stop running. \"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" said Reps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., Marc Veasey, D-Texas, Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., and Mark Pocan, D-Wis.\n\nAnd there were a steady drip of other Democratic lawmakers issuing statements on Friday. Democratic sources told NPR that they expect more lawmakers will go public with concerns about the president's viability as a candidate, saying the process will take more time to play out as they watch DNC convention rules committee meetings this weekend.\n\nBut, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, endorsed Biden. \"It is clear that Latino voters will decide the margin of victory in competitive races up and down the ballot this cycle, from California and New Mexico to Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Nebraska, said Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., chair of BOLD PAC.\n\nVice President Harris and her grand-nieces get ice cream from a shop owned by Tyra Banks, center left, in Washington, on July 19.

Vice President Harris is an obvious choice, and a group of young Democratic governors are also seen as having future presidential ambitions. All of them have said they fully support Biden.\n\nHarris - who took her grand-nieces for ice cream in Washington on Friday - has travel planned for Massachusetts on Saturday, Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday.\n\nThe campaign has not yet announced where Biden will be traveling next week. On Friday, his doctor said his COVID symptoms have improved . He is taking the antiviral Paxlovid.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic National Convention's rules committee met about the virtual roll call vote it plans to hold in early August to ensure the party's candidate is official before early state deadlines that come before the party's convention begins on Aug. 19.\n\nThe party is worried about lawsuits, the DNC's outside counsel Dana Remus said. \"Unfortunately, at this moment in time, we have to assume that everything about the election process that Republicans and affiliated groups can challenge, they will challenge no matter the strength of their arguments,\" Remus said.\n\nAnother DNC committee will meet on Sunday to discuss the roll call further.\n\nO'Malley Dillon said it has been a \"tough several weeks\" for the campaign but said the party needs to unify.\n\nShe said Biden has \"the greatest respect for the leaders of our party\" - referring to reports about the doubts expressed by congressional leaders and former President Barack Obama.\n\nBut O'Malley Dillon pointed to a letter now signed by 1,400 Black women leaders from across the country released this week that strongly backed Biden and urged party leaders to \"stop the attacks\" against him.\n\n\"We reject all efforts to disregard this fact or to circumvent the will of millions of voters\" who backed Biden in the primaries, the women said in a signed copy of the letter obtained by NPR.\n\nO'Malley Dillon said that the campaign has \"seen some slippage in support\" since Biden's disastrous debate, but said party volunteers have found strong interest on the ground in battleground states.\n\n\"People are not moving from Joe Biden to Donald Trump. What they're doing is they're saying to us, 'Can he do it?' And the president is saying, 'Yes, I can,'\" she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

But the term discounts real work that can get done, says Eric Schultz who worked right up until the end in the Obama White House.\n\nSchulz said Obama directed his staff to leave it all on the field. \"He was very clear that even in our worst days, there will be no other place in life or job or role or platform where you can have as much impact,\" Schultz said.\n\nFor Biden and his team - who will have served only four years instead of eight - that feeling may be even more acute, Schultz said.\n\nPresident Biden hugs Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter freed by Russia in a multinational prisoner exchange, on Aug. 1, 2024 at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.

If another Democrat steps up to challenge Harris, the party could be headed for an open convention, which could go to multiple rounds of voting.\n\nMuch depends on whether Democrats - and more importantly, the 4,700 or so convention delegates - coalesce behind a single candidate before they convene on August 19.\n\nIf there are serious competitors for Harris, the convention would be preceded by something resembling a highly accelerated primary campaign where the voters being wooed are the delegates. The delegate voting process is spelled out in Democratic party rules .\n\n\"Think of it as a redo of the primary system in a very, very, very compressed period of time,\" said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a Democratic National Committee member and a delegate herself. She spoke to a group of delegates about the potential process on Friday.\n\nShe suggested the candidates would name their intended running mates.\n\nBut Kamarck told delegates that she was skeptical there would be a contest, because of the tight timelines. \"The problem is we are really up against the clock. This is a month,\" she told delegates on a Zoom on Friday.\n\nUnder DNC rules , requests to nominate a candidate must be presented in writing and include written approval from the proposed nominee - as well as a petition with signatures from at least 300 convention delegates. Harris has already racked up enough endorsements that this will be easy for her to pull together.

Starting with the 1972 election, party rules were changed to shift the power to pick the nominee from party power brokers to voters whose preferences are logged months before the convention.\n\nThe rules were adjusted again after the contentious 2016 Democratic primary to further dilute the influence of party leaders in favor of the preference of voters.\n\nAn open convention would be \"reality TV like you can't imagine,\" said Kamarck. \"But there is a procedure for doing it right.

Kennedy was assassinated, leaving Vice President Hubert Humphrey to battle it out with anti-war Senator Eugene McCarthy.\n\nHumphrey came into the convention with the majority of delegates and left as the Democratic nominee, but the convention put an ugly intraparty battle on display with protests inside and outside the convention hall.\n\n\"Lots of voters tuned in to these conventions because it was only at the conventions that you saw the real drama,\" said Kamarck.\n\nRepublican Richard Nixon won the election that November and Democrats instituted a series of reforms to the nominating process to give regular voters more say.\n\nLoading...\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "A Year of Empty Threats and a \"Smokescreen\" Policy: How the State Department Let Israel Get Away With Horrors in Gaza\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nIn early November, a small group of senior U.S. human rights diplomats met with a top official in President Joe Biden's State Department to make one final, emphatic plea: We must keep our word.\n\nWeeks before, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the administration delivered their most explicit ultimatum yet to Israel, demanding the Israel Defense Forces allow hundreds more trucksloads of food and medicine into Gaza every day - or else. American law and Biden's own policies prohibit arms sales to countries that restrict humanitarian aid. Israel had 30 days to comply.\n\nIn the month that followed, the IDF was accused of roundly defying the U.S., its most important ally. The Israeli military tightened its grip, continued to restrict desperately needed aid trucks and displaced 100,000 Palestinians from North Gaza, humanitarian groups found , exacerbating what was already a dire crisis \"to its worst point since the war began.\"\n\nSeveral attendees at the November meeting - officials who help lead the State Department's efforts to promote racial equity, religious freedom and other high-minded principles of democracy - said the United States' international credibility had been severely damaged by Biden's unstinting support of Israel. If there was ever a time to hold Israel accountable, one ambassador at the meeting told Tom Sullivan, the State Department's counselor and a senior policy adviser to Blinken, it was now.\n\nBut the decision had already been made. Sullivan said the deadline would likely pass without action and Biden would continue sending shipments of bombs uninterrupted, according to two people who were in the meeting.\n\nThose in the room deflated. \"Don't our law, policy and morals demand it?\" an attendee told me later, reflecting on the decision to once again capitulate. \"What is the rationale of this approach? There is no explanation they can articulate.\"\n\nSoon after, when the 30-day deadline was up, Blinken made it official and said that Israelis had begun implementing most of the steps he had laid out in his letter - all thanks to the pressure the U.S. had applied.\n\nThat choice was immediately called into question. On Nov. 14, a U.N. committee said that Israel's methods in Gaza, including its use of starvation as a weapon, was \"consistent with genocide.\" Amnesty International went further and concluded a genocide was underway . The International Criminal Court also issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister for the war crime of deliberately starving civilians, among other allegations. (The U.S. and Israeli governments have rejected the genocide determination as well as the warrants.)\n\nThe October red line was the last one Biden laid down, but it wasn't the first. His administration issued multiple threats, warnings and admonishments to Israel about its conduct after Oct. 7, 2023, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, killed some 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\n\nGovernment officials worry Biden's record of empty threats have given the Israelis a sense of impunity.\n\nTrump, who has made a raft of pro-Israel nominations, made it clear he wanted the war in Gaza to end before he took office and threatened that \"all hell will break out\" if Hamas did not release its hostages by then.\n\nOn Wednesday, after months of negotiations, Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire deal. While it will become clear over the next days and months exactly what the contours of the agreement are, why it happened now and who deserves the most credit, it's plausible that Trump's imminent ascension to the White House was its own form of a red line. Early reports suggest the deal looks similar to what has been on the table for months, raising the possibility that if the Biden administration had followed through on its tough words, a deal could have been reached earlier, saving lives.\n\n\"Netanyahu's conclusion was that Biden doesn't have enough oomph to make him pay a price, so he was willing to ignore him,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute who's focused on U.S.-Israel relations and a former official with the Palestinian Authority who helped advise on prior peace talks. \"Part of it is that Netanyahu learned there is no cost to saying 'no' to the current president.\"\n\nSo-called red lines have long been a prominent foreign policy tool for the world's most powerful nations. They are communicated publicly in pronouncements by senior officials and privately by emissaries. They amount to rules of the road for friends and adversaries - you can go this far but no further.\n\nThe failure to enforce those lines in recent years has had consequences, current and former U.S. officials said. One frequently cited example arose in 2012 when President Barack Obama told the Syrian government that using chemical weapons against its own people would change his calculus about directly intervening. When Syria's then-President Bashar al-Assad launched rockets with chemical gas and killed hundreds of civilians anyway, Obama backpedaled and ultimately chose not to invade, a move critics say allowed the civil war to spiral further while extremist groups took advantage by recruiting locals.\n\nAuthorities in and outside government said the acquiescence to Israel as it prosecuted a brutal war will likely be regarded as one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of the Biden presidency. They say it undermines America's ability to influence events in the Middle East while \"destroying the entire edifice of international law that was put into place after WWII,\" as Omer Bartov, a renowned Israeli-American scholar of genocide, put it. Jeffrey Feltman, the former assistant secretary of the State Department's Middle East bureau, told me he fears much of the Muslim world now sees the U.S. as \"ineffective at best or complicit at worst in the large-scale civilian destruction and death.\"\n\nBiden's warnings over the past year have also been explicit. Last spring, the president vowed to stop supplying offensive bombs to Israel if it launched a major invasion into the southern city of Rafah. He also told Netanyahu the U.S. was going to rethink support for the war unless he took new steps to protect civilians and aid workers after the IDF blew up a World Central Kitchen caravan. And Blinken signaled that he would blacklist a notorious IDF unit for the death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank if the soldiers involved were not brought to justice.\n\nTime and again, Israel crossed the Biden administration's red lines without changing course in a meaningful way, according to interviews with government officials and outside experts. Each time, the U.S. yielded and continued to send Israel's military deadly weapons of war, approving more than $17.9 billion in military assistance since late 2023, by some estimates. The State Department recently told Congress about another $8 billion proposed deal to sell Israel munitions and artillery shells.\n\n\"It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the red lines have all just been a smokescreen,\" said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School and a preeminent authority on U.S. policy in the region. \"The Biden administration decided to be all in and merely pretended that it was trying to do something about it.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times , Blinken disagreed and said Netanyahu has listened to him by softening Israel's most aggressive tactics, including in Rafah. He also argued there was a cost to even questioning the IDF openly. \"Whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel,\" Blinken said, \"Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a ceasefire and the release of hostages.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that not enough humanitarian assistance has been reaching civilians and said the Israelis initially resisted the idea of allowing any food and medicine into Gaza - which would be a war crime - but Netanyahu relented in response to U.S. pressure behind the scenes. Blinken backtracked later in the interview and suggested that the blocking of aid was not Israeli policy. \"There's a very different question about what was the intent,\" he told the Times.\n\nFor this story, ProPublica spoke with scores of current and former officials throughout the year and read through government memos, cables and emails, many of which have not been reported previously. The records and interviews shed light on why Biden and his top advisers refused to adjust his policy even as new evidence of Israeli abuses emerged.\n\nThroughout the contentious year inside the State Department, senior leaders repeatedly disregarded their own experts. They cracked down on leaks by threatening criminal investigations and classifying material that was critical of Israel. Some of the agency's top Middle East diplomats complained in private that they were sidelined by Biden's National Security Council. The council also distributed a list of banned phrases, including any version of \"State of Palestine\" that didn't have the word \"future\" first.  Two human rights officials said they were prevented from pursuing evidence of abuses in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe State Department did not make Blinken available for an interview, but the agency's top spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said in a statement that Blinken welcomes internal dissent and has incorporated it into his policymaking. \"The Department continues to encourage individuals to make their opinions known through appropriate channels,\" he added. Miller denied that the agency has classified material for any reason other than national security.\n\nOver the past year, reports have documented physical and sexual abuse in Israeli prisons, using Palestinians as human shields and razing residential buildings and hospitals . At one point early in the conflict, UNICEF said more than 10 children required amputations every day on average. Israeli soldiers have videotaped themselves burning food supplies and ransacking homes. One IDF group reportedly said , \"Our job is to flatten Gaza.\"\n\nIsrael's defenders, including those on the National Security Council , acknowledge the devastating human toll but contend that American arms have helped Israel advance western interests in the region and protect itself from other enemies. Indeed, Netanyahu has significantly diminished Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing many of the groups' leaders. Then Iran's \"axis of resistance\" received its most consequential blow late last year when rebel groups ousted Assad from Syria.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew told the Times of Israel he worried that a generation of young Americans will harbor anti-Israel sentiments into the future. He said he wished that Israel had done a better job at communicating how carefully it undertook combat decisions and calling attention to its humanitarian successes to counter a narrative in the American press that he considers biased.\n\n\"The media that is presenting a pro-Hamas perspective is out instantaneously telling a story,\" Lew said. \"It tells a story that is, over time, shown not to be completely accurate. 'Thirty-five children were killed.' Well, it wasn't 35 children. It was many fewer.\"\n\n\"The children who were killed,\" he added, \"turned out to have been the children of Hamas fighters.\"\n\nThe repercussions for the United States and the region will play out for years. Protests have erupted outside the American embassies in Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia, the world's third-largest democracy, while polls show Arab Americans grew increasingly hostile to their own government stateside. Russia, before its black eye in Syria, and China have both sought to capitalize by entering business and defense deals with Arab nations. By the summer, State Department analysts in the Middle East sent cables to Washington expressing concerns that the IDF's conduct would only inflame tensions in the West Bank and galvanize young Palestinians to take up arms against Israel. Intelligence officials warn that terrorist groups are recruiting on the anti-American sentiment throughout the region, which they say is at its highest levels in years.\n\nThe Israeli government did not answer detailed questions, but a spokesperson for the embassy in Washington, D.C., broadly defended Israel's relationship with the U.S., \"two allies who have been working together to push back against extremist, destabilizing actors.\" Israel is a country of laws, the spokesperson added, and its actions over the past 15 months \"benefit the interests of the free world and the United States, creating an opportunity for a better future for the Middle East amid the tragedy of the war started by Hamas.\"\n\nNext week, Trump will inherit a demoralized State Department, part of the federal bureaucracy from which he has pledged to cull disloyal employees. Grappling with the near-daily images of carnage in Gaza, many across the U.S. government have become disenchanted with the lofty ideas they thought they represented.\n\n\"This is the human rights atrocity of our time,\" one senior diplomat told me. \"I work for the department that's responsible for this policy. I signed up for this. ... I don't deserve sympathy for it.\"\n\nThe southern city of Rafah was supposed to be a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who the IDF had forced from their homes in the north at the start of the war. When Biden learned that Netanyahu intended to invade the city this spring, he warned that the U.S. will stop sending offensive arms if the Israelis went through with it.\n\n\"It is a red line,\" Biden had said, marking the first high-profile warning from the U.S.\n\nNetanyahu invaded in May anyway. Israeli tanks rolled into the city and the IDF dropped bombs on Hamas targets, including a refugee camp , killing dozens of civilians. Biden responded by pausing a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs but otherwise resumed military support.\n\nIn late May, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to stop its assault on the city, citing the Geneva Conventions. Behind the scenes, State Department lawyers scrambled to come up with a legal basis on which Israel could continue smaller attacks in Rafah. \"There is room to argue that more scaled back/targeted operations, combined with better humanitarian efforts, would not meet that threshold,\" the lawyers said in a May 24 email. While it's not unreasonable for government lawyers to defend a close ally, critics say the cable illustrates the extreme deference the U.S. affords Israel.\n\n\"The State Department has a whole raft of highly paid, very good lawyers to explain, 'Actually this is not illegal,' when in fact it is,\" said Ari Tolany, an arms trade authority and director at the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. \"Rules for thee and not for me.\"\n\nThe administration says that it restrained Israel's attack in Rafah. In a recent interview, Lew told the Times of Israel the operation ultimately resulted in relatively few civilian casualties. \"It was done in a way that limited or really eliminated the friction between the United States and Israel,\" he added, \"but also led to a much better outcome.\"\n\nSeveral experts told me international law is effectively discretionary for some countries. \"American policy ignores it when it's inconvenient and adheres to it when it is convenient,\" said Aaron Miller, a career State Department diplomat who worked for decades under both Democratic and Republican presidents as an adviser on Arab-Israeli negotiations. \"The U.S. does not leverage or bring sustainable, credible, serious pressure to bear on any of its allies and partners,\" he added, \"not just Israel.\"\n\nRead More\n\nMiller and others note that the barbarity of Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, galvanized domestic support for Israel and made it significantly easier for Biden to avoid holding the Israelis accountable as they retaliated.\n\nThere are other likely reasons for Biden's unwillingness to impose any realistic limitations on Israel's use of American weaponry since Oct. 7. For one, his career-long affinity for Israel - its security, people and the idea of a friendly democracy in the Middle East - is shared by many of the most powerful people in the country. (\"If this Capitol crumbles to the ground, the one thing that would remain is our commitment to our aid - I don't even call it aid, our cooperation - with Israel,\" Nancy Pelosi said in 2018, weeks before resuming her role as House speaker.) That rationale aligned with the Democrats' political goals during an election when they were wary of taking risks and upsetting large portions of the electorate, including the immensely powerful Israel lobby.\n\nImmediately after the ICJ's order about the Rafah invasion, officials in the State Department's Middle East and communications divisions drafted a list of proposed public statements to acknowledge the importance of the court and express concern over civilians in the city. But Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesperson, nixed almost all of them. He told the officials in a May 24 email that those on the White House's National Security Council \"aren't going to clear\" any recognition of the ruling or criticism of Israel.\n\nThat was an early sign that the State Department was taking a back seat in shaping war policy. In its place, the NSC - largely led by Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein - assumed a larger role. While the NSC has grown significantly in size and influence over the decades, State Department officials repeatedly told me they felt marginalized this past year.\n\n\"The NSC has final say over our messaging,\" one diplomat said. \"All any of us can do is what they'll allow us to do.\"\n\nThe NSC did not make its senior leaders available for an interview or respond to questions from ProPublica. Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser and brother to the State Department's counselor, said recently it was difficult, for much of the past year, \"to get the Israeli government to align with a lot of what President Biden publicly has been saying\" about Gaza.\n\nRead More\n\nSullivan said too many civilians have died there and the U.S. was frequently required to publicly and privately pressure Israel to improve the flow of humanitarian aid. \"We believe Israel has a responsibility - as a democracy, as a country committed to the basic principle of the value of innocent life, and as a member of the international community that has obligations under international humanitarian law - that it do the utmost to protect and minimize harm to civilians.\"\n\nDuring another internal State Department meeting in March, top regional diplomats voiced their frustrations about messaging and appearances. Hady Amr, one of the government's highest-ranking authorities on Palestinian affairs, said he was reluctant to address large groups about the administration's Israel policy and he took issue with much of it, according to notes of the conversation. He warned colleagues that the sentiment in Muslim communities was turning. From a public diplomacy perspective, Amr told them, the war has been \"catastrophically bad for the U.S.\" (Amr did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAnother attendee at the meeting said they had been effectively sidelined by the NSC. A third said it was a huge amount of effort to even get permission to use the word \"condemn\" when talking about Israeli settlers demolishing Palestinians' homes in the West Bank.\n\nSuch sanitizing language became common. Alex Smith, a former contractor with the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that at one point the State Department distributed NSC's list of phrases that he and others weren't allowed to use on internal presentations. Instead of \"Palestinian residents of Jerusalem,\" for example, they were meant to say \"non-Israeli residents of Jerusalem.\" Another official told Smith in an email, \"I would recommend not discussing [international humanitarian law] at all without extensive clearances.\"\n\nA USAID spokesperson said in an email that the agency couldn't discuss personnel matters, but the list of terms was given to the agency by the State Department as early as 2022, before the war in Gaza. The list, the spokesperson added, includes the \"suggested terms that are in line with U.S. diplomatic protocol.\"\n\nDeference to Israel is not new. For decades, the U.S. has repeatedly looked the other way when Israel is accused of human rights abuses.\n\nOne of the most conspicuous paper tigers in American foreign policy is the Leahy Law, experts say. Passed more than 25 years ago, the law's authors intended to force foreign governments to hold their own accountable for violations like torture or extrajudicial killings - or their military assistance would be restricted. The law allowed precision targeting of individual units that faced credible allegations, so that the U.S. didn't need to cut off entire countries from U.S.-funded weapons and training. It's essentially a blacklist.\n\nRead More\n\nAlmost immediately, Israel got special treatment, records show. In March 1998, IDF soldiers fired on journalists covering demonstrations in the West Bank city of Hebron. Congress asked the State Department, then led by Madeleine Albright, to take action under the new law. \"An Israeli official informed the U.S. Embassy that the soldiers were disciplined after the incident, but was unable to provide further information,\" State Department officials responded in a letter - more than two years later - to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the law's namesake. \"It is the Department's conclusion that there are insufficient grounds on which to conclude that the units involved committed gross violations of human rights.\"\n\nWhile the country took action across the globe in South America, the Pacific Rim and elsewhere, the U.S. government has never disqualified an Israeli military unit under the law - despite voluminous evidence presented to the State Department.\n\nIn 2020, the agency even set up a special council, called the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, to assess accusations against the country's military and police units. The forum is composed of State Department officials with expertise in human rights, arms transfers and the Middle East who review public allegations of human rights abuses before making referrals to the Secretary of State. While it had ambitious goals to finally hold Israeli units accountable, the forum became widely known as just another layer of bureaucracy that slowed down the process and protected Israel.\n\nCurrent and former diplomats told me that U.S. leaders are fundamentally unwilling to follow through on the law and cut off units from American-funded weapons. Instead, they have created multiple processes that give the appearance of accountability while simultaneously undermining any potential results, the experts said.\n\n\"It's like walking toward the horizon,\" said Charles Blaha, a former director at the State Department who served on the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum. \"You can always walk toward it but you will never ever get there.\"\n\n\"I really believed in the Israeli military justice system and I really believed that the State Department was acting in good faith,\" he added. \"But both of those things were wrong.\"\n\nA review of the vetting forum's emails and meeting minutes from 2021 through 2022 shows even the most high-profile and seemingly egregious cases fall into a bureaucratic black hole.\n\nAfter the IDF was accused of killing Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in May 2022, videos circulated on the internet of Israeli police units beating pallbearers at her funeral. \"It is indeed very difficult to watch,\" a deputy assistant secretary wrote in an email to a member of the forum. Another member told colleagues, \"I think this would be what is actionable for the funeral procession itself as we wait for more info on circumstances of death and whether this would trigger Leahy ineligibility.\"\n\nNeither Akleh's killing, nor the funeral beatings, led to Leahy determinations against Israel.\n\nFor years, lawmakers pushed the U.S. government to take action on Akleh's case. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide who helped draft the Leahy Law, recently held a meeting with State Department officials to discuss the case again. The officials in the meeting again punted. \"We're talking about an American journalist who was killed by an Israeli soldier and nothing happened,\" he said. \"They are walking out the door on Jan. 20th and they haven't implemented the law.\"\n\nIn another case considered by the forum, a 15-year-old boy from the West Bank said he was tortured and raped in the Israeli detention facility Al-Mascobiyya, or Russian Compound. For years, the State Department had been told about widespread abuses in that facility and others like it.\n\nMilitary Court Watch, a local nonprofit organization of attorneys, collected testimony from more than 1,100 minors who had been detained between 2013 and 2023. Most said they were strip searched and many said they were beaten. Some teens tried to kill themselves in solitary confinement. IDF soldiers recalled children so scared that they peed themselves during arrests.\n\nAt the Russian Compound, a 14-year-old said his interrogator shocked and beat him in the legs with sticks to elicit information about a car fire. A 15-year-old said he was handcuffed with another boy. \"An Israeli policeman then walked into the room and beat the hell out of me and the other boy,\" he said. A 12-year-old girl said she was put into a small cell with cockroaches.\n\nMilitary Court Watch routinely shared its information with the State Department, according to Gerard Horton, one of the group's co-founders. But nothing ever came of it. \"They receive all our reports and we name the facilities,\" he told me. \"It goes up the food chain and it gets political. Everyone knows what's going on and obviously no action is taken.\"\n\nEven the State Department's own public human rights reports acknowledge widespread allegations of abuse in Israeli prisons. Citing nonprofits, prisoner testimony and media reports, the agency wrote last year that \"detainees held by Israel were subjected to physical and sexual violence, threats, intimidation, severely restricted access to food and water.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2021, the State Department reached out to the Israeli government and asked about the 15-year-old who said he was raped at the Russian Compound. The next day, the Israeli government raided the nonprofit that had originally documented the allegation, Defense for Children International - Palestine, and then designated the group a terrorist organization.\n\nAs a result, U.S. human rights officials said they were prohibited from speaking to DCIP. \"A large part of the frustration was that we were unable to access Palestinian civil society because most NGOs\" - nongovernmental organizations - \"were considered terrorist organizations,\" said Mike Casey, a former U.S. diplomat in Jerusalem who resigned last year. \"All these groups were essentially the premier human rights organizations, and we were not able to meet with them.\"\n\nMiller, the State Department spokesperson, said in his statement that the agency has not \"blanketly prohibited\" officials from speaking with groups that document allegations of human rights abuses and they continue to work with organizations in Israel and the West Bank.\n\nAfter the raid on DCIP, a member of the forum emailed his superior at the State Department and said the U.S. should push to get an explanation for the raid from the Israelis and \"re-raise our original request for info on the underlying allegation.\"\n\nBut almost two years went by and there were no arrests, while those on the forum struggled to get basic information about the case. Then, in the early months of the Israel war on Hamas, another State Department official reached out to DCIP and tried to reengage, according to a recording of the conversation.\n\n\"As you can imagine, it's been a bit touchy here,\" the official said on the call, explaining the months without correspondence. \"The Israeli government's not going to dictate to me who I can talk to, but my superiors can.\"\n\nThe IDF eventually told the State Department it did not find evidence of a sexual assault but reprimanded the guard for kicking a chair during the teenager's interrogation. To date, the U.S. has not cut off the Russian Compound on Leahy grounds.\n\nIn late April, there was surprising news: Blinken was reportedly set to take action against Netzah Yehuda, a notorious ultraorthodox IDF battalion, under the Leahy law.\n\nThe Leahy forum had recommended several cases to him. But for months, he sat on the recommendations . One of them was the case of Omar Assad.\n\nOn a cold night in January 2022, Netzah Yehuda soldiers pulled over Assad, an elderly Palestinian American who was on his way home from playing cards in the West Bank. They bound, blindfolded and gagged him and led him into a construction site, according to local investigators. He was found dead shortly after.\n\nAfter the killing, DAWN, an advocacy group founded by the slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, compiled a dossier of evidence on the case, including testimony from family and witnesses, as well as a medical examiner's report. The report found Assad had traumatic injuries to the head and other injuries that caused a stress-induced heart attack. The group delivered the dossier to the State Department's Leahy forum.\n\nThe dossier also included information about other incidents. For years, Netzah Yehuda has been accused of violent crimes in the West Bank, including killing unarmed Palestinians. They have also been convicted of torturing and abusing detainees in custody.\n\nBy late 2023, after the Oct. 7 attacks, the experts on the forum decided that Assad's case met all the conditions of the Leahy law: a human rights violation had occurred and the soldiers responsible had not been adequately punished. The forum recommended that the battalion should no longer receive any American-funded weapons or training until the perpetrators are brought to justice.\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica published an article in the spring of 2024 about Blinken sitting on the recommendations . But when he signaled his intention to take action shortly after, the Israelis responded with fury . \"Sanctions must not be imposed on the Israel Defense Forces!\" Netanyahu posted on X. \"The intention to impose a sanction on a unit in the IDF is the height of absurdity and a moral low.\"\n\nThe pressure campaign, which also reportedly came from Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La. and Lew, the ambassador, appears to have worked. For months, Blinken punted on an official decision. Then, in August, the State Department announced that Netzah Yehuda would not be cut off from military aid after all because the U.S. had received new information that the IDF had effectively \"remediated\" the case. Two soldiers involved were removed from active duty and made ineligible to serve in the reserve, but there is no indication that anyone was charged with a crime.\n\nMiller, the spokesperson, said the IDF also took steps to avoid similar incidents in the future, like enhanced screening and a two-week educational seminar for Netzah Yehuda recruits.\n\n\"In seven and a half years as director of the State Department office that implements the Leahy law worldwide,\" Blaha wrote shortly after the announcement, \"I have never seen a single case in which mere administrative measures constituted sufficient remediation.\"\n\nIn its statement to ProPublica, the Israeli government did not address individual cases, but said, \"All of the incidents in question were thoroughly examined by the American administration, which concluded that Israel took remedial measures when necessary.\"\n\nLast summer, CNN documented how commanders in the battalion have been promoted to senior positions in the IDF, where they train ground troops and run operations in Gaza. A weapons expert told me the guns that Netzah Yehuda soldiers have been photographed holding were likely made in the U.S.\n\nLater in the year, Younis Tirawi, a Palestinian journalist who runs a popular account on X, posted videos showing IDF soldiers who recorded themselves rummaging through children's clothing inside a home and demolishing a mosque's minaret. Tirawi said the soldiers were in Netzah Yehuda. (ProPublica could not independently verify the soldiers' units.)\n\nHebrew text added to one of the videos said, \"We won't leave a trace of them.\"\n\nOn Nov. 14, more than a year after the war started, Human Rights Watch released a report and said that Israel's forced displacement of Palestinians is widespread, systematic and intentional. It accused the Israelis of a crime against humanity, writing, \"Israel's actions appear to also meet the definition of ethnic cleansing.\" (A former Israeli defense minister has also made that allegation .)\n\nDuring a news briefing later that day, reporters pressed a State Department spokesperson, Vedant Patel, on the report's findings.\n\nPatel said the U.S. government disagrees and has not seen evidence of forced displacement in Gaza.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"certainly would be a red line.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico demanded an apology from President Joe Biden after a ProPublica story disclosed that the Drug Enforcement Administration had found evidence that one of López Obrador's closest aides accepted donations of around $2 million from a drug cartel in 2006.\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday, López Obrador denounced the accusations as \"slander\" and threatened to curtail U.S.-Mexican cooperation on drug trafficking and immigration issues.\n\nHe also accused ProPublica reporter Tim Golden, the author of the article , of being a \"pawn\" and \" a mercenary in the service \" of the DEA.\n\nLópez Obrador said the ProPublica story was part of a media campaign against him by the DEA and the State Department to damage his political party ahead of the presidential election on June 2.\n\n\"President Biden should find out about this, because how are we going to be sitting at the table talking about the fight against drugs if they or one of their institutions is leaking information and harming me,\" López Obrador said.\n\n\"If they have no evidence, they have to apologize,\" he said.\n\nLópez Obrador's demand comes at an especially sensitive time for the Biden administration, as it seeks to clamp down on the millions of immigrants who have crossed the southern U.S. border in search of asylum. A recent poll showed that immigration has surpassed inflation as the top issue in the presidential race.\n\nThe White House, the DEA and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nProPublica published its findings on Tuesday, about the same time that two other news outlets, InSight Crime and Germany's Deutsche Welle , reported on the DEA investigation.\n\nProPublica said the article was independently produced and reported, noting that it had repeatedly sought comment from the López Obrador administration before publication.\n\n\"We shared a detailed summary of our findings with President López Obrador's spokesperson more than a week before we published, and he chose not to comment,\" said Stephen Engelberg, ProPublica's editor in chief. \"The president has had a lot to say since then, but none of his remarks has identified a single inaccuracy or factual error.\"\n\nProPublica's article reported that several informants told DEA agents that operatives in López Obrador's 2006 campaign for president accepted money from the Beltrán Leyva drug mafia. In return, the traffickers were told that a future government would give them a say in naming an attorney general, the informants said. López Obrador did not win that election, but he was voted into office in 2018. As president, he has backed away from confrontation with organized crime groups and scaled back counternarcotics cooperation with the United States.\n\nRead More\n\nThe DEA investigation - which included testimony from a former campaign operative and a key drug informant - did not establish that López Obrador knew of or approved the donation. However, it found substantial evidence that one of his closest aides had agreed to the arrangement. The investigation was shut down, and no charges were ever filed. Among the reasons, officials in the Department of Justice were concerned that the investigation would be perceived as the United States interfering in Mexico's politics, ProPublica found.\n\nLópez Obrador is barred from running for reelection. His party's candidate is currently leading the race, according to opinion polls. The leading opposition candidate has seized on the accusations.\n\nGolden has written extensively about corruption in Mexico's government, including a 2022 article about the DEA arrest of former Defense Minister Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda. The charges against him were dismissed after Attorney General William Barr decided the case was too politically charged to pursue, ProPublica found.\n\nThe DEA has a long history of investigating politicians in other countries for drug trafficking. The Associated Press reported this week that the agency spent years running covert operations in Venezuela to build drug cases against some of its leaders.\n\nI'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter dedicated to accountability, transparency and data-driven journalism.\n\nI am interested in hearing from insiders and whistleblowers - people who know how their organizations work and what is going wrong. I welcome documents and data that deliver concrete evidence.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "What's Next for U.S. Immigration Policy on the Southern Border?\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to curb immigration, effectively blocking most asylum claims when border crossings spike to a certain level. The move comes amid mounting concerns from across the political spectrum over immigration, which has emerged as a major voter issue this election year.\n\nSome Democrats and human rights advocates have warned the Biden administration that the executive order could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis at the border, putting immigrants at greater risk as they wait on the Mexican side of the border. A recent analysis by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found lawmakers, advocates and government officials previously issued similar warnings that went unheeded before a fire in a Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, detention center killed 40 men in March 2023.\n\nTwo weeks before the fire, which was one of the deadliest incidents involving immigrants in Mexico's history, the Congressional Research Service published a report saying that the Mexican government did not have adequate resources to handle the influx of U.S.-bound migrants. \"As a result, migrants remain vulnerable to crime and other abuses,\" the report concluded.\n\nThe ProPublica and Tribune examination, which was accompanied by an 18-minute documentary titled \" The Right Way ,\" unpacks the deadly consequences of policies such as Title 42, an emergency health code used by former President Donald Trump to slow immigration and continued under Biden. Even though the pandemic-era policy, which enabled the quick expulsion of 2.8 million immigrants, ended in May 2023, migrants continued to be stranded in Mexican cities because of other U.S. policies.\n\nThe week before Biden's executive order, ProPublica and the Tribune hosted a virtual panel with experts to discuss U.S. policies that contributed to the fire, changes to the U.S. asylum system and why immigration has become a leading concern among voters as they prepare for this year's presidential election. Speakers included:\n\nBelow are excerpts from the panel's discussion, which have been edited for clarity and concision.\n\nAndrew Selee: The American public overwhelmingly thinks it's a crisis. At least four polls that came out recently tell the same story, which is that Americans are quite pro-immigration , but they're also really worried about the border . This cuts across party lines now. Yes, Republicans are more concerned about the border than Democrats, but Democrats have moved on this issue as have independents.\n\nWhen you have a system that can't make decisions about who should come into the country, that undermines the credibility of your immigration system. It makes people more worried about immigration in general and less willing to support things like legal pathways that would actually help.\n\nWe don't have a crisis in terms of our well-being as a society, but we do have a crisis in terms of being able to make decisions about who comes in and keep some sort of control over immigration policy. I'm worried if we don't figure this part out, we're going to see a backlash against immigration that will hurt all of us.\n\nMaureen Meyer: As the administration looks to reduce numbers at the border so that it doesn't seem like a crisis, what you end up having is a humanitarian crisis on the Mexican side of the border. As numbers have dropped here, especially since last December, Mexico is encountering over 120,000 migrants a month. So what you have is a crisis that you're exporting farther south.\n\nVictor Manjarrez: Normally, I would say that that's pretty significant, but that 50% drop is compared to December, when we had historically large numbers in terms of arrests along the southwest border.\n\nEven with that drop, it's estimated that there is going to be between 1.6 to 1.7 million arrests. The high-water mark was 1.6 million in 2000 for the longest time. When the numbers went up in 2022 and 2023 to 2.2 million, it was crushing because it does a number of things. You have to collapse your operations, and you have to vacate areas to handle the flows that come in.\n\nThe dynamic used to be that most people try to evade early detection. Now, people surrender to claim asylum. That doesn't take away from the fact that it takes a large number of resources, from transportation to the logistics of processing.\n\nWatch the Panel Discussion\n\nSelee: I think you want three elements. You want people to be able to come on legal pathways to take available jobs. Right now, we have 8 to 10 million jobs a month that are open, and it's a very tight labor market. You want a way of connecting employers with willing workers. We don't have that right now. We have a system built in 1990 that has numbers set in stone by Congress 34 years ago in a different economy. That's one element you have to update.\n\nSecondly, you need a refugee system where people who are fleeing things that would put their lives in danger can get into the United States through asylum, either by applying at the border or ideally earlier. Ideally, we want a humanitarian protection system that starts in the region, particularly since we know most people are coming from somewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean, but then has a fail-safe at the border.\n\nYou have to be able to return people who don't meet those two characteristics: who aren't coming on a legal pathway and aren't granted asylum. You have to make decisions on protection fairly quickly, by the way. If it takes four or five years, which is what it takes right now to get a decision, you're not giving protection to people who need it. But you're also creating a pull factor for people who might not have otherwise applied for protection. We don't tend to remove a lot of people who've been in the country that long. People know that if they make it to the U.S. border, they are likely to get in.\n\nThat's a system that doesn't make sense for people who need protection, but it also doesn't make sense from a migration protection standpoint. We then turn to Mexico and other countries along the way and say, let's make it harder for people to get here. We would be much better off with a system that gave protection that had legal pathways but also returned people who don't come through those ways. But we've ended up with a system that simply tries to slow people down.\n\nSelee: They've really stretched the limits of what they can do with the executive branch to create legal pathways. They've tried to increase employer interest. They created quite a large pathway for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans, groups of people where there are displacement crises. It made sense to stretch what they call humanitarian parole powers to allow people to enter the country and have a work permit for two years. They've tried to speed up asylum and create incentives for people to go to ports of entry to apply for asylum rather than going between ports of entry. But without resources, without authorities, without Congress, it's hard to create legal pathways. Unless Congress gets involved, appropriates money and provides some authorities, particularly on the legal pathway side, it becomes very hard to get done.\n\nWe saw an attempt by Republicans and Democrats, but that fell apart so we're back to where we were\n\nSelee: It would have codified some of the things they did to restrict asylum. For decisions on asylum, it would've put more money into the Border Patrol and into ICE, for processing people and for returns. It's a Band-Aid, but sometimes Band-Aids are important too. It would have at least created a more virtuous cycle for people who have strong asylum claims to present themselves at the border and a disincentive for people who know they don't have strong claims.\n\nOn the flip side, Mexico came out for the first time ever with a national strategy on migration. How does Mexico relate to its own diaspora, i.e., the 12 million Mexicans that live in the U.S.? How does Mexico deal with asylum-seekers? Like with the U.S., it's a question of resources and authorities and how you actually do it.\n\nMeyer: In terms of the Biden administration, we will continue to see a harder-line policy. President Biden and Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke a few weeks ago and talked about how they're going to increase enforcement to reduce the number of migrants reaching the borders.\n\nIf it is a Biden second term, we will hopefully see a shift back to expanding legal pathways, improving the system, adding more resources and a continuation of these programs, especially the regional programs.\n\nWith Trump's first term, we saw canceling refugee resettlement numbers or dramatically lowering them, canceling programs that Biden restarted like the Central America's Minors Program, building more wall and, as you said, increased mass deportation. It's a very contrasting view of the situation at the border that will have stark differences come January 2025.\n\nRead More\n\nFiled under -\n\nConnor Goodwin was a Communications Manager with ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "AOC, Sanders erase Biden as progressive movement moves on\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDENVER, Colo. â Now we know what they really thought.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, at the biggest rally of his political career, Sen. Bernie Sanders encouraged some 32,000 people here to organize against âoligarchy,â dismantle the private campaign finance system, and maybe run for office themselves.\n\nHe never ran as a Democrat â and they wouldnât need to, either. The party hadnât earned it.\n\nâFor the last 30 or 40 years, Democrats have turned their backs on the working class of this country,â said Sanders.\n\nThe Vermont independent shared the stage with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who called for âa Democratic Party that fights harder for us.â They were introduced by Jimmy Williams, the president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, who denounced Democrats for not raising the minimum wage or expanding Social Security when they held the House, Senate, and White House.\n\nâFor the Democratic Party to ever win back the majority, they have to represent the working class and not the corporate class,â said Williams.\n\nThe blunt talk barely made ripples in Washington, where Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are often covered as problems for their party. But as they reboot their movement, progressives who traded loyalty to Joe Biden for big policy victories âÂ from the Green New Deal to clemency for Leonard Peltier â are breaking ranks with the Democratic Party and its feeble brand. Sanders is stepping up efforts to recruit Democratic and independent candidates, and Ocasio-Cortez is taking a larger role in responding to the Trump administration.\n\nAnd unencumbered from their 2024 task â to make a progressive case for Biden, and then, for Kamala Harris â they are no longer selling his presidency as a success.\n\nIn this article:\n\nWhen he secured the 2020 Democratic nomination, Biden made a deal with Sanders and other progressives, giving them a role in drafting the party platform and incorporating their ideas into his campaign and administration. To progressivesâ surprise, he often responded to their direct actions; climate activists protested with Ocasio-Cortez for a New Deal-style âclimate conservation corps,â and he created one by executive order.\n\nâWhen it comes to domestic policy, President Biden probably would go down as one of the most effective presidents that centered the working class,â Ocasio-Cortez told the New York Times in January.\n\nBut Bidenâs support for Israelâs war in Gaza smothered progressivesâ good will. In Denver, Sanders mentioned the former president just once by name, when he denounced Trump for maintaining âthe horrific Biden policy of giving more money to Netanyahu to destroy the Palestinian people.â\n\nNow Biden, whoâs made just two public appearances since leaving Washington, is a non-factor in his party. His achievements, including trillions of dollars of infrastructure, health care and climate spending, are being pulled down by his successor. Democrats rarely talk about Bidenâs role in those programs as they fight (and sue ) to save them.\n\nThe erasure started before Biden left office, with Sanders crediting Trumpâs victory to âDemocratic leadershipâ that defended the âstatus quoâ and lost working class votes.Sanders and other progressives had taken another tone during the campaign, defending Biden and his record. (So had Williams: IAPUT endorsed Biden, then Harris, in the 2024 election, and he praised âUnion Joeâ as the best president for labor in generations.)\n\nâWe came out of that economic downturn a lot faster than anyone dream we would have, and you can thank President Biden for that,â Sanders told a crowd in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on June 28 â the day after the disastrous CNN debate with Trump that unraveled Bidenâs campaign and damaged Democratsâ argument that voters could overlook his age. âBidenâs policies, by and large, are for the working class of this country, and weâve got to appreciate that.â\n\nIn conversations on Monday, progressive strategists said that there was no upside to mentioning Biden at all, even when defending programs he funded or created. In Denver, Ocasio-Cortez spoke more positively of the Democrats than Sanders did, praising the stateâs senators and Democratic members of Congress by name for opposing the GOPâs spending packages.\n\nâI want you to look at every level of office around you, and support Democrats who actually fight, because those are the ones that can win against Republicans,â she said.\n\nWhy does it matter if Democrats and progressives wrap up Bidenâs presidency into a story of Democratic failure? It explains the Sanders/Ocasio-Cortez project, which in part is about disentangling their politics from a toxic brand and turning it into an anti-establishment cause.\n\nâTrump basically said the system is broken, and Iâm going to fix it,â Sanders told me before his âFight Oligarchyâ tour began last month. âDemocrats more or less said: You know, the status quo is not perfect, but weâre gonna tinker with it around the edges.â\n\nThe senatorâs new electoral project is recruiting progressives to run against Republicans and beat them, whether they want to run as Democrats or independents.\n\nâThere are a whole lot of people, who voted Republican, who are not crazy about the Republican Party,â Sanders told me in Greeley. âWorking-class Republicans donât want tax breaks for billionaires and cuts to veterans programs.â In the story heâs telling, those voters did not have an ally in the White House who did the right thing for four years; neither party has answered those votersâ concerns.\n\nBut Republicans have not forgotten about Biden. During his address to Congress last month, Trump mentioned Biden, âthe worst president in American history,â 14 times. In remarks to reporters, the president frequently blames Bidens for problems he didnât leave him, like a stock market correction. The story Trump and the GOP are telling is that their party is delivering for the working class, rescuing it from the costs and failures inflicted by their last president and the Democratic Party.\n\nDefeated parties have been here before. George W. Bush vanished from Republican politics after leaving the presidency in 2009; apart from a few âMiss Me Yet?â memes and Dick Cheneyâs criticism of the Obama presidencyâs anti-terrorism strategy, that team played no role in the Tea Party-era GOP rebrand. Republicans built space to attack their former presidentâs legacy, with conservative candidates taking down incumbents who had supported Bushâs Wall Street bailout. The party won the presidency again with Trump, who has mocked Bush as a failure.\n\nParties have also swung hard in the other direction. In 2021, when Trump was beaten but able to run again, his party retconned his presidency into a success. They were boom years, with no new foreign wars, undermined only by a deranged anti-Trump deep state and the COVID-19 pandemic. The few Republicans who criticized Trump over his handling of that pandemic, like Floridaâs Ron DeSantis, lost to him and endorsed him.\n\nThis was never going to happen for Biden, who left office when voters held a far darker view of the economy than they did in 2020 . But itâs significant that the progressives are skipping right past it. Democratsâ argument about how they can win back working class voters might start with Biden, who implemented some big progressive ideas and watched more of those voters walk away.\n\nAs Biden left office, The Nationâs Katrina vanden Heuvel called him a âremarkably consequential one-term presidentâ who âorchestrated the best recovery in the industrial worldâ and âconsolidated the break with the failed market fundamentalism of the conservative era that Trump began.â Itâs the sort of analysis many progressives had of Biden â Gaza record aside â until the results came in from Pennsylvania on Election Night.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Bidenâs Hunter pardon splits the anti-Trump âResistanceâ\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn Sunday night, John Dean got the news from a friend: President Biden would pardon his wayward son, Hunter, sparing him from prison and any further prosecutions.\n\nRepublicans were condemning the decision. Democrats were wringing their hands about the optics, and how Donald Trump might react. Dean had another reaction.\n\nâI was not surprised â and delighted that he had done it,â Dean told Semafor. Biden believed that âraw politicsâ had infected the prosecution, enough to recant his promise that he would not use presidential clemency power to help his son.\n\nDean agreed. âI donât think he lied to the public about what he was going to do,â he said. âI think he changed his mind about what he was going to do.â\n\nIn the 51 years since he was fired as Richard Nixonâs White House counsel, and cooperated with the Watergate probe, Dean had become a prominent critic of Republican presidents. Heâd condemned Supreme Court decisions that expanded the executiveâs powers while shrinking his liabilities. And the Biden-Harris coalition that lost last month included not just Democrats, but scores of frustrated ex-Republicans who believed that Trump threatened the entire American system.\n\nThey drifted apart on Sunday night. The pardon divided both Democrats and anti-Trump non-Democrats â some thrilled that Biden had abandoned his partyâs commitment to ânormsâ in the face of a returning president that flouts them, some outraged that he had abandoned the moral high ground that theyâll need for the fights to come.\n\nâFraming it as a selective unfair prosecution against Hunter just totally undercuts any narrative about the rule of law,â said Robert Schwartz, who led super PACs in 2024 that encouraged anti-Trump voters to support Nikki Haley in the GOP primary, than Kamala Harris in the general election. âThey do know these are the same arguments Trump used about his legal cases, right?â\n\nIn this article:\n\nBidenâs decision rattled his own party, drawing condemnation from some allies in safely blue states.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who briefly ran for the Democratsâ 2020 presidential nomination, wrote on Monday that Biden âput personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americansâ faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all.â Vermont Sen. Peter Welch called it âunderstandableâ but âunwise.â Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the two-time chair of the Senate Democratsâ campaign committee, accused Biden of an âimproperâ use of power: âIt erodes trust in our government, and it emboldens others to bend justice to suit their interests.â\n\nThat wasnât the universal take. Some Democrats, like outgoing DNC chairman Jaime Harrison, praised Bidenâs decision without conditions. Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett was on MSNBC within an hour of the announcement, defending Biden on the grounds that Republicans didnât really care about the facts of Hunter Bidenâs case.\n\nâAt the end of the day, we know that we have a 34-count convicted felon that is about to walk into the White House,â Crockett said on MSNBC. âFor anyone that wants to clutch their pearls now, because he decided he was going to pardon his son, I would say: Take a look in the mirror.â\n\nFew Democrats went on the record to agree with Crockett, and none defended Bidenâs decision to issue the pardon after repeatedly saying that he wouldnât. But she wasnât alone. Multiple Democrats told Semafor that Trumpâs victory had already smashed the norms he was protecting when he said he would respect the legal system and let his son go to prison. One Democratic member of Congress put it this way: At what point are you just a sucker?\n\nBidenâs pardon was devastating to some of the ex-Republicans who had supported him to beat Trump. The Bulwark, the most prominent of the conservative exile publications, published a range of opinions on Monday, from a defense of the pardon â âBiden made the correct choice to protect his son against the powerful unfettered vindictiveness that is to come in a few short weeks,â wrote Kim Wehle â to columns and podcasts condemning it.\n\nFormer Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton, who became a critic after leaving his administration, had refused to vote for either Trump or Harris last month. Bidenâs mistake, he told Sky News, was âfortifyingâ the idea that there were multiple tiers of the justice system; on X, he added that âwhen Trump pardons the January 6th defendants, heâs going to say I did it because Joe Biden pardoned Hunter.â\n\nBut Trump had said during the election that he was likely to pardon Jan. 6 defendants â and briefly mused about pardoning Hunter Biden. Dean said that a second Trump administration, staffed by people like FBI director-designate Kash Patel, was already planning to wage political prosecutions. It would make sense, in that context, for Biden to go beyond Sundayâs action and issue blanket pardons for the people on Trump enemy lists.\n\nâLet Biden give a safe harbor for some of his people whoâve done nothing but follow the process,â Dean said. âHe could do it with specific people like Jack Smith and company. He could do it with [Robert] Mueller and company. He could do it with blanket pardons, where you would have a class of people who are just engaging in political behavior, and if Trump went after them, they could say: Hey, this isnât subject to criminal investigation.â\n\nDemocrats are in disarray, as usual, but the stakes for most of them are pretty low. As Semaforâs Burgess Everrett put it , âfree shots at unpopular outgoing president of your own party donât come around too often.â Democrats who want their anger at Trumpâs next moves to sound credible are starting by denouncing the Biden pardon.\n\nBut not every Trump critic needs to run for office. The pardon broke the seal on a discussion liberals have been having for a month: What was the point of being the party of norms?\n\nBiden and Attorney Gen. Merrick Garland had allowed a Trump-ordered probe of the Trump-Russia inquiry to continue; had appointed a special counsel to investigate Bidenâs handling of classified documents after leaving the vice presidency; had kept on David Weiss, a Trump appointee, and made him a special counsel, to avoid any appearance that the Democrats were trying to impede the Hunter Biden investigations.\n\nNone of this was very compelling to voters who heard Trump accuse the Biden DOJ of trying to destroy him. According to exit polling last month, a majority of voters who believed that American democracy was âvery threatenedâ voted for Trump.\n\nThat was enormously depressing for Democrats and anti-Trump conservatives. Some of them hoped that Biden would leave office on the high ground, making an Abrahamic sacrifice of his son, making any Trump revenge moves or mass pardons look cheap by comparison. Well, he didnât.\n\nâThe American voting public has told usâover and overâthat they DO NOT CARE about our precious norms,â wrote Bulwark editor Jonathan V. Last. âThis does not mean that we should not care about norms. We can care for them as a matter of taste, or morality. Or because we believe they are good, right, and true. But practically speaking there is no political incentive structure to enforce them. They will continue to erode irrespective of what you, I, or John Dillinger do.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Top Republicans call on Biden to resign from office as well\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, President Joe Biden announced, after weeks of pressure from his party, that he would be dropping out of the presidential race. For Republicans, thatâs not enough: They want him to resign from the presidency, too.\n\nâIf Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,â House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted . âHe must resign the office immediately.â\n\nTrump campaign managerâs Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles echoed the call in a statement calling Biden âa national security threat in great cognitive decline.â\n\nâJoe Biden cannot take himself out of a campaign for President because he is too mentally incompetent and still remain in the White House,â the two wrote.\n\nItâs quickly become a widespread call among Republicans, with the argument being that if Biden is incapable of running for re-election, heâs also not fit to continue serving as president.\n\nSteve Daines, chairman of the NRSC, argued that if Biden âis no longer capable of running for re-election, he is no longer capable of serving as President.â Sen. Rick Scott , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , Elise Stefanik , Tommy Tuberville , Jim Banks , and others echoed the messaging.\n\nThere were some exceptions. Rep. Mike Lawler, running in a swing seat in New York, stopped short of a call to resign. And Sen. Mitt Romney, a longtime Trump critic, praised Bidenâs decision while thanking him for his work on bipartisan initiatives together.\n\nâOthers will judge his presidency,â Romney said. âHowever, having worked with him these past few years, I respect President Biden. His decision to withdraw from the race was right and is in the best interest of the country.â\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said on Sunday that he had â all the confidence in the world â in Bidenâs ability to remain president during a CBS News interview in which he also called on Biden to drop out of the race. He argued Biden would be able to devote his full focus to the job, rather than have his attention divided by campaigning.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThis argument has been quietly brewing within the Republican Party for weeks â at last weekâs RNC Convention, I heard countless discussions about the Biden debacle, and whether he was fit to keep serving. The consensus was always the same: If he dropped out, it was an indication that he wasnât capable of continuing for even six more months and Democrats should be forced to make the case otherwise.\n\nTo be clear, team Trump started off this drama with the belief that Biden wouldnât step down. And, in many ways, they didnât want him to, seeing a politically wounded, elderly candidate whose own party had lost faith in him as an easy opponent to defeat.\n\nBut, as the reality that Biden might actually step down soaked in, the Trump campaign decided to take it in stride. They trolled Democrats with quotes about an attempted âcoupâ by party leaders âÂ a not-so-subtle riff on the criticisms Trump received for trying to overturn the 2020 election âÂ while boasting that Kamala Harris would be even easier to defeat.\n\nAfter Biden made his announcement, the Trump campaign worked quickly to tie Harris to Biden. It was a continuation of the messaging theyâd been floating over the past week â at the RNC Convention, for example, LaCivita pointed out how theyâd attack her as âthe border tsarâ who was tasked with presiding over immigration.\n\nâKamala Harris is just as much of a joke as Biden is. Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,â he wrote, alongside Wiles, on Sunday.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Democratic senator criticizes Biden campaignâs âdismissive attitudeâ after debate\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nA Democratic senator chastised President Bidenâs re-election campaign for their aggressive attempt to quell intensified age concerns in the wake of a disastrous debate performance which sent tremors through the Democratic Party.\n\nâI really do criticize the campaign for a dismissive attitude towards people who are raising questions for discussion. Thatâs just facing the reality that weâre in. Thatâs hardly â I wonât repeat their term,â Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Semafor in a Monday phone interview, alluding to their use of âbedwettingâ in a weekend campaign email. âBut thatâs the discussion we have to have. It has to be from the top levels of the Biden campaign to precinct captains in the southside of Chicago.â\n\nâThe campaign has raised the concerns themselves,â Welch said. âSo then to be dismissive of others who raise those concerns, I think itâs inappropriate.â\n\nThe Biden campaign has argued the debate didnât alter the electionâs trajectory, citing its strongest grassroots fundraising hauls in the two days after the debate. The team on Tuesday announced it raised $264 million in the second quarter, nearly half of it in June in its strongest month yet.\n\nWelch added the party has an âexistential responsibilityâ to voters to keep former President Donald Trump from winning a second term. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that a president can be immune from prosecution for official acts taken in office. Welch said that ruling underscored the necessity for a candid dialogue about having Biden lead the Democratic ticket.\n\nWelch said heâs also heard plenty of concern from Democratic donors in the days since the debate, which he called a âserious setback.â He added Democrats maintain an enormous respect for Biden and his legislative achievements, but the party has a bigger responsibility to ensure victory in November.\n\nâPassivity is not the response that is going to work for us. We all have to be self conscious,â Welch said. âWe all have to be acutely aware that our obligation is to the country, even more than the party. Thatâs the obligation we have â whatâs best for the country.â\n\nAsked if Biden can remain on the ticket and win in November, Welch said it was the âchallengeâ of the campaign to overcome âdamageâ from the debate and show an energetic Biden in unscripted settings.\n\nIn recent days, President Biden has acknowledged his poor debate performance while campaign officials seek to assuage deep unease among elected Democrats, party activists and donors. The Biden campaign circulated an internal poll on Monday indicating the competitive race remained unchanged compared with an earlier poll conducted in May.\n\nStill, Democratic senators said they were alarmed with Bidenâs poor debate performance. âI think like a lot of people, I was pretty horrified,â Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, told WPRI 12 News . âI think people want to make sure that this is a campaign thatâs ready to go and win, that the president and his team are being candid with us about his condition â that this was a real anomaly.â\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a White House ally and campaign surrogate, told CNN that heâs urging Biden to hold more press conferences so he can demonstrate his fitness for office.\n\nBiden on Monday evening addressed the Supreme Courtâs immunity ruling from the White House, warning it would place âvirtually no limits on what the president can do.â But his remarks lasted less than five minutes and he took no questions.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Bidenâs next big test is the NATO summit\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nSome Democrats and allies of the White House believe that President Biden can use next weekâs NATO summit in Washington to turn the page on his dismal debate performance that has spiked anxiety across the party.\n\nâMy hope is that over the next seven to ten days the president is out there aggressively meeting with people in different parts of the country making his case, doing things that show his international stature, like the NATO event,â said Jim Kessler, vice president for policy at the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way. âCertainly, something on the international stage is a place where he can help himself.â\n\nBiden will gather leaders from across Europe at the celebration of 75 years of the alliance, a gathering full of photo ops, remarks, and celebrations âÂ though also typically unscripted Q&As with leaders that Biden has recently avoided.\n\nA person familiar with the administrationâs thinking said that the summit would present a good opportunity for Biden to showcase his leadership and diplomatic achievements on the world stage. The person noted that because the summit will be in Washington â rather than a European city, like last yearâs Vilnius summit â his engagements will get more press attention.\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to comment.\n\nIn this article:\n\nWhile an official event, the NATO summit in a normal moment carries political upsides for a president searching for a win. Biden can cheer the expansion of the alliance during his tenure while seeking a contrast with Donald Trump, who suggested the US not defend allies who do not meet NATOâs spending targets.\n\nBut the presidentâs condition will now be closely scrutinized, including by Americaâs military allies. European officials took note of his debate performance last week, and are now more expectant of Trump returning to power.\n\nâPeople are curious as to the future of the Democratic campaign,â one European official told me. âIf Biden continues to underperform like he did on Thursday, I think we are headed to Trumpâs victory.â\n\nSome in Europe are worried about that prospect.\n\nâTheyâre not concerned about Joe Biden,â Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told my colleague Kadia Goba. âTheyâve dealt with Joe Biden. Theyâve worked with Joe Biden. Theyâve seen Joe Biden right across the table as I have. What theyâre concerned about is a Donald Trump, who does not understand what democracy really is all about.â\n\nThe White House has been meticulously planning the celebratory summit to ensure the US and its European allies appear united, especially as Russia presses on with the war in Ukraine.\n\nâThe White House said from very early on in the preparations of this summit, like a year ago already, that they do not want any issues that are divisive,â another European official told my colleague Mathias Hammer. âItâs part of maintaining this positive narrative, the unity,â the official said, noting that the focus on unity has taken priority over more divisive issues like burden sharing.\n\nAsked about the discussion following the presidential debate, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, a longtime Biden adviser, offered a ringing endorsement of Bidenâs foreign policy moves during a Brookings Institution event.\n\nUS allies have âseen a president who has reinvested America, reinvested America in the world, reinvested in these alliances, in these partnerships in ways that they seek and want,â he said at the event in Washington on Monday. Biden has been responsible for âdramaticallyâ boosting confidence in US leadership around the world since taking office, Blinken added.\n\nMathias Hammer and Kadia Goba contributed reporting.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Senate Democrats havenât turned on President Biden â yet\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nSenate Democrats didnât turn on President Biden when they returned to the Capitol on Monday, but they made clear theyâre not done talking about it either.\n\nBrushing off a written demand from Biden to move on from conversations about his status, Democrat after Democrat implied that his nomination was still in question while asking for more time to deliberate on the issue. At minimum, several said Biden had more work to do to restore confidence in his political viability after a disastrous debate against Donald Trump late last month that threw Democrats in a panic.\n\nâItâs a moral question,â Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado told Semafor. âAnd we should satisfy ourselves as Democrats that in an era of Donald Trumpâ¦ that we are putting our best foot forward.â\n\nBennet argued Democrats were on course to win control of Congress and the White House before Biden went on the CNN debate stage. He said he wasnât sure that was the case anymore and Democratic senators needed to âassessâ the fallout. Bennet also expressed confidence in the partyâs ability to find a replacement for Biden, while adding âitâs no oneâs first choice.â\n\nSeveral senators, including Bennet and Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota, said Monday they had heard from voters concerned about Bidenâs age affecting his ability to serve out another four-year term. âPresident Biden has got to prove to the American people â including me â that heâs up to the job for another four years,â Sen. Jon Tester, who faces a tough reelection back in Montana, told a local TV station .\n\nPerhaps the toughest statement came from the Senateâs longest-serving Democrat, Patty Murray of Washington, who seemed to walk close to the line of asking Biden to drop out.\n\nâMore than a week since the debate, and after talking with my constituents, I believe President Biden must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump,â Murray said in a statement. âAt this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.â\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, a member of Senate Democratic leadership who reportedly has been feeling out interest in an effort to push Biden aside, issued a statement urging âconversations about the strongest path forward.â He added Biden should âaggressively make his case to the American peopleâ while widening the voices he listens to, given the presidentâs penchant to prize counsel from a small, insular group of longtime advisors.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranked Senate Democrat, said upon arriving in the Capitol on Monday afternoon the debate âraised a lot of questionsâ that Biden has responded to with mixed results. Asked later by Semafor whether Democrats and Biden were on a collision course, Durbin responded: âI want our party unified behind one person as soon as possible.â\n\nShould that person be Biden? âWeâll see,â Durbin told Semafor.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe Senate Democratic caucus gathers on Tuesdays for lunch, and the discussion could veer in a different direction once Biden skeptics see how much willingness there is to challenge a president who has made clear heâs not going anywhere without a fight.\n\nNot every Senator has been so circumspect about Bidenâs status. Several Democrats offered supportive statements for Biden. âAs Iâve said before, Iâm with Joe,â Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters.\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez-Masto of Nevada â who faced a competitive Senate race in 2022 â urged Democrats to support Biden. âHeâs always had Nevadansâ backs, whether itâs on the picket lines, protecting our personal freedoms, or lowering costs â now itâs time for us to have his,â she said in a statement.\n\nLike the famous scene in âWolf of Wall Streetâ where a beleaguered Jordan Belfort insists heâs not going anywhere, Biden is making clear he isnât stepping aside as the Democratic nominee for president â a post heâs fought for since the late 1980s. Notably, he invited critics to directly challenge him at the Democratic National Convention in August if they want to defenestrate him.\n\nThe Democratic Partyâs reckoning over Bidenâs candidacy, though, runs a real risk of unleashing protracted infighting. Thereâs a palpable unease among Democratic senators, few of whom have issued full-throated endorsements of the partyâs standard bearer.\n\nOne Democrat close to the White House said that Biden may well lose more confidence among Hill Democrats if he insists on dispelling widespread concerns around his age as the function of out-of-touch Democratic elites. âWe can all see whatâs happening,â the Democrat source said. âWe know that his age is having an impact on him.â\n\nWhile the default in the Senate was a cryptic wait-and-see statement on Monday, Biden seemed to make more progress in the House.\n\nLeft-wing âSquadâ members Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Ilhan Omar both publicly backed Biden on Tuesday. âJoe Biden is our nominee,â Ocasio Cortez said. âHe is not leaving this race. He is in this race and I support him.â\n\nThe chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Nevada Rep. Steven Horsford, also announced his support for Biden âÂ a potentially critical bellwether. Biden called into a virtual meeting with the CBC on Monday to thank them for their continued support. The leadership of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus also backed Biden .\n\nThere are still some questions about how deep CBC support runs behind the scenes, especially among younger members, but Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson dismissed the idea of a generational split. âWe respect our elders, and our elders mean a lot to us and Joe Biden is an elder and he has exemplified what it is to be a great public servant,â he told reporters.\n\nNot everyone in the party was as supportive. âYou have to go to voters,â Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., told reporters. âI mean, are Americans convinced that youâre in the kind of shape to both stand for the campaign, but more importantly, can you continue to serve as president? I think thatâs the challenge. I donât think heâs met that challenge yet. He needs to continue to work at it.â\n\nMorelle reportedly expressed similar concerns on a leadership call over the weekend and privately told colleagues Biden should step down .\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden ally, said that Biden remains the most effective Democrat to defeat Trump. âI think it would be a huge mistake for the Democratic Party based on one evening in one debate to turn aside from supporting a very seasoned and capable President,â he told reporters.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "âBlitz primaryâ could open up Democratic race if Biden drops out\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAs the Democratic Party convulses over questions about President Joe Bidenâs mental fitness, a pair of well-connected Democrats is offering an optimistic plan that would involve the president stepping down as the nominee and the party announcing a âblitz primaryâ process ahead of the August convention.\n\nThe proposal is the work of Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown University law professor who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations and as a volunteer policy adviser to the Biden campaign in 2020, and Ted Dintersmith, a venture capitalist and education philanthropist who has donated to various Democratic campaigns. They want Biden to flip the script on the current Washington narrative of a Democratic Party in chaos and for the party to see the current period as an opportunity for a reset. âIn the midst of malaise and crisis, we can forge an uplifting path,â Dintersmith told Semafor.\n\nTheir idea goes something like this, according to a memo shared with Semafor that has been circulated to Democratic donors and bundlers as well as officials within the Biden campaign and administration:\n\nAccording to its authors, the country would be captivated. Donations would pour in. And Biden would be celebrated as a âmodern-day George Washington,â the proponents argue.\n\nâWe can limp to shameful, avoidable democracy-ending defeat. Or Democrats can make this Our Finest Hour. While we hope for help from Lord Almighty, the Lord helps those who help themselves,â the memo states, alluding to Bidenâs recent interview with ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos in which he said only the âLord Almightyâ could force him from the race. âWe need to act. Now.â\n\nIn response, a Biden campaign spokesperson pointed to comments made by the president last week about remaining in the race. âIâm not letting one 90-minute debate wipe out three and a half years of work. Iâm staying in the race, and I will beat Donald Trump,â he said in Wisconsin.\n\nThe spokesperson also noted that the Biden Victory Fund received a maximum donation from a top donor last week, and that grassroots fundraising remains strong.\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats are desperate for a way out of the current mess. Concerns about Bidenâs mental acuity and intraparty fighting about whether he should continue as the nominee have dominated headlines since his June 27 debate performance. Bidenâs Friday Stephanopoulos interview did little to quell the angst.\n\nThis plan looks to chart an optimistic course of action for the party but probably stands little chance of being implemented. For one, it would require Biden â who has only been digging in â to decide voluntarily to exit the race within days. And it wouldnât automatically make Harris the nominee, instead ushering in a broader field, which could exacerbate the partyâs problems with some key constituencies if sheâs seen as being passed over. Itâs also hard to see candidates sticking to a positive-only campaign pledge that avoids attacking their competition. Even if they publicly restrained themselves, a competitive race would likely usher in a knife fight of opposition research, leaks, and whispers by their allies in the press and on social media.\n\nThe memo acknowledges that time is not on the Democratsâ side: âWill it happen? Probably not, absent a timely decision by Party leaders, including President Biden, who truly put country first,â it states. âYes, President Biden has served his country with distinction for five decades. Yes, this honorable man deserves our respect, gratitude, and admiration. But not our blind loyalty. America desperately wants an uplifting choice.â\n\nBrooks said that she has heard near-universal support from individuals to whom she has sent the memo, suggesting party elites would be on board with such a plan if Biden backs it.\n\nThis story has been updated with a response from the Biden campaign.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Jim Clyburn made Joe Biden president once. Can he save him a second time?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nIn the story of Joe Bidenâs rise to the presidency in 2020, nobodyâs been mythologized quite like 83-year-old South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn. With a late endorsement, the longtime House leadership fixture helped deliver his stateâs delegates to Biden and revive his flagging campaign after rough showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nNow Biden is facing the biggest crisis of his political career, with his party openly questioning his viability as a candidate. Clyburn is set to talk to the president tonight.\n\nWhen I met the Congressman at a building near the Capitol for an interview on Friday, he had just told a group of reporters that the debate was only âstrike oneâ for Biden. I asked if the president really had two more to spare.\n\nâWho knows, he can hit foul balls,â he said. âEverybody remembers Babe Ruth being the home run king. Few people remember how many times he struck out. Who knows? On strike two he may knock it out of the park.â\n\nHe offered a now-familiar take on Bidenâs showing, asking to focus on the differences between the candidates on their records and platforms.\n\nâI think all of us saw what was not a good performance, but the presidency is a very substantive entity, and President Biden has never been a show horse âÂ heâs always been a workhorse,â Clyburn said.\n\nWhen it comes to questions about Bidenâs hold on the nomination, Clyburnâs response is simple: âLetâs just stay the course.â\n\nâWe got two months before we go to the convention and then three months after that to go to the election,â he said. âSo thereâs no reason to have their hair on fire.â\n\nIn the meantime, the Congressional Black Caucus â whose districts form the core of Bidenâs base, and which Clyburn helped deliver in the 2020 primaries âÂ was still solidly behind Biden, he said.\n\nâI havenât talked to a CBC member yet who says he ought to get out,â he told Semafor.\n\nThe CBC has proven a critical ally in the past to embattled presidents, notably sticking by President Clinton when the Monica Lewinsky scandal initially threatened to cause a party-wide break. That experience was, Clyburn said when asked about it, ânot the same thing, but similar.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nMany of the Democrats watching Bidenâs debate woke up on Friday with existential questions about their partyâs immediate future that they were desperately looking to party elders âÂ Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, certainly Clyburn âÂ to help answer .\n\nClyburnâs concerns were more technical.\n\nFor one, a debate was the wrong format for Biden. Instead he recommended a series of 60-90 minute town halls âto really do what I know he does wellâ and connect with voters on a human level. He should make sure to get out of the major metro areas in Georgia and Pennsylvania, too, and explore smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nâI hope they donât have a second debate,â he said. âI really think he just ought to go out and do town halls and talk to people.â\n\nAs for Thursdayâs debate, he thinks Biden should have organized his answers by giving a holistic breakdown of how his administration has impacted âthe individual, the family, and the community,â a public speaking trick his father, a preacher, had taught him decades ago. âWe do it for the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost,â he said.\n\nHe also thought Bidenâs team had thrown him off his game by over-briefing him with factoids and data, a critique some other Democrats had raised.\n\nâI just donât think you prepare people by loading them up with figures,â Clyburn said.\n\nBiden, he thought,  needed to be less reactive to Trump, who seemed to bait him into chasing rabbits with his attacks.\n\nâNo matter what your question is, Iâm not talking to this guy over here: Ignore him, and look into that camera and embrace it,â Clyburn said.\n\nClyburn, who is stepping down from House leadership this year but seeking re-election, knows what itâs like to have questions raised about his age. I asked whether he worried back in 2020 when he endorsed Biden that he might someday decline in office. He didnât directly answer, but suggested the biggest change wasnât in Bidenâs health, it was his switch to a job that required constant attention and offered less time for political performance.\n\nâHe had less on his shoulders because he wasnât responsible for protecting the country from Russian invasion,â he said.\n\nWith Biden still in the race, thereâs nothing to do for now but work. Heâll be stumping for the president in Florida and Wisconsin.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "A âscaredâ Biden aide sounds an alarm\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMidday on the Fourth of July, I received a call from a government official with regular access to the West Wing, who said they had reached a breaking point and wanted to sound the alarm.\n\nThe person insisted on careful ground rules: No details on the specific policy area theyâd work on, no gender, age, or sexual orientation. Their credibility basically depends on my vouching that theyâre a serious person, which I can do âÂ though I should also say this person has nothing to say about the presidentâs physical condition, and was limited to their own experience outside Bidenâs tight inner circle.\n\nHere is the assertion this person would like to get across: Itâs unclear even to some inside the West Wing policy process which policy issues reach the president, and how. Major decisions go into an opaque circle that includes White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients (who talks to the president regularly) and return concluded. (The big exception to this pattern, they said, is foreign policy.)\n\nThis pattern had already been a topic of discussion, and curiosity, among the high-powered aides who work in and around the White House. The rituals of paperflow are technical, but they say theyâre surprised by the lack of briefings to the president, and of readouts from consultations with the president and worry about the possibility of decisions âbeing made without him.â\n\nMy source has no reputation for being involved in factional fights on hot button issues, and no obvious ulterior motive for picking up the phone.\n\nâIâm super proud of the policies,â the person said. âIâm talking to you because Iâm incredibly upset and scared for the country and I would like to do what I can.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe Biden White House runs policy through a tight inner circle âÂ tighter than the sprawling debates of the Clinton or early Obama years. But White House officials furiously rejected any hint that the president isnât fully in command, even if some in the policy apparatus donât see him. There is also wide reporting that Biden has been in the weeds of key decisions beyond Gaza and Ukraine, including issues ranging from trade with China to student loan forgiveness.\n\nBiden âis in the middle of everything. He signs off on everything,â said Bruce Reed, the deputy chief of staff who oversees policy. âMany of us have sat with him as heâs made hundreds of decisions.â\n\nâNobody has the authority to freelance. Not Jeff, not Ron, not anybody,â Reed told me.\n\nOther top aides echoed Reedâs account, and further stressed that the presidentâs age has had no effect at all on his involvement in these issues.\n\nTop White House economist Jared Bernstein said Biden âmakes decisions on everything from student debt relief to 301 tariffs to housing policyâ and Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi said Biden is âsweating every relevant detail.â\n\nSpokesman Andrew Bates said in an email: âThis single sourceâs claim is directly contradicted by a large body of (even critical) reporting about the policy process, which has continually stressed President Bidenâs direct involvement in every major decision.â\n\nThe question looming over my conversations is how much Bidenâs age, so visible in front of the scenes, has affected his governance behind them.\n\nThatâs a reporting question, and itâs one on which the media is scrambling right now to make up for lost time. Iâm skeptical, as are many journalists, of aidesâ insistence that his age has changed nothing about his decision-making process. But thereâs also no evidence for the wildest, late Woodrow-Wilson-style speculation.\n\nMy sourceâs call âÂ as they say, from inside the building âÂ is a mark of why the panic inside the Democratic Party is running so deep right now.\n\nEven inside the West Wing, not everyone is sure.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "The Final Policies Biden Is Pushing Through Before He Leaves Office\n\nP resident Joe Biden will leave the White House, presumably for the last time, on Jan. 20. And while his successor, Donald Trump , has promised to implement a raft of policies on Day One of his new term, Biden isn't leaving before pushing through a few of his own.\n\nIn December, Biden announced nearly $2.5 billion in security assistance for Ukraine , commuted death-row sentences , and granted clemency to a record number of prisoners. Since the beginning of 2025-in addition to addressing crises like the California wildfires and attending to the usual end-of-presidency securing of judicial confirmations , bill signings (mostly post office renamings), and handing out of medals to citizens and service members -Biden has used his remaining days in office to tout his administration's accomplishments-on everything from LGBTQ rights to health care to small-business growth -as well as to assert his domestic and foreign-policy principles through a series of executive actions.\n\n\"My Administration is leaving the next Administration with a very strong hand to play,\" Biden said on Monday in the first of two farewell speeches to the nation. (The second is scheduled for Wednesday .)\n\nHere's a rundown of some of the final policies Biden has announced this month so far, as his presidency winds down.\n\nOn Jan. 3, Biden blocked a nearly $15-billion deal from Japanese company Nippon Steel to acquire Pittsburgh-headquartered U.S. Steel-a planned move that drew political scrutiny during the recent election season amid reinvigorated calls to shore up America's domestic manufacturing industry. Biden said he blocked the acquisition on national security grounds. \"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" the outgoing President said in a statement . \"Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"\n\nNippon Steel and U.S. Steel were ordered to abandon their transaction within 30 days, but they sued the Biden administration alleging \" illegal interference \" in the deal that the companies say, according to a joint statement, would \"enhance, not threaten, United States national security.\" The Biden administration extended the deadline to unwind the transaction to mid-June, further into Trump's term, though Trump has also opposed the acquisition .\n\nOn Jan. 5, Biden signed into law the Social Security Fairness Act , a bipartisan measure that will increase Social Security payments for former and current public employees who receive pensions-including firefighters, police officers, and teachers, as well as their spouses and survivors-by rescinding two federal policies that limited their benefits. \"This is a big deal,\" Biden said during a signing event at the White House, where he touted himself as \"the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits.\" The law would increase the monthly payouts of some 3 million recipients by an average of $360, while many will also receive lump-sum payments to make up for the shortfall of benefits they should have gotten in 2024.\n\nTrump has promised to \"protect Social Security,\" though analysts have warned the fund is headed toward insolvency and his proposals could worsen its finances, which may lead to legally-mandated benefit cuts.\n\nOn Jan. 6, Biden, using his authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, issued a ban on new offshore oil and natural gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, as part of his larger climate and conservation agenda. The order covers some 625 million acres of federal waters, including the U.S. East coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Coast along California, Oregon, and Washington, and more portions of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. \"My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs,\" Biden said in a statement .\n\nTrump, who has promised to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\" by expanding oil and gas drilling, posted on Truth Social that Biden is \"doing everything possible to make the TRANSITION as difficult as as possible\" and said during a Jan. 7 press conference at Mar-a-Lago that he will immediately reverse Biden's order -though he will likely need an act of Congress .\n\nOn Jan. 7, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule that will remove around $49 billion in medical bills from consumer credit reports, improving the credit score of more than 15 million Americans. Lenders will also be barred from using medical information in their lending decisions, the bureau said, based on previous research that showed medical bills on people's credit reports are poor predictors of their loan repayment ability. \"This will be lifechanging for millions of families, making it easier for them to be approved for a car loan, a home loan, or a small-business loan,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said in a White House factsheet that called reducing the burden of medical debt \"a key priority in President Biden and Vice President Harris's effort to lower cost for American families.\"\n\nOn Jan. 8, Biden announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will expand the benefit coverage of veterans with cancer believed to be linked to toxic pit exposures, as part of a yearslong effort of his Administration to increase veterans' access to benefits. According to a press release by the Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans with acute and chronic leukemias, multiple myelomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, myelofibrosis, urinary bladder, ureter, and related genitourinary cancers, as well as the survivors of veterans who passed from these conditions, can immediately apply for benefits without needing to prove that their ailments are linked to their service. \"It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve as Commander-in-Chief and to support and care for our service members, veterans, and their families,\" Biden said in his statement.\n\nOn Jan. 10, the Biden Administration expanded the sanctions on Russia's energy sector in response to the war it continues to wage in Ukraine. In a statement, the Administration called the sanctions the \"most significant\" so far-covering two major Russian oil producers, dozens of oilfield service providers, 183 vessels moving seaborne Russian oil, and opaque traders of Russian oil worldwide. Some of the targeted vessels are also suspected to ship Iranian oil, according to the Treasury Department. \"Some will ask why we waited for the end of the Administration to introduce sanctions on Russian oil,\" reads a White House statement on the sanctions. \"The answer is this: for sanctions to be successful, they must be sustainable.\"\n\nWhether or not the Trump administration plans to continue these sanctions remains to be seen, though analysts have said that Trump may find sanctions on Russia to be \" stickier \" than expected, and he may even take advantage of them to force negotiations with Putin to end the war. Trump \"has been handed a great big stick to use,\" wrote Bloomberg's Julian Lee . \"He shouldn't just throw it away.\"\n\nOn Jan. 10, the U.S. Treasury Department released partial guidelines on how companies can secure clean fuel tax credits-which was aimed at incentivizing production of low-carbon fuels-in an apparent rush to secure climate initiatives before Biden's term ends. \"This guidance will help put America on the cutting-edge of future innovation in aviation and renewable fuel while also lowering transportation costs for consumers,\" said Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. But while the guidelines provide emission reductions criteria to ensure access to the subsidies, biofuels groups criticized the lack of specificity , as it leaves many of the final decisions to Trump, who has vowed to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act that established the credit in the first place.\n\nOn Jan. 13, Biden approved student loan relief for more than 150,000 borrowers, bringing the total number of borrowers whose student debt has been cancelled under his term to 5 million-more than any other President in U.S. history, according to the Associated Press . Student loan relief, a key Biden campaign proposal in 2020, totaled to $183.6 billion throughout Biden's presidency despite the Supreme Court striking down a wider forgiveness plan in 2023, forcing the Administration to instead expand upon the Education Department's existing programs. \"Since Day One of my Administration, I promised to ensure higher-education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity, and I'm proud to say we have forgiven more student loan debt than any other administration in history,\" the President said in a statement .\n\nIn November, Politico reported that Trump's transition team and advisers are already eyeing a rollback of Biden's debt-forgiveness policies, though Trump allies have admitted that doing so won't be simple.\n\nOn Jan. 13, the Biden Administration announced additions to its existing restrictions on AI chips, aimed at preventing China and other countries of concern to the U.S. from access to the technologies that will allow them to beat America in the artificial intelligence space. Under the framework, 18 U.S. allies will have no new restrictions, but for most other countries, the U.S. will require authorization for exports, reexports, and transfers of advanced computing chips. \"This policy will help build a trusted technology ecosystem around the world and allow us to protect against the national security risks associated with AI, while ensuring controls do not stifle innovation or US technological leadership,\" said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in a statement .\n\nTech groups, however, have warned that such \"rushed\" new policies could cause \"unintended and lasting damage\" to the American semiconductor and AI chip industry. The rule, however, has a 120-day comment period, which means the Trump Administration will get to decide whether or not it ultimately goes through.\n\n\"Obviously it's going to be up to them how they want to proceed, and they may have internal debates the same way we had internal debates about exactly how to calibrate the rule,\" Biden National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Bloomberg . \"But I would be surprised sitting here today if, after 120 days, they looked at the landscape as we've looked at it, and said, 'You know, we really don't need this at all.'\".\n\nThe Biden Administration has been working to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, for which it has collaborated on negotiations with mediators Qatar and Egypt for more than a year. Ahead of Trump's inauguration, which is seen by many as a deadline for a deal to be reached, Biden has made calls in the last couple days with the Emir of Qatar and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . According to White House readouts of both calls, Biden emphasized the need for a deal that would return the hostages that are still held in Gaza as well as bring a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.\n\nIn a foreign-policy speech at the State Department on Jan. 13, Biden said , \"On the war between Israel and Hamas, we're on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition.\" Personnel from both Biden's and Trump's teams have been working together on the negotiations-as Trump also appears keen to quickly resolve the conflict in the Gaza Strip, having warned Hamas that there will be \" all hell to pay \" if the remaining hostages held captive are not released by the time he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "'We Are the World Power.' How Joe Biden Leads\n\nYou can read the transcript of the interview here and the fact-check here .\n\nJoe Biden makes his way through the West Wing telling stories. In the Cabinet Room, with sun pouring through French doors from the Rose Garden outside, he remembers the first time he sat around the long mahogany table, its high-backed leather chairs ordered by seniority. It was more than 50 years ago, Biden says, and Richard Nixon told National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger to brief the 30-year-old first-term Delaware Senator on the still secret timing of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. Walking slowly through the halls, the President unspools anecdotes about heads of state: Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping , Emmanuel Macron. In the Oval Office, he talks about his childhood home in Scranton, Pa., and the 2008 phone call from Barack Obama asking Biden to be his running mate.\n\nBiden recounts these memories over the course of more than 90 minutes on a warm spring day, speaking in a quiet, sometimes scattershot way. The impression he gives is one of advancing age and broad experience, of a man who has lived history. Biden leads the U.S. as the American century is fading into an uncertain future, a changing world of threats, opportunities, and power shifts. At 81, he holds fast to a vision that has reigned since World War II, in which a rich and powerful America leads an alliance of democracies to safeguard the globe from tyranny.\n\nOn June 6, Biden will travel to Normandy, France, to memorialize an event that has served for eight decades as a focal point of this vision. He will arrive as the 12th-and certainly the last-American President who was alive on that day in 1944, when 73,000 American troops led the largest amphibious invasion in human history, accelerating Nazi Germany's defeat and Europe's liberation. For generations, D-Day has been a hallowed anniversary. The President says commemorating it is as much about the future as the past. \"We're playing [that role] even more,\" Biden says. \"We are the world power.\"\n\nWhether this view of America's role in the world will outlast Biden's presidency is an open question. Voters face a clear choice this November. Biden calls America's democratic values the \"grounding wire of our global power\" and its alliances \"our greatest asset.\" His presumptive opponent, former President Donald Trump, called for withdrawing American forces in Europe and Asia and has promised, most recently in his April 12 interview with TIME, to cut loose even our closest allies if they don't do as he tells them. By his own account, Trump sees all countries as unreliable, the relations between them transactional. That sentiment has spread throughout a Republican Party that once championed America's values abroad. J.D. Vance, the Ohio Senator in contention to become Trump's Vice President, tells TIME that the D-Day story has become a sepia-toned distraction. \"The foreign policy establishment is obsessed with World War II historical analogies,\" says Vance, \"and everything is some fairy tale they tell themselves from the 1930s and 1940s.\"\n\nBuy TIME's President Biden 'If He Wins' cover here\n\nDuring his 40 months in office, events have tested Biden's vision of American world leadership. Alliances haven't been enough to win a new European war in Ukraine. U.S. power and leverage haven't prevented a humanitarian catastrophe in the Middle East, marked by alleged war crimes. Putin is trying to assemble an axis of autocrats from Tehran to Beijing. In China, the U.S. faces an adversary potentially its equal in economic and military power that is intent on tearing down the American global order. President Xi has told his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, U.S. officials say, raising the possibility of a dark analogue to Normandy in Asia. Biden doesn't rule out sending troops to defend Taiwan if China attacked, saying, \"It would depend on the circumstances.\"\n\nBiden's record in facing these tests is more than just nostalgic talk. He has added two powerful European militaries to NATO, and will soon announce the doubling of the number of countries in the Atlantic alliance that are paying more than the target 2% of their GDP toward defense, the White House says. His Administration has worked to prevent the war in Gaza from igniting a broader regional conflict. He brokered the first trilateral summit with long-distrustful regional partners South Korea and Japan, and coaxed the Philippines to move away from Beijing's orbit and provide the U.S. new access to four military bases. He has rallied European and Asian countries to curtail China's economic sway. \"We have put together the strongest alliance in the history of the world,\" Biden says, so that \"we are able to move in a way that recognizes how much the world has changed and still lead.\"\n\nBut American Presidents must earn a mandate from their fellow citizens, and it's far from clear that Biden can. In surveys, large majorities say that he is too old to lead. As he walked TIME through the West Wing and sat for a 35-minute interview on May 28, the President, with his stiff gait, muffled voice, and fitful syntax, cut a striking contrast with the intense, loquacious figure who served as Senator and Vice President. Biden bristles at the suggestion that he is aging out of his job. Asked whether he could handle its rigors though the end of a second term, when he will be 86, he shot back, \"I can do it better than anybody you know.\" Age aside, Biden's handling of foreign affairs gets poor marks from voters, and not just for the bungled withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan or the ongoing war in Gaza. While 65% of Americans still believe that the U.S. should take a leading or major role in the world, that number is down 14 points from 2003 and is at its lowest level since Gallup began polling the issue two years earlier.\n\nBiden, who is the most experienced foreign policy President in a generation, believes that role is in America's interest. \"When we strengthen our alliances, we amplify our power as well as our ability to disrupt threats before they can reach our shores,\" he said soon after taking office. To judge the merit of Biden's plan to sustain American world leadership, voters can look to his record: what he has accomplished, where he has fallen short, and how he intends to build on his work in a second term.\n\nAround 3 p.m. on Dec. 13, 2021, the White House Situation Room put through a call from Biden to his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto. Putin's invasion of Ukraine was still more than two months away, and Finland, with its 830-mile border with Russia and tense history with Moscow, had long declined to join NATO. Less than a quarter of Finns supported entering the alliance at the time. But Biden had decided, aides say, that if Russia invaded, the West's response should be not just to defend NATO, but to strengthen it.\n\nOn March 4, days after the invasion, Biden met with the newly enthusiastic Niinisto in the Oval Office. Together they called Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, who had resisted joining the alliance, to try to persuade her. After both countries applied for membership in May 2022, Biden turned to getting the rest of NATO to accept them. In June, he called Turkey's leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan from Air Force One on the way to a summit in Madrid, in hopes of getting Erdogan's support for expanding the alliance. Dangling a one-on-one meeting, Biden said of Turkey's long-sought access to America's F-16 fighter jets, \"Let's find a way to get that done,\" according to the White House. By March 2024, Sweden and Finland were in. \"Everybody thought, including you guys, thought I was crazy,\" Biden says. \"Guess what? I did it.\"\n\nThe accession of Finland and Sweden was part of Biden's broader efforts to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by rallying the free world. Starting in October 2021, Biden held a series of meetings with European and NATO leaders, discussing postinvasion support for Ukraine, including military assistance, sanctions, diplomacy, and economic support. Biden also brought Asian allies into the effort. South Korea and Japan have imposed sanctions on Russia and its arms suppliers. The result, Biden advisers say, is a strengthened alliance of shared democratic values worldwide. \"He has connected Europe and Asia in a way no previous President has,\" says National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.\n\nOthers view all the investment in Ukraine as a distraction from the bigger challenge America faces in East Asia. \"Who doesn't think that $200 billion spent in Europe would've been incredibly useful in the Pacific?\" says Elbridge Colby, a former Trump Administration Pentagon official and lead architect of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. \"Great nations fail,\" says Lieut. General Keith Kellogg, Trump's former National Security Adviser, when \"you fix somebody else's potholes instead of fixing your potholes.\"\n\nBiden says he remains committed to Ukrainian victory. Asked about the war's endgame, Biden says, \"Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine.\" But last year's Ukrainian counteroffensive was a failure. Russia recently has made its largest advances since the opening months of the invasion. Alliance building may have reached its limit, along with Americans' appetite for funding a war of attrition. Biden's allies in Kyiv complain he has been too cautious, giving Ukraine enough weapons to survive the war but not to win it. \"It's not a decisive stance,\" says a senior official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's government. \"It's not the way to victory.\"\n\nOn balance, however, even longtime critics are impressed with Biden's efforts in Ukraine. Former Defense Secretary and CIA director Robert Gates wrote in 2014 that Biden had \"been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national-security issue over the past four decades.\" But on May 19, Gates said that Biden's response to Russia's invasion has gone a long way toward repairing the damage of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. \"He gained a lot of credibility with the speed with which he assembled the coalition of partner countries, allies, and friends before, during, and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\" Gates told CBS's Face the Nation.\n\nBiden says his response has been part of a broader deterrence strategy. \"If we ever let Ukraine go down, mark my words, you'll see Poland go, and you'll see all those nations along the actual border of Russia [fall],\" he tells TIME. But in other theaters, the high-minded Normandy vision has given way to a different kind of diplomacy.\n\nHalfway through our interview, Biden responds to a question about America's relationship with Saudi Arabia by saying that the U.S. has two kinds of alliances: \"There are values-based, and there are practical-based.\" During the campaign, Biden had sworn to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah.\" One of his first moves in office was to cut off certain arms supplies over the kingdom's war in Yemen, which has displaced 4.5 million people and killed 377,000, including 11,000 children, according to the U.N. Soon after, the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, met with China's Foreign Minister and proposed greater cooperation on nuclear energy and security with Beijing, already the kingdom's largest economic partner.\n\nThe Biden Administration quietly pivoted. A new \"great game\" was afoot, with the world dividing between competing Chinese and American spheres of influence. For all Biden's efforts to stimulate a green transition, Saudi Arabia was still providing much of the world's energy. Moreover, the Saudis had expressed willingness during the Trump presidency to normalize relations with Israel, which would tilt the regional balance of power against Iran and in the U.S.'s favor. On Sept. 27, 2021, Sullivan traveled to Saudi Arabia with instructions from Biden to explore the possibility of a peace deal between the kingdom and Israel.\n\nBiden himself traveled to Saudi Arabia in July 2022, bucking a flurry of criticism for meeting with MBS, who has led a widespread crackdown on clerics, academics, and human-rights advocates critical of his regime, according to Human Rights Watch, and who the U.S. says ordered the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi . But the visit helped stabilize relations. Over the course of the next year, it began to look as if Biden's moral climb down with MBS had brought the Saudis back on the U.S. side, and restarted a possible bargain with Israel. The outlines of that deal, Biden now says, were \"overwhelmingly in our interest.\"\n\nHamas, the terrorist group that controls Gaza, was determined not to allow it. Days after its Oct. 7 attack against Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad told TIME, \"We planned for this because Israel thinks it can make peace with anyone, it can make normalization with any country, it can oppress the Palestinians, so we decided to shock the Israelis in order to wake up others.\" Eight Americans were among the estimated 240 taken hostage in the massacre. The Biden Administration has sought to secure their release, but it is not clear how many of the American hostages have survived; three reportedly have been killed. \"We believe there are those that are still alive,\" Biden tells TIME. \"I met with all the families. But we don't have final proof on exactly who's alive.\"\n\nBiden's reaction to Oct. 7 was to provide rock-solid support to Israel. Within a week he had deployed two aircraft carriers to the region. Quietly, he tried to rally Egypt and Saudi Arabia to resist expansion of the conflict into a war between Israel and Iran. Biden's \"practical-based\" alliance building appeared to pay off on April 13, when Iran responded to an Israeli attack on a satellite diplomatic office by launching more than 300 missiles and drones in its first-ever direct attack on Israel. The Saudis and Jordanians reportedly provided intelligence assistance and opened their airspace to U.S. and other jets. With Israel leading the way, the ad hoc alliance managed to shoot down all but four of the projectiles, with no fatalities. More important, the episode helped avert a region-wide war.\n\nBut Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has upped the cost of Biden's commitment to Israel at every turn. Nearly eight months after the conflict started, the death toll in Gaza, according to the local Hamas-led Ministry of Health, has climbed to more than 36,000 people, including an unknown number of Hamas fighters. More than 1.7 million have been displaced by Israeli attacks that have destroyed much of the enclave. On May 20, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court requested a war-crimes indictment for Netanyahu, his Defense Minister, and three leaders of Hamas. Four days later, in a largely symbolic move, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt operations in Gaza . Human Rights Watch says Israel has \"imposed collective punishments on the civilian population, deprived the civilian population of objects indispensable to its survival, and used starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.\"\n\nAsked if Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, Biden says, \"It's uncertain.\" From the start, the Administration knew Israel was pushing the limits of legal warfare, the Washington Post and others have reported. The conflict is driving a wedge between the U.S. and its allies. On May 31, Biden laid out a phased cease-fire plan that would end the war and secure the release of hostages. He has continued to pursue the complicated regional deal with Saudi Arabia. Some close to Biden say the only holdout to the broader pact is Netanyahu. The President declines to say as much, but when asked by TIME if Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his own political reasons, Biden admits, \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nAs aides try to bring the interview to a close, Biden turns to China. Hawks say Beijing is in a sprint to match American economic and military production. By some measures, it is catching up on GDP and defense manufacturing, and already has a larger navy. But Biden takes a bullish view of the competition with the rising Asian power. \"Everybody talks about how, how strong China is and how powerful they are,\" Biden says. \"You've got an economy that's on the brink there. The idea that their economy is booming, give me a break.\" That doesn't mean they can't pose a threat. Asked if China is using AI or other means to meddle in the upcoming U.S. election, Biden says someone is, but declines to say who. Pressed, he adds, \"I think China would have an interest in meddling.\"\n\nWhat Biden describes as China's economic weakness could make confrontation more, not less, likely-another argument, as he sees it, for expanding America's alliances in East Asia. And in that arena, the President has pursued a mix of \"values-based\" and \"practical\" approaches.\n\nBiden was on Air Force One on his way to a fundraiser in Illinois on May 11, 2022, when the results of the Philippine presidential elections were announced, showing that Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. had won. Biden \"had the instinct to just pick up the phone and said, 'Hey, let's get together soon and start building a relationship,'\" Sullivan says. It was a long shot. Marcos has a pending $2 billion judgment against him in a U.S. court relating to his parents' human-rights record during their more than 20-year dictatorship, which ended in 1986. The Philippines are now rated \"partly free\" by Freedom House, and the outgoing President, Rodrigo Duterte, had courted China even as Beijing claimed nearby islands and territorial waters. Marcos had sent cold signals to the U.S. during his campaign.\n\nBiden's call was the first Marcos had received from a foreign leader. As U.S. officials followed up, they briefed the new President on the parallels between Putin's invasion of Ukraine and Xi's declared goals in the South China Sea. Biden dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris and his Secretaries of State and Defense to woo Marcos. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman made clear Marcos had diplomatic immunity and would be welcome in the U.S. Less than a year after Biden's congratulatory call, Marcos made a visit to the White House. More significantly, he provided the U.S. military new access to four bases in the Philippines. In April and May, the two countries engaged in their largest military exercises together, simulating an effort to repulse an amphibious landing. \"The President got engaged early in a very personal way,\" says Sullivan, \"and then kind of showed both respect for him and a vision for where the relationship would go.\"\n\nBiden has pursued this brand of personal realpolitik across Asia. He elevated the communist autocracy in Vietnam to the highest diplomatic status, comprehensive strategic partner, and has moved to embrace the increasingly repressive regime of Narendra Modi in India. He has tried to boost the \"Quad\" alliance with India, Japan, and Australia, upgrading it from a meeting of Foreign Ministers to one of heads of state. In April 2023, Biden convened a Camp David summit with the South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Overcoming long-fraught relations between Seoul and Tokyo, the three countries criticized China's behavior in the South China Sea and declared \"a hinge point of history, when geopolitical competition, the climate crisis, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and nuclear provocations test us.\"\n\nCritics say the problem is too much friend making and not enough deterrence. The U.K. recently said China may be preparing to provide lethal aid to Russia, a move that Biden said in March 2022 would put Xi \"in significant jeopardy\" of harsh U.S. sanctions. \"The single biggest problem with the Biden team is their failure to grasp what it takes to achieve effective deterrence against aggressors,\" says Matt Pottinger, who was Deputy National Security Adviser under Trump. \"They failed against the Taliban, then Putin, and then Iran and its proxies. And now Beijing is making moves that could prove fateful for the world.\" Former Trump official Colby says Biden's diplomatic work is a weak substitute for the one thing that can deter China's rise. \"These high-profile photo ops,\" says Colby, \"are not a substitute for raw military power.\" He points to recent statements by senior U.S. military officials that China is outpacing the U.S. on missile- and shipbuilding, and war games showing the U.S. losing badly in a contest over Taiwan, and says the U.S. should put all its efforts into defending the \"first island chain\" of Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines.\n\nBiden believes that withdrawing from Europe and the Middle East to focus on East Asia would backfire, aides say. If America abandons its allies elsewhere, they argue, its Asian allies will abandon it, in turn. The U.S. needs European and Middle Eastern countries to increase its economic and military advantages over China. And ultimately, failing to confront instability now-in Ukraine, Gaza or elsewhere-will only make doing so later a more costly distraction from the competition with Beijing.\n\nBack in the Cabinet Room after the interview, the sun is lower, and Biden has more stories. He turns to a sideboard with a commendation from the Kosovo government to his son Beau Biden, who died of cancer nine years ago. The President relates with evident pride his son's work supporting its judicial system. A mention of diplomat Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton accords for the Balkans, elicits a story about Afghanistan and an argument Biden had with Holbrooke over the search for peace there.\n\nOn a matching sideboard on the other side of the door, the President opens an album with travel pictures, launching a series of anecdotes about the Popes he has known, including John Paul II and Benedict, whom Biden calls \"the Rottweiler.\" Recounting an exchange with one over abortion, he casts an eye toward the cracked door to the Oval Office and asks an aide, \"Are they in there?\" Turning back to his visitors, he says, \"Let me show you one more picture.\"\n\nThis avuncular politicking remains a Biden trademark, one that has helped with allies overseas but failed to unite Americans at home, as Biden pledged when running for President. Not that he has stopped trying. Biden ultimately persuaded Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to move a roughly $95 billion supplemental aid package for Ukraine, the Middle East, and Taiwan. To build support for his Middle East peace package, he has worked both sides of the aisle. On Nov. 8, 2023, Biden sat for two hours in the windowless Roosevelt Room with a bipartisan group of nine Senators who had just returned from the region, asking for impressions from the trip and moderating a conversation between them, Sullivan, and Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk. At the end, he pulled Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham into the Oval Office for separate 10-minute conversations about next steps in the effort, says Coons.\n\nBiden may be right that despite the partisanship, a consensus exists for a values-based, pragmatic role for America in the world. His challenge is to get Americans to focus on that rather than on other issues driven by foreign affairs, like inflation or immigration. Biden denies that his expansion of Trump's trade war with China will increase prices, and says his only regret about lifting Trump's anti-immigration measures is that he didn't do it sooner. His goal in a second term, he says, is \"to finish what he started.\"\n\nAt stake is the direction of the world for the coming century. At Normandy, Biden will make the case for what historian Hal Brands says is \"the 80-year tradition of internationalism that has been quite good for America and the world.\" The alternative, says Brands, would be a \"more vicious and chaotic\" world where Americans ultimately would be less safe, prosperous, and free, but only after everyone else suffered first.\n\nWrapping up his conversation with TIME, Biden offers cookies from a tray in the outer Oval. \"They're homemade,\" he says. Turning to leave, he offers a final salutation: \"Keep the faith.\" But then he pauses and turns back, as the phrase triggers one last story. It's about a relative who had his own response to that admonition. And here Biden taps one of his visitors on the chest and says, \"Spread the faith.\"\n\n- With reporting by Simon Shuster/Kyiv; Leslie Dickstein, Simmone Shah, and Julia Zorthian/New York; and Melissa August, Brian Bennett, Vera Bergengruen, Eric Cortellessa, and Sam Jacobs/Washington\n\nOrder your copy of the President Biden 'If He Wins' issue here\n\nCorrection appended, June 5: The original version of this story misstated the terms of an agreement the Biden Administration struck with the Philippines.

      "text": "Biden's Overlooked Advantage\n\nI n recent months we have heard much about President Biden's low poll numbers and Americans' negative views of the economy . It is therefore not surprising that numerous media pundits have rushed to entertain the idea of a Trump victory in 2024.\n\nLet's first start with some obvious caveats to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, a substantial amount of Biden's lagging approval is coming from his own party : since 2022, between 15 and 22 percent of Democrats have neglected to voice approval for Biden. The present crisis in the Middle East, which has put President Biden at odds with many in the Democratic base , has likely allowed this disapproval to harden even further. But on Election Day, these dissatisfied Democrats-and many Independents as well-will likely look at Biden a little differently when the prospect of another Trump presidency is looming large.\n\nA second fairly obvious caveat is that, with inflation having cooled off a great deal over the past 2 years, Americans' sentiments about the economy have improved quite dramatically, which can only help Biden's chances going forward.\n\nBut an even more fundamental caveat exists, and it is one that is surprisingly overlooked. Put simply, the fact that Biden has been in office for one term matters .  A lot.\n\nHistory Repeating? The Case of 2012\n\nIn September of 2011, then-President Barack Obama was struggling.  His approval was virtually identical to Biden's current approval, hovering around 40% . Views of the economy were overwhelmingly negative and polls found Obama losing to one of the then-front-running Republican contenders, Mitt Romney. On the eve of the 2012 election, at least one respected poll had Romney narrowly leading Obama.\n\nIt seemed clear that Americans were ready for a change.\n\nBut change is not what happened. Obama handily won the two-party vote share (that is, the total number of votes won by the Democratic and Republican Party candidates) by about 4 percentage points.\n\nGiven political scientists' research on U.S. presidential elections, no one should have been surprised by this outcome. Why? Because in November of 2012 Obama was the incumbent president, just as Biden will be in November of 2024.\n\nThe Power of Incumbency\n\nEvery presidential election seems unique, but the data don't lie.  My recent research , conditionally accepted at the peer-reviewed journal, Political Science Research & Methods , looks at all presidential elections since 1952. Despite all the different candidates, national priorities, international challenges, economic conditions, etc. over the past 72 years, incumbent candidates have won the popular vote a remarkable 78% of the time.\n\nThese incumbent candidates have averaged 54.5% of the two-party vote share-a massive 9 percentage-point average advantage over their non-incumbent challengers.\n\nEven if we go back to the first election following the end of the Civil War (1868), the results tell us the same story:  incumbent presidents average well over 50% of the two-party vote share.\n\nThis is not to say that incumbency is the only thing that matters.  After all, 2020 saw the incumbent lose the popular vote by 4 percentage points. But given the historic unusualness of that election (the Covid-19 pandemic, skyrocketing unemployment, unprecedented controversies surrounding Trump, etc.), 2020 may be better viewed as an exception that proves the rule.\n\nIndeed, the 2020 and 1980 elections are the only two exceptions to the rule of incumbent victory since 1952 (excluding Bush Sr. in 1992 which, though only his first term, was the Republican Party's third term in office).  The lesson is clear:  while it is not quite a \"guarantee,\" incumbency confers an unequivocal advantage.\n\nIsolating Incumbency's Effect\n\nPolitical scientists have long known about the power of incumbency when using statistical analyses to forecast election results.  Indeed, aside from the economy, it is one of the most consistently powerful predictors of election outcomes.\n\nBut why should it matter?\n\nThere are many potential reasons, but my research -which also employed an online experiment featuring several thousand participants-shows that a majority of citizens (Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike) simply believe that incumbents should generally be elected for a second term.  In short, a president serving only one term (when legally allowed to serve two) just doesn't seem to sit right with many Americans.\n\nExistence of such a norm in U.S. politics has a huge implication:  simply knowing that a candidate is an incumbent should be enough to nudge a substantial share of voters toward voting for that candidate.\n\nIndeed, by isolating candidates' incumbency status from all other considerations (name recognition, the economy, etc.), this is precisely what my experiment finds . Compared to when their incumbency status is not specified, candidates who are identified as the sitting president-whether Democratic or Republican-see an increase of 5.6 percentage-points in vote share. By the standards of modern presidential elections, that is an absolutely game-changing bump.\n\nThe Months Ahead\n\nOf course, each election comes with unique features.  The popularity of third-party candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for example, may disproportionately erode some of Biden's vote share. Trump's criminal trial, the widening crisis in the Middle East, whether the Electoral College result will correspond with the popular vote result , and the likelihood that interest rates will remain high to curb inflationary pressures, for example, all introduce a healthy amount of uncertainty into what will happen in November.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Trump is a (former) president who served only one term, meaning that some share of voters may feel he therefore deserves a second term. In short, might some voters see Trump, rather than Biden, as the real incumbent in 2024?\n\nWhile this is of course possible, we simply don't have enough evidence to assume that many voters will think this way come November (the last time sitting president lost reelection and then ran again (and won) was 1892).\n\nThus, to the extent voters see Biden as the true incumbent, he is likely to benefit from incumbency advantage. Indeed, a poll from this week finds that Trump's polling advantage over Biden-an advantage we have heard so much about in recent months-is now gone .  Other recent polling now shows a small, but growing, Biden advantage.\n\nAgain, this is not at all to say that Biden's incumbency guarantees a 2024 win. (There are no such guarantees in U.S. politics.) Rather, it is to say that, statistically, a Biden loss in 2024 would be very strange . Thus, absent some very strange circumstances (for example, as there were during the 2020 election), history implies a clear advantage for Biden.\n\nIn sum, presidential elections do not ask voters whether they like the sitting president.  Instead, they ask voters whether they prefer the sitting president over the president's opponent. Failure to appreciate this difference leads pundits to regularly predict incumbents' political doom, despite how often incumbent presidents have won reelection over the past 150 years, and despite the intrinsic power that incumbency appears to hold.\n\nTo be sure, Biden has weaknesses.  So did Obama in 2012.  But the asset they shared-incumbency-should not be overlooked. Media's focus on Biden's weaknesses might be good for getting clicks, but it ignores his crucial strength.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Biden and Trump Prepare for the Most Cringe Meeting in Politics\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nAs far as scripted set pieces of American politics go, the first photo-op in the hand-off of power between one White House and the next is up there.\n\nThere are moments of cringe, as was the case in 1980 when Ronald Reagan peppered Jimmy Carter with seemingly ancillary questions to the job they were trading, even as the incumbent rightly suspected someone in Reagan's camp had worked to extend the Iranian hostage crisis so it would end as soon as Reagan took power. During the 1992 iteration that saw George H.W. Bush welcome Bill Clinton to his future office and home after a particularly rowdy race, the incumbent's staff grew persnickety when incoming spokesman Dee Dee Myers spoke to reporters in the walkway between the office complex and the residence: \"We don't do press conferences in the Colonnade,\" a Bush aide sniped . And then eight years later, an attempt at an amiable transition was infamously marred when Clinton's team took the Ws off government keyboards being passed to the incoming George W. Bush administration-at a cost of almost $5,000 in damages.\n\nBut none of those moments was as norm-breakingly flagrant as four years ago when Donald Trump simply refused to invite his successor, Joe Biden, to the White House. The typical niceties mask the inevitable first steps toward accepting that the incumbent party's window in power is racing to a close and it is time to concede the race-something that Trump never did. Biden, who had spent eight years as Vice President and knew his way around the West Wing well enough, didn't exactly need a tour from Trump, but a briefing on the ongoing Covid-19 situation and the covert efforts to keep Russia to heel, China at bay, and the Korean Peninsula relatively stable would have been welcome. It was similar silence on Inauguration Day 2021, when the Trumps fled Washington and became the first absentee outgoing First Family since Andrew Johnson skipped Ulysses S. Grant's 1869 swearing-in ceremony.\n\nSo against this backdrop, Trump will head back to the White House Wednesday as a returning victor, once again forcing polar opposites to sit and debrief in the name of national stability.\n\nBiden phoned Trump right after Election Day and invited him for a meeting that was never offered to Biden. The outgoing President, who is the only politician to defeat Trump in a campaign, has hardly hidden his contempt of his predecessor and soon-to-be successor, but friends say he's also an institutionalist who is determined not to have Sore Loser on his epitaph.\n\nWhat's unknown to this point: Will Kamala Harris join for any of that awkward session? She, too, phoned Trump and congratulated him on his win last Wednesday. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, Harris' top aide, vowed Harris \"would work with President Biden to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, unlike what we saw in 2020.\"\n\nThe last time a sitting Vice President lost out on a promotion was the 2000 election, and then-VP Al Gore joined the Clinton-Bush 43 conversation. By all contemporary accounts, it was unpleasant for both parties' reps wandering the West Wing.\n\nHarris aides did not respond to questions about Harris' plans for Wednesday.\n\nTo be sure, transitions are usually fairly routine affairs, especially once the balloting ends. Generally speaking, folks at this level of the game can wall-off the conflicts. During their last weekend at the presidential retreat of Camp David, the elder Bushes invited Clinton's transition chiefs Warren Christopher and Vernon Jordan to join them in the Maryland mountains. The younger Bush insisted that his team cooperate with the incoming Obama staffers. And, through sneers and tears, Obama's aides followed the boss' orders, too. After all, switching out party labels is, actually, the norm.\n\nOnly twice in the last century has a party held the White House into another presidency without a mid-term death of an incumbent, and those winners are Herbert Hoover, who followed Calvin Coolidge, and George H.W. Bush, who followed Ronald Reagan. The rest were the likes of Harry Truman (elected in his own right after FDR's death) and Lyndon Baines Johnson (elected, too, following JFK's assassination). Basically, for the last hundred years, the White House tends to switch parties when it switches Presidents-requiring the most awkward of meetings between the newcomer and the man he likely spent the last months viciously savaging as a failed incumbent.\n\nBut, for the most part, the outgoing and the incoming tend to play nice for the cameras and often find themselves discussing serious matters outside the glare of political gamesmanship. Trump himself has said his 90-minute session with Obama in 2016 was incredibly enlightening and helped him understand the fuller map beyond campaign rhetoric-especially putting into plain language that North Korea was the biggest under-appreciated threat to the incoming administration. (Obama also told Trump not to hire Mike Flynn, whom Obama dismissed from a top intelligence gig; Trump did not heed that but did can Flynn as National Security Adviser after just 22 days.)\n\nMost Presidents with an eye toward history understand the needs of this final act, both for responsible governing and for their personal legacies. Most modern presidencies don't hit this final stride exactly riding a wave. Truman set the low bar at 32% job approval when he left office. (Nixon would be lower, at 24%, but his resignation in the wake of Watergate has to be treated with a bold-faced asterisk.) Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush all were given the boot by the electorate given a choice. Reagan was far from atop his game by the end, Clinton had emerged a survivor-albeit a bruised one benched by Gore-yet still left office with a 66% job approval rating. George W. Bush spent the 2008 GOP convention touring Africa, far away from delegates and parked at a Trumanesque 34% job approval. Trump raged his way out of office, refusing to accept he had, in fact, lost to Biden. And Biden is currently parked at 41% in Gallup's decades-long tracking of that office.\n\nAll of which is to say this: by this point in their presidencies, the men who run the White House are generally eager to start the legacy-building projects in earnest. Most often than not, they hate their successors. But a photograph-even a group one, as happened with Obama's transition, for the first such confab in 27 years-goes a long way toward showing unity, normalcy, and even legitimacy.\n\nAs much as Biden is going to grit his teeth through Wednesday's session, he knows the alternative is not an option. While Trump availed himself of that easier route in 2020's defeat, that's not how Biden sees the job. And at a time when he's drawing a fair share of blame for Trump's return, Biden understands that the best thing for his legacy, and the country, is handling this uncomfortable moment with the composure and grace that the man he is preparing to greet never offered to him.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "The Story Behind TIME's 'If He Wins' President Biden Cover\n\nRead our full cover story on President Joe Biden here . You can also read the transcript of the interview here and the fact-check here .\n\nAs President Joseph Biden walked into the small dining room next to the Oval Office, he reminded his visitors, not for the first time, that this space was where his predecessor spent the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021 . \"Trump sat and watched TV for three hours and did nothing,\" he said, recalling the riot that overtook the Capitol on the day that Biden's victory was to be certified by Congress.\n\nWe were at the White House on May 28-one week before Biden was scheduled to visit Normandy on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, and two weeks before he was set to join world leaders in Italy-to speak with the President about the U.S.'s role in the world. No President in a generation has entered the job with more foreign policy experience than Biden. Yet his first 31⁄2 years in office have shown the limits of American leadership along with its strengths, dominated as they have been by crises in Afghanistan, Ukraine , and Israel , and by rising tensions in Asia.\n\nSo much of the Biden campaign has revolved around the threat Donald Trump would present to the world if he wins. From his seat off the Oval Office, Biden recalled the first G-7 meeting he attended as President. \"America's back,\" he remembers telling his counterparts. According to Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron replied, \"For how long?\" It made the President realize \"how much confidence people lost in America,\" Biden told TIME . \"There's not a major international meeting I attend that, before it's over ... a world leader doesn't pull me aside, as I'm leaving, and say, 'He can't win. You can't let him win.'\"\n\nWe've heard less so far from Biden about what he believes it would mean for the world if he wins. \"To finish what I started in the first term,\" Biden told us, outlining a vision in which Europe is protected from Russian aggression; new alliances are secured in the Middle East; the opportunities of the Global South and population booms in Africa are realized; and Pacific nations, working with the U.S., help slow climate change and the geopolitical threat from China.\n\nFor that vision to be realized, Biden has to first win in November. The White House is on guard for interference in the election from China and elsewhere. (\"There is evidence that meddling is going on,\" the President told us, without elaborating.) He has to overcome voters' doubts about his age (\"Watch me,\" he said). To the skeptics, he points to his record: passing a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill and a historic climate-change package, and boosting private investment in American industry. \"Look, name a President that's gotten as much done as I've gotten done in my first 31⁄2 years,\" he said.\n\nWashington Bureau Chief Massimo Calabresi, who has reported across the capital and around the world for TIME since 1993, captures the stakes of this moment in this week's cover story . Calabresi's reporting is accompanied by portraits taken by Philip Montgomery-the first time Biden has sat for an outside photographer in the Oval Office during his presidency. It was Montgomery's picture of Biden being sworn in at his Inauguration , in front of a sea of masked faces, that ran on TIME's cover in 2021. And his portraits of Donald Trump accompanied our recent profile of the former President.\n\nBuy TIME's President Biden 'If He Wins' cover here\n\nThis interview is the third Biden has given to TIME since he announced his candidacy for President in 2019. The first happened in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses, before the COVID-19 shutdown. The second, for Person of the Year in 2020, followed the campaign's conclusion under the intense health protocols that dominated that election. And today, we hear him as he prepares for what are likely to be the last major international trips of this term, at a moment when a confluence of global challenges looms over his re-election effort.\n\nIn the time we spent with the President, he remembered long-ago encounters with historic figures ranging from Pope John Paul II to Henry Kissinger. He recalled the words of historian Jon Meacham, who told Biden after the President entered the Oval Office on Inauguration Day that the country had not been as divided since the days of Lincoln, nor the future of its democracy as challenged since those of FDR. The overall impression Biden left us with is one of a man in conversation with history, both the country's and his own.\n\nOrder your copy of the President Biden 'If He Wins' issue here\n\nWrite to Sam Jacobs at sam.jacobs@time.com"

      "text": "From everyman to family man: The essence of Delaware's Joe Biden, our 46th US president\n\nJoe Biden is ending more than five decades of political service with history-making bookends - he was the youngest ever elected to the U.S. Senate in modern times and is now the oldest to leave the country's highest office.\n\nIt's been a career fueled by ambition, resiliency, and idealism and highlighted by tragedy, disappointments and triumph. And while he is not leaving the office of the presidency the way he envisioned, Delaware - Biden's home for more than 70 years - has always been his touchstone. As vice president and president, he brought the world to his home state.\n\nBiden told The News Journal in 1976 that he was not sure if he ever wanted to live in the White House.\n\nTrue to his word, he has returned to Delaware so often during his one-term presidency that locals have dubbed the traffic backups created by his motorcade as \"Joe Jams.\"\n\nAnd Biden's encounters with the locals are uniquely Delaware.\n\n\"It's like Elvis in Memphis. Everyone has a Biden story if they've lived here long enough,\" said Jude Baseden, who resides in north Wilmington.\n\nWilmington's Bill Pegram had his Biden moment in 2019 when he spotted the then-former vice president leaving a Greenville coffee shop with a cup of joe, stopping his truck in the middle of the parking lot to shake his hand.When Biden learned Pegram's father, Richard, was a World War II veteran, he told Pegram to get his then-95-year-old father on the phone.\n\n\"He thanked him for his service and made my father's day,\" Pegram recalled. \"Politics aside, anyone who would call my dad and thank him like that - I have to give a little appreciation to him.\"\n\nBiden always told the press and anyone who listened that he wanted to be known as \"just plain Joe.\"\n\nA former assistant public defender, Biden was a criminal lawyer with the Wilmington law firm of Aerenson and Balick in 1971 when he decided as a New Castle County councilman to run for the U.S. Senate seat against incumbent Sen. J. Caleb Boggs.\n\nBiden was a county councilman for only 16 months. At the time, News Journal columnist Al Cartwright said Boggs, who had been elected statewide to public office since 1946 - three times as a U.S. representative, twice as governor, and twice as U.S. senator - had shoes older than Biden.\n\nThe 29-year-old Biden's youth and stunning upset over a veteran lawmaker who seemed unbeatable propelled him into the spotlight as a national political figure where he would remain for 52 years.\n\nThe senator \"ran as Joe Biden and was elected as Joe Biden and he signs his name Joe Biden,\" said Wes Barthelmes, Biden's administrative assistant, who had once worked for the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in February 1973.\n\n\"Don't keep looking for mystique. There's no mystique. He's just just a hard-working senator,\" Barthelmes would later say.\n\nThe \"just Joe\" theme would be repeated at a March 1973 chicken-and-covered dish dinner for Sussex County Democrats in Wesley United Methodist Church hall.\n\nBiden became emotional and wept as he stood on the same stage where he first announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate to Sussex County voters a year earlier. The last time he was there, Biden was with his wife, Neilia, who had died three months earlier in an automobile accident.\n\n\"I very seldom have trouble speaking, as you know, but this is where we started,\" he said as his voice trembled.\n\nSeveral in the audience cried openly as Biden said, \"My wife had a great deal of respect for you all. I didn't want to come tonight. ... I've never done this [cry] in public ....\" Biden regained his composure, continued the speech, and told the audience he was still \"Joe Biden, not Senator Biden.\"\n\nHe received a standing ovation and perhaps for the first time realized he could find solace and strength in shared grief.\n\nBiden's ability to work a rope line, pump up a crowd, or connect with a random voter on the street has always been among his superpowers.\n\nHe may live in million-dollar houses in Greenville and Rehoboth Beach that many will never be able to afford, but he still can come across as someone most can relate to on a middle-class level.\n\nAs one News Journal article noted in 1986, \"He is a man who lives in a mansion on the edge of Chateau Country, but who treats his family to pizza after a long day in Washington and takes guests out to lunch at a sub shop.\" He's also the kind of guy who is genuinely wowed when his staff flies in Charcoal Pit milkshakes as a surprise treat following his Democratic National Convention speech last year.\n\nBut when it comes to voters, he looks them square with his blue eyes undistracted, trained on its target. The 6-foot former University of Delaware football player asks how you are and about your family, sometimes with both hands on your shoulders.\n\nThere's always a handshake or two. Or three. And then there's The Smile. For his entire career, he has turned on the huge grin, revealing gleaming perfect rows of white teeth, whether he's happy with a question just asked - or looking to duck one.\n\nWhen a 35-year-old Biden broke his right wrist sliding head-first into third base at a 1978 charity baseball game in Claymont, it left him in a cast up to his elbow for six weeks.\n\nFor a gregarious senator, losing his ability to use his hand-shaking arm was akin to Samson getting a buzzcut. Not to mention how it hindered his speech-giving, which sometimes seemed to be powered by arm movement. At the time, Biden conceded the broken wrist may leave him speechless.\n\nBut, of course, it did not. His ability to talk. And talk. And talk some more quickly became legendary when he landed in the U.S. Senate office he held continuously for Delaware from 1973 to 2009.\n\nAs he said at the Sussex County Democrats' Jamboree in 1988 during his heavily-anticipated return to the public eye following his brain aneurysm: \"I do miss this.\" As 1,000 cheered the start of his comeback, he added, \"It's the honest-to-God's truth. I could hardly wait to get here.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Biden's gift for gab, many have noticed during his presidency what Delawareans have known for decades: He will often tell the same stories or use the same phrases repeatedly.\n\nOne News Journal columnist in 1982 mentioned that Biden opened a recent speech by \"dragging out the Gumboro gas station joke that it seems he has been using since the Nixon administration.\"\n\nNews Journal columnist Norm Lockman wrote in 1973 that Biden sometimes \"indulged in a little self-pity that makes some people wonder about his own sincerity.\" Shortly after his wife Neilia's 1972 death, he had talked about her so frequently in speeches that people began criticizing him, particularly in Delaware (and mostly behind his back) for exploiting the tragedy, Lockman wrote.\n\n\"There are people who think I've taken advantage of the tragedy. It makes me mad, but it's understandable. I know it looks contradictory. Why should this guy who wouldn't let anyone come to her funeral turn around and, in a political context, talk about his wife and a personal relationship?\" Biden said.\n\n\"But I can't help it. I can try not to talk about it, but if it comes up, then I can't talk about Neilia without talking about Neilia. I can't help but become personal. I mean, I just can't treat her memory like some campaign worker who is gone and it's all over with.\"\n\nIn recent years, Biden has often mentioned his late son Beau in speeches and sometimes receives the same criticism.\n\nStill, his folksy homespun tales, paired with jokes and knowledge of foreign and domestic issues, were a potent combination when combined with his natural charisma and ability to connect one on one with voters.\n\nThat everyman persona would sometimes create headlines on its own, like in 1977 when two teens snatched a purse from a 41-year-old woman in Wilmington.\n\nOn his 35th birthday, Biden was nearby and heard her scream while driving home on Miller Road after dropping his children off at the movies. He raced down 27th Street, hopped out of his car, and chased the pair, dubbed \"quick little devils\" by the woman - jumping a pair of fences in the process. One of them eventually dropped the purse as the senator gained on them.\n\n\"I was really disappointed I didn't get [the thieves], but at least I got her purse,\" he told a reporter at the time.\n\nIn March 1969, Biden - then a lawyer living off Marsh Road - found and helped an injured St. Bernard in front of his office at the Farmers Bank Building. The 80-pound dog was limping from an injury to its right paw. Biden took off his belt and put it around the dog's neck as a makeshift leash.\n\nHe put the dog in his car and drove it to his home, even though he was late for court. Biden said he was a sucker for stray animals. The dog joined two cats named Foupi and Squirrel and a German shepherd named Senator at his home until the owner was found and the dog was returned to its home.\n\nBiden's dogs would gain even more headlines over the years.\n\nJude Baseden, who referenced Elvis in Memphis when describing Biden in Delaware, and two friends found Biden's lost Great Dane in 1975 when she was 12 years old in the Brandywood neighborhood in Talleyville.\n\nShe and her friends thought they would be rewarded for finding the dog known as \"Governor.\" Every day, Baseden went to the mailbox looking for a letter and a reward. A few weeks later, a large brown envelope came. Inside was a thank you letter from Biden.\n\nHe included a black-and-white glossy photo of himself. Baseden, then known as Judy, said there was no money and no reward.\n\n\"I was really mad and tore up the photo,\" now says Baseden, adding that people need to remember she was 12 at the time.\n\nHistory took some time to sink in and Baseden said she now appreciates the letter. It hangs in a frame on the wall in her Wilmington-area home.\n\nBiden's German shepherds Champ, Major and Commander lived in the White House. The elderly Champ, a good boy who also lived at the vice president's Number One Observatory Circle , died in 2021. But Major and Commander were banished from Washington for good after multiple biting incidents. The president's cat, Willow, remains.\n\nJoe Biden's mouth has always been both an asset and a liability.\n\nNews Journal columnist Lockman said Biden \"has the shortest link between his brain and his mouth of any big-time Delaware politician.\"\n\nBiden in October 1973 spoke in Chicago shortly after then-President Nixon appeared on TV in a press conference and said Nixon had done for politicians \"about what the Boston Strangler did for door-to-door salesmen.\"\n\nBack in Delaware, Biden said he received a telegram about his comments and he read the contents: \"I resent the comparison. [signed] The Boston Strangler.\"\n\nThe younger Biden could especially be a big mouth with enough bluster to fill a few Senate offices, an impression made immediately when he complained about the size of his Senate salary as a freshman lawmaker.\n\n\"I do not know about others, but I'm worth a lot more than my salary of $42,500 a year in this body,\" the 30-year-old said in July 1973. \"I'd better shut up or I'm going to lose the next election before I get a chance to run.\"\n\nBiden later said he regretted \"shooting off at the mouth.\"\n\nHe once called a former colleague a \"phony SOB\" in 1994 - Democratic Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth, for the record - and in 2022 he called Fox News's Steve Doocy a \"stupid son of a bitch\" while speaking to himself in a hot mic moment as reporters were leaving a press conference.\n\nBiden has changed over the years, however. He's softer-spoken and the loss of son Beau, whose promising political career seemed posed to track with his father's, has left a sad void.\n\nAfter the disastrous debate with former President Donald Trump in June sparked a widespread push for him to end his candidacy, the fire-breather seemed like he would struggle to blow out a birthday candle. While he still can show a flash of his old self, he has slowed down markedly.\n\nHe has also evolved on some issues.\n\nFor example, he voted for a 1994 bill co-sponsored by North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms to cut off federal funding to any school district that has programs \"encouraging or supporting homosexuality as a positive lifestyle alternative.\" But 18 years later, he would famously get out in front of President Obama and voice his support for same-sex marriage on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in a headline-making moment.\n\nOn other issues, he has not changed his stance. Biden grew up Catholic and still regularly attends Mass at St. Joseph on the Brandywine in Greenville and St. Edmond's in Rehoboth Beach, but believes in a woman's right to choose abortion.\n\nBiden's attachment to his family goes beyond the often-told tragedy of the 1972 Hockessin car accident that stole his wife Neilia and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi Christina, known as \"Amy.\" Or the 2015 cancer death of his son Beau. Or his famous weekday commutes every morning and night to Washington via Amtrak as a senator.\n\nThe Biden clan has always kept its circle tight. Joe's parents, two brothers, sister, and brother-in-law all worked on his first Senate campaign. \"We have very few close friends outside of the family,\" said his wife, Neilia, a week before her death.\n\nBiden's beloved mother, Catherine \"Jean\" Biden, frequently told her children: \"Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end. Period.\"\n\nHis younger sister, Valerie Biden Owens, has played a central role in her brother's life as an advocate, strategist and best friend. She is a frequent companion to Biden at the 5 p.m. Saturday church service at St. Joseph on the Brandywine, and the pair also sometimes meet up for meals around Wilmington at old familiar places like Mrs. Robino's in Little Italy.\n\nOwens had been her brother's campaign manager for more than five decades beginning with a high school race. She became the first woman in United States history to run a presidential campaign. In 1987, Owens was by Biden's side when he ended his first run for president after being accused of plagiarizing a speech from United Kingdom Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.\n\nWife Jill Jacobs, whom he married in 1977, has been his rock. He is so proud of his wife and her long career as an educator that he often says in speeches, \"I'm Jill Biden's husband.\"\n\nThe affection between the couple is longstanding. Joe and Jill were known to sprawl out on facing seats on the Amtrak train home from Washington when he was a senator. She would kick off her shoes and put her feet in his lap.\n\nOn his last day as vice president in 2017, Joe and Jill Biden rode an Amtrak train home to Wilmington. The next day, he showed up at an indoor track meet at Tower Hill School to watch his grandchildren.\n\nHis daughter Ashley could often be seen by his side during overseas trips as vice president and president.\n\nAnd his sons were an especially ubiquitous presence as they grew from high schoolers into college students, more able to take part in their father's fast-moving world.\n\nThat was then-20-year-old Georgetown University student Hunter Biden in 1990 attending each day of the contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nNearly 35 years later, one of the most controversial moments of Biden's presidency would be granting sweeping amnesty to Hunter - convicted of federal gun charges and also pleading guilty to federal charges of tax evasion - after promising not to pardon him. The move might have shocked the nation, but many Delawareans, long familiar with the Biden family's closeness, were hardly surprised.\n\nWhen then-22-year-old Beau Biden was graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1991, his father was there to give the commencement address. Closing his speech, which had been void of any mention of the special family connection to the day, Biden simply stated, \"Congratulations Beau,\" from behind the podium.\n\nBiden decided against delving into their relationship because it would be \"cheating the other parents on this special day,\" he told the press, before adding that he was also worried he'd embarrass Beau by \"losing it. I'm afraid if I had tried that at all, I wouldn't have been very good at it. We've come a long way together.\"\n\nInstead, he shared a quick hug and kiss with his son when Beau collected his diploma on stage before the procession continued.\n\nAfter a high-risk surgery for a life-threatening brain aneurysm in February 1988 and suffering from a serious pulmonary embolism complication, Biden stayed out of the public eye as he recovered.\n\nHis first public appearance came two months later when he sneaked into Archmere Academy's mock presidential debate to support 18-year-old Hunter's performance as the Rev. Jesse Jackson from a production booth. He was unseen by parents and participants that night. His own staff didn't know about the outing until they read about it in the newspaper.\n\nHis closeness to Delaware and his family could also be used as a political weapon.\n\nDuring his 1990 campaign against former Delaware Attorney General and Superior Court Judge M. Jane Brady, she accused Biden of being part of bureaucratic Congress and \"out of touch\" with the state at a voter forum.\n\nBut Biden earned applause from the 300-person crowd - many of whom were wearing \"Joe\" campaign stickers on their chest - when he countered by asking how he could be out of touch if he took the train home from Washington every night, lives in Delaware, shops in Delaware and sends his children to school in Delaware.\n\nHis medical setbacks in early 1988, less than five months after dropping out of his first presidential run amid the plagiarism charges, had the effect of calming the hard-charging Biden, leaving him more subdued and philosophical, even serene, as he described himself at the time.\n\nAfter recovery, he told the Washington Post he understood how he could have come off as a \"hothead.\" At the very start of his Senate career, he once rattled off terms used to describe himself, some of which came from his political enemies: \"brash,\" \"glamor boy,\" glib-tongued\" and \"arrogant\" were some of them.\n\nSometimes, those characterizations came to life in front of television cameras.\n\nJust days before he dropped out, Biden squared off with a voter questioning his aptitude.\n\nThe voter quizzed him about his law school career and Biden shot back, \"I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,\" before adding, \"I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you'd like,\" and rattling off a steady stream of his academic accomplishments.\n\nThe voter responded by saying, \"I'm not questioning your IQ. I'm just saying that with the people that we have elected to office in recent years, I think that we have to question their credentials very solidly.\"\n\nMore than four years earlier, a voter was on the receiving end of a testy exchange with Biden in front of visiting PBS cameras, this time at a town meeting on the home turf of his alma mater Archmere Academy.\n\nBiden was questioned about calling fighting forces in El Salvador \"rightists and leftists.\"\n\n\"Since you're so damn well informed, let me answer your question,\" Biden spat at his critic. The voter fought back: \"What do you mean I'm so damn well informed? You guys like it when someone isn't informed. Look, I pay your salary senator ....\"\n\nFor every angry confrontation, there are thousands of moments where Biden used his equally natural charm on voters.\n\nWhen Biden is out living his life in Delaware, he is a selfie magnet. He seems to stop for anyone, anywhere. That's why many Delawareans seem to have a selfie with Biden somewhere, whether it's in a photo folder on Facebook or framed in their home.\n\nHis genial, outgoing nature is on display during local coffee runs, but also when it matters most.\n\nSeaford-born 21-year-old U.S. Marine Michael A. \"Moke\" Hastings was killed in a bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 240 other U.S. military personnel 35 years ago when Biden was a senator.\n\nIn a News Journal letter to the editor published more than a year after the bombing, the Hastings family wrote about the help Biden and his staff gave in the aftermath of his death. They noted other politicians had called and offered long-term help, but never left a phone number. Biden left several to make sure they could always reach him.\n\n\"Sen. Biden took the time to come to Seaford for our son's funeral, but it didn't stop there,\" they wrote. \"He has called several times since to ask how we were doing. A friend in need is a friend, indeed, and we'll never forget his acts of kindness.\"\n\nBiden's ability to help others during times of grief can be traced back to 1972 when about 650 people attended the December memorial service at St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church off Concord Pike in Talleyville for his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi. Biden showed up unexpectedly and comforted mourners.\n\nMore than 40 years later, he again would do the same for the thousands who waited hours in a more than two-block-long procession at Wilmington's St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church to pay their respects to Neilia and Joe's oldest son, Beau Biden, who died of cancer in 2015 at age 46.\n\nThe plagiarism kerfuffle during his first presidential campaign in 1987 left Biden somewhat abashed after he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"It's a humbling experience,\" he said several months later. \"But I deserve to be humbled. ... I made serious mistakes and I made stupid mistakes.\"\n\nIt also opened the floodgates to national ridicule for Biden. And local opponents thought it would stick, finally giving them an angle at taking down the swaggering wunderkind. It never did.\n\nAt the time, his 1984 senate challenger John Burris said, \"His magic, his invisible shield has been pulled away ... that almost invisible bubble has been popped. [The credibility question] didn't stick in 1984. Next time around it will.\"\n\nEven in hindsight, you can't fault them for believing the future U.S. president could have been mortally wounded politically. He was a walking, talking punchline - pantsed on the national stage.\n\nLate-night talk show hosts fed off on the scandal, as they continued to do after he ascended to the vice presidency and presidency, more focused on his uncanny ability to talk his way into gaffes.\n\nOn \"The Tonight Show,\" Johnny Carson joked, \"Joe Biden called his staff together and said the whole plagiarism issue is nothing to worry about. There's nothing to fear, but fear itself, he said.\"\n\nDavid Letterman also chimed in on \"Late Night,\" joking that Biden's new campaign slogan was \"Kennedy '68.\"\n\nEven two years later, a 1990 episode of the family sitcom \"Growing Pains\" starring Alan Thicke and Kirk Cameron took a jab. A character sold his sister's term papers to fellow students at school. When the principal found out, he told their parents and before reading one of the copied papers, he said, \"And just listen to this one that Joey Biden turned in!\"\n\nNewsweek even used his name as a synonym for plagiarism - \"committing a Biden.\"\n\nAs someone as prideful as Biden - \"I give you my word as a Biden,\" as he often says - seeing his name mutate into a cause for mockery in front of the world must have been jarring; a real shot to his healthily-sized ego. But for a man sometimes known for his braggadocio, he didn't let it show for long.\n\nWhen reporters asked if he was politically hurt, Biden responded, \"My feeling is not at all,\" before launching into one of his famous anecdotes.\n\nHe recalled entering the men's room of an Italian restaurant a month after his campaign ended in disaster and was met with a standing ovation when he left.\n\n\"You can't be a major leader without taking some very hard knocks,\" he declared.\n\nOne of the hardest for President Biden came during a late July weekend this past summer at his Rehoboth Beach home as he grappled with the idea that polls, donors, and voters had lost confidence in the nominee and felt that at age 81, Biden was too old to win a second term.\n\nOn July 20, Judge Jane Roth, the wife of Biden's longtime Delaware colleague, the late Sen. Bill Roth, shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal that Biden's situation seemed to mirror her husband's heart-breaking reelection loss in 2000 to Tom Carper.\n\n\"I have witnessed the grief of a politician, one with a long record of significant accomplishments when he loses the support of the people,\" Judge Roth wrote in an opinion piece. \"Bill thought he would win despite his age and his health problems. The reality was that the voters wanted a younger representative with new ideas and new energy. For Bill, it was a very sad ending to his 30 years in the Senate. I think he never got over it. As his spouse, I believe he would have been happier if he had bowed out. His remaining years would not have been touched with a sense of loss but instead with one of accomplishment.\"\n\nOne day later, on July 21, Biden once again made political history when he decided to bow out of the race.\n\nHow Biden will be remembered remains to be seen.\n\nIn the closing days of his administration last month, he spoke of his legacy at a holiday reception at the White House in broad strokes.\n\n\"The one thing I always believed about public service, especially about the presidency, is the importance of asking yourself, 'Have we left the country in better shape than we found it?'\" he said. \"Today I can say with every fiber of my being and all my heart that the answer to that question is a resounding yes.\"\n\nThat reflective moment came more than 51 years after he spoke about legacy at a Hotel du Pont dinner honoring the man Biden had just beat for the senate seat: his two-term Republican predecessor and former Delaware Gov. J. Caleb Boggs.\n\nIn the speech, a young Biden laid out what he hoped for himself when his time as a public servant came to an end, without knowing it would be five decades later when he walked out of the White House for the last time as our nation's 46th president.\n\n\"I hope I will live to have what Cale Boggs has today: an unblemished reputation for integrity.\"\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com or 302-324-2861 and follow her on X (Twitter) @pattytalorico .

      "text": "Letters to Joe: Messages, words of wisdom and thanks as Biden leaves the White House\n\nAs Joe Biden exits the White House, we asked those who know him, have worked with him and even a few folks who are also in the national spotlight and from Delaware, to share their memories, well-wishes and send-off messages to the outgoing president.\n\nHere's what they had to say.\n\nI met Joe Biden when I was sixteen years old at the Joe Biden youth leadership conference in Delaware. I was so excited to be chosen to represent my high school and get to voice my opinions about local issues and policies. I'll never forget Joe delivering the closing speech in the auditorium - his face getting all red because he was so impassioned. I can't remember the topic of the speech, but I knew he meant every word he was saying up there! It was fiery and we all loved it.\n\nYears later, when I was cast on \"Parks and Recreation,\" I had the privilege of working with Joe and Jill. We got a tour of the vice president's office and I found a note on Joe's desk that had my name on it and some facts about where we had met in Delaware. I felt so special that he remembered we had a history. In true April Ludgate style, I pocketed the note. Mike Schur [the creator of \"Parks and Recreation\"] was very concerned I'd get in trouble. It was the White House after all. You can't steal from the White House! Turns out you can.\n\nSome more years later, I was asked to host \"Saturday Night Live.\" A dream come true. I pitched an idea to Lorne Michaels to have Joe (who was the sitting president at that time) do a little bit in my monologue. Lorne seemed skeptical, but he let me pursue it. I was hoping that Joe would remember me enough to want to participate. But I wasn't sure I could pull it off. Not only did he say yes -- he left a heartwarming voicemail on my phone after he filmed his bit.\n\nHe said on the message, \"Hey kid, it's Ashley Bidens dad...,\" and it made me laugh. Even as the sitting president, he was still the same guy. A total sweetheart.\n\nAubrey Plaza is an actor, comedian and Ursuline Academy graduate.\n\nI am not a very political person, but I can certainly recognize the importance of hard work and bringing pride to the country you represent.\n\nI want to thank President Biden and Dr. Biden for their contributions to our country, to our futures and for keeping us safe.\n\nAs a Delawarean, I hope that President Biden's legacy will be a message to all young people that even if you're from a little state, you can dream big.\n\nJohnny Weir is a retired figure skater and American commentator who calls Delaware home.\n\nMr. President,\n\nLike virtually every Delawarean, we could tell too many stories about your impact on our lives. Jobs that represented transformative beginnings; celebrations of births and support after deaths; conversations about the meaning of service and citizenship, about family, friendship... and football.\n\nThroughout those personal stories, there are themes that, to us, have also defined your public leadership.\n\nStarting in 1972, always with respect for those who came before, you gave us faith that our then-young voices mattered - to you and to the country. We felt that message on a personal level, at the same time recognizing that it was for all who had not been heard or seen enough in the halls of power. And you said, and showed, that honoring the dignity of each of us could strengthen the community of all of us.\n\nYou've called on us, at every phase, \"to remember who we are,\" toward upholding both our individual integrity and our shared identity as Americans. You've embodied the confidence that our ideals are not just about a world that should be; they are also essential to getting things done in the world that is. What we say we value - as you defined it, \"opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, service, and truth\" - are not just ideas; they must be action items, in the world of policy and in how we treat one another.\n\nAs one of the writers you quote most - \"not because they are Irish but because they are the best\" - Seamus Heaney once said of poetry, you have touched \"the base of our sympathetic nature while taking in at the same time the unsympathetic nature of the world.\" You've lived that paired reality of courage and vulnerability, often to our amazement, finding in too much heartbreak a renewed inspiration to serve.\n\nSo your leadership, like your friendship, is chronicled not only in what has been done - remarkable in itself - but also in what has been felt, an honesty of the heart that your neighbors and fellow Americans could always trust. Like the care and compassion of your personal connections, the public faith you've preached - \"possibility\" - has been more persuasive, and more practiced, because of that trust. True to the lesson of your Finnegan grandparents, you haven't just kept the faith, you've spread it.\n\nYou've often said that \"Delaware\" is written on your heart. As we welcome you and Jill back to where your heart is most at home, we wish for you and your family what you've always wished for all of us, that, \"He will raise you up on eagles' wings/Bear you on the breath of dawn/Make you to shine like the sun/And hold you in the palm of His hand.\"\n\nJohn Carney is the mayor of Wilmington and, most recently, former governor of Delaware. Former first spouse Tracey Quillen Carney worked on the staff of then-Sen. Joe Biden for 15 years.\n\nDear Joe,\n\nFifty-three years ago, my brother, Robbie Richards, invited my husband Bill and me to come to dinner to meet a young New Castle County Councilman who Robbie thought had a bright future. Bill and I were a little surprised because the young man was a Democrat, and we were all Republicans. But we went to dinner and met you, Joe, and your first wife, Neilia. The dinner was a success. The conversation was lively and we were impressed by both you and Neilia. Bill and I agreed that you would go far.\n\nWe were somewhat taken aback a year later when you ran for the other Senate seat against our good friend, the incumbent, Cale Boggs. In an upset. you beat Cale but Bill understood the reality of politics. Bill was sorry that Cale had lost but he was glad that he already knew his new colleague.\n\nThen Neilia and your daughter Naomi were tragically killed in an automobile accident. Your two sons, Beau and Hunter, were seriously injured. You were distraught. It was difficult for you to think of the future without Neilia and Naomi. Your family and friends, however, encouraged you to move forward with your Senate career. You decided that you would be sworn in as Senator in the hospital room where your sons were recovering. Bill and I attended this hospital room swearing-in. Your two little boys had an unparalleled view of this important step in their father's life. On this occasion, I witnessed your deep devotion to your family.\n\nThus began 28 years of Bill and you working together in the U.S. Senate to represent Delaware. To be with your family, you returned by train to Wilmington every evening and took the train back to Washington in the morning. Bill also often came back in the evening and returned the next day. You frequently took the same train. When you did, you often sat together. Both of you worked hard on the train, reading and writing. And, If you were sitting together and busy working, constituents would be less likely to interrupt you by stopping and chatting. You got a lot done by sitting together.\n\nOver the years, you and Bill, a Democrat and a Republican, learned what areas you both would support and where you did not agree on policy. With this understanding, you were very effective in representing the people of Delaware. When you could work together, you got a lot done. I also benefited personally from your being a Senator. When I was nominated to the U.S. District Court in 1985 and to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1991, Bill, as my spouse, couldn't very well present me to the Judiciary Committee for its approval. You stepped in and did so - and very enthusiastically. It meant a lot to me to have that bipartisan support.\n\nBill died in 2003 and then my daughter Katy died in 2014 after an extended illness. On both occasions, you gave me great support in my grief. At Katy's memorial service, you told me about the illness of your son, Beau. This was before there was public awareness of the gravity of Beau's condition. I could tell how stricken you were by Beau's illness. But you were also thinking of my situation. You could appreciate my grief while experiencing your own.\n\nI had strong Republican roots before becoming a judge, but as a constituent I have observed your dedication to your job and to the people you represent. I admire you for the many things you have done both for the State of Delaware and for the country. It's been wonderful to have had a President from Delaware - one who spoke as a statesman with world leaders, who funded infrastructure improvements throughout our country, and who was at the same time a consummate politician - indeed, here was a bright young man who went far. And I am very proud of our First Lady, Jill. She has been a superb wife for you.\n\nBut when I think of you, Joe. I think not of the Senator or Vice President or President. I think of the friend who is dedicated to his family and who understands grief -- not just his own, but mine as well. You have relieved my grief. You know grief's enduring nature but you have learned to live with it in order to maintain a life of service to others. This life of service is what you will be remembered for and why we are proud of you.\n\nJoe, that is what you mean to me.\n\nBest wishes to you, Jane Roth\n\nJane R. Roth is a senior judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit and wife of the late Bill Roth, a long-serving U.S. senator from Delaware. She currently resides in Washington, D.C.\n\nI was first introduced to Joe Biden when I was serving in the United States Navy. During one of my six-month deployments in Southeast Asia, the best days were when the mail came, bringing cards, care packages, newspapers, and magazines. Following the 1972 election, the issues of both Time and Newsweek included stories of a stunning upset in Delaware, where a 29-year-old upstart, Joe Biden, defeated Caleb Boggs, a Delaware icon. I remember thinking to myself, \"I'd like to meet that young guy someday if I ever make it to Delaware.\"\n\nAnd then, one day, after finishing my military obligation, I found myself enrolled in an MBA program at the University of Delaware and volunteering to help a beloved professor, Jim Soles, with his congressional campaign. I was new to Delaware, and miraculously, I was invited by Dr. Soles a month or two later to join in a strategy session at the home of none other than Delaware's young junior Senator, Joe Biden. He could not have been more gracious that day. After learning of my military service in Southeast Asia, he embraced me and welcomed me to Delaware, marking the beginning of a friendship that has lasted for 50 years.\n\nJoe Biden has a saying that \"all politics are personal.\" During the last five decades, those words have served both of us well. Making personal connections with people in Delaware - and around the world - has allowed him to attain the highest level of office, but still remember he is a public servant at the end of the day. Some people may think that Joe Biden is just a partisan and only likes to work with Democrats, but he can work with just about anyone. Early in his Senate career, he did that with people like Senator John Stennis (D-Miss.) and even Senator Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.). One might ask, how could a Democrat ever find common cause with any of those guys? But Joe Biden did, and he's been able to do the same thing in the years since then including his time as President.\n\nIt's his bipartisan approach that has largely paved the way for our country to make historic economic progress during his presidency. Over 16 million jobs have been created over the last four years, and in 2023 alone, a total of 2.7 million jobs were created, which is more jobs that any single year under the previous administration. That's more than the populations of Delaware, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Virginia combined! The improvement in inflation over the last year is the best story never told, with inflation now below 3 percent, the lowest level since April 2021.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is roaring back. The United States has made the most substantial investments in science, innovation, and industrial strategy in over 50 years, and more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs have been added across the country. Thanks to the historic investments in two landmark bills that I helped to author at the encouragement of Joe Biden who signed them into law - the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act - we have made a commitment to build a new clean energy economy which is creating good-paying jobs while helping to save our planet. And, thanks to the PACT Act, we expanded access to health care for more than 3.5 million Post-9/11 veterans, which has special meaning to Joe Biden, who fought for that bill in his son Beau's memory.\n\nJoe Biden is a man of his word and a person of unfailing integrity, and it is that commitment to doing what is right - not what is easy - that has earned him the respect of voters and world leaders alike. When challenged in his personal or professional life, he puts his country ahead of himself. He has proven that people can disagree without being disagreeable, and that we can compromise on policy without compromising our principles.\n\nFor over five decades, Joe Biden has been a principled leader and an even better friend. More importantly, though, he is a devoted husband, a loving father and grandfather, and a dedicated son and brother. It is those qualities that have helped make him an exceptional person and an excellent president.\n\nTom Carper is a former U.S. senator who represented Delaware for years.\n\nYou can't tell the story of modern Delaware politics without Joe Biden, but it's also true that you can't tell the story of Joe Biden without Delaware. Sure, Joe is understandably proud of his Scranton, Pennsylvania roots, but it's what he learned in Delaware that most shaped his approach to public service.\n\nAs I came up in Delaware politics, I often heard people speak of the \"Delaware Way.\" While it can mean different things to different people, the general idea is that folks work together to overcome their differences and find common ground. Joe took that Delaware Way to Washington, and that's an important part of what's made him so successful as a senator and vice president, and the most consequential president of my lifetime.\n\nWhen he made a focus on bipartisanship and working together a central theme of his primary campaign in 2020, Joe was at times dismissed as naively believing in a bygone era. Once Joe won, he began proving the naysayers wrong, building bipartisan majorities in Congress to pass transformative legislation to invest in America's infrastructure, re-shore advanced manufacturing, fulfill our sacred obligation to veterans, protect communities from gun violence, and invest in community mental health.\n\nHe did all that by bringing people together, not by tearing us apart. He led on the national stage by staying true to his Delaware roots.\n\nIt's not just Delaware's political civility that shaped Joe, however. No matter where he goes, he is always Joe from Claymont, son of a hardworking car salesman who valued the dignity of work as much as a paycheck. Coupled with his mother's \"American creed\" - that \"no one is better than you. You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to you\" - Joe has never stopped believing in the remarkable possibilities that America offers and the importance of treating people with respect.\n\nIt's a promise grounded in the values strengthened by the nuns at St. Helena's and Holy Rosary, who stressed the importance of \"decency, fair play, and virtue.\" Joe's early parochial education, followed by his four years at Archmere, bolstered his Catholic faith and a belief in the obligations we all have to each other. The nuns taught their students that \"it was noble to intervene,\" as Joe recalled in his memoir, emphasizing above all the broader lesson of John 15:13: \"No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.\"\n\nYou can draw a direct line from Joe's Catholic education to his decision to take a lifeguarding job at a majority Black swimming pool in Wilmington as a 19-year-old during the Civil Rights Movement. Joe knew very little about the Black experience in Delaware, a segregated state at the time, but he was determined to change that by listening to his peers at Prices Run public swimming pool. There, Joe met lifelong friends like Richard \"Mouse\" Smith and Maurice Pritchett, who - between swimming laps and playing late-night basketball games - explained the challenges they faced as young Black men in 1960s America. Joe took his new friends' messages seriously. As Pritchett recounted, \"Biden, you could see it in his eyes, he wanted to know about us.\" Pritchett and Smith described the repeated indignities - what Joe later termed the \"dozen small cuts a day\" - that left them hurt and angry.\n\nThose stories resonated with Joe. After all, one of Joe's defining values is that he hates bullies; hates it when people misuse power and refuse to give others a fair shake. It's what's driven him to do more to counter racial inequality than any president in 50 years: funding HBCUs at record levels; appointing an historically diverse slate of federal judges to the bench, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on our nation's highest court; and creating economic opportunity for Black Americans by emphasizing underserved communities and Black homeownership, among many other priorities.\n\nThis is the man who served as the loyal No. 2 to our nation's first Black president, Barack Obama, and who chose Kamala Harris as his running mate in 2020, leading her to become the first Black vice president (and then solidly endorsed Harris for president after ending his own campaign this summer). Once confronted with the inequality and indignities imposed on Delawareans by decades of racial segregation, the values of his faith and his family made Joe a lifelong advocate for racial equality.\n\nOnce again, it all comes back to Delaware. Just as Joe did, every night as a senator. He took the Amtrak train north so he could be home for his two young sons after the death of their mother and sister. What started in tragedy soon bonded him even further to our state and the people he represented, because no matter what, Joe was there. He always showed up when we needed him, just as he did for his sons.\n\nAs Delawareans, we've gotten used to an outsized influence because of Joe. From Wilmington to Dover to Georgetown, we've benefited from his presence in our lives. That will change this month when he leaves office and comes home. What won't change, however, is what he gave our state, and what our state gave him. I know I speak for many Delawareans when I say, thank you, Joe, for taking us to heights we've never reached before. Thank you, Joe, for being one of us, and showing the rest of America what it means to be a Delawarean.\n\nChris Coons is a U.S. senator from Delaware.\n\nDear President Biden,\n\nI write this letter not as your constituent of nearly 50 years, nor as Delaware's former Secretary of Labor and Congresswoman, or our new United States Senator. Today, I write to you as a first-time grandmother on behalf of my beautiful granddaughter, Lennox. Lately, I've been reflecting on your presidency, and how I will describe your legacy to her. Three words immediately come to mind: progress, compassion and promise.\n\nThe first word is progress . You entered office amid a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. At the time, our country had lost over 400,000 Americans to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment was at 6%. We had to get our nation back on track - and you rose to the occasion. Working with Congress, you signed the American Rescue Plan Act into law to help us recover, rebuild, and restore. From life-saving vaccines to the reopening of our schools and businesses safely, your leadership in this turbulent time was consequential. We expanded the Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty in half. We revived our economy.  As President, you ushered in an era of unprecedented legislative progress, while bringing our allies together, and I am proud to have worked alongside you in accomplishing these historic wins for Delaware and the nation.\n\nHistory will show that working with Democrats and Republicans, you accomplished things that had only been talked about for decades. The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making transformational investments in our nation's roads, bridges, highways, ports, and rail, while expanding broadband internet to millions of Americans. By reaching across the aisle, you helped us keep our sacred obligation to our veterans by signing the Honoring Our PACT Act into law, which marked the largest expansion of VA benefits since the G.I. Bill. You fought for safer communities by signing into law the most comprehensive action ever taken to address gun violence, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act . And working with Democrats in the House and Senate, you championed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower the cost of health care and prescription drug costs for seniors and make the largest investment in fighting the climate crisis in our nation's history. The impact your leadership will have on communities at home and abroad will undoubtedly be felt across generations. Simply put, you're leaving office as the most accomplished president in modern history.\n\nThe second word is compassion . When our country was at a crossroads after witnessing the horrific attack in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, and later the murder of George Floyd, you stepped up to bring back compassion at a time when our nation needed it most.\n\nAnd for me, and countless others, you've been a compassionate friend and mentor. In 2014, when my husband suddenly and unexpectedly passed away; years later when my sister suffered a stroke; and most recently when my father, the late Ted Blunt, received the diagnosis of cancer and six months later left this earth - you were there. Even as I sought wisdom in my run for the Senate, you were there. It's a generosity that I hope you know is appreciated and will always be reciprocated. And despite tremendous personal loss throughout your own life, including the passing of your late son, Beau, you've continued to show us as individuals and as a country how to \"keep the faith\" in the face of adversity. That's because your North Star - your devotion to your state and nation - has never wavered.\n\nThe final word is promise . What you have brought with you from position to position has been a commitment to the promise of a better and brighter future for all Americans. The promise of a future where our schools, movie theaters, places of worship, and grocery stores are free from gun violence. The promise of a future where all Americans have access to quality and affordable health care, childcare, and housing opportunities. The promise of a future where our democracy is protected and not diminished. The promise of a future where access to clean drinking water isn't just a privilege but a basic human right. The promise of a nation where freedom, justice, and equality are the basis for everything we do. Thank you for all you've done to show us this future is achievable - if we're willing to work for it.\n\nMr. President, as you have often said, family is the beginning, middle, and the end so I would be remiss if I did not mention your other half, Dr. Jill Biden, and the unconditional love, strength, and support of your family. To the Bidens - thank you for being an anchor for the President and for sharing him with us.\n\nThough my granddaughter is too young to read or write, she will grow up hearing of your decades of impactful service, your steadfast leadership, your deep compassion, your unwavering friendship, and your unshakeable optimism for the \"possibilities\" of America. The example you have set will inspire Lennox and future generations to lead with integrity, honor, and decency - not just in word but in deed. Thank you for your service to our state, our nation, and our future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nU.S. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester is one of Delaware's two U.S. senators, as well as the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to ever represent the First State in that chamber.\n\nPresident Biden,\n\nI'm honored to join thousands of our neighbors in thanking you for a lifetime of service to us, our state, and our country.\n\nYou are the definition of a true patriot, and you have led the most accomplished administration we've seen in my lifetime. Under your leadership, we have historic employment across the country, we've made critical investments in addressing climate change and we've bolstered economic opportunity for millions of Americans.\n\nBut I've been lucky to see you champion working families, and equity over my whole life - as my Senator, Vice President, and over the last three and a half years as President. In that time, you have proven that we can do big things together that make a real difference in the lives of Americans, from Wilmington to Scranton and beyond - and through it all, you have shown how decent, kind, and selfless you are.\n\nNearly 250 years ago, Delaware became the first state to sign on to the journey that is America. In the centuries since our small state has come to realize that the promise of our Constitution is only possible when we respect our differences and resolve our disagreements through conversation and collaboration. Through the power of our proximity here in this state, we have come to see our fellow citizens as neighbors with shared hopes and a common destiny. We know that the divisions and nastiness that we too often see nationally must not - and does not have to - be our new normal. That a different kind of politics is possible: a politics of hope, not of hate; of grace, not of grievance; of progress, not of pettiness.\n\nThis is the legacy you leave us with, as Delawareans and as Americans. It is a legacy that we are all called to honor especially now.\n\nMy heart is full of love for you, Jill, and the entire Biden family. Whenever I think of your legacy I am filled with love and adoration for Beau - who taught me that there is no better quality in a public servant than authenticity. Beau was always the same sweet, kind, and generous man behind closed doors as he was in front of a crowd. I count myself lucky to have gotten to know you through the eyes of your son, Beau.\n\nWhen I won my race for Congress this fall, you called me to say that you got a message from heaven from Beau: \"Beau's looking down from heaven, congratulating you.\" I'll always remember that call from you. Mr. President, I know that today and every day Beau is proud of you.\n\nAt this moment in America's journey, hope sometimes feels hard to come by, your legacy reminds us that we must never forget that we are the beneficiaries of seemingly impossible change becoming a reality; that it's always been in our country's most significant challenges that we take our biggest steps forward. Because no matter what obstacles stand in our way, so long as we breathe, we hope - and, together, we can once again turn that hope into historic progress.\n\nIt's easy to be cynical but you, Mr. President, have never done that - you have shown us that in facing the most impossible of circumstances, we always have the propensity to take our biggest steps forward. Now more than ever, we need to channel that hope and determination to build on the work you have accomplished.\n\nMr. President, yes, you showed me how to be a good public servant and how to serve our state with integrity, grit, and decency. More than that, you showed me how to summon courage and hope after tremendous personal loss. That is a gift that I will always treasure.\n\nIt's only fitting that I'm writing this letter on the Amtrak. Mr. President, welcome home. You will always be my idol.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCongresswoman Sarah McBride\n\nRep. Sarah McBride is Delaware's sole congresswoman beginning this year, as well as the first openly transgender politician ever elected to those halls.\n\nDear Mr. President,\n\nA simple truth: YOU ARE THE BEST. Mr. President, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., you are the best person, president, and public servant I have ever had the great good fortune of knowing and serving. So many people can and will say the same. So, let me be more specific about the difference you have made in my life and have enabled me to make in the lives of others, thanks to the trust you placed in me.\n\nServing as U.S. Ambassador to Germany and representing you and your Administration overseas has been the greatest honor of my life. I could not be prouder of the work we have done to defend democracy and to advance all our shared values and interests with Germany.  Germany is now a stronger partner than ever with the U.S, thanks to your global leadership.\n\nI know the important role your father played in your life, and I could not be more grateful to you for enabling me to pay the greatest possible tribute to my father. As the daughter of Kurt Gutmann, who fled Nazi Germany in 1934, I could never have imagined that I would go on to serve as your envoy to his home country one generation later.\n\nThat day I received your unexpected call informing me of your intention to nominate me as Ambassador, I felt so many emotions, but the one that has stuck with me most is gratitude. I am grateful to call you a friend and to have had the privilege and pleasure of getting to know you over the past twenty years. I am deeply grateful for your public service over half a century and for the unsurpassed good that you have accomplished in your Presidency for the nation, and the world.\n\nWhen we first discussed the idea of your joining the University of Pennsylvania after your Vice Presidency, I could not have imagined in that moment that you would go on to run for President again. When you decided not to run in 2015 after the passing of your beloved Beau, you were so focused on all that you would go on to do after leaving office.  Among so many other things, you launched the Cancer Moonshot initiative, and your focus was inspiring young people. You certainly did that, and I literally was by your side in observing how much you taught-and inspired-our students. You brought such a depth and richness of experience, insight, and wisdom to our campus in that time.\n\nIt has always been important for universities to bring leaders from across the political spectrum to engage with students, and you engaged with your unsurpassed and irresistible passion. Penn students benefited enormously from your unique vision. Everyone loves to talk about their memorable interactions with you as Professor Biden. What I said at the time bears repeating because it shows what an amazing and unique President you are:\n\nEvery time Joe Biden...visited campus, he brought forth endless expertise on a wide variety of topics-from international affairs and domestic politics to immigration policy and cancer research, and so much more... His unmatched personal connections with global leaders made our mission to bring the world to Penn and Penn to the world even stronger.\n\nI saw firsthand how valuable these personal relationships are to diplomacy, from Oval Office meetings with Chancellor Scholz, to your recent October visit to Berlin where President Steinmeier presented you with the Order of Merit at the highest level- Germany's highest tribute - for your commitment to the transatlantic alliance since your days in the Senate.\n\nYears before I had ever attended a Munich Security Conference (MSC), you shared your passion for this global convening with me - a forum that embodies how meaningful effective person-to-person diplomacy can be. The beginning of my Ambassadorship was marked by rushing to attend my first MSC just days before Russia's unprovoked, brutal reinvasion of Ukraine. We lost no time in urging Germany and our other allies to be prepared to stand with us in supporting Ukraine. It was not lost on me how serious our work was and continues to be. Your leadership made it possible for Ukraine to resist Putin's aggression.\n\nOver the years, we have discussed our shared passions for democracy and education, collaborative medical research, and creating job opportunities for the middle class. You always took a keen interest in my perspective, as a scholar of democracy and as the first person in my family to attend college. When I was Chair of President Obama's Commission on the Study of Bioethical Issues, I saw your integrity and commitment to improving the lives of Americans firsthand. There is no greater honor and privilege that I could have imagined in my life than to work with you, and now call you a friend. I have learned so much from your principled leadership, decency, and vision. Thank you for this. Thank you for being the best - and a mensch!\n\nWith gratitude,\n\nAmy Gutmann\n\nAmy Gutmann is the Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Political Science, School of Arts and Sciences, and professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication. She is also a Penn president emerita and a retired U.S. ambassador to Germany.\n\nFor more than three years, I've been fortunate to serve as chairman of President Joe Biden's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nAfter much reflection, I am resigning that position on Monday, full of gratitude for President Biden's tremendous record of service, and proud of what we've accomplished together.\n\nHere's the truth: no president in U.S. history has done more to support HBCUs than Joe Biden.\n\nWhile many have suggested they understand the importance of America's HBCUs, the Biden/Harris administration's actions can be summed up this way:\n\n\"Deeds; not words.\"\n\nSince their election in 2020, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have invested $20 billion in our country's HBCUs.\n\nThat includes nearly $4 billion through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief legislation to help HBCUs support students' ability to meet basic needs and maintain campus operations; $2.6 billion from the U.S. Department of Education to support the growth and sustainability of HBCU degree programs; more than $1.6 billion through federal grants, cooperative agreements, and other competitive funding opportunities to drive academic and training programs; and almost $950 million to support HBCUs in growing research capacity and infrastructure.\n\nBiden and Harris made these investments because they understand the unmistakable value of America's HBCUs.\n\nAcross the country - despite representing only a small fraction of higher education institutions - HBCUs educate twice as many students who are low-income and Pell eligible as non-HBCUs.\n\nAnd they do so with incredible success.\n\nIn addition to generating nearly $16 billion in direct economic impact, HBCUs still produce 80% of Black judges, 25% of Black science professionals, 70% of Black dentists and physicians, and 40% of Black members of Congress. And the return-on-investment for HBCUs is not just financial. On every indicator of well-being, Black students attending HBCUs students fare better than similarly situated students at Predominantly White Institutions, or PWIs.\n\nBiden's decisions to invest in America's HBCUs will have a significant impact on generations of students who attend these institutions, the faculty and staff who pour their whole hearts into providing HBCU educations, and the families who sacrifice so much in favor of boundless futures for their children.\n\nWe know Joe Biden in Delaware. So we're not surprised by his commitment to service. But his work as president has been singular in its commitment, and will be forever remembered by a grateful set of American citizens who will continue to achieve in every field of human endeavor.\n\n\"Deeds; not words.\"\n\nIn four years, Biden's deeds are unprecedented: tangible artifacts - demonstrable symbols - of an incomparable legacy.\n\nTony Allen is president of Delaware State University and chairman emeritus of the President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\n(This piece was updated with three letters.)"

      "text": "'View' hosts clash over Democrats hiding Biden's decline as one says it's 'why people want to be independents'\n\nManage your account\n\nCo-hosts of \"The View\" argued Friday over how the Democratic Party should look back at how they alienated voters by covering up then-President Joe Biden's decline.\n\nMonths after President Donald Trump won again, Democrats are still trying to understand how their party lost the presidential election. Biden's administration was dogged by questions about his mental acuity and now more revelations are coming out about how his defenders turned a blind eye to his decline or condemned those who questioned his ability to serve.\n\n\"The 2024 presidential campaign was even more of a mess for Democrats than we even saw,\" co-host Joy Behar said, noting that multiple books are reporting inside information about the Biden presidency and campaign.\n\nEven so, Behar argued, \"We have to take a lot of this, I think, with a bit of a grain of salt. I mean, if any of this is true, what can Democrats do about it now? I mean, it seems to me this ship has sailed, what's the point?\"\n\nBiden Insider Expresses How White House 'Gaslit' The Public About Former President's Decline\n\nCo-host Alyssa Farah Griffin argued that Biden, despite the fact he stepped down, was instrumental in the Democratic Party's defeat.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\n\"We're in a moment we're in where a lot of people are scared, they're nervous. They're worried that we're seeing America fundamentally changed. And a reason for that, not just a little asterisk, is that Joe Biden did not win, did not step aside in time to allow someone else to win, and I do think it is a story that warrants some reflection,\" she said.\n\nGriffin went on to argue that Biden let himself be carried away by his ego and compared him to Trump.\n\n\"People always think I'm so critical just because I think he needed to step aside and give someone else a chance. He does start to come off, the more we're learning, like, 'I alone can fix it.' It almost comes off Trumpy,\" she said, going on to argue that if Biden had stepped down sooner, his Democratic successor could have had a better chance at winning the election.\n\nCo-host Sara Haines offered another major takeaway: \"Listen to the voters.\"\n\n\"One thing that really pissed me off as an independent, and I was one of the people that sat here and said after seeing President Biden - I voted for Biden, I really liked Biden, I actually have been happy with him, and I would have voted for him if he continued to run - but I did look at him and think, 'I think maybe you do need to step aside,' and now the rumors that we're hearing [are] starting to make sense.\"\n\nThe immediate response to questioning Biden's acuity was swift and angry, she recalled.\n\n\"What happened is everyone said, 'You're disloyal if you say that, shut up and fall in line,' and that's why people want to be independents these days, because partisan politics, they lie,\" Haines said. \"It was the Democratic Party that made that choice, that said, 'You're betraying him if you call it like you see it,' and the point here was is he wasn't necessarily fit to run for another four years.\"\n\nAna Navarro disagreed, instead echoing Behar and co-host Sunny Hostin's lack of interest in a postmortem analysis of the Democratic Party's efforts in the election.\n\n\"Usually I like these books, usually I like campaign gossip of 'Primary Colors' after Clinton or, oh, after Obama or 'Game Change' after McCain, but these are not normal times,\" she said. \"So I'm just not interested in palace gossip from a year and a half ago.\"\n\nShe went on to offer a laundry list of problems she'd rather focus on with the current Trump administration.\n\n\"Two things can be true at once,\" Haines replied. \"You can despise Trump and everything the Republicans stand for, and still be able to see straight about what happened here. And denying it and telling people, 'You're not seeing what you're seeing,' is never going to win voters, ever!\"\n\nOriginal article source: 'View' hosts clash over Democrats hiding Biden's decline as one says it's 'why people want to be independents'"

      "text": "Republicans Get Disgraced Doctor to Probe Biden's Mental State\n\nManage your account\n\nTexas GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson said a House panel will probe whether former White House doctor Kevin O'Connor concealed former President Joe Biden's mental decline.\n\nJackson, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee's subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, told the New York Post in a story published Friday that the GOP \"will look into whether or not we actually had a shadow presidency for a large part of [Biden's] term\" and that O'Connor \"will absolutely, positively be implicated in the cover-up of this. He is a massive, massive part.\"\n\n\"He was probably putting President Biden on lots of medications that we have no clue of-in efforts to try to treat his cognitive decline,\" he alleged. The subcommittee has yet to formally announce any investigation.\n\nJackson is a physician who served in the White House Medical Unit under former Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump before he was elected to Congress in 2020. In 2021, a report by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General stated that Jackson had \"engaged in inappropriate conduct involving the use of alcohol\" on two presidential trips, and \"made sexual and denigrating statements about one of his female medical subordinates to another of his subordinates.\"\n\nJackson alleged O'Connor, whom he said he's known for a long time, \"would do or say anything to cover up and protect [the Biden family], regardless of what it meant professionally.\"\n\nBiden, the oldest president in U.S. history when he left office at 82, faced growing questions about his fitness for office as his term wore on. O'Connor wrote in a February 2024 memo that the president \"continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.\"\n\nBy avoiding sit-down interviews and large press conferences , the president's apparent mental decline only became apparent during his catastrophic performance in the televised debate with Trump last June. He relinquished the Democratic nomination to former Vice President Kamala Harris on July 21.\n\nThe move spurred Republicans to question whether his team had concealed signs of his supposed mental decline and were doing the president's job for him.\n\nIn July, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for White House aides, including O'Connor, to discuss Biden's cognitive state, but it is not clear whether he responded to the voluntary request."

      "text": "Governor Tim Walz grilled on 'major mistake' of Biden seeking re-election\n\nManage your account\n\nGov. Tim Walz , D-Minn., was grilled by CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday about whether members of the Democratic Party needed to acknowledge that President Joe Biden wasn't up to running for re-election.\n\n\"Don't you think your party needs to acknowledge that President Biden was not up for the job of running for re-election, and that this was a major mistake?\" Tapper asked, as Walz argued that Biden made the decision to drop out . \"You all went along with the idea that he was up for it and he wasn't, and everybody saw it. And the country rejected it.\"\n\nWalz, who was Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 running mate, also told Tapper that the Democratic Party needed to do some soul-searching in the wake of their loss to President Donald Trump.\n\n\"History will tell us to go back on that. That very well could be the case, Jake. What I'm concerned about is learning from those lessons. I would hope we would never do it again, make a mistake, make sure we go through and get someone. But I don't know where it helps us going forward,\" Walz said, before pivoting to Trump.\n\nKamala Harris Was 'Very Annoyed' With Obama As She Sought His Endorsement, Book Reveals\n\nTapper also pressed Walz on Harris' recent remarks , during which she said, \"I'm not here to say I told you so,\" during a speech in California on Thursday.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\n\"What does 'I told you so' really mean here? I mean, people heard her message. They did not vote for her. She lost every battleground state. You yourself have criticized the Harris-Walz campaign for being too cautious. She may have told the American people, you know, she may have warned the American people, but she didn't do it compellingly enough to win,\" the CNN host said.\n\nWalz said he owned the loss and criticized himself for it. However, he said Harris tried to warn people of what Trump was planning to do.\n\n\"I do think the challenge for Democrats , and this is, I think, a structural problem that's going to take a lot more thinking. Why, with all of that out there, did they not think we were any better than that? And they didn't, and I'm very concerned with the folks who stayed home,\" he said, acknowledging that Trump did a good job identifying voters' anxieties.\n\nThe CNN host also asked about criticisms that the Democratic Party was gaslighting Americans about inflation, the border and Biden's fitness.\n\n\"And then, fundamentally, this idea that President Biden was up for another four years of the job while Americans in poll after poll, for year after year, were saying, 'He's too old to do the job,' your party stood against all of those things,\" Tapper said.\n\nWalz argued that Biden led the country out of the Covid-19 pandemic and that he did a good job, but that the Democratic Party failed to message correctly on issues such as immigration.\n\nOriginal article source: Governor Tim Walz grilled on 'major mistake' of Biden seeking re-election"

      "text": "Kamala Harris believes Biden is to blame for her loss, new book says\n\nManage your account\n\nFollowing a six-day vacation in Hawaii and after returning to Washington for her final month as vice president, Kamala Harris came to a counterintuitive conclusion about her 2024 presidential election loss: She just needed more time.\n\n\"She could have won, she told friends, if only the election was later in the calendar - or she got in earlier,\" writes Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes in \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" a new book chronicling last year's unorthodox presidential campaign. \"In other words, Joe Biden was to blame. If only he had not run.\"\n\nWhile former President Biden's unpopularity surely weighed on Harris' truncated 107-day candidacy, the idea that the Democratic ticket would've performed better with more time struck even some Harris allies as farcical.\n\nHarris enjoyed her best polling in the wake of August's Democratic National Convention, when she leaped ahead of Donald Trump in some polling due to the new burst of energy stemming from Biden's late departure from the race.\n\nThe more straightforward analysis, Allen and Parnes write, is that more time was not in Harris' favor.\n\n\"That is (expletive) bonkers,\" one Harris friend is quoted telling the authors. \"If Election Day was October first, we might have actually somehow pulled it off. Shorter was actually better, not longer.\"\n\nA Harris adviser said it wasn't time that was the campaign's problem, but rather ideas.\n\n\"I don't think we needed more time. We needed more sand,\" the adviser is quoted saying. \"We needed more substance. And she did not have more substance.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Harris did not respond to an inquiry seeking reaction to the book's account.\n\nAfter largely withdrawing from the public square since Trump was sworn into his second term, the former vice president appeared at a summit for Black women leaders in Dana Point, Calif., last week.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere,\" Harris told the audience.\n\nHarris is weighing a run for governor to succeed Gavin Newsom and Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair for her presidential run, told her she could wait a full year to decide on a 2026 campaign, according to the book.\n\nIf the 60-year-old Harris launches a run for governor, she would begin as the favorite, even as a crowded field awaits her decision. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaragiosa are among the declared contenders.\n\nBut if Harris chooses the gubernatorial contest, it means she's likely shut the door on pursuing the 2028 presidential race, which will be an open-seat contest without an incumbent. It's an option that would be significantly tougher given the scars from her 2024 loss.\n\nAllen and Parnes' book detail the significant early reservations Democrats had about Harris as a national candidate, even as these same operatives, donors and politicians wanted Biden to step aside.\n\nOf preferring Harris to Biden, one veteran Democratic operative is quoted saying, \"Well, at least she has a pulse.\"\n\nEven as pressure ramped up for Biden to exit the race, his own top aides mobilized a behind-the-scenes campaign to undercut Harris' potential.\n\n\"They were aggressively saying that we would wind up with the vice president and that would be a mistake,\" one Democratic donor said.\n\nWhile she was instrumental in orchestrating Biden's eventual ouster, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is also portrayed as being against Harris' candidacy from the outset.\n\n\"Pelosi didn't want Harris, didn't think the vice president would prevail in a competition for the nomination and didn't think she would beat Trump,\" the book says.\n\n\"She doesn't like Harris,\" one Pelosi confidant told the authors.\n\nOne surprising anecdote revealed in \"Fight\" is how Trump handled Harris' concession call the morning after the election.\n\n\"You gave me a run for my money,\" Trump told her, demonstrating a flash of grace to an opponent he consistently disparaged privately as well as publicly. \"You're tough. You ran a great campaign.\"\n\nNew book dishes on Trump's DeSantis obsession: \"Why doesn't he just wait until 2028?\""

      "text": "Breaking Down How Much Time Biden Spent on Vacation While President - It's Not 40%\n\nManage your account\n\nA claim popularized by the Republican National Committee that U.S. President Joe Biden spent 40% of his presidency on vacation stretched the truth. The RNC treated partial days outside of the White House as full days on vacation, made outright errors in its calculations and included locations which are not always used as vacation settings in its analysis.\n\nDue to the duties of the office, the president is never truly on vacation. Therefore, Snopes focused on determining how many days Biden spent in a vacation setting, which was about 117 or 118 full days, or about 8% of his presidency, depending on which source you use. Biden also spent an additional 66 partial days in a vacation setting.\n\nA White House spokesperson said Biden works \"every single day.\" His administration's research said Biden spent 60 total weekdays away from the White House with no public events, or about 4.5% of his presidency.\n\nMuch of a president's work schedule is private and not publicly reported. Snopes found 76 to 77 days where Biden spent some or all of his time in a vacation setting and there was no public evidence that he was working, or about 5% of his presidency.\n\nSnopes also determined that Biden spent an additional 109 full days at Camp David or his personal residence in Delaware -- where Biden often works away from the White House -- with no publicly reported events and15 days where the only public events involved campaigning for his re-election.\n\nIn the months after former U.S. President Joe Biden took office in 2021, a claim began circulating that Biden spent 40% of his presidency on vacation.\n\nExamples of this claim appear on Reddit ( archived ), X ( archived ) and Facebook ( archived ). Snopes received questions from readers about this claim as early as October 2021. There are media reports spanning from 2022 ( archived ) to 2024 ( archived ) repeating the rumor. In 2022, the New York Post ( archived ) claimed the rumor originated from a Republican National Committee analysis:\n\nThe 19-month tally of Biden trips was assembled by the RNC and is consistent with independent journalistic counts. It includes days that Biden spent at his Delaware residences as well as days at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, and trips to Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Kiawah Island, South Carolina.\n\nAdditionally, the Republican National Committee published press releases in early 2023 ( archived ) and early 2024 ( screenshot ) claiming Biden had, at those points in time, spent 40% of his presidency on vacation. The RNC also publicized the claim on X ( archived ) in 2024, along with a video of Biden on the beach:\n\nA comprehensive Snopes analysis of Biden's public calendar , research from his administration and pool reports - detailed daily dispatches from the White House press corps tracking Biden's movements - determined that the Republican National Committee stretched the truth. It is difficult to define what a \"vacation\" is for a president, given that the president is never away from his duties. Thus, Snopes determined how many days Biden was in a vacation setting.\n\nBased on this definition, Biden spent 117 or 118 full days of his 1,461-day presidency on vacation, or about 8% of his presidency. He also spent 66 days, about 4.5% of his presidency, partially in a vacation setting.\n\n(The pool reports say Biden left his vacation home early on April 13, 2024, whereas his official public calendar as published by Roll Call, an insider publication which covers all things Capitol Hill, said he spent April 13 in his vacation home and left on April 14, 2024. That would change how many full days Biden was on vacation, but it would not affect the number of partial days he was on vacation.)\n\nAltogether, that is 183 or 184 days - and on 107 of those days, there is public evidence Biden spent time working in his official capacity as president, which does not mean he was not working, as much of the president's working schedule is not public. Thus, there were 76 or 77 days where Biden spent time in a vacation setting with no public evidence he was working, or about 5% of his presidency.\n\nHere's what Jake Schneider, author of the two RNC press releases, said in an X direct message when Snopes asked how he determined that Biden spent 40% of his presidency on vacation:\n\nI'm happy to share my underlying data with you. Basically, we use the standard of all or part of any day spent at a Biden-style vacation destination (e.g., Wilmington/Rehoboth/Camp David/etc) as a vacation day - which is the exact same standard The Washington Post assigned to President Trump during his first term.\n\nSchneider did not return additional questions about what sources he used to figure out Biden's location and how he decided what a vacation setting was. The RNC press releases also provide images showing each day Biden was purportedly on vacation for 2021, 2022 and 2023.\n\nCalendars created by the Republican National Committee claiming to show when Biden was on vacation. (Republican National Committee/Snopes Illustration)\n\nBut an investigation by Snopes found that the RNC's analysis made sweeping assumptions and included outright errors.\n\nAs acknowledged by Schneider, the RNC included partial days in a vacation setting. However, the party's analysis failed to take into account how much or how little time in the day was spent traveling to or in a vacation setting.\n\nFor example, on September 3, 2021, the RNC calendar says Biden was on vacation. But according to Biden's public calendar, he spent most of that day in Louisiana touring Hurricane Ida relief efforts, meeting local leaders and delivering remarks in his official capacity as president. He does not leave Louisiana until 7:08 p.m. local time, or 8:08 p.m. EST, before arriving at his personal residence in Delaware at 11:11 p.m. In another example, the RNC claimed Biden was on vacation on Sept. 11, 2022, when he arrived at the Pentagon around 8:46 a.m. and spent most of the day at 9/11 remembrance events.\n\nThe RNC said Biden was on vacation on days when he arrived at the White House early in the morning or departed for a vacation setting late in the day. In one instance, the RNC said Biden was on vacation on April 22, 2022 when he was working and according to the pool report , did not arrive in Delaware until 12:24 a.m. the next day. In another instance, the RNC said he was on vacation on Sept. 13, 2022, when he left the White House to travel to Delaware and vote before returning to the White House, all on the same day.\n\nOn some days , Biden spent some time in Delaware visiting gravestones or attending private memorial services to commemorate deceased loved ones, such as his son or his first wife, and the RNC included them as \"vacation\" days.\n\nThe RNC also did not appear to have double-checked its work. On Aug. 13, 2022, for example, the RNC said Biden was on vacation, but according to his public calendar and the pool report , he was at the White House all day. On the flip side, the president left for Camp David on Aug. 17, 2023 , but the RNC does not note this. Errors like these occurred several times.\n\nFinally, the RNC analysis included days spent at Camp David or at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. According to the White House , Camp David, a Maryland country residence, \"has offered every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt an opportunity for solitude and tranquility, as well as an ideal place to work and host foreign dignitaries.\"\n\nThus, while sometimes used for recreation, presidents, including Biden, often work at Camp David, where he has reportedly met with his national security team, signed executive orders and hosted prime ministers.\n\nBiden spent many weekends as president at his residence in Wilmington, Delaware, a practice he's had since his time as a senator, according to both the White House and news reports. A White House official told Snopes that Biden does not treat his Wilmington residence as a vacation home.\n\nBased on Biden's public calendar and pool reports, Biden frequently works from Wilmington. On May 30, 2021, for example, he delivered remarks at Veterans Memorial Park in New Castle Country, Delaware; on Aug. 6, 2021 , he leaves the White House and arrives in Delaware before receiving his weekly economic briefing. He has hosted multiple foreign prime ministers at his Delaware home on the same day.\n\nFinally, Biden has a vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware that he frequents, suggesting that if Biden was to return to Delaware for vacation, he would go there instead.\n\nWhile Camp David and Wilmington are not always vacation settings, Snopes could not determine how often Biden may have treated them as such. Snopes found that Biden spent 109 full days in Delaware or Camp David with no evidence of work on his public calendar or in pool reports, or 7.5% of his presidency.\n\nHere are all of the vacation settings Snopes included in its analysis: Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden's annual Thanksgiving tradition where he and his family travel to Nantucket, Massachusetts, vacations in St. Croix, Virgin Islands, Kiawah Island Golf Resort in South Carolina, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and a friend's home in Santa Ynez, California.\n\nAndrew Bates, the Biden White House's deputy press secretary, said in an emailed statement that \"President Biden works hard every single day - including the few days he has been on vacation during his term - which is reflected in the most accomplished record of any modern administration.\"\n\nHe added that presidents \"have been able to perform all their duties from anywhere in the world for decades.\"\n\nAccording to an Aug. 19, 2024 pool report , Biden's press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when discussing his then-upcoming vacation to Santa Ynez, California, also said \"presidents are never on vacation - he's president wherever he is.\"\n\nThere is evidence that Biden works while on vacation. On June 3, 2022 , for example, he delivered remarks on a May jobs report from Rehoboth Beach Convention Center. There was also a weekend in September 2022 where he told the press pool he was at his Rehoboth home because the Secret Service was working on his Wilmington home and he was thus \"not on vacation.\"\n\nResearch presented by a White House official said there were 60 total weekdays from 2021 to 2024 where Biden \"had no public events and was not at the White House,\" or about 4.1% of his presidency. The Biden administration did not include weekends and federal holidays in its analysis and added that this list does not represent total days in vacation areas.\n\nIt is also worth noting that within those 60 weekdays, there were days the White House noted that Biden had public events not on his public calendar but noted in pool reports, such as briefings on foreign wars and bill signings. Snopes also cross-referenced this list with Biden's public calendar and discovered that the White House included days in which Biden had his \"Daily Briefing,\" an event that nearly always appears on weekdays on Biden's public calendar but is not open to the public.\n\nWhile the White House did not return multiple questions about whether, legally or officially, the president gets weekends and federal holidays off, it is true that presidents cannot fully disengage from their job. \"Most presidents are always on the clock; even when they are not working, they are on call, and can be pulled into discussions at a moment's notice,\" said Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University.\n\nIt is impossible for Snopes to determine how many days Biden was on vacation and did not do any work or primarily spent time away from work. According to Dallek, presidents do \"a ton of work\" not visible to the public or on their official public schedule, including \"behind-the-scenes conversations, briefings, reading memos, preparing for speeches, prepping for interviews and more.\"\n\n\"A president taking a vacation is a bit of misnomer, although some presidents take the job more seriously and work harder than others,\" Dallek added.\n\nTherefore, we can only determine how many days Biden was in a vacation setting, as well as days he was in a vacation setting and there is no public evidence, either from his public calendar or from pool reports, that Biden was working.\n\nMany of these \"working vacation\" days only included one or two publicly reported events and were usually noted in the pool report as information given by unnamed White House officials. Snopes did not include informal conversations Biden had with the press as work, given that it is nearly impossible for the president to avoid press in public areas.\n\nAs noted at the beginning, our analysis found 117 or 118 full days of his presidency on vacation and 76 days partially in a vacation setting, with 107 of the total 183 or 184 days showing evidence that Biden worked. There are 33 of these days where the public calendar does not show evidence Biden worked, but the pool reports say a White House official told a reporter that Biden was engaging in at least one work activity, such as a call with a foreign leader or a national security meeting.\n\nSnopes did not include days Biden traveled for work as well as days Biden was campaigning for other lawmakers and officials because campaigning for others is part of building and maintaining working relationships, as well as an attempt to ensure that your party remains in power and can pass its desired legislation more effectively.\n\nHowever, Snopes did determine how many days Biden campaigned for himself because some may consider that time away from presidential duties. There were 15 days Biden campaigned for himself and there were no events on his public calendar; 14 of those days did not have work events recorded by the press pool. For 62 days, Biden spent some time campaigning; 57 of those days were also spent working and five of those days were also spent in a vacation setting.\n\nBeven, J., Hagen, A. and Berg, R. (2021).

      "text": "Joe Biden Makes One Last Bad Decision\n\nManage your account\n\nIn issuing preemptive pardons for members of the Jan. 6 committee, former military leaders and government officials, and family members, now ex-President Joe Biden made one final terrible decision.\n\nBefore leaving the White House, Biden issued preemptive pardons for the members and staff of the Jan. 6 committee, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci, and the police officers who testified before the Jan. 6 committee. He also pardoned his brother James Biden and his wife, as well as his sister Valerie Biden Owens and her husband.\n\nNone of these people are under investigation for committing crimes, nor is there any evidence that they committed any crimes. These appear to be purely prophylactic pardons meant to protect these individuals from the threat of investigations launched by President Donald Trump, who had promised vengeance through investigation and prosecution against all of the pardoned individuals.\n\nThe Constitution grants the president with the power to pardon anyone of federal crimes, but it has almost never been used preemptively. The only true example of this is President Gerald Ford's pardon of President Richard Nixon for all potential crimes committed in connection with the Watergate break-in and its cover-up, for which there was overwhelming evidence of Nixon's involvement.\n\nBut Nixon did break the law, unlike the recipients of Biden's pardons. In the statement announcing the preemptive pardons, Biden notes that they should not be seen as an admission that any crime was committed, nor should their acceptance be seen as an admission of guilt.\n\nWhile these pardons may well save these people from months, if not years, of costly litigation for committing no crimes, they were a terrible idea. They create the appearance of corruption, even where none exists. To those marinating in the Trumpian conspiracy swamps, and even for those who do not closely follow politics, they look like a cover-up. Why pardon someone if they didn't do something wrong? In feeding the conspiracy, they affirm Trump's argument that politics is just an elite protection racket, so why shouldn't he get to do the same?\n\nTrump will no doubt use these pardons as justification to issue his own set of pardons to allies and cronies. He considered at the end of his first term issuing preemptive pardons to lawmakers and others who helped in his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Now, with the blessing of the Supreme Court with immunity from prosecution for official acts and Biden's precedent, Trump can order administration officials, staff, border patrol or members of the military to break the law and receive a get out of jail free pardon. Biden left Democrats to face the easy taunt of hypocrisy if they choose to protest.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers agreed that Biden's last-minute pardons were a mistake. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told HuffPost that he was \"very disappointed\" with them.\n\n\"I think we're going to have a very hard time critiquing Donald Trump's improper use of the pardon power because of President Biden pardoning his own family members,\" Kaine said.\n\n\"I thought the pardons for our committee as well as for the family members were unnecessary and unwise,\" said Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a member of the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nThe preemptive pardons, particularly for his own family members, also fly in the face of Biden's promise to turn the page on Trump's personal venality and debasement of the presidency.\n\n\"It concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,\" Biden said in 2020 when asked about Trump potentially issuing preemptive pardons for Republican lawmakers, administration officials, his family and himself.\n\nAnd yet Biden set just such a precedent in the plain self-interest of pardoning his family members. If it isn't corrupt in our modern quid-pro-quo sense, it is corrupt in the classical republican sense in that he put his personal interest above the common good.\n\nWhile Biden issued these pardons, Trump shares the blame. He created this situation by promising to abuse the power of the president to order investigations into his political opponents whether a crime existed or not. He fomented the political atmosphere that is rife with calls for vengeance against the \"deep state\" bureaucrats who betrayed the country and stabbed Trump in the back.\n\nThe pardons may protect these individuals, but they ultimately act as more kindling for Trump's worst impulses. Others less fortunate than those who received a Biden pardon may wind up paying the price."

      "text": "Biden gives son Hunter 'unconditional' pardon\n\nUS President Joe Biden has issued an official pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases, despite previously ruling it out.\n\nIn a statement, the president said his son had been \"singled out\" and called his cases \"a miscarriage of justice\".\n\nHunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June - becoming the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted of a crime.\n\nReacting to the pardon, President-elect Donald Trump said: \"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the [6 January] Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"\n\nTrump was referring to his supporters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 in a bid to overturn Trump's defeat in the 2020 election.\n\nJoe Biden's full and unconditional pardon for his son comes after the president had repeatedly said he would not give him clemency.\n\nJust a couple of months ago, in September, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden would not issue a pardon for his son.\n\nShe repeated that stance last month in another briefing, saying: \"We've been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.\"\n\nBefore that, in June, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy, Biden had said he would neither pardon his son nor commute his sentence.\n\n\"I said I'd abide by the jury decision, and I will do that. And I will not pardon him,\" he told reporters covering the summit.\n\nBut on Sunday evening, President Biden said although he believed in the justice system, \"politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\".\n\n\"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" he said.\n\nBiden said he wrestled with the decision, and added: \"Once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.\"\n\n\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement comes after the president gathered his family together to spend the Thanksgiving weekend in Nantucket. Reporters spotted Biden out for a walk on Friday with Hunter and his four-year-old son Beau, as well as Biden's daughter Ashley.\n\nSenior Republicans in Washington reacted furiously to news of the pardon, with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer saying the president \"lied from start to finish\" about the circumstances surrounding his son's case.\n\nBut there were signs of unease among Democrats too. Representative Greg Stanton of Arizona became the first politician in his party to disagree publicly with the decision, saying on X: \"I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong.\"\n\nIn a statement, Hunter Biden said mistakes he made during the darkest days of his addiction had been \"exploited to publicly humiliate and shame\" his family for political sport.\n\n\"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering,\" the 54-year-old added.\n\nThe younger Biden has been sober for five-and-a-half years, his father said.\n\nThis is not the first time a US president has pardoned a member of their family.\n\nBill Clinton pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a 1985 cocaine-related offence in 2001.\n\nIn 2020, Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka. President-elect Trump has recently announced that Kushner will be the new ambassador to France .\n\nHunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine counts of federal tax fraud in September, for which he had been facing up to 17 years in prison.\n\nHe was also convicted of three felonies in connection with a gun purchase in June, for which he had been facing up to 25 years in prison.\n\nSentencing for these cases had been scheduled for 12 and 16 December.\n\nHis legal troubles had been a dark cloud over his father's presidential campaign, which came to an end in July after Biden pulled out of the election race .\n\nBiden endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic candidate, who lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November.\n\nTrump is set to take over the Oval Office from Biden on 20 January 2025 - Inauguration Day.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Biden signs with Los Angeles talent agency\n\nFormer US President Joe Biden has signed with a Los Angeles talent agency - marking a significant step in shaping his post-presidency career.\n\nThe signing marks a reunion with Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which previously represented him from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\"President Biden is one of America's most respected and influential voices in national and global affairs,\" Richard Lovett, co-chair of CAA, said in a statement.\n\n\"His lifelong commitment to public service is one of unity, optimism, dignity, and possibility,\" Mr Lovett said. \"We are profoundly honored to partner with him again.\"\n\nThe talent agency also has ties to former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nMr Biden, 82, has remained largely quiet about his plans following his five-decade career in public service, but when leaving the White House in January, he reassured supporters saying, \"We're leaving office, we're not leaving the fight.\"\n\nWith only two weeks having passed since his departure from office, there's no clear indication that he has a new book or project in the works.\n\nDuring his previous stint signed to the talent agency, he published his memoir, Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose in 2017.\n\nThe book, which chronicled the loss of his eldest son, Beau, became a New York Times number one bestseller and inspired his American Promise book tour, widely seen as a stepping stone to his 2020 presidential bid.\n\nWhile keeping a relatively low profile, the former president has been spotted around his Delaware home and remains in contact with former aides and associates. He also recently became a great-grandfather, with the birth of his granddaughter, Naomi's son.\n\nThough CAA is usually tied with big movie stars and A-list celebrities, it's not uncommon for the agency to also work with politicians and social advocacy groups.\n\nThe Obamas' partnership with CAA through their production company, Higher Ground has led to the creation of award-winning films and television shows, including the Oscar-winning documentary, American Factory.\n\nAdditionally, former presidential nominee and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed with CAA to represent her book projects, including Hard Choices, which chronicled her tenure as America's top diplomat.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Biden under new pressure from top Democrats as Covid halts campaign\n\nPresident Joe Biden faces new questions over his candidacy in the November election - with his campaign events currently on pause due to a Covid-19 infection.\n\nThe top two Democrats in the US Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are both reported to have met him individually to express concerns over his bid for the White House.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, has also privately told him that he cannot beat Donald Trump in November's election, according to CNN.\n\nMr Biden's re-election attempt was already being buffeted by growing dissent among top Democrats after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last month.\n\nAnnouncing his Covid infection on Wednesday, Mr Biden's press secretary said the 81-year-old was facing mild symptoms.\n\nHe would isolate at his home in Delaware while carrying out \"all of his duties fully\", said Karine Jean-Pierre. She added that the president was vaccinated and boosted. He has tested positive for Covid twice before.\n\nMr Biden was seen earlier in the day visiting supporters in Las Vegas and speaking at an event. He was forced to cancel a speech later in the day at UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organisation.\n\nIt marked a sudden and debilitating end to a trip that was supposed to see Mr Biden hitting the campaign trail again with full force - after the pause sparked by the attempted assassination of his rival Trump.\n\nThe president had spent time in Las Vegas trying to revive his appeal among Hispanic voters, with whom his poll lead has slipped since 2020.\n\nLater on Wednesday, he was seen moving slowly and cautiously up the steps to Air Force One. He was not wearing a mask. As he boarded the plane, he was heard to say: \"Good, I feel good.\"\n\nMr Biden has faced growing calls to withdraw from the election race in recent weeks.\n\nDuring their separate private meetings with Mr Biden which took place last week, Mr Schumer and Mr Jeffries expressed concerns that his presence at the top of the November election ticket could hurt their chances for controlling either chamber in Congress, according to multiple reports.\n\nAfter the reports, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said: \"The president told both leaders he is the nominee of the party, he plans to win, and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mr Jeffries said, \"it was a private conversation that will remain private\".  Mr Schumer's office called the reporting \"idle speculation\" but added the Democratic leader \"conveyed the views of his caucus directly to President Biden\".\n\nMs Pelosi, too, is said by CNN to have told the president in a recent conversation that polling suggested he could harm the Democrats' chances of winning the House in November.\n\nThe president pushed back, at which point Ms Pelosi asked for input on key data from the president's long-time adviser, according to CNN, which cited four sources briefed on the call.\n\nIt is not clear when the conversation took place. Ms Pelosi's office told CNN she had not been in touch with the president since Friday.\n\nAbout two dozen Democratic politicians have publicly called for Mr Biden to step aside in recent weeks, including Adam Schiff, a congressman from California who has called on Mr Biden to \"pass the torch\".\n\nMr Schiff said Mr Biden \"has been one of the most consequential presidents in our nation's history\", and he could \"secure his legacy of leadership\" by allowing another Democrat to step forward.\n\nIn an interview with BET, Mr Biden said he did not feel he could pass the mantle with the country so \"divided\".\n\nThe president also said, for the first time, that he would consider dropping out of the race if any of his doctors said he had a \"medical condition\".\n\nBefore the announcement of Mr Biden's infection on Wednesday, reporters on the Las Vegas trip said they had been rushed off the site of a campaign stop at a Mexican restaurant to the city's airport following the announcement.\n\nThe restaurant had been ablaze with colour, with Mexican art and guitars hanging from the walls and banners draped from the ceiling. One wall was adorned with \"Biden-Harris\" posters.\n\nAs ceiling fans swirled on low speed and Latino pop played quietly from the speakers, Mr Biden walked in via the kitchen door - which was flanked by a Secret Service detail - and entered a main dining area.\n\nHe shook hands with diners - who had clearly been prepared some time in advance for his arrival - kissed one and had selfies taken with others.\n\nThe president seemed somewhat stiffer and appeared slower than the day before, when he had given an energised performance in a speech to a national civil rights group.\n\nCommenting later in the day on his Covid infection, the president's doctor Kevin O'Connor said Mr Biden had presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including a runny nose and a cough, and had been given his first dose of Paxlovid.\n\nHe felt fine during his first event of the day but later tested positive, Dr O'Connor said.\n\nMr Biden posted on X to thank everyone for \"the well wishes\" and said he would \"work to get the job done for the American people\" while in recovery.\n\nIn another post on his account, he stated: \"I'm sick\" before going on to write \"... of Elon Musk and his rich buddies trying to buy this election. And if you agree, pitch in here\".\n\nThe tweet pointed to a donations portal.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up her e. Those outside the UK can sign up here.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Republicans accuse Biden of inciting Trump shooting\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers are blaming US President Joe Biden, claiming his campaign rhetoric led to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.\n\nAs of Sunday, nearly a dozen lawmakers have pointed fingers at Mr Biden and Democrats at-large for the shooting Saturday evening at the former president's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nMany are pointing to a comment from Mr Biden while on a private phone call with donors last week.\n\nAccording to Politico, Biden said on the call: \"I have one job, and that's to beat Donald Trump. I'm absolutely certain I'm the best person to be able to do that. So, we're done talking about the debate. It's time to put Trump in a bullseye.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Mr Biden condemned the attack and called on Americans to denounce such violence. On Sunday, he ordered a review of security at the rally.\n\nIn the aftermath of the assassination attempt, the specific reference to \"Trump in a bullseye\" less than a week before, has led some Republicans to place the burden of the shooting in part on Mr Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden sent the orders,\" Georgia Republican Rep. Mike Collins posted on X, formerly Twitter, in a response to a post about Mr Biden's comments to donors.\n\nIn another post, Mr Collins wrote \"they attempted to neutralize the threat\", responding to a separate graphic featuring the president's comments.\n\n\"Notice that after an attempted assassination of President Trump, the same people who wanted him prosecuted for telling his supporters to peacefully march to the Capitol on January 6 are not calling for President Biden's prosecution after he said it was time to put President Trump in the bullseye after their debate,\" Collins wrote.\n\nFBI officials identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, a kitchen worker from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who is a registered Republican.\n\nA Secret Service sniper fatally shot Crooks after he fired at the president.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, also referenced Mr Biden's bullseye comment in posts on social media.\n\n\"Just days ago, Biden said 'it's time to put Trump in a bullseye'. Today, there was an assassination attempt against President Trump,\" she wrote on X Saturday evening.\n\nMs Blackburn also criticized Mr Biden for not releasing a statement for the first hour after the shooting, calling his delay \"unacceptable\".\n\n\"Go to the Oval Office and address the American people. We do not settle our differences by violence,\" she said.\n\nMr Biden spoke Saturday night from his home in Delaware where he was spending the weekend. He condemned the assassination attempt and called on all Americans to denounce such \"sick\" violence.\n\n\"We must unite as one nation to condemn it. It's sick, it's sick,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden then left Delaware to return to the White House, where he addressed the shooting again Sunday afternoon. A national address from the Oval Office is planned for Sunday night.\n\nThe sitting president also spoke with Trump over the phone on Saturday night in a call that one White House official described as \"good, short and respectful\".\n\nRepublicans on the House Judiciary Committee took to social media in response to Mr Biden's bullseye statement, too, asking reporters in a post if they plan to delve into the president's comment to donors.\n\n\"That just happened,\" they wrote in a post after the attempted assassination.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, told 9News on Saturday night that she believes \"much of the rhetoric from the left has escalated to this moment\".\n\n\"President Trump was literally put in a bullseye after the President of the United States, the sitting President of the United States, called for him to be put in a bullseye,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked if she thinks Biden bears responsibility for the attempted assassination, she replied: \"I do believe that Joe Biden is responsible for the shooting today.\"\n\nOther Republicans pointed to Democrats' recent efforts to end Trump's Secret Service protection after he became the first president convicted of felony counts for falsifying business records related to hush money payments to an adult film actress.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, introduced the legislation in April that several House Democrats co-sponsored.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican who blamed the media and several Democrats for the shooting in posts on X, posted a list on the social media platform of Democrats who co-sponsored the legislation.\n\n\"Pray for America. The left wants a civil war. They have been trying to start one for years. These people are sick and evil,\" she wrote.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican, who is on Trump's short list of vice presidential picks, echoed similar sentiments blaming the left's rhetoric.\n\n\"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,\" he wrote on X.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Democrats and the media have \"recklessly stoked fears\", and called Trump and conservatives \"threats to democracy\".\n\n\"Their inflammatory rhetoric puts lives at risk,\" he also wrote on X.\n\nLouisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, the House majority leader who was shot at a practice for a congressional baseball game in 2017, said Democrats have fuelled \"ludicrous hysteria\" about Trump being re-elected.\n\n\"Clearly, we've seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop,\" he said.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Allies defend Biden as poll suggests growing age concern\n\nA new poll suggests that some Democratic voters are increasingly concerned about whether Joe Biden is mentally fit to serve as president after a shaky debate performance on Thursday.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday indicated that 72% of registered voters believe the president does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president - a sharp increase from the 65% who said the same in an earlier poll.\n\nForty-nine percent of voters said the same of former President Donald Trump.\n\nParticularly alarming for the Biden campaign, 45% of registered Democrats who responded to the poll said they believe the president should step aside for another candidate.\n\nConcerns about the candidates' age - Mr Biden's is 81 and Trump is 78 - existed before Thursday's debate. Mr Biden's hoarse voice and muddled answers, however, renewed concerns among some Democrats about his candidacy and left some calling for Mr Biden to step aside.\n\nThe president's family encouraged him to stay in the race and keep fighting during a long-planned visit to Camp David on Sunday, a source with knowledge of the conversations confirmed to CBS News, BBC's US partner.\n\nStill, Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democrat and White House ally, called it a \"difficult situation\" in an interview with MSNBC on Sunday.\n\nHe said that there are \"very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party\", though he emphasised that the ultimate decision remained Mr Biden's.\n\n\"Regardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified and our party also needs him at the very centre of our deliberations in our campaign,\" he added.\n\nIn the days since the debate, first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama have publicly acknowledged it was not Mr Biden's best performance.\n\nBut they and many other Democratic allies rejected calls that Mr Biden should step aside.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told MSNBC on Sunday that the president's debate performance \"was a setback. But, of course, I believe a setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback\".\n\nThis poll from CBS News and polling organisation YouGov contrasts with a memo shared by Biden campaign chairwoman Jen O'Malley on Saturday. It claims that internal polling shows that it is the \"beltway class\" counting Mr Biden out, not Americans across the country.\n\nWhen asked about the new poll, Biden administration officials argued head-to-head polls matter more and show the president leading by a point or tied with Trump.\n\n\"The grassroots is not fundamentally panicking like the Beltway is when you look at the head-to-heads,\" an unnamed Biden administration official told CBS News. \"Before Thursday, there were people who thought he was too old, but a lot of those people were still picking him over Trump.\"\n\nBut interviews with voters after the debate, back up the concern expressed in CBS News' poll. Voters told BBC News they were worried about the president after his performance.\n\n\"I am less confident in the ability of Biden to lead this country today than I ever have been,\" one Democratic voter told the BBC after the debate.\n\nWith concerns growing, the president's campaign surrogates appeared on a series of politics shows in the US on Sunday morning.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Coons, a close ally of the president and a campaign co-chair, fiercely defended the president on ABC News' This Week.\n\n\"Joe Biden has an incredible record, and he knows, as the American people do, that when you get knocked down, you get back up and you fight harder,\" the senator said. \"That's what he's planning to do.\"\n\nWhen Mr Coons was asked about the president's mental fitness, he deflected and raised concerns about Trump. He also would not say whether Mr Biden was listening to the growing concerns about his age and stability.\n\n\"He's the only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump,\" Mr Coons said about the president.\n\nDemocratic Senator Raphael Warnock said on NBC News Meet the Press that the president should \"absolutely not\" drop out of the race.\n\n\"There have been more than a few Sundays when I wished I preached a better sermon\" Mr Warnock, who is also a pastor, said.\n\n\"But after the sermon was over, it was my job to embody the message, to show up for the people that I serve. And that's what Joe Biden has been doing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans doubled-down on their critiques of the president's performance saying it showed why Trump was the right choice.\n\n\"Joe Biden had a disastrous performance, which is why they're talking about replacing him,\" Republican Senator JD Vance said on Fox News on Sunday.\n\nMr Vance said Trump was engaging, funny and had a \"good natured demeanour\" during the debate.\n\n\"That's what you need to be able to serve as president of the United States and to contrast with Joe Biden, who seemed to be unable to complete a sentence,\" he said.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Biden vows to run as more Democrats ask him to drop out\n\nUS President Joe Biden is looking forward to \"getting back on the campaign trail next week\", fortifying his commitment to stick in the race as more Democrats on Friday called for him to step aside as the party nominee.\n\n\"The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win,\" he said.\n\nHis statement appeared to be in response to the conflicting reports that Mr Biden's inner circle is discussing the beleaguered president's future and whether he will remain in the race.\n\nOver the last several weeks, Mr Biden has been caught in a whirlwind of political pressure to step down: Calls from leaders within his own party to withdraw from the race, a loss of big-ticket donors and the added pressure that his decision could cost Democrats control of Congress.\n\nAt least a dozen Democratic lawmakers have called for him to step aside on Friday alone, and Vice-President Kamala Harris - considered the top choice to replace Mr Biden - was tasked with comforting worried donors on a Friday afternoon call.\n\nMs Harris said that she believed \"in my heart of hearts\" that \"we are going to win this election\", an individual who listened to the conversation told the BBC.\n\n\"We know which candidate in this election puts the American people first: Our president, Joe Biden,\" she added.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Biden's re-election campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon also attempted to push back on speculation that the president would withdraw in an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe\n\n\"Absolutely, the president's in this race,\" she said when asked about Mr Biden's plans.\n\nShe described him as \"more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump\" and said he's the \"best person\" to take on the former president.\n\nIn his statement, the president referenced former President Trump's Republican National Convention speech to say he will continue \"exposing the threat\" of the former president while \"making the case\" for his record.\n\n\"Donald Trump's dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans. Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box,\" he said.\n\nAs the conflict played on on Friday, the president was under quarantine at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He tested positive for Covid-19 while traveling in Las Vegas earlier this week. Mr Biden is experiencing \"mild symptoms\", the White House said.\n\nSince his poor debate performance last month, Mr Biden has insisted he will continue to run, though his perspective on what it would take for him to step down as the Democratic nominee has evolved.\n\nFirst telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos \"only the Lord Almighty\" would make him stand down, Mr Biden said this week during an interview with BET (Black Entertainment Television) that he would re-evaluate the campaign if a doctor told him he had a serious medical condition.\n\nAccording to a campaign memo released on Friday, Mr Biden isn't going anywhere.\n\n\"Joe Biden has made it more than clear: He's in this race and he's in it to win it,\" according to the memo. \"Moreover, he's the presumptive nominee - there is no plan for an alternative nominee. In a few short weeks, Joe Biden will be the official nominee. It is high past time we stop fighting one another. The only person who wins when we fight is Donald Trump.\"\n\nTime is running out for Mr Biden to decide if he will step down.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention begins 19 August, but the Democratic National Committee is expected to meet virtually the first week of August to nominate Biden as the official party nominee to meet state ballot deadlines.\n\nThe DNC rules committee met on Friday morning to discuss the procedures for the virtual roll-call vote, which they intend to hold before 7 August.\n\nWhen asked whether another candidate could challenge Mr Biden in the roll-call vote, the committee's co-chair Leah Daughtry said that \"any challenger would have to have the verified support of hundreds of delegates\".\n\nWith Mr Biden winning nearly all of the available delegates during the Democratic primary, that requirement would be nearly insurmountable.\n\nMs Daughtry noted that \"such a challenge has never happened over the past half century of competitive primaries\".\n\nThe pressure continues to build, however.\n\nOn Friday, Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich, of New Mexico, became the third Democrat in the upper chamber to call for Biden to step aside.\n\n\"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to united behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\" he wrote in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nHis statement follows that of Democratic Senator Jon Tester, of Montana, who called on Biden to end his re-election bid on Thursday.\n\n\"While I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,\" Mr Tester wrote in a statement on X.\n\nIn the House, Congressman Jim Costa, a Democrat from California, also called for him to withdraw on Thursday.\n\nDemocratic congressmen Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin released a joint message on Friday saying \"the most responsible and patriotic thing\" Biden could do is \"step aside as our nominee\".\n\n\"With great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" they wrote in the joint statement.\n\nIllinois Democratic congressman Sean Casten wrote in the Chicago Tribune on Friday that he doesn't think the president can defeat former US President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he wrote.\n\nOther members of the House joined the calls for the president to step aside on Friday, including Zoe Lofgren of California, Kathy Castor of Florida, Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky, Greg Landsman of Ohio and Betty McCollum of Minnesota.\n\nReports this week suggested senior Democratic leaders are leaning in the same direction.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have all reportedly expressed concerns during private conversations with Mr Biden about his candidacy. In public statements, Ms Pelosi's staff insisted her comments have been misrepresented and Mr Jeffries affirmed his support for Mr Biden.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, Mr Biden's previous running mate, has reportedly said Mr Biden's chances of winning the election have greatly diminished.\n\nLawmakers haven't been the only ones turning their backs to Biden. Big name donors - including actor George Clooney and Disney family heiress Abigail Disney - have closed their wallets.\n\nDespite the defectors, some are sticking by his side.\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most influential progressive voices in the House, has supported Biden over the last few weeks. She broadcast live on Instagram on Friday morning and spoke about the risks of entering the convention without Biden as the presumptive nominee, including potential legal challenges and ballot access deadlines.\n\nThe Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has about 40 members, and the 60-member Congressional Black Caucus, have both met with the president and also indicated their support for his re-election bid.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Log in to hide ads .\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 16, 2025, 1:14 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nPresident Joe Biden's legacy, in the short term at least, is likely to be marked by a sense of failure.\n\nHis first few years in office saw persistent inflation, with many Americans struggling to afford groceries, gas, and rent. Under his watch, record streams of migrants flooded across the U.S.-Mexico border. As he heads out the door, a new CNN poll finds that just 36% of Americans approve of how he has handled the presidency, matching his previous low.\n\nPerhaps most painful, Mr. Biden's 50-plus years in public life are ending with an outcome he sought mightily to avoid: the return of Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is leaving office after a single term that many Americans regard as unsuccessful. But history suggests his accomplishments could be viewed more favorably over time.\n\nEven a late-breaking ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is unlikely to be seen as a clear win for Mr. Biden, with Mr. Trump being given as much or more credit for the achievement. To many observers, it's raising unmistakable parallels to another one-term president whose time in office was widely seen as unsuccessful: Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"Not a lot of one-term presidents are considered candidates for Mount Rushmore,\" says Matthew Dickinson, a political scientist at Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nYet Professor Dickinson and other presidential scholars don't rule out the possibility that public estimation of Mr. Biden's term could well improve over time. Biden defenders argue he deserves and will ultimately get credit for getting the COVID-19 pandemic under control and enacting a massive economic relief program. During his first two years in office, when Democrats controlled Congress, Mr. Biden passed major programs that are expected to deliver tangible results in coming years - including investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nEven now, the U.S. economy is outperforming much of the world, with unemployment at 4.1% and inflation at 2.9%. Some Democrats complain that their party had a messaging problem, not a policy problem, as President Biden reduced his interviews and public appearances and struggled to communicate effectively.\n\nIn his final days in office, Mr. Biden has used both his presidential power and his bully pulpit. He's issued a raft of executive orders, and put out a 61-page memo touting his accomplishments. Wednesday night, he delivered a farewell address to the nation that was both hopeful and ominous.\n\nMr. Biden warned specifically of a growing concentration of riches in the United States, a veiled swipe at Mr. Trump and some of his most prominent supporters.\n\n\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" the president said in his speech. The world's richest person, Elon Musk, has become a key Trump ally, and the next two wealthiest, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, have also curried favor with the incoming president.\n\nOver the long haul, the larger meaning of Mr. Biden's one term remains fluid. Will it be seen as a brief interregnum that effectively stretched out Mr. Trump's era of influence by four years? Or by denying Mr. Trump a second consecutive term in 2020, did Mr. Biden accomplish something more significant?\n\nRussell Riley, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, argues that beating Mr. Trump in 2020 could turn out to be a key Biden legacy.\n\n\"It may very well be that an uninterrupted reign of a Trump presidency for eight years would have been markedly more disruptive than two separate intervals of a Trump presidency,\" Professor Riley says.\n\nMr. Biden came to the presidency as the embodiment of the political establishment, an avatar of \"normality.\" He had served 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president before reaching the Oval Office. He also had a history as a centrist dealmaker, skills he honed in the Senate.\n\n\"He was nominated because he was going to move the Democratic Party back to the center, but he didn't necessarily govern that way,\" Professor Dickinson says. \"I think that hurt him.\"\n\nInstead, Mr. Biden tacked left - leading to a \"big government\" ethos and legislation that added trillions to the national debt.\n\nOf course, Mr. Trump was also a big spender, and the national debt rose even more during his first term than Mr. Biden's. Whether Mr. Trump's second-term plans to boost government efficiency and slash the federal workforce come to anything remain to be seen. For now, cutting or eliminating programs dear to Democrats is high on the list.\n\nMr. Biden's decision to run for a second term, after strongly suggesting he wouldn't, is another key part of his legacy. By the time the octogenarian dropped out of the race last July, after a disastrous debate performance, there was no time for a proper primary. Vice President Kamala Harris, as the emergency fill-in, narrowly lost the popular vote, and lost the Electoral College by a wider margin.\n\nIt may well be that no Democrat running on Mr. Biden's record could have beaten Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Biden will get credit in the history books for elevating the first woman to the vice presidency. After the Supreme Court's historic overturning of the nationwide right to abortion in 2022, Ms. Harris became the administration's most prominent voice on reproductive rights.\n\n\"She was a far more effective messenger on that than he was,\" says Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.\n\nMr. Biden is also credited with assembling a diverse Cabinet, and putting the first Black female justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nA persistent challenge throughout the Biden term was the legal and personal troubles of his son. The only surviving child from Mr. Biden's late first wife, Hunter Biden occupied a unique place in his father's presidency, as a source of perpetual concern. When President Biden announced last month the unconditional pardon of his son, going back 11 years, he broke a repeated promise that he would not do that. The president's regular oaths of \"my word as a Biden\" may now ring a bit hollow.\n\nHis son's pardon also shined a light on the larger issue of alleged Justice Department weaponization. The two federal cases against Mr. Trump - now dismissed - helped fuel passions around his 2024 reelection, and could in turn spur efforts by the incoming Trump Justice Department to prosecute Biden allies.\n\nUltimately, the policy dimension of Mr. Biden's one term will be his most durable legacy. In foreign affairs, the disastrous final withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 may be the most memorable episode - a blow to Mr. Biden's public approval from which he never recovered. His shoring up of international alliances and diehard support for Ukraine and Israel, amid brutal wars, underscored Mr. Biden's identity as a globalist.\n\nWednesday's announcement of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal brought back memories of President Carter, and the Iranian hostage crisis that helped make him a one-termer. Mr. Carter's memorial service in Washington was just last week, making the parallel even sharper.\n\nMr. Carter is now remembered fondly by many for his decades-long post-presidency, marked by good works, rather than the missteps of his time in the White House. Of course, Mr. Carter was just 56 when he left office.\n\nBut historians point to other presidents whose public image improved, sometimes dramatically, years after they left office. The once deeply unpopular Harry Truman is now lauded for desegregating the military and supporting the creation of NATO.\n\nLyndon Johnson, who dropped his reelection bid amid growing protests over the Vietnam War, is now best known for signing major civil rights legislation and implementing his Great Society agenda, including creation of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nMr. Biden made no secret of his desire to pass sweeping programs like the Great Society or Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. But ultimately he had to trim back his Build Back Better agenda, which aimed for tax reforms, plus broad investment in infrastructure, environment, and healthcare. Some elements were implemented separately.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history.\n\n\"I've dedicated my career to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Today, I am commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 individuals on federal death row to life sentences without the possibility of parole. These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my administration has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\"\n\nThe Biden administration in 2021 announced a moratorium on federal capital punishment to study the protocols used, which suspended executions during President Biden's term. But Mr. Biden actually had promised to go further on the issue in the past, pledging to end federal executions without the caveats for terrorism and hate-motivated, mass killings.\n\nWhile running for president in 2020, Mr. Biden's campaign website said he would \"work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, and incentivize states to follow the federal government's example.\"\n\nSimilar language didn't appear on Mr. Biden's reelection website before he left the presidential race in July.\n\n\"Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,\" Mr. Biden's statement said. \"But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vice president, and now president, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level.\"\n\nHe took a political jab at Mr. Trump, saying, \"In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\"\n\nIndeed, President-elect Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has spoken frequently of expanding executions. In a speech announcing his 2024 campaign, Trump called for those \"caught selling drugs to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts.\" He later promised to execute drug and human smugglers and even praised China's harsher treatment of drug peddlers. During his first term as president, Mr. Trump also advocated for the death penalty for drug dealers.\n\nThere were 13 federal executions during Mr. Trump's first term, more than under any president in modern history, and some may have happened fast enough to have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus at the federal death row facility in Indiana.\n\nThose were the first federal executions since 2003. The final three occurred after Election Day in November 2020 but before Mr.Trump left office the following January, the first time federal prisoners were put to death by a lame-duck president since Grover Cleveland in 1889.\n\nMr. Biden faced recent pressure from advocacy groups urging him to act to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The president's announcement also comes less than two weeks after he commuted the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, and of 39 others convicted of nonviolent crimes, the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.\n\nThe announcement also followed the post-election pardon that Mr. Biden granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges after long saying he would not issue one, sparking an uproar in Washington. The pardon also raised questions about whether he would issue sweeping preemptive pardons for administration officials and other allies who the White House worries could be unjustly targeted by Mr. Trump's second administration.\n\nSpeculation that President Biden could commute federal death sentences intensified last week after the White House announced he plans to visit Italy on the final foreign trip of his presidency next month. Mr. Biden, a practicing Catholic, will meet with Pope Francis, who recently called for prayers for U.S. death row inmates in hopes their sentences will be commuted.\n\nMartin Luther King III, who publicly urged Mr. Biden to change the death sentences, said in a statement issued by the White House that the president \"has done what no president before him was willing to do: take meaningful and lasting action not just to acknowledge the death penalty's racist roots but also to remedy its persistent unfairness.\"\n\nDonnie Oliverio, a retired Ohio police officer whose partner was killed by one of the men whose death sentence was converted, said the execution of \"the person who killed my police partner and best friend would have brought me no peace.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mr. Biden also singled out Gen. Mark Milley, who served under President Donald Trump, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who managed the COVID-19 pandemic under both Presidents Trump and Biden. The outgoing president also pardoned five members of his own family.\n\nWhile technically within the bounds of the presidential pardon power, no president has issued so many late pardons to individuals yet to be convicted of - or even investigated for - committing crimes. Supporters of the preemptive action counter that an incoming president never threatened legal action against his political enemies the way newly inaugurated President Donald Trump has.\n\nPresident Joe Biden drew criticism for pardoning his son Hunter to protect him from political retribution. Now, Mr. Biden's eleventh-hour preemptive pardons for his family and Trump critics are raising further questions.\n\nIn his inaugural speech on Monday, President Trump reiterated his view that his four criminal indictments - and convictions on one set of the charges - resulted from persecution by the departing president rather than his own actions.\n\n\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced,\" President Trump said. \"The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\"\n\nRegardless, what is unquestionable is that Mr. Biden has pushed the presidential pardon power into new ground. While some pardon recipients expressed gratitude, others worried about the precedent it could set for Mr. Trump and future presidents, who already enjoy broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution gives the president the power to \"grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States.\" While previous presidents have issued pardons to people yet to be charged with crimes, there is little precedent for the preemptive pardons Mr. Biden issued during his final 24 hours in the White House.\n\nIt's not his first run at preemptive pardons. Last month, Mr. Biden pardoned his son Hunter before his sentencing for federal gun and tax fraud felonies. The amnesty covered any crimes he may have committed over the past decade.\n\nOn Monday morning, in the final hours of his term, President Biden also issued preemptive pardons to other individuals who Mr. Trump and his supporters often criticized.\n\nGeneral Milley and Dr. Fauci received full and unconditional pardons \"for any offenses\" they may have committed over the past decade. The members of the Jan. 6 committee and their staff, as well as police officers who testified to the committee, received full pardons for any offenses \"arising from or in any matter related to\" the committee's work investigating the Capitol attack. Five members of Mr. Biden's immediate family, meanwhile, received full pardons for any nonviolent offenses they may have committed over the past decade.\n\nNot everyone supported these actions. Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who served on the Jan. 6 committee when he was in Congress, said last month that he didn't want a preemptive pardon. \"It's unnecessary,\" he told ABC News. Giving \"preemptive blanket pardons on the way out of an administration,\" he added, \"is a precedent we don't want to set.\" Mr. Trump has previously threatened to prosecute Senator Schiff and other members of the committee, including former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, whom Mr. Biden also pardoned.\n\nBut other pardon recipients voiced their appreciation.\n\nGeneral Milley - the nation's highest-ranking military official during the last year of Mr. Trump's first term, who became a prominent critic of the reelected president - said in a statement that he was \"deeply grateful\" for the pardon. He said he was thankful to be spared from \"fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,\" adding that he doesn't want to put \"my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety.\"\n\nDr. Fauci, whose handling of the country's pandemic response was condemned by critics, echoed those sentiments. Earlier Monday, he told CNN he is \"very appreciative\" of the preemptive pardon. \"We did nothing wrong. But the baseless accusations and threats are real for me and my family,\" he added.\n\nBeginning in 2021, Mr. Trump began making public comments that General Milley should be tried for treason. Several prominent Republicans have said that Dr. Fauci should be prosecuted for his handling of the nation's pandemic response.\n\nIn the long run, however, Mr. Biden's preemptive pardons could cast more suspicion on the beneficiaries than it relieves. In a social media post this morning, Republican Sen. Rand Paul said the pardon of Dr. Fauci \"will only serve as an accelerant to pierce the veil of deception\" around the pandemic. \"I will not rest until the entire truth of the coverup is exposed,\" he added.\n\nMr. Biden is not the first president to issue pardons to people yet to be convicted of crimes. President Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon before he could be tried in the wake of Watergate. President Jimmy Carter issued blanket preemptive pardons to those accused of avoiding the draft in the Vietnam War. President Andrew Johnson issued blanket pardons to former Confederate soldiers after the Civil War.\n\nBut the timing and the scope of these pardons - including the Hunter Biden pardon - worry some experts.\n\n\"This may be the strangest year in the history of the pardon power,\" says Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law who studies sentencing and clemency.\n\nThe Biden pardons \"involve people who not only haven't been charged but seem highly unlikely to be convicted of anything,\" he adds. \"He's ignored the hundreds of others who had good cases for clemency, who followed the rules, who submitted a petition, and got nothing.\"\n\nMr. Biden also issued several more traditional pardons before he left the White House. Perhaps most notable was his extending clemency toward Native American activist Leonard Peltier, who was imprisoned for 50 years despite serious doubts over his conviction in the 1970s. Mr. Peltier will be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence at home.\n\nOne person who has voiced concerns about a president issuing eleventh-hour preemptive pardons is Mr. Biden himself.\n\nIn December 2020, amid reports that then-President Trump was considering issuing preemptive pardons, including to his own family members, Mr. Biden told CNN that preemptive pardons \"concer[n] me, in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice.\"\n\nHe added: \"You're not going to see, in our administration, that kind of approach to pardons.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He is also pardoning 39 people convicted of non-violent crimes.\n\nAfter pardoning his son, President Biden announced clemency for more than 1,500 people and is reportedly mulling preemptive pardons for Donald Trump's foes. Experts caution that America may be entering a new era of personal - and political - presidential pardons.\n\n\"These actions represent the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history,'' the statement said.\n\nThat news comes on the heels of two other presidential pardon matters that have grabbed headlines of late: a Politico report last week that President Biden was considering preemptive pardons for those who might be targets of the incoming Trump administration and a pardon for his son Hunter, convicted earlier this year of federal gun and tax charges.\n\nThe presidential pardon power is meant to be broad, and presidents often close out their terms with this gesture of clemency, meant to be an \"act of grace'' to further \"the public welfare,'' according to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nBut the preemptive pardon-one that covers crimes that people have not yet been accused of or protects them from being charged if they haven't committed a crime - is rarely used, experts say. Some argue that using preemptive pardons in the way the Biden administration is considering would set a troubling precedent, enabling future presidents to create impunity zones around themselves and their political allies.\n\n\"It's never felt necessary or appropriate,\" says Margaret Love, who served as the U.S. pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997. \"It's unmoored from [the pardon powers'] original ties to the justice system. Presidents have not thought about how to use this power in a democratic society fairly, accountably, for a lot of years.\"\n\nPresident Biden has already pushed the boundaries of the expansive pardon power. In last week's pardon of Hunter , the clemency covered not just his son's convictions but also any crime he may have committed during a 10-year period. Hunter has not served any time for his crimes. The only comparable pardon is Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal, as it protected Mr. Nixon from punishment for alleged crimes.\n\nBut granting clemency to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration - even though they may not have committed a crime - would push those boundaries even further, experts say.\n\nDoes the Trump era justify such a boundary push? In his first television interview since his reelection, President-elect Trump told \"Meet the Press\" that the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol should be jailed. The committee had been investigating efforts by his supporters to keep Mr. Trump in power; federal prosecutions of Mr. Trump's own role in the efforts have been dropped in the past month.\n\nSome of his nominees for high-profile law enforcement positions in his administration have made similar comments over the years. Pam Bondi, his pick for U.S. attorney general, said that \"The prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones,\" in a 2023 Fox News interview, referring broadly to government lawyers who have brought charges against Mr. Trump. Kash Patel - the nominee to lead the FBI, the country's top domestic police agency - appended a book he published in 2022 with a 60-name \"enemies list.\" Some on this list are likely under consideration for the Biden administration's potential preemptive pardons.\n\n\"Respect for democracy and the rule of law doesn't mean that Joe Biden has to sit idly by and wait for the Trump administration to do things that he would regard as unjust and destructive,\" says Austin Sarat, a political science professor at Amherst College.\n\nIn an early case about the pardon power, the U.S. Supreme Court described it as \"the benign prerogative of mercy.\" But Professor Sarat says the pardon power has come to be used less as an act of mercy and more as a tool to rectify injustice.\n\nPreemptive pardons, by contrast, would not just shield individuals from potential prison time. They would also help deflect public censure, valid or not, and hefty legal expenses likely incurred defending themselves against the Trump Justice Department. Even preemptive pardons of the past have been justified as needed to achieve an essential public purpose, such as helping the country move on after a conflict. Two presidents - Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson - granted blanket pardons to former Confederate officers, for example, and President Jimmy Carter gave a blanket amnesty to individuals who dodged the Vietnam War draft.\n\nInstead of helping the country close a chapter of its history, however, experts say preemptive pardons here could open a new and troubling one.\n\nTo start, issuing preemptive pardons could make the grantees look more guilty than some Americans already believe. Second, however broad the pardons would be, the Trump administration could still likely find targets for prosecution. Most importantly, Mr. Biden would be using the pardon power in a way that future presidents could abuse.\n\nUsing pardons \"to protect one's political allies prospectively just creates a really bad precedent,\" says Frank Bowman, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law.\n\nSuch a precedent becomes even more problematic following the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling earlier this year, which grants former presidents broad immunity for official acts, he adds. Preemptive pardons would mean \"All the people in the president's orbit [could] do whatever they want during the term and get a pardon for it.\"\n\nThat the Biden administration is even discussing preemptive pardons is disappointing, some experts say, and reflective of a lack of faith in the justice system's ability to deter wrongful prosecutions.\n\nIt's also reflective of how use of the pardon power has changed. Having issued the fewest pardons of any first-term president in history so far, Mr. Biden now seems focused on pardoning those who may not need that safety net. In doing so, he would be leaving others behind bars, like Leonard Peltier, a Native American activist now serving two life sentences despite high-profile calls for clemency.\n\nA more effective use of the pardon power would be to use it as it has been used for the past century - namely, to correct injustice and to broadcast a message of grace, mercy, and unity to the nation, experts say. That could come through pardoning someone like Mr. Peltier, as Democratic U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii has called for . Or it could come through commuting the sentences of the roughly 40 people on federal death row, as a growing campaign - reaching as far as the Vatican - is calling for.\n\nThere is also the possibility that preemptive pardons won't be accepted.

In recent years, both political parties have come to appreciate the value of appointing as many judges as possible when they control both the Senate and the White House. But more than any other, the Biden administration appears to have perfected this judicial confirmation machine.\n\nThe result has been President Biden appointing 233 federal judges, more than any one-term president since Jimmy Carter. And he has appointed perhaps the most diverse slate of federal judges in history. That legacy may have been overlooked because there were fewer openings to the coveted U.S. Supreme Court and 13 circuit courts of appeal - which have the final word on every case filed in the federal system.\n\nConfirming a historically diverse slate of judges could be one of President Biden's strongest legacies, but zero-sum politics continues to dominate judicial selection.\n\nNo president has appointed a greater proportion of women or people of color to the bench. Mr. Biden has also embraced professional diversity in his selections, nominating lawyers with experience in public defense, civil rights, and labor law to positions traditionally dominated by prosecutors and veterans of major law firms.\n\nThis legacy, however, has been secured with the help of an increasingly zero-sum political approach to judicial confirmations. Democrats \"stopped being nice and started being ruthless,\" says Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law. The politicization of the issue \"may be more substantial than it's ever been,\" he adds. And that could come at a cost.\n\nThe Biden administration made its priorities clear early. Within 12 months of taking office, Mr. Biden had confirmed 40 judges - more than any president in their first year since Ronald Reagan. By the time Mr. Biden leaves office, over a quarter of active federal judges will be his appointees.\n\nMr. Biden has also been breaking new ground in terms of nominee diversity. Over 60% of his judges are women - more than any president in history - and the same proportion are people of color. No president has appointed more Black women to the federal bench, nor as many openly LGBTQ+ or Native American jurists.\n\nProfessional diversity has also been a focal point. The federal judiciary, particularly at its highest levels, had become increasingly homogeneous in recent decades, populated mostly by white men with careers in prosecutors' offices and white-shoe law firms. Mr. Biden has appointed his fair share of prosecutors and Big Law veterans. But he has also appointed large numbers of judges with experience in other areas, such as public defense, civil rights, immigration, and labor law.\n\n\"In a democratic society, there's an expectation that institutions will to some degree reflect the broader population, and these appointments do that,\" says Gbemende Johnson, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. \"They communicate that these institutions are not cut off to certain people.''\n\nHis one appointment to the nation's highest court embodies this push. In Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Mr. Biden appointed the first Black woman to the Supreme Court and the first justice with experience as a public defender.\n\nBut Justice Jackson is also emblematic of the minimal impact Mr. Biden has had in reshaping the upper reaches of the federal judiciary - at least compared with his predecessor.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden appointed one Supreme Court justice, former President Donald Trump appointed three. And while both men confirmed a similar number of judges to the circuit courts of appeal, Mr. Trump was able to flip more circuits to Republican-appointee majorities than Mr. Biden has for Democratic-appointee majorities.\n\nFederal Judicial Center, Congressional Research Service\n\nMaybe not more of an issue, but politicization remains an issue.\n\nPolitics has played a role in judicial appointments since America's infancy , but it has ratcheted up in recent presidencies. To help Barack Obama, Senate Democrats eliminated the filibuster - a requirement that nominees receive 60 votes to be confirmed - for lower federal court judges. Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings for President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, for almost a full year. During the Trump administration, Republican senators eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nGOP senators at that time also adopted an exception for circuit court nominees to the century-old \"blue slip\" rule , enabling them to confirm appellate judges over objections from Democratic senators from their home states. When Democrats returned to power in 2021, they kept that new rule, along with others that helped marginalize the minority party's ability to influence judicial confirmations.\n\nFederal judgeships have not been updated in over 30 years, leaving judges to manage \"crushing\" caseloads, according to the Judicial Conference of the United States. In a 2023 report , the Judicial Conference - the policymaking body for the federal court system - called on Congress to create new federal judgeships to help courts manage case backlogs.\n\nThe Senate responded by drawing up a bill that would create 66 new federal judge positions. To be fair to both parties, the new seats would be filled in tranches across three presidential administrations and six Congresses.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate unanimously in August. But it didn't pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives until last week , after the November election indicated that President-elect Trump would be the one to fill the first tranche of seats. The White House has said that Mr. Biden will veto the bill, and there would likely not be enough votes to override a presidential veto.\n\nThe gridlock is \"one more piece of evidence of the politics of the moment,\" says Christina Boyd, a professor of law and political science at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\"Every new seat is [viewed as] a win for the other guy in this situation,\" she adds. \"We're at a place where nobody is willing to give that ground despite what I think is a real need on the ground for more judges.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He still had his base: ride-or-die supporters who believed he had the best shot at beating former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut it wasn't to be. Mr. Biden, under intense intraparty pressure, stepped aside on July 21. Illinois State Comptroller Susana Mendoza, a loyal Biden delegate, is floored by how much better things now look for the party.\n\nThe opening night of the Democratic National Convention features a bittersweet moment: a keynote address by President Joe Biden. The party shoved him aside, but he's also deeply respected and known for resilience.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of Joe Biden's, and I was sad to see what happened, happen,\" Ms. Mendoza says in an interview. \"But I'd be lying to you if I told you that the momentum shift was anything other than monumental.\"\n\nThe president \"passing the torch,\" she adds, \"is going to be one of those defining moments of his legacy.\"\n\nOther Democrats are less glowing. They wish that the octogenarian president had come to accept much sooner that he had slowed down and would better serve his party by not running for reelection. That could have allowed for a proper primary contest among the party's next-generation talent, these party members say.\n\nBut the emergency transition to Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic nominee, has been remarkably smooth. And in his prime-time address Monday night, Mr. Biden is expected to make a strong pitch for her candidacy . Electing her, based on their joint record, and blocking Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Biden views as a threat to democracy, would in effect solidify the president's legacy.\n\nAfter Mr. Biden's speech, he and his wife, Jill - also speaking Monday night - will board Air Force One and fly to California for a vacation. The idea of Mr. Biden, who lives and breathes politics, leaving a Democratic convention early would have been unheard of, under different circumstances.\n\nThe president has been to all but one Democratic convention since his first in 1972, when he was an upstart Senate candidate and council member from New Castle County, Delaware, who had yet to turn 30. That's 13 conventions spread over more than a half-century. (The only one he missed was in 1988, as he recovered from brain surgery not long after his failed first presidential campaign.)\n\nBut this year, Mr. Biden's intent clearly is to cede the stage, literally and figuratively, to his hoped-for successor.\n\nOne close friend who will be watching Monday night from the United Center is Ted Kaufman, who served as Mr. Biden's decades-long chief of staff in the U.S. Senate. He also served as a senator from Delaware himself when Mr. Biden became vice president.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Kaufman ascribes the current unity among Democrats to the \"existential threat\" posed by former President Trump. He emphasizes that Monday night will not be Mr. Biden's goodbye to the nation.\n\n\"This is not going to be his farewell speech,\" Mr. Kaufman says. \"His farewell speech will be in January.\"\n\nOn Monday, the speech will center on \"how important it is that we leave this convention and go out and elect Kamala Harris president of the United States,\" he says. \"That's enough.\"\n\nMr. Kaufman says he wasn't surprised that Mr. Biden decided to drop his reelection bid - or that it seemed to happen so suddenly, with the president insisting that he wouldn't quit the race until the day he abruptly announced he was out.\n\nThat's how Mr. Biden operates, his friend and former aide says. \"He's been doing this for 50 years, and one of the things that's made him so successful is that he's really good at analyzing his situations and making decisions and making them quickly.\"\n\nChris Whipple, author of the book \"The Fight of His Life,\" which covers the first two years of the Biden presidency, sees the moment as \"bittersweet.\"\n\nDropping out of the 2024 race \"was obviously the most difficult decision he or any other president has made in a long, long time,\" Mr. Whipple says. \"I mean, just think back to Lyndon Johnson in 1968\" - the last sitting U.S. president to quit his reelection race.\n\n\"But it's also tragic in a way. This had more betrayals than a Shakespearean drama,\" he adds, rattling off the names of high-profile Democrats who turned on Mr. Biden one by one - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, former President Barack Obama, and even celebrities such as actor George Clooney.\n\nEven more brutal, Ms. Pelosi has been offering some glimpses of the behind-the-scenes machinations to get Mr. Biden to drop out, as she promotes her new book, \"The Art of Power.\" \"I never called one person, but people were calling me saying that there was a challenge there,\" she told The New Yorker .\n\nAnother close observer of Mr. Biden, former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska - a friend of the president dating back to their days in the Senate - also says he's not surprised that the president ultimately decided to drop out. The Nebraskan says he spent a couple of hours with Mr. Biden in the White House back in December, and has spoken with him a few times since.\n\n\"I always had the feeling that he would eventually make this decision,\" Mr. Hagel says.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"Put yourself in his position,\" he says. \"For 50 years, he's been doing this, and he's been knocked down, as he likes to say, a number of times, but he gets back up and he eventually succeeds.\"\n\n\"That's who Joe Biden is. But you get to a point in your life and your career where things have really shifted and changed dramatically - not only your age and your capacity,\" he adds. \"When it's time for new leadership, it's time for new leadership.\"\n\nMs. Mendoza, the Illinois state comptroller, says she's expecting the mood at the convention around the president's speech to feel \"somewhat nostalgic, somewhat bittersweet.\" She says she still feels some sadness around how things played out.\n\n\"He's been through so much pain and heartache and loss in his life that having to walk away from this position had to just be another major blow,\" she says, alluding to the deaths of the president's first wife and baby daughter in 1972, then his eldest son, Beau Biden, in 2015.\n\n\"But I think at the end of the day, he's gonna have a huge smile on his face when he sees Kamala Harris be sworn in as president of the United States.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He has asked Congress to pass a binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court. And he called for the justices to be subject to 18-year term limits.\n\nPresident Biden's demands are unlikely to be realized before he leaves office, most experts agree. Critics have, meanwhile, hit back at the proposals as an effort by President Biden to destroy a court he disagrees with while energizing Democratic voters ahead of the November presidential election.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had resisted calls to reform the Supreme Court. Then came the July decision offering former presidents immunity for any official act.\n\nBut public confidence in the high court is hovering near record lows - a result of both unpopular decisions and ethics scandals surrounding several justices. A sizable majority of Americans support the reforms Mr. Biden is asking for, according to recent polls, and court-curbing efforts have led to changes in the past.\n\nThe Supreme Court, as much as any other institution, naturally shifts with America's changing political tides - just much, much more slowly, experts say. Mr. Biden is trying to accelerate that process, and while he likely won't succeed during his tenure as president, he may be laying the groundwork for more gradual changes.\n\n\"Court reform has historically been very difficult to enact,\" says Tara Leigh Grove, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. But \"it's by design a politically constructed court, and [it] can be changed over time through the system we have.\"\n\nWith few specifics, Mr. Biden outlined his desired reforms in an op-ed published by The Washington Post on Monday.\n\nFirst, he is calling for a constitutional amendment saying that former presidents have no immunity for crimes committed while they were in office.\n\n\"No one is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court,\" he wrote in the opening paragraph.\n\nThe proposal is a direct response to a Supreme Court decision earlier this month. In a 6-3 ruling along ideological lines, the court held for the first time that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\nThe decision has come to be seen as another victory for conservatives since former President Donald Trump appointed three justices to the court. Since 2022, the conservative supermajority has also expanded gun rights, abolished affirmative action in college admissions, and overturned Roe v. Wade - all policies favored by Republicans.\n\nIn response, Democrats have accused the Supreme Court of being \"captured\" by the GOP. And Mr. Biden's second proposal is that justices be subject to term limits.\n\nIn his op-ed, he said he would support a system in which the president appoints a new justice every two years to spend 18 years \"in active service.\" This could be instituted through legislation or a constitutional amendment, legal scholars say.\n\nThird, he is asking for a \"binding code of conduct\" for justices. Currently, they are subject to a voluntary code that is \"weak and self-enforced,\" he wrote. Meanwhile, federal court judges, he noted, are all bound by an enforceable code of conduct.\n\nProfessor Grove, a member of Mr. Biden's Supreme Court commission, says that while it's \"not a slam dunk,\" there's \"a very strong argument\" that Congress could impose a binding ethics code on the justices.\n\nMr. Biden argues that sweeping changes are needed now more than ever. His demands, he says, are informed by his two decades of experience as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They're also informed by a commission to study Supreme Court reform that he assembled in 2021.\n\nMr. Biden has overseen more high court nominations \"than anyone living today,\" he wrote, and he thus has \"great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers.\"\n\nBut \"what is happening now is not normal,\" he added, \"and it undermines the public's confidence in the court's decisions.\"\n\nMr. Biden can't push through any of these reforms himself. The two Supreme Court reforms would require bipartisan action from Congress - and would also likely need to survive review by the justices themselves. The constitutional amendment would face an even tougher road: ratification by a supermajority of Congress and three-fourths of the states.\n\nThe Constitution details how the federal judiciary should function, but it doesn't provide many details. For centuries, Congress has tinkered with how courts operate, including changing the number of appeals courts and the number of Supreme Court justices. It also implemented retirement ages for lower court judges.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have pointed to this history, and said they intend to pursue legislation in line with the president's proposed reforms. But they would face an uphill battle in a divided Congress, where Republicans have already been blasting Mr. Biden's efforts as politically motivated.\n\nDemocrats \"will reshape any institution to make sure it performs for them, not the country as a whole,\" wrote South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, on the social platform X on Monday.\n\n\"I will wholeheartedly oppose these so-called 'reform' measures,\" he added.\n\nWhere the reforms don't seem to be struggling, however, is the court of public opinion.\n\nA Fox News survey conducted in early July found that 56% of voters disapprove of the court's immunity decision, while 78% support an 18-year term limit for justices. (Republicans have more favorable views of the immunity decision, and the court in general, according to the survey.) A YouGov survey released last week showed a bipartisan majority of Americans support both term limits and an enforceable ethics code for Supreme Court justices.\n\nLast fall, the court adopted a formal ethics code for the first time in its history, but it included no way to enforce it. Speaking in Sacramento, California, last week, Justice Elena Kagan said the court \"should try to figure out some [enforcement] mechanism,\" reported CNN. The justice floated the idea of lower court judges holding the justices accountable.\n\nBeyond the question of whether reforms can be implemented, some scholars think the country needs to consider a more sobering question: Should these reforms be implemented?\n\n\"How would you feel if you kind of liked what the court was doing and you saw people you do not politically support trying to mold the court into their image?\" asks Professor Grove.\n\nIt's not just the content of the reforms that worries some in the legal community, but the context in which they're being pushed. The proposed reforms are \"rooted in dissatisfaction with decisions of justices, and I worry about that,\" says Thomas Griffith, a former judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Biden's op-ed opens and closes with references to the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision. Plus, Judge Griffith - another member of the presidential commission - believes that the court could benefit from some reforms, but not if they're tainted by politics.\n\n\"There's probably lots of things we can do,\" he adds. \"But let's have it come from a desire for good government and process, and not because people are upset by a decision.\"\n\nCertainly not in the next six months, and perhaps not even in the next six years. But it's worth noting that the Supreme Court has quietly been reforming at the margins.\n\nThe court continued to broadcast live audio of oral arguments since the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to begin the practice, for example. And the court adopted the formal ethics code last year after mounting public concern over the justices' ethical practices - including Justice Sonia Sotomayor using court staff to schedule her book tour, and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito not disclosing decades of gifts from wealthy conservative donors.\n\nAdopting the ethics code \"was a direct result of public pressure,\" says Christine Bird, an associate professor of political science at Oklahoma State University.\n\nPublic support now for more substantial reforms, like term limits, \"is not something we would have seen five to 10 years ago,\" she adds. That said, she continues, \"Smaller changes are more likely than big sweeping changes.\"\n\nCalls for Supreme Court reform are not new, or even exclusively Democratic. One could even argue that reform has been a constant, albeit a glacially moving constant. To paraphrase a ruling from the past term, the Supreme Court as an institution is not trapped in amber .\n\nThe Constitution does not prescribe term limits for the federal judiciary, yet lower court judges have been able to take \"senior status\" for over a century . Now the country is debating whether a similar principle could apply to justices.\n\nEthics reform is another example. Before the 1970s, there was no formal ethics code for the federal judiciary. An ethics scandal involving Justice Abe Fortas pressured the courts into creating one - yet it excluded the Supreme Court, an omission the country is now reexamining.\n\nThe court has long been thought of - and thought of itself - as different from other institutions in that it's supposed to exist above politics.\n\nWhen Mr. Biden says that what's happening now is \"not normal,\" he's saying that the court is no longer behaving differently from other institutions. His proposed reforms are a response to that perceived shift. Some legal scholars say the reforms he's calling for would only entrench the Supreme Court in the political realm.\n\n\"I hate to take issue with the president of the United States ... but I think this is normal,\" says Judge Griffith. The court \"is doing what it's supposed do, deciding cases in front of it and using its best efforts to apply the law.\"\n\n\"Every judge takes an oath to do impartial justice, and that's certainly an ideal,\" he adds. \"When a judge is not acting impartially, do you give up on the ideal? No, you double down on the ideal.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

By happenstance, the Monitor's turn to serve in the White House press pool fell on Jan. 20. That meant I was part of a small group of reporters tasked with covering the president's activities up close on behalf of the wider press corps.\n\nWe traveled in the motorcade, at times careening down Washington streets at high speed. We were in the Oval Office Monday night as President Donald Trump signed executive orders and held a news-packed, 50-minute impromptu press conference . We dropped in at three inaugural balls and watched President Trump and Vice President JD Vance greet fans and dance with their wives.\n\nOh, and I met Kid Rock.\n\nMy job, as the pool reporter representing print media Jan. 20, was to track presidential movements. Typing up a pool report at one point with frozen thumbs into my iPhone, I could only think, \"I'm so glad I dressed for the weather and not for the occasion!\"\n\nAt our first inaugural ball - the Commander in Chief Ball - the pool reporters began to smell cigar smoke. Turning around, I saw Kid Rock, who had performed at the inauguration eve rally, standing behind us on the small press riser, cigar and beverage in hand.\n\nThe day was full of other unforgettable moments. My job as the pool reporter representing print media was to track presidential movements. Before noon, I covered President Joe Biden, who most notably and controversially issued preemptive pardons for his siblings and their spouses moments before his term expired. After noon, I covered Mr. Trump, including as he signed an explosive order pardoning more than 1,500 participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, which happened after he lost the 2020 election.\n\nAt that moment, I thought of the family and supporters outside the Washington, D.C., jail whom I had recently interviewed - and who prayed for such pardons.\n\nThroughout the day, I described the in-person events as they happened. As President Biden and the first lady greeted the Trumps upon their arrival for morning tea at the White House, I was standing on a riser outside the North Portico. Mr. Biden was asked, \"What's your message today?\"\n\n\"Joy,\" he said. And then after a pause, \"Hope.\"\n\nTyping up my pool report with frozen thumbs into my iPhone, I could only think, \"I'm so glad I dressed for the weather and not for the occasion!\"\n\nIt was 23 degrees Fahrenheit outside and windy, which is why the inauguration ceremony was moved inside. But I knew I'd be spending time outside anyway, which turned out to be more than I expected. Not only was there an arrival by the Trumps, but there was also the arrival of Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband. Not on the schedule was the arrival of incoming Vice President Vance and his wife, for a greeting with the soon-to-depart second couple.\n\nI knew we'd be attending inaugural balls that evening, and I didn't want to look like a slob. But wearing a dress and heels in the bitter cold didn't make sense. So I wore black jeans, fur-lined Ugg boots, and a scruffy L.L. Bean barn jacket.\n\nThat night, as we parted the sea of gown- and tuxedo-clad ballgoers at each gala to head to our press stations, I didn't care what I looked like. I was just glad not to have frostbite.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Trump took the oath of office inside the Capitol rotunda, around noon on Monday, I had a feeling that we had gone through the looking glass: All we can expect is the unexpected. I wasn't actually in the rotunda for that portion of the day. A separate Capitol press pool handled that reporting, while the White House pool sat in a hearing room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and watched the proceedings on C-Span.\n\nI was just glad to be indoors and able to eat something. Soon we were outside again, watching the Bidens say their farewells and fly off in Nighthawk 46, a Black Hawk military helicopter. With that, the Biden era was over, and the Trump era had resumed.\n\nThe inaugural parade that evening, held inside Washington's 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, was a sight to behold. Marching bands from Mississippi, Tennessee, and Mr. Vance's hometown high school in Middletown, Ohio, performed, as did a corps of whirring bagpipes from New York. First responders from Butler, Pennsylvania, where Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt last July, also marched.\n\nMr. Trump's return to the Oval Office that evening, for the first time in four years, created the biggest news of the day , as he signed orders and fielded press questions. He seemed completely at home, almost as if he had never left.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nAt one point, prompted by a reporter's question, Mr. Trump reached into the Resolute Desk - made of timbers from the British ship HMS Resolute and given to President Rutherford B. Hayes by Queen Victoria - and pulled out a letter from Mr. Biden. This letter from the departing president to the incoming one has become a tradition.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Biden had declined to say what he had written to his successor. Mr. Trump started to open the letter in front of the press, and then thought the better of it. Some things, it seems, are better left for later.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He said he \"believe[s] raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nDec. 02, 2024, 11:33 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nPresident Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, sparing the younger Mr. Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family.\n\nThe Democratic president had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. The move on the night of Dec. 1 comes weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House.\n\nIt caps a long-running legal saga for the younger Mr. Biden, who publicly disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020 - a month after his father's 2020 victory - and casts a pall over the elder Mr. Biden's legacy.\n\nMr. Biden, who time and again pledged to Americans that he would restore norms and respect for the rule of law after Mr. Trump's first term in office, ultimately used his position to help his son, breaking his public pledge to Americans that he would do no such thing.\n\nIn a statement released the evening of Dec. 1, Mr. Biden said, \"I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nThe president's sweeping pardon covers not just the gun and tax offenses against the younger Mr. Biden, but also any other \"offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\"\n\nIn June, Mr. Biden categorically ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son, telling reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case, \"I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.\"\n\nAs recently as Nov. 8, days after Mr. Trump's victory, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Mr. Biden, saying, \"We've been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.\"\n\nThe elder Mr. Biden has publicly stood by his only living son as Hunter descended into serious drug addiction and threw his family life into turmoil before getting back on track in recent years. The president's political rivals have long used Hunter Biden's myriad mistakes as a political cudgel against his father: In one hearing, lawmakers displayed photos of the drug-addled president's son half-naked in a seedy hotel.\n\nHouse Republicans also sought to use the younger Mr. Biden's years of questionable overseas business ventures in a since-abandoned attempt to impeach his father, who has long denied involvement in his son's dealings or benefiting from them in any way.\n\n\"The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,\" Mr. Biden said in his statement. \"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.\"\n\n\"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,\" Mr. Biden added, claiming he made the decision this weekend.\n\nThe president had spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, with Hunter and his family, and departed for Angola later Dec. 1 on what may be his last foreign trip as president before leaving office on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nHunter Biden was convicted in June in Delaware federal court of three felonies for purchasing a gun in 2018 when, prosecutors said, he lied on a federal form by claiming he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.\n\nHe had been set to stand trial in September in the California case accusing him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. But he agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges in a surprise move hours after jury selection was set to begin.\n\nDavid Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who negotiated the plea deal, was subsequently named a special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to have more autonomy over the prosecution of the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden said he was pleading guilty in that case to spare his family more pain and embarrassment after the gun trial aired salacious details about his struggles with a crack cocaine addiction.\n\nThe tax charges carry up to 17 years behind bars and the gun charges are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though federal sentencing guidelines were expected to call for far less time and it was possible he would have avoided prison time entirely.\n\nHunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced this month in the two federal cases, which the special counsel brought after a plea deal with prosecutors that likely would have spared him prison time fell apart under scrutiny by a judge. Under the original deal, Hunter was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and would have avoided prosecution in the gun case as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nBut the plea hearing quickly unraveled last year when the judge raised concerns about unusual aspects of the deal. The younger Mr. Biden was subsequently indicted in the two cases.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team this weekend released a 52-page white paper titled \"The political prosecutions of Hunter Biden,\" describing the president's son as a \"surrogate to attack and injure his father, both as a candidate in 2020 and later as president.\"\n\nThe younger Mr. Biden's lawyers have long argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict the president's son amid heavy criticism by Mr. Trump and other Republicans of what they called the \"sweetheart\" plea deal.\n\nRep. James Comer, one of the Republican chairmen leading congressional investigations into Mr. Biden's family, blasted the president's pardon, saying that the evidence against Hunter was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability,\" Comer said on X, the website formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMr. Biden is hardly the first president to deploy his pardon powers to benefit those close to him.\n\nIn his final weeks in office, Mr. Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in law, Jared Kushner, as well as multiple allies convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Mr. Trump over the weekend announced plans to nominate the elder Mr. Kushner to be the U.S. envoy to France in his next administration.\n\nMr. Trump, who has pledged to dramatically overhaul and install loyalists across the Justice Department after he was prosecuted for his role in trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election, said in a social media post on Dec. 1 that Hunter Biden's pardon was \"such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice.\"\n\n\"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\" Mr. Trump asked, referring to those convicted in the violent Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.\n\nHunter Biden said in an emailed statement that he will never take for granted the relief granted to him and vowed to devote the life he has rebuilt \"to helping those who are still sick and suffering.\"\n\n\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction - mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,\" the younger Mr. Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team filed the night of Dec. 1 in both Los Angeles and Delaware asking the judges handling his gun and tax cases to immediately dismiss them, citing the pardon.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr. Weiss did not respond to messages seeking comment the night of Dec. 1.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Biden's family starts discussing his possible exit plan from the 2024 race\n\nWASHINGTON - Members of President Joe Biden's family have discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe overall tone of the conversations has been that any exit plan - should Biden decide to take that step, as some of his closest allies increasingly believe he will - should put the party in the best position to beat former President Donald Trump while also being worthy of the more than five decades he has served the country in elected office, these people said.\n\nBiden's family members have specifically discussed how he would want to end his re-election bid on his own timing and with a carefully calculated plan in place. Considerations about the impact of the campaign on his health, his family and the stability of the country are among those at the forefront of the discussions, the people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe prospect of Biden's considering stepping aside, much less that his family is gaming out a possible exit plan, is an extraordinary development that comes after he has repeatedly said he would not relinquish his position as the presumptive nominee of the party.\n\nBut concerns have mounted among party leaders, donors and even officials who are part of his re-election effort with every day that has passed since a devastating debate three weeks ago. At the same time, Democrats are watching Republicans rally around Trump, who just survived an assassination attempt and accepted his party's nomination Thursday night.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates denied that any such exit discussions are happening amongst the family.\n\n\"That is not happening, period,\" he said. \"The individuals making those claims are not speaking for his family or his team - and they will be proven wrong. Keep the faith.\"\n\nOn MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged that the campaign has seen some \"slippage,\" but she said it's been \"a small movement\" and insisted Biden is \"absolutely\" still in the race.\n\nRon Klain, Biden's former White House chief of staff and an adviser to him for decades, said in an interview that Biden is hearing the public and private calls for him to exit the race.\n\n\"I think he's feeling the pressure,\" said Klain, who has spoken to Biden recently. \"I want him to stay in.\"\n\nKlain's take is that it makes no sense for Biden to be pushed aside. He said some in his party underestimate Trump at their own peril and undervalue the fact that Biden is the only one who has beaten him before.\n\nBiden and the people closest to him have felt burned by efforts to push him out that they see as backhanded and disrespectful . The family is distraught and moving through the stages of anger and grief over how people they perceived to be friends have treated the president.\n\n\"There was a much more dignified way to do this if this is what they wanted,\" a Biden ally said. \"This is no way to treat a public servant who has done a lot for this country.\"\n\nDiscussions about how to game out a fitting plan for Biden to step aside have also played out among senior staff members, not just the president's family, according to a person close to the re-election effort. Bates also denied these discussions are happening.\n\nThe family members Biden has relied on most include first lady Jill Biden, his son Hunter and his sister, Valerie Owens, as well as a few longtime close aides who have been at the core of the discussions.\n\nThe conversations about Biden's political future have raged while he remains at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sidelined after he tested positive for Covid on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, some of Biden's closest aides were calling trusted allies to get a sense of where they thought his political standing is, according to a person familiar with the phone calls.\n\nA Democratic lawmaker described Biden in this moment as \"reflective.\" A third person close to Biden described the president as politically \"fighting for his life.\"\n\nThere are growing expectations among some allies that if Biden were to exit, it could be in the coming days. But they also caution that it still is up to him to make the decision and that he is not wired to quit even when he faces seemingly insurmountable adversity.\n\nAbout the possibility any announcement is imminent, a person close to the Bidens said, \"We don't even know what we're doing tomorrow.\"\n\nStill, Biden is not insusceptible to the mounting pressure from his own party, and he has said himself since the debate that he may consider leaving the race if there were no path for him to win.\n\n\"I think it's inevitable,\" a second person close to the re-election effort said of Biden's withdrawing from the race.\n\nAs reports surfaced, including from NBC News , that Biden had shown signs that he could budge from his insistence that he remain the nominee, rumors and reports - some that the president's allies flatly denied - began to fly. They included speculation about timing of a potential exit, whether Biden would immediately endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and who was on the shortlist to be her vice presidential running mate.\n\nAmong the reports: that longtime speechwriter and historian Jon Meacham was penning Biden's exit remarks.\n\nMeacham rebuffed the account.\n\n\"The report is totally false,\" he said.\n\nAmid the turmoil the Biden campaign sent out talking points to Democrats, according to a Democratic strategies: \"President Biden has not spoken to congressional leadership today. The president is his party's nominee, having won 14 million votes during the Democratic primary. He's running for re-election, and that will not change until he wins re-election.\"\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nAs many in his own party turned against him, Biden continued this week to check in with allies and gauge their sentiments.\n\n\"With all the rumors that I'm leaving, I'm not,\" Biden told the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, in a phone call Monday, Sharpton said.\n\n\"I will support whatever you decide,\" Sharpton said he told the president.\n\nSharpton said in an interview Thursday that legacy is something Biden \"has to think of\" as he contemplates his political future. \"If there's anyone that could make a comeback ... it's Joe Biden. Whether he chooses to or not, I don't know.\"\n\nSome in Biden's camp had hoped he would be able to weather the storm of pressure for him to step aside - that news events, including the Republican National Convention, would turn the national conversation away from whether and when he might end his campaign. But even the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday did little to quell the furor around Biden. If anything, Democrats have since turned up the heat.\n\nA major factor driving the private pressure on Biden is the fear among Democrats that his candidacy could rob them not only of the White House and the Senate but also of a chance to flip the House to their control. That helps explain why senior lawmakers have pushed on Biden to reconsider his decision to stay in the race.\n\n\"The House is on the brink,\" said Brian Wolff, the treasurer of the House Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting House Democratic candidates. \"These candidates don't deserve that.\"\n\nWolff said Democratic incumbents and challengers in tough races cannot risk splintering their own voter coalitions by publicly taking one side or the other as Biden considers his options.\n\n\"They can't afford to alienate the base that wants to support Biden or the base that wants someone else,\" he said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "'We're close to the end': Biden world braces for the possibility that the president steps aside\n\nWASHINGTON - President Joe Biden's political world is collapsing. Top allies have either publicly or privately called on him to step aside. Major donors have fallen off a cliff. Grassroots fundraising is not keeping up with the demands of a campaign that needs to aggressively scale up three months before the presidential election. Members of his own re-election effort have already declared he has no path.\n\nSince a disastrous debate in Atlanta upended the trajectory of his campaign three weeks ago, Biden has again and again attempted to dig in, bucking efforts to dislodge him from power.\n\nBut there is now a palpable sense that the ground has shifted from under him, according to five people with knowledge of the situation, even among some of the president's most defiant backers internally who now believe the writing is on the wall.\n\n\"We're close to the end,\" a person close to Biden said.\n\nThat person, who previously doubted Biden would ever step aside, acknowledged that it's the president's decision but joined in the array of Biden allies who say he is nearing a point of no return.\n\nAs the extraordinary events unfolded, the president tested positive with Covid and has retreated to his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., taking him off the campaign trail. Once again, it offered a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump, who, even after his brush with death on Saturday, will appear at a raucous coronation at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee Thursday night.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff also made a remarkable public call for the president to abandon the Democratic nomination, a move that ended up exposing that other Democratic leaders - including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi , and Sen. Chuck Schumer - had brought dire concerns , supported by polling, to the president indicating that he risked taking down the control of Congress with him if he continued on the same path.\n\nIn the hours after an attempted assassination on Trump last weekend, some Democrats said - even feared - that the calls for Biden to step aside would be \"frozen\" as the president dealt with a national crisis. But that faded quickly. Some allies now say that the episode, which has caused an even more intense rallying around Trump with his party, only makes it more glaringly obvious that the nagging narrative of whether Biden is on a cognitive decline cannot win the White House.\n\nA person with knowledge of the projections said the Biden campaign now expects it will only raise 25% of the big donor money it had originally projected to raise in July - that's a further downgrade from the expectation last week that large-dollar fundraising would be down by as much as 50%. The money has \"dried up,\" this person said.\n\nOne Democratic lawmaker on Wednesday said if Biden didn't agree to step aside, the cacophony of calls would grow only louder, with more lawmakers expected to urge him to do so. The lawmaker called it a \"sad moment\" for the party.\n\nA sense of reality is beginning to wash over some of the president's top campaign lieutenants, who have endured streams of phone calls from donors and one-time supporters flagging that they cannot back Biden.\n\nA person who spoke with a senior campaign official said a sense of a new reality has fallen over the campaign.\n\n\"They're finally realizing; it's a when, not if,\" the person said.\n\nThere has been a shift behind the scenes in the president's openness to stepping aside, according to multiple people close to Biden, despite his aggressive insistence in public appearances and private phone calls with allies that he is not going anywhere.\n\nBiden had already, in the opinion of some of the president's aides, shown signs that if he were convinced he had no path \"he would not go forward with this,\" a person with knowledge of the president's conversations with aides said.\n\nNBC News previously reported that Biden's private conversations with aides grew more \"reality-based\" and included talk of how Biden's legacy could be defined by his having a prolonged stalemate with his own party or by losing the White House to Donald Trump, whom Biden himself has repeatedly warned is a danger to American democracy.\n\nOutwardly, campaign officials remain steadfast in their assertion that Biden isn't going anywhere.\n\n\"The president is feeling fine, he is self-isolating in Delaware,\" Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Biden campaign, said at a news conference in Milwaukee. \"Our campaign is not working through any scenarios where President Biden is not the top of the ticket. He is and will be the Democratic nominee.\"\n\nSince a televised debate where Biden appeared confused, at times unable to complete a sentence, his every move has been scrutinized. Biden accelerated his usually severely limited media exposure to demonstrate he can make a cogent argument for reelection.\n\n\"I'm old,\" Biden told NBC News' Lester Holt in an interview on Monday . \"But I'm only three years older than Trump, No. 1. And No. 2, my mental acuity's been pretty damn good. I've gotten more done than any president has in a long, long time in 31⁄2 years. So I'm willing to be judged on that.\"\n\nBut rather than allay concerns, Biden's exposure only intensified them among allies. Biden has stumbled, mixing up names and seeming to lose his train of thought.\n\nBefore coming off the trail on Wednesday, for instance, Biden mistakenly called Nevada's Democratic state attorney general the state's governor, who is a Republican, according to a pool report of the exchange.\n\n\"Sad,\" is how one close Biden ally described the dynamic around the president.\n\n\"There's no excitement in this campaign at all,\" another ally said.\n\nSome Biden aides have cautioned that the campaign has picked up on some voter anger in battleground states over the feeling that people are trying to chase the president they voted for off the ballot.\n\nAnd even as the calls for Biden to step aside grow louder, a campaign official said as of this past weekend, said no one had yet presented a detailed plan for an alternative to Biden.\n\nBiden at one point said he might consider stepping aside if he were told there was no path. In an interview that aired Wednesday evening, Biden said there was something else that would prompt him to reevaluate his campaign.\n\n\"If I have some medical condition that emerged,\" Biden suggested. \"If somebody, if the doctors came to me and said you got this problem, that problem.\"\n\nCarol E.

      "text": "Charting the Biden economy: Despite all the growth and jobs, a deeply unpopular president\n\nTo the untrained eye, Joe Biden leaves the presidency with what appears to be a sterling economic record: hiring proceeding at a solid clip, gross domestic product on the rise and consumers still spending at a strong pace.\n\nThere's just one problem, and it is one that will forever taint Biden's legacy, the one that sank him and his party politically and for which he will always be remembered.\n\nInflation and its onerous burden on households, particularly those at the lower end of the income spectrum, has dwarfed all the other good that happened on Biden's watch. Even with the pace of inflation slowing markedly from its mid-2022 peak, consumers, investors and business owners continually cite it as their most pressing issue.\n\n\"Biden inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the pandemic, and he's bequeathing an economy that's flying high,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"Having said that, there are blemishes in the minds of many Americans ... They feel ripped off.\"\n\nSo even with an unemployment rate down dramatically from when he took office, even with growth at 3%, and even with an economy that is cited by top officials as the envy of the rest of the world, the Biden economic story is one that has an unhappy ending as Donald Trump prepares to head back to the White House on Monday.\n\n\"To me, that is the lasting legacy and differentiator between the two administrations,\" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities and a senior economist in the first Trump administration. \"Inflation was two-and-a-half times higher under President Biden than it was under President Trump. That essentially was the key catalyst for the return to Trump's policy, which was one of very good growth and low and stable inflation.\"\n\nBiden leaves office with just a 36% approval rating overall, the lowest point of his presidency, with just 33% approving of the way he handled the economy, according to a CNN poll .\n\nA look through various data points helps tell the story of inflation and how that has fed into the perception about the economy as a whole.\n\nIndeed, the cumulative inflation rate during Trump's first term from 2017-21 was below 8%, as measured by the consumer price index . For Biden, it's been 21%. That the economy has expanded in real terms by 11% under Biden - compared to 8.6% under Trump - doesn't seem to matter. Inflation peaked above 9% in June 2022 and has stayed above the Federal Reserve's 2% target every month since March 2021.\n\nAs the prices of various goods and services increased and stayed elevated, wages have struggled to keep pace. Even with a pickup in 2024, the 19% increase in average hourly earnings under Biden is still below the inflation rate.\n\nConsequently, the disparity between wages and prices has pushed consumer confidence 6% lower under Biden than when he took office, as measured by the widely followed University of Michigan sentiment survey . That's saying something considering that when Biden took office in January 2021 the economy was still under the shadow of Covid, with many folks choosing to spend the holiday season in late 2020 away from friends and family because of the spread of the omicron variant.\n\nWhy are consumers feeling so blue?\n\nAfter all, even though the price of eggs has soared 180% in four years, household net worth has surged and consumers have continued spending. Retail sales have grown more than 20% and household net worth now totals $169 trillion, or 28% higher than at the end of 2020, according to Fed data.\n\nThe big contributors to the household balance sheet have been a meteoric if volatile rise in stocks as well as the value of real estate.\n\nSince Biden took over, tech companies, powered by advancements in artificial intelligence, have pushed equity prices ever higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average alone has risen more than 40%, and the Nasdaq Composite, which is weighted more towards Silicon Valley high-flyers, has jumped close to 50%.\n\nHome prices during the same period have pushed 24% higher, while the value of real estate at the household level has risen 42%, according to the Fed.\n\nStill, the dream of home ownership has grown more and more elusive as prices have risen and borrowing rates have gone with them. The typical 30-year mortgage rate is over 7% now, more than double where it was in January 2021.\n\nThe surge in wealth, particularly in the stock market, also has skewed benefits, mostly tilting toward those with the resources to buy stocks.\n\nThe share of total net worth held by the richest 1% stands at 30.8%, its highest in about three years, according to Fed data. Similarly, 1 percenters control just shy of 50% of all stock market-related wealth , a number that also has gradually increasedover the past few years. The lowest 50% of earners hold just 1% of stock market wealth, a number that actually has doubled during the Biden years.\n\nAll of the various metrics seem to tie back into the inflation question and how we got here.\n\nEconomists and policymakers diagnose the issue similarly, though there are some diversions: Supply-demand imbalances at the beginning of the pandemic drove up the costs for goods over services by hitting supply chains. Trillions in fiscal and monetary stimulus aimed at stemming the damage from Covid exacerbated the issue by sending too much money chasing too few goods. Finally, a monetary response in the form of, first low then high interest rates that even Fed officials have admitted was slow-footed helped stoke prices further.\n\nBiden lobbed a fusillade of fiscal ammunition at the post-Covid economy, including the controversial $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that critics say added to the inflation burden, though supporters say the measures provided critical infrastructure and climate mitigation spending that will yield benefits for years to come.\n\n\"We have had very good growth and we've had a reasonably strong labor market,\" LaVorgna said. \"The question is, at what price?\"\n\nThe labor market in fact has been powerful, cranking out millions of jobs as employers sought to meet their own supply-demand mismatch that at one point had open positions outnumbering available workers by a 2-to-1 margin. The Biden economy has seen the unemployment rate slashed by more than 2 percentage points, and looking stable lately despite a blip higher in mid-2024.\n\nAgain, though, it all seems to come back to inflation.\n\nThe price to which LaVorgna alluded came in the form of a bloated federal budget in which the deficit hit $1.8 trillion in 2024 and is tracking so far in well north of that in fiscal 2025 to finance a $36.2 trillion debt. Taxpayers last year shelled out more than $1 trillion just in interest costs on the debt, and are expected to pay some $1.2 trillion this year, a total that eclipses all other outlays except Social Security, defense and healthcare.\n\nThe 6% deficit to GDP ratio the government is running is unheard of in an expansionary economy. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. had not run a shortfall that massive relative to total output since 1945 as the nation was escaping the World War II economy.\n\nThe tab, then, will be picked up future generations saddled with today's debt and deficits.\n\n\"That's a problem, a big problem,\" Zandi said.\n\nIn fact, much of the job growth has come in government and health care, both sectors linked to expansionary fiscal policy, as well as leisure and hospitality, a sector that took until May 2024 to regain the jobs it lost during Covid.\n\nDespite the challenges that abound, most officials say the U.S. economy is healthy.\n\nZandi said his global clients frequently ask him what the \"secret sauce\" is that has kept the U.S. so vibrant compared to its global counterparts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell , who frequently has called the U.S. fiscal path \"unsustainable,\" said he gets similar questions.\n\n\"In these international meetings that I attend, this has been the story .. how well the U.S. is doing,\" Powell said at a December news conference . \"If you look around the world, there's just a lot of slow growth and continued struggles with inflation. So I feel very good about where the economy is and the performance of the economy, and we want to keep that going.\"\n\nUncertainty over where the Fed is headed, though, is a cloud that will hang over the Trump economy.\n\nThe central bank spiked its key borrowing rate by 5.25 percentage points during its inflation fight but has lowered it a full point since then as officials grow more comfortable with where inflation is heading. However, there's considerable uncertainty over what happens from here, with markets cautiously pricing in another quarter- or half-point in cuts for the remainder of 2025.\n\nAs Biden walks away from the White House, he leaves behind myriad questions of what could have been done to make things better - and how it easily could have been worse.\n\n\"Economists looking at this 20 years from now are going to view this as quite an amazing performance,\" Zandi said. \"The story here is still not over. But my sense is history will judge this period as one to follow in future crises.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden administration looks for ways to keep TikTok available in the U.S.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration is considering ways to keep TikTok available in the U.S. if a ban that's scheduled to go into effect on Sunday proceeds, according to three people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\"Americans shouldn't expect to see TikTok suddenly banned on Sunday,\" an administration official said, adding that officials are \"exploring options\" for how to implement the law so that TikTok does not go dark on Sunday.\n\nIf the administration moves forward with any such plan, it would mean that the popular app going down would not define his last full day in office, and it would defer the issue to Donald Trump, who is inaugurated on Monday.\n\nAt the same time, Mike Waltz, the incoming national security adviser for Trump, told Fox News Wednesday that the president-elect is ready to intervene to preserve access to the Chinese-owned video app in the American marketplace. And Pam Bondi, Trump's pick for attorney general, refused to commit to enforcing the ban when asked about it during her Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\nTaken together, the moves represent parallel efforts by the rival presidents to execute an end run around Congress and the Supreme Court, which is teed up to issue a ruling on the ban at any time.\n\nStill, a White House official insisted that not enforcing the ban, if it is upheld, is not an option.\n\n\"We are not considering deferring enforcement,\" the official said. \"Statutorily, we don't believe we have the authority to do that.\"\n\nBiden and Trump's positions are reversals from their one-time support for banning the app.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on the plan.\n\nTikTok is considering its options, including the last-ditch possibility that the app goes dark on Sunday, though it could also allow the app to remain active but without future updates and bug fixes.\n\nThe law in question required ByteDance, TikTok's China-based owner, to divest from the company and find an outside buyer to take over within nine months. That window closes Sunday. The law also provided the president authority to grant a one-time 90-day extension if \" significant progress \" has been made toward that divestment.\n\nThe measure was enacted in the name of national security, as lawmakers believed Americans' data was at risk of being compromised by China, or that China could influence Americans through controlling content on TikTok. TikTok - which has long said those concerns are meritless - and some of its users sued to block the law, challenging it from a First Amendment standpoint.\n\nWithout a sale, a reprieve for TikTok would mean that those national security concerns would, at least for now, remain unresolved.\n\nBut just days ahead of the potential ban, throngs of American TikTok users have downloaded other Chinese alternatives that pose similar security issues.\n\nTrump, who tried and failed to implement a ban during his first term, vowed on the campaign trail last year to \"save TikTok.\" Biden signed the ban into law as part of a $95 billion measure providing aid to Ukraine and Israel in April. But now his White House is looking to take the teeth out of the law.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a longtime Biden ally, is among a small set of lawmakers who have appealed to the White House and the Supreme Court to stop the ban.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that President Biden will listen to the millions of voices who don't want the lights to go out on this app,\" Khanna said. \"He has the power to extend the timeline to try to have a solution that prevents the app from shutting down.\"\n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also said that he has relayed his concerns about the ban to White House officials and asked them to delay it.\n\nHe said they replied that they \"would take it under consideration\" but didn't give a clear answer of what would happen.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nLate last month, Trump filed a brief with the Supreme Court urging it to hold off on implementing that part of the law, so that the incoming president could \"pursue a negotiated resolution\" to prevent a TikTok shutdown. In that brief, Trump's attorney John Sauer argued that the president-elect \"received a powerful electoral mandate from American voters to protect the free-speech rights of all Americans - including the 170 million Americans who use TikTok.\"\n\nDays later, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to ask : \"Why would I want to get rid of TikTok?\"\n\nHe attached a graphic showing his broad reach on the short-form video app, which claims 170 million U.S. users.\n\nLast week, Supreme Court justices did not appear convinced by TikTok's free speech arguments, though it could decide to temporarily block the law while still ruling against the social media company.\n\nDuring arguments , Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to Congress finding that TikTok's parent company is subject to Chinese laws requiring it to assist in intelligence gathering.\n\n\"So are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" he asked.\n\nIn addressing the free speech concerns, Roberts said that \"Congress doesn't care about what's on TikTok.\"\n\nThe law is \"not saying TikTok has to stop,\" he added. \"They're saying China has to stop controlling TikTok.\"\n\nWhile TikTok's Asia-headquarters are located in Singapore, its parent company ByteDance resides in Beijing.\n\nSome congressional Republicans who voted for the TikTok law said they expect Trump to step in and negotiate a sale to U.S. interests once he takes office.\n\n\"They have to divest by law, so Trump could play an effective role by finding a buyer ... He fancies himself as a top negotiator,\" said Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, a China hawk who was chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee when Congress passed the legislation last year. \"Otherwise, I guess it shuts down unless he can find a way to divest it.\"\n\n\"A lot of these influencers rely on TikTok,\" he continued. \"They don't want to switch over, but ByteDance is controlled out of Beijing. It's just not a threat to Congress but to our children.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said there is only one path for TikTok if it wants to continue operating in the U.S.: divestiture.\n\n\"Congress has already passed the bill,\" he said. \"What I'm hoping for is the owners of TikTok come forward and say, 'We will never share Americans' data with the Communist Party of China and here's how that will be enforced: divesting from the parent company.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

More elections with former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at CNN's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27, 2024. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs the Biden administration approaches its conclusion and transitions into its legacy phase, the events surrounding his health and cognitive vitality will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on the historical narrative.\n\nPresident Biden's cognitive decline , initially apparent during the debates and ultimately costing him the presidential nomination, continues to raise significant questions about who is and who was making the decisions in the White House.\n\nIf those around President Biden have obscured the impact of his age and health, it could represent a potential betrayal of democratic principles. Such actions deprive the electorate of the transparency essential for informed governance. This concealment consolidates power among unelected operatives, erodes public trust, and undermines the foundational tenets of accountability and constitutional leadership.\n\nHas something like this ever happened before?\n\nIt has-and under even more dramatic circumstances. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson suffered a catastrophic stroke, a debilitating event meticulously concealed from the American public. The resulting opacity in leadership profoundly and irreversibly altered the trajectory of United States history in the 20th century.\n\nThose who watched the debates witnessed it firsthand-President Biden's cognitive decline could no longer be concealed. Yet, efforts to obscure the reality were reportedly ongoing well before June 27, 2024. President Biden had become increasingly unavailable, relied heavily on scripted remarks, declined meetings and assumed a diminished role in governance, according to The Wall Street Journal . This troubling pattern culminated in a debate performance that laid these concerns bare. Far from mere speculation, these claims are substantiated by thorough reporting in The Wall Street Journal , drawing on 50 interviews with individuals closely acquainted with the administration.\n\nNegative stories were buried, The WSJ reported. The inner circle blockaded the president. Key members of Congress didn't have contact with Biden. Pivotal roles were played by unelected staff members. Even now, the Democratic leadership continues to assert that everything was fine in Camelot. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer maintained, as recently as last week, that Democrats did not gaslight the public.\n\nPolitical leanings may influence whether or not one perceives or declares this a scandal. But, at its core, this issue left the nation confronting a potential leadership vacuum. Tangible examples provided in the The Wall Street Journal piece include the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, where truncated or skipped cabinet meetings highlighted the potential absence of decisive executive direction. The question it raises is both unavoidable and urgent: who was-and who is-truly governing the country?\n\nThis scenario is not without a sobering precedent .\n\nAmerican politician Woodrow Wilson (1856 - 1924), President of the United States from 1913-1921, ... More goes over papers at his desk as his second wife Edith Bolling Galt Wilson (1872 - 1961) looks on, mid 1910s. Edith was often referred to as \"secret president\" because of the important role she played in Wilson's presidency during his long and debilitating illness following a stroke. (Photo by Stock Montage/Getty Images)\n\nA little over a century ago, the nation was confronted with a president demonstrably unfit to govern, though this reality was assiduously concealed from the American people. The repercussions shaped the trajectory of U.S. foreign policy in the 20th century.\n\nIn 1919, President Woodrow Wilson, in an exhausting bid to rally public support for U.S. entry into the League of Nations, embarked on an arduous speaking tour. On September 25, 1919, Wilson collapsed, and by October 2, he had suffered a debilitating right-sided stroke. This catastrophic event, his fourth, rendered him hemiplegic-unable to move his left hand or leg. The president, incapacitated, became dependent on others for the most basic activities of daily living, such as feeding himself. Even the act of signing his name presented an insurmountable challenge.\n\nThis was hidden from the American public and even Congress.\n\nAt the center of this unfolding drama was Dr. Cary Grayson, Wilson's White House physician and confidant. Grayson, bound by a combination of professional ethics and profound personal loyalty, acted with extraordinary secrecy. His relationship with Wilson extended well beyond the clinical; he had introduced Wilson to his second wife, Edith, tended to Wilson's sister during a medical emergency and accompanied the president to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Grayson had a truly meteoric ascent. In a short time, he went from assistant surgeon lieutenant to medical director and eventually rear admiral. This had inextricable ties to his proximity to the president.\n\nCould a man so enmeshed in his patient's personal and political fortunes truly render an objective diagnosis? In 1919, as in 2024, the question of whether loyalty can override duty to the public takes on a pressing urgency.\n\nThat question became acute when, four days after Wilson's catastrophic stroke, his cabinet convened to deliberate the nation's course. Then-Secretary of State Robert Lansing invoked Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which provides for the vice president to assume presidential duties in cases of incapacity. Yet Grayson refused to endorse or sign any documentation attesting to Wilson's disability, effectively quashing discussions of a transfer of power.\n\nFor the next 17 months, the reins of the presidency were, in practice, held by Edith Wilson. Acting as an intermediary, she filtered all communication to and from the bedridden president. Her role as de facto steward of executive power has been the subject of considerable historical debate, yet the fact remains that this extraordinary arrangement kept the true extent of Wilson's condition hidden from Congress and the public.\n\nThe consequences altered the history of the United States. The League of Nations, bereft of U.S. support, languished into impotence, and only in the aftermath of World War II did the United States begin to approximate Wilson's vision of a Pax Americana. Still, the ethical questions remain stark: Grayson, as my colleagues and I noted in a Journal of Neurosurgery paper , allowed patient-physician confidentiality to supersede national security at a critical juncture in history. This decision, framed by loyalty and political considerations, obscured the president's infirmity at a moment of pivotal international consequence.\n\nCharitably interpreted, Grayson's actions ignite a debate about the intricate interplay of professional ethics, personal loyalty and the bonds forged through years of medical care. Less generously, they suggest a pernicious entanglement of political ambition and institutional inertia - a reluctance of those governing to relinquish power, even when the governed are ill-served.\n\nHistory will tell us."

This includes those serving disproportionate sentences for cannabis.\n\nPresident Biden's clemency, one of his final acts as his presidency draws to a close, signifies yet another step of his toward repairing the injustices caused by the War on Drugs.\n\nSarah Gersten, executive director and general counsel at Last Prisoner Project , a nonprofit focused on cannabis criminal justice reform, hailed Biden's milestone move. \"This historic decision offers hope-not just for those freed today, but for all the individuals still incarcerated for cannabis and their families that have been impacted by the War on Drugs,\" she said in a public statement . \"President Biden's actions remind us that meaningful change is possible when people work together and listen to what is needed to provide true justice through second chances.\"\n\nIn October 2022, President Biden said he would be pardoning all people convicted of marijuana possession under federal law from 1992 to 2021. At that time, he also urged U.S. governors to take similar action for state offenses of civil possession of marijuana.\n\nIn June 2024, Biden's call was heeded by Maryland Governor Wes Moore who signed an executive order that would erase more than 175,000 marijuana-related convictions.\n\nUnfortunately, not all is rosy on the marijuana rescheduling front. Though progress was made during Biden's administration, there have been setbacks. Earlier this week, DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John Mulrooney II c anceled a hearing on rescheduling for next week. With the incoming Trump presidency and his choice to lead the DEA pulling out -and no replacement appointment in the offing-the future of rescheduling seems paused indefinitely."

More former U.S. President Donald Trump participate in the CNN Presidential Debate at the CNN Studios on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia. President Biden and former President Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nRetirement decisions are always complex and rarely easy. As a veteran retirement researcher who has written books on the subject, I find myself sympathetic to President Biden's reluctance to \"step aside\" and retire. While this is a unique situation, his response is in fact quite normal.\n\nIt makes perfect sense that President Biden is \" defiant ,\" as many have called him. Most people in his situation would be. Given the psychological and social factors involved here, President Biden would have to be extraordinary to give into pressure and voluntarily give up working, despite being well beyond the traditional retirement age - most people don't work past 70 .\n\nPresident Biden and his wife are among the minority of older workers who are still on the job but able to retire in financial comfort (about one-third of older workers are in that fortunate position.) These voluntary older workers are more likely to have high job satisfaction and a strong sense of professional identity because they have relatively more authority, status, and control over their work (especially if you are president of the United States). Older individuals in positions of power are much less likely to retire. Being boss, especially at older ages, is fun.\n\nMany world leaders, notably President Ronald Reagan and UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, stayed on the job despite their infirmities. Bosses are more likely to get microbursts of serotonin throughout the day with genuine or sycophantic \"atta Boys\" and other sources of praise that produce a sense of satisfaction. When President Biden told George Stephanopoulos last Friday that he has a cognitive test every day on the job, I interpreted what he said through my research findings - that people frequently tell him he is correct and smart and that makes him feel good.\n\nFeeling good is another reason why older workers who are promoted at work are less likely to retire voluntarily - being promoted gives us validation and rewards. For someone like President Biden, the prospect of retirement seems wrong because he has been promoted to the very tip-top of the hierarchy. He told Stephanopoulos, \"I'm running the world.\"\n\nSpouses' labor force participation matters, too. Older workers are less likely to retire if their spouse is still working. Dr. Jill Biden's active career as a college professor could be another factor contributing to President Biden's decision to continue working.\n\nAn enduring finding in retirement research is that being forced to retire is one of the worst things that can happen to you. Sadly, more than half of Americans (52%) are forced to retire before they planned on it, and are thus more likely to report being more depressed and anxious. No wonder President Biden says repeatedly he is not leaving.\n\nIn the private sector, CEOs are often subject to mandatory retirement - which has a sweet side in removing the negative social stigma of having to step aside. What others your age are doing plays a crucial role in the retirement decision.\n\nPresident Biden is surrounded by elder peers who are still active in their careers, making him less likely to view retirement as an appealing or dignified option. Biden's contemporaries - such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Representative Nancy Pelosi, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and especially his most relevant peer, his rival former President Donald Trump - are not retiring, either. This only makes it tougher for Biden to leave when peers in his age group are staying on.\n\nPointing to peers who have retired, like President George Washington, ameliorates the peer effect somewhat. However, Washington's and Pope Benedict's retirements - a precedent set after 600 years - were vastly different. Their decisions to step down were driven by a desire to set a precedent for leadership transitions and they were voluntary decisions; they had complete control. They both retired voluntarily and with a sense of accomplishment and being at their peak.\n\nPresident Biden's reluctance is understandable - but retirement decisions can shift quickly. A click of insight that your retirement can be generative - \"making way for someone younger\" is often on the lips of the retiree - can change one's mind. As can the insight that past presidents contribute mightily - just look at Jimmy Carter .\n\nFinding meaning in retirement will be the secret sauce for Biden to move quickly from this current job to President Emeritus. Everyone deserves a dignified retirement. And choice is key, since being pushed out is hard on a heart, soul, and body."

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover the cannabis industry, psychedelics, culture, and innovation.\n\nBy Lindsey Bartlett ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on infrastructure at the Portland Air National Guard base ... More on April 21, 2022 in Portland, Oregon.\n\nA recent poll found positive impressions of President Biden improve by double-digits if he reschedules cannabis.\n\nThe youth rejoiced when President Biden pushed through hard-fought financial aid in the form an additional $5 billion in student loan forgiveness. This move will offer relief to 793,000 Americans who borrowed money for college.\n\nNow, the younger generation of voters aged 18-25 asks that President Biden keep his other campaign promise of freeing America's cannabis prisoners and decriminalizing weed. This reality is driven home by the Lake Research Partners poll that was funded by the Coalition for Cannabis Scheduling Reform (CCSR).\n\nPolitico first reported that the majority of the youngest generation of voters strongly want President Biden to move forward with rescheduling cannabis. \"Voters ages 18-25 register some of the strongest levels of support for rescheduling,\" the poll reads, \"with 65% favoring rescheduling, including nearly half who feel that way strongly.\"\n\nTwo-thirds of voters believe the President should accept the recent HHS recommendation to reschedule cannabis to Schedule 3. Among voters 18-25, a whopping 84% believe President Biden should accept the recommendation. This compares to 13% who say Biden should somehow try to block the reschedule. The numbers reflect an 11-point swing overall, including a double-digit +11-point swing with younger voters aged 18-25.\n\nUNITED STATES - APRIL 28: Members of the DC Marijuana Justice community hold a 51 blow-up joint on ...

(Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nThere are so many benefits to the cannabis platform if President Biden makes it a priority. That's why he ran on it . Cannabis decriminalization is popular and bipartisan. There's nothing America agrees on more than weed. The Lake Research poll found that 74% of Democrats and 55% of independents support rescheduling cannabis. 70% of citizens believe weed should be legal, a record high according to the latest Gallup poll . A whopping 80% of Democrats in America want cannabis to be legal.\n\nThat reflects the Democratic party majority . That is a lot of people. It would drastically help Democrats in the 2024 election. Young Americans, among Biden's strongest-performing demographics in 2020, have seen the largest drop in approval ratings among any age group. The President needs their vote.\n\nAnother study found that 57% of all adults want people with past convictions to be cleared for nonviolent marijuana charges. While President Biden signaled he would expunge the records of American citizens who have been charged with Federal cannabis possession, it's helped a relatively small amount of convictions. One analyst found the move freed 0 people who were currently incarcerated . On December 22, 2023, a recent double-down on this stance granted clemency to 11 people . The majority of cannabis prisoners are locked up at the state level, not federal. In 2024, 19 states still jail people for non-violent cannabis possession misdemeanors.\n\n\"Just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the use or possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either,\" said Biden in the recent statement.\n\nU.S. Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware addresses Drexel University Alumni. Biden was the youngest ... More U.S. Senator at that time.\n\nBiden's messaging is correct, but his actions fall short. This is an urgent matter for the 40,000 people sitting in jail and prison for this plant. American citizens are suffering in private prison systems over a plant that is legal in 24 states . This is a grave injustice. This issue determines their entire life. Action is needed for these citizens who have been hit hardest by some of his earlier policies . Biden can change his mind. He has before.\n\n\"Criminal records for marijuana use and possession have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities,\" President Biden said. \"Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It's time that we right these wrongs.\"\n\nAmerica has the largest amount of its own citizens in prison than any country on earth- 2.1 million. They lose on average 2.6 years of their lives. ACLU data found that states waste a cumulative $3 billion enforcing cannabis laws every year. Black Americans are 3.7x more likely to be arrested for cannabis, the ACLU documented in its data report from 2020 called A Tale Of Two Americas . I'm sad to say these numbers have not improved since Biden took office. Federal cannabis arrests have increased by 25% under the Biden admin's watch.\n\nDozens of varieties of marijuana samples are on display at the Happy Days dispensary, which opened ... More for business on January 2, 2024, in East Farmingdale, New York.  (Photo by John Paraskevas/Newsday RM via Getty Images)\n\nAll of this incarceration happens simultaneously as states collect billions of tax dollars from the blossoming industry. The hypocrisy is more damning each year. States have already collected $10 billion in taxes from legal weed , and $3 billion in 2022 alone. In cash . Legalizing cannabis will help pull the country out of any lingering recession. Economists estimate the legal cannabis industry will create 1 million jobs in America. Without federal decriminalization, the legal cannabis businesses are relegated to operating in cash, putting them at risk and forcing them into the shadows.\n\nEvery state that legalizes cannabis benefits greatly from it. California made $1.2 billion in tax money from the legal weed industry in 2021 and $269.3 million in Q3 of 2023 . Egregiously high taxes (like in California's market) are not necessary to see an economic lift: somewhat reasonably taxed markets like Colorado made over $270 million in 2023 and Washington made over $500 million in 2022 .\n\nThe steps are easy and have been laid out for Biden in detail in a report by the Congressional Research Service . Biden could free all cannabis prisoners with a single signature by utilizing Executive Action. He could clear up the muddy, regulatory, cash-only waters of the state-by-state market by enacting Federal decriminalization or helping advance the SAFER Banking Act. He could single-handedly help reduce the opioid epidemic in the U.S. He could change the lives of his constituents for the better.\n\nBiden could offer an entire generation of passionate, innovative business owners access to the same American Dream he has accessed. By taking more drastic steps towards legalization across the country, the president could begin to repair the damages done by the War on Drugs.\n\nIt's ironic. After all these years of criminalizing it, weed is going to save President Biden.\n\nHARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA, UNITED STATES - 2021/01/14: Flags hang from the balcony outside of ...

More Wednesday, July 17, 2024. Biden is returning to his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to self-isolate after testing positive for COVID-19. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nCovid-19 has now been a factor in two second-term presidential campaigns. In November 2020, when the virus was raging throughout the world, and fears were at their peak, the country sought a return to normalcy - and a plan to reduce health and economic turmoil was a key factor. Voters selected the Biden presidency to do that, and with no small irony, President Biden's run for a second term was given a blow by his own Covid-19 infection - a cautionary reminder of the pathogen's staying power over two presidencies.\n\nThis is a symptom of the challenge both providers and consumers in the U.S. healthcare system face. Immediate concerns are generated by the growing surge of Covid-19. Test positivity was 11% as of July 6, per the CDC , up from 9.1% the previous week. For context, this past winter's peak was 12%. A CDC map shows that test positivity is highest in California and the Southwest. Covid-19 related emergency room visits were up 23% in the past week and hospitalizations are rising steadily, per the CDC .\n\nLong-Term term concerns are still evidenced by Covid-19 post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) also known at long Covid. And this is even among vaccinated persons who have had viral infections during the Omicron era. One study of more than 400,000 infected U.S. Veterans published on July 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine continued to raise these concerns about long Covid.\n\nHealthcare providers are facing new challenges that could affect their ability to respond to this pandemic. According to a May 24 report by the American Hospital Association , hospitals and health systems incurred significant underpayments for several essential and complex health care services in 2023. They also are facing mounting administrative burdens and costs, due to commercial health insurer practices like prior authorization and denials. At the same time, health insurance costs to consumers have grown twice as fast as hospital prices in 2023 and the industry is in the throes of the biggest M&A wave in more than a decade, with healthcare deal activity having grown 42% since 2010.\n\nPharmaceutical drug prices are rising and shortages are increasing. The yearly median list price of pharmaceutical drugs has risen 35% over the previous year. There was an average of 301 drug shortages per quarter last year, the most in a decade.\n\nLabor costs, which on average account for 60% of a hospital's budget, increased by more than $42.5 billion between 2021 and 2023. Even at higher wages, staffing is becoming a problem. Hospitals can't function without nurses. According to a report by McKinsey & Company , by 2025, the United States may face a shortage of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses available for direct patient care, equating to a 10% to 20% gap.\n\nEven the payment system for hospitals and physicians is undergoing fundamental changes. Payers are now encouraging providers to move toward value-based care arrangements, which pay hospitals and physicians based on patient health outcome rather than fees for service. It remains to be seen if these value-based models will really achieve better outcomes and cost savings. Still, if they do or don't, it's estimated that VBC reimbursement will grow from between 80 and 100 million patients in 2022 to between 130 and 160 million in 2027.\n\nCovid-19 is continuing to have a profound effect on every facet of our society, from children to adults. Children who became addicted to social media during the stay-at-home mandate during the pandemic have suffered a lack of social development. Between these post-pandemic issues and many who have long-term effects of Covid-19, we are still seeing fundamental changes to the economics of healthcare. Think of what another national pandemic could do?\n\nSome have openly argued that Covid-19 may have given President Biden the excuse needed to withdraw from a difficult campaign without admitting defeat. Even if this is true, the reality is that another virus will challenge us soon enough. We have learned very little from dealing with Covid-19 and now, Avian Influenza (H5N1) is becoming the specter that our healthcare system really needs to understand. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic virus that is steadily spreading, and human-to-human transmission is no longer abstract. From birds to cows to pigs, it is adapting to animals that could be gateways to widespread human infection.\n\nDetection may even have gotten worse than before Covid-19, as we are only surveying wastewater to track the spread of H5N1. What we need is the development of multiplex diagnostics, real-world vaccines and next-generation anti-viral therapies today. We can only ameliorate another pandemic's impact, by planning and implementing protective and preventive measures before the crisis begins. The consequences of not doing so may be far more unsettling than even the change in the presidential race we have just witnessed."

More a century or more to have such negative attitudes about the benefits of free trade.\n\nPresident Biden could be the first U.S. President in almost half a century to neither negotiate nor sign a free trade agreement while in office.\n\nSince the end of World War II, a succession of U.S. presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, have largely embraced, if not always consistently, the notion that limiting barriers to exports and imports was a net positive, improving lives here and abroad and, at least tangentially, buffering against the outbreak of war.\n\nThe two glaring exceptions? Former President and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and current President Biden. The two don't see eye-to-eye on much but it appears they are in lockstep on international trade. Most obvious: Biden has kept Trump's onerous tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nBut even Trump negotiated and signed into law the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, an update of the North America Free Trade Agreement (the only U.S. FTA First Trust Large Cap Value AlphaDEX Fund that doesn't use the word \"trade\" in its name and restricts rather than embraces trade).\n\nIf Biden should win re-election, he would have another four years to contemplate an FTA. Don't hold your breath.\n\nBut I'll be an optimist.\n\nThat would provide the opportunity to bring back to life the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , a sort of NATO for trade, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which was intended to hem in China, a foe to Trump and Biden alike.\n\nBoth of these were efforts by Biden's former boss, former President Barack Obama, the first of which never gained sufficient steam and the second which Trump quickly scuttled once in office.\n\nFor that matter, a pretty safe bet for Biden would be an expansion of existing treaties in this hemisphere to reinvigorate the Free Trade Area of the Americas, an effort begun by former President George H.W Wormhole . Bush, a Republican, and pursued by his successor, President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Such a treaty might even, over time, slow the influx of immigrants trying to enter this country illegally.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, is re-elected, then Biden would be the first president since Jimmy Carter to have neither negotiated nor signed a free trade agreement.\n\nThat's no fault of Carter's. The first U.S. free trade agreement originated and was signed after he left office, by his successor President Ronald Reagan.\n\nThat was the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement, which includes the West Bank and Gaz a.\n\nFrom there, President Bush, President Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Obama all at least pursued, negotiated or signed FTAs into law.\n\nHere's a list of current U.S. free trade agreements, including when they were signed and when they went into effect.\n\nAnd if Trump is re-elected? I wouldn't hold my breath for him either. But I'll be an optimist..."

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe MAGA community is furious over reports that former President Joe Biden used an autopen-a mechanical device that replicates signatures-to sign several official White House documents during his time in office.\n\nThe Oversight Project, an arm of the right-wing think tank behind Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundation, published a report last week claiming that Biden used an \"autopen signature\" across almost \"every document we could find.\"\n\nFor the organization, Biden's use of the autopen to sign official documents would cast doubt over the former president's ability to lead the country. \"WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY,\" the Oversight Project wrote on X , formerly Twitter .\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Heritage Foundation via email for comment on Monday.\n\nBiden's final years in office and his run for reelection were marred by concerns over his age and mental acuity, exacerbated by his penchant for gaffes, stumbles, and missteps and several public episodes where the former president appeared frail and confused.\n\nAfter reassuring voters that he was in perfect physical and mental form to beat Donald Trump and take on four more years in the White House, Biden eventually bowed to pressure from fellow Democrats and withdrew from the race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris .\n\nAfter Trump's triumph in November, several reports pointed the finger at Biden's aides for trying to conceal the severity of the situation.\n\nThe Oversight Project did not share many details on its alleged investigation, including the number of documents reviewed, but wrote on X: \"We gathered every document we could find with Biden's signature over the course of his presidency.\"\n\nIt added, sharing three documents signed by the former president: \"All used the same autopen signature except for the announcement that the former President was dropping out of the race last year.

The two executive orders appear to have the same signature, while the third has another.\n\nThe Oversight Project suggested that Biden might not have signed these documents, alluding to a shadowy presence behind the former president.\n\n\"For investigators to determine whether then-President Biden actually ordered the signature of relevant legal documents, or if he even had the mental capacity to, they must first determine who controlled the autopen and what checks there were in place,\" it wrote on X.\n\nTrump has reportedly used the autopen extensively during both his first and second mandates. According to a review of publicly available Federal Register documents, 25 of Trump's signatures on the Federal Register's website from both presidential terms had the same signature.\n\nBarack Obama is the first president to have used the autopen to sign an executive order.\n\nMAGA influencer Johnny Midnight wrote on X: \"Wow! So we don't know who really signed Executive Order[s], Pardons or anything else in the Whitehouse! In a Court of Law it would be shot down ... This is criminal. The Biden 'presidency' didn't have a real president. People should go to jail for this.\"\n\nMAGA influencer Phillip Buchanan, also known as Catturd, wrote on X: \"Null and void.\"\n\nRight-wing political commentator Rogan O'Handley, known as DC Draino, wrote on X: \"There is nobody who wants to move past this Joe Biden autopen scandal than Liz Cheney , Adam Kinzinger , and Gen Milley. If courts start to rule Biden's signatures are invalid, then those federal pardons go out the window.\"\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey has called for the Justice Department to investigate whether Biden's \"cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval.\"\n\nIf that was the case, \"these executive orders, pardons, and all other actions are unconstitutional and legally void,\" Bailey wrote on X.\n\nGiulia Carbonaro is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on the U.S. economy, housing market, property insurance market, local and national politics.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Joe Biden closed out his term in office with a final interview on MSNBC 's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell at 10 p.m. ET Thursday. The one-on-one marked the close of a political career spanning half a century that became increasingly insulated as the president, who turned 82 in November, grew older.\n\nThe interview was with a friendly host on a friendly cable network that has seen a collapse in its ratings post-election. O'Donnell's show airs at a late hour and attracts about 1.1 million viewers, making it the second most popular program on MSNBC behind Rachel Maddow -but a far cry from the reach of a broadcast tentpole like NBC 's Nightly News or CBS ' 60 Minutes, to say nothing of the viral TikToks and big-name podcasts that have largely replaced TV news for so many Americans.\n\nO'Donnell, a former Democratic Senate aide, is also one of Biden's more ardent supporters in the news media, having called his presser on the sidelines of a NATO summit this summer the \"most masterful televised presidential news conference about foreign policy\" ever delivered.\n\nDuring the interview, Biden spoke about the Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal announced on Wednesday, and the conversations he held with President-elect Donald Trump surrounding the agreement.\n\nBiden noted a conversation he had with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him that he \"can't be carpet bombing these communities\" during the Hamas-Israel war. Netanyahu reportedly replied, \"well, you did it,\" Biden said, hearkening way back to U.S. involvement in the bombing of Berlin during World War II.\n\n\"That's why we came up with the U.N. (United Nations),\" Biden replied to Netanyahu, he said.\n\nBiden was also asked about his farewell speech to America on Wednesday night and his warning that an \"oligarchy\" is taking over the United States.\n\nThe president said that \"if the decision is made that multibillionaires, the super, super wealthy, the wealthiest people in the world, begin to control all the apparatuses from the media to the economy, then who do I get to fight back for me?\" Biden then added that \"everyone deserves just a shot.\"\n\nThe decision by the president to deliver his last word on O'Donnell's Last Word suggests Biden is happy to leave office without one last big tangle with the more combative White House press corps.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nBiden also spoke on the economy, the Russia-Ukraine war and policy during his presidency, including the infrastructure bill. Speaking about his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding nuclear weapons use, Biden said that \"nuclear weapons, tactical nuclear weapons ... scares the hell out of everybody including the Russians.\"\n\nBiden was asked by O'Donnell about rising inflation during his presidency and he noted that as he exits office, inflation has had a \"soft landing,\" adding that when he came into office, it was during the COVID-19 pandemic and his administration had to push legislation to \"take care of that.\"\n\nThe president's aversion to the media has been something of a constant throughout his term, with the exception of the period just after his disastrous debate performance this summer when he did a handful of radio and TV interviews in an attempt to shore up public perception of his cognitive ability.\n\nBefore the summer, Biden seemed determined to avoid the public eye, his team opting for controlled appearances over the unpredictable glare of unscripted moments and sit-down interviews. But as the presidential election approached, his retreat became impossible to ignore.\n\nThe turning point came in that June debate with Trump , a rematch that had been framed as Biden's chance to underscore his leadership and contrast him with Trump's impulsiveness. In the months leading up to the showdown, Biden had noticeably pulled back from the media spotlight, a move that only fueled speculation about his mental acuity.\n\nInstead, the debate served as the beginning of the end. Biden appeared unsteady, his responses erratic, his voice a hoarse whisper. For the first time, even loyal Democrats began to ask uncomfortable questions about whether he was the right man to defeat Trump at the ballot box. What was intended as a strategy to avoid missteps ultimately backfired, paving the way for his decision to step aside in July.\n\nUntil that moment on the debate stage in Atlanta, questions about Biden's age and cognitive abilities were met with silence, or outright dismissal, by many in the mainstream media. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough , host of \"Morning Joe,\" infamously commented in March 2024: \"Biden is far beyond cogent. He is better than he has ever been intellectually, analytically.\"\n\nIt wasn't until after the debate that some of the country's largest media outlets began to ask questions that, many argue, they should have been asking all along. The press' tone shifted. The New York Times issued a rare editorial urging Biden to reflect on whether he was still the best choice to lead the Democratic Party . Other traditionally supportive outlets like The New Yorker joined the chorus, with editor David Remnick writing about the \"honor in recognizing the hard demands of the moment.\"\n\nEven Scarborough, one of Biden's most loyal defenders just three months earlier, turned on the president after the debate, saying \"If he were a CEO and turned in a performance like that, would any Fortune 500 corporation in America keep him on?\"\n\nVeteran political journalist Mark Halperin described the media \"cover up\" of Biden's health \"the worst scandal in American journalism history.\"\n\n\"The press turned on him and acted like they had not just propped him up for seven years,\" Halperin said during an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson on his podcast just before the election. \"They never acknowledged their participation as co-conspirators in a 7-year-long cover up, and then the same people get to cover the new candidate.\"\n\nIn an attempt to control the debate fallout, Biden and his aides arranged a high-profile one-on-one interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC , which did little to quell the public skepticism.\n\n\"Especially in the aftermath of that first debate with Trump, the media started questioning Biden's ability to run again,\" media analyst Brad Adgate told Newsweek .\n\nBiden is departing Washington as the president with the fewest news conferences and media interviews among the last seven presidents, according to an analysis by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar.\n\nWhile Biden's administration leaned into digital communication and informal Q&A exchanges, traditional press engagement were few and far between. Based on Kumar's data, up until to June 2024 Biden participated in 588 impromptu interactions with reporters during his term-second only to Trump-but held just 36 formal news conferences and 125 interviews. By comparison, Trump conducted 327 interviews, and Obama had 479 at similar points in their presidencies.\n\n\"These informal interactions often lacked the depth of accountability that formal interviews or news conferences provide,\" Adgate, the media critic said.\n\nThe president's limited media presence wasn't just a strategy to shield him from social media scrutiny, it became a narrative unto itself. Though his team frequently cited his lifelong stutter as an explanation for his often poor performances in unscripted settings, the optics had become hard to ignore.\n\nAfter switching to more stable sneakers following a fall during a military graduation ceremony in June 2023, some commentators speculated that his team was quietly acknowledging his physical decline. However, questions about his mental sharpness remained largely ignored-even as polling showed Americans had serious questions about his physical and cognitive abilities.\n\nA PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll released in April 2023 showed that only 47 percent of Democrats supported Biden running for reelection, with a significant decline in support among younger Democrats.\n\nEven as these questions about his mental fitness were avoided-what Jill Abramson, former executive editor of The New York Times , attributed to reporters' political concerns about \"not being accused of helping Donald Trump\"-the mainstream media began raising concerns about the president's accessibility. In March 2024, the Times issued a rare public statement criticizing the administration for its limited engagement with journalists.\n\n\"For anyone who understands the role of the free press in a democracy, it should be troubling that President Biden has so actively and effectively avoided questions\" the statement read.\n\nDeputy White House Press Secretary Andrew Bates responded to the Times criticism, stating: \"President Biden is delivering his message to the American people through an aggressive, modern, all-encompassing communications and digital strategy.\" He highlighted interviews Biden gave to The New Yorker , ProPublica, and CNN 's Fareed Zakaria, as well as multiple appearances on cable news, with MSNBC leading the count.\n\nBiden's presidency coincided with seismic shifts in how Americans consume news, as traditional media outlets were faced with declining trust and dwindling audiences.\n\nA recent Gallup poll revealed that nearly 70 percent of Americans have little to no confidence in the press, making it the least trusted institution in the country-behind even Congress . Meanwhile, podcasters and independent creators saw their fortunes soar during the Biden years, with figures like Joe Rogan drawing more listeners than the combined evening news broadcasts of ABC, NBC and CBS.\n\nTrump was among the first to recognize-and capitalize on-this new reality, bypassing legacy outlets to connect with his base directly through social media platforms now shaped by tech titans embracing a new ethos of \"free speech absolutism.\" Biden, by contrast, stuck to a more traditional playbook-one that often felt out of step with the digital age.\n\n\"If Biden could revisit his administration, I'm sure he might reconsider how he handled the media,\" Adgate said. \"Having more news conferences or engaging more with journalists-like previous presidents-could have made a difference. But with the fast-paced news cycle, especially over the last decade, I'm not sure how much news conferences still matter.\"\n\nAs the president prepares to leave Washington, he does so in the understated style that defined much of his presidency. Biden's conversation with O'Donnell is expected to focus on his legacy while steering clear of the controversies that dogged him in 2024.\n\nMSNBC is among the outlets still adjusting to the return of Trump . On the same day it announced O'Donnell had landed Biden's final interview, the cable network said that Maddow would return to hosting her show five nights a week-a clear signal that the liberal wing of the mainstream media is preparing to ramp up coverage of a president who thrives on constant visibility.\n\nUpdate 1/16/25, 10:57 p.m. ET: This article has been updated to include remarks from Biden's interview with MSNBC on Thursday night.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJesus is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWhen I became the head of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections (ODRC) in 2011, I strongly supported the death penalty. I knew it would be my job to carry out executions, and I accepted that role without hesitation. Seven years later, when I left the position, my views had forever changed. I came to understand that the death penalty causes great harm and drains significant resources, yet does not make us safer.\n\nThat is why I hope that before President Joe Biden leaves office, he commutes the sentences of all those on federal death row to life imprisonment without possibility of parole.\n\nDuring my tenure as ODRC director, I personally oversaw 15 executions. Here is what that meant.\n\nFifteen times, I stood in a small room and ordered my staff to inject lethal chemicals into another human being, resulting in his death. Each of those executions left me with deep and lasting psychic wounds. They also took a heavy toll on my staff, even those who were less directly involved in the process. Correctional colleagues from other states have shared their own stories with me about experiencing long-term post-traumatic symptoms from participation in or proximity to executions.\n\nFifteen times, I met with victims' family members who chose to witness the execution. Those meetings were among the hardest in my long career. Some of the family members fervently believed the execution would bring them long-awaited justice, while others wanted the years of waiting to be over. I saw all of their faces as they left the viewing room, and I grew to doubt that continuing the cycle of violence and death brought any real peace.\n\nFifteen times, I told a man exactly when and how he would die, then handed him paperwork directing him to choose his final meal, specify the disposition of his meager belongings, and list the people he wanted to witness his death. I can say with complete confidence that not one of those 15 men were the same as they had been when they committed the crime decades before.\n\nFifteen times, I was tasked with finding the lethal chemicals to carry out the death penalty. This macabre task led me to some of the internet's most unscrupulous corners, and required me to expend vast resources-both human and monetary-to source and acquire the means of execution. Particularly at a time when correctional systems are struggling to recruit and retain qualified staff, there is no justification for continuing a policy that drains resources without improving public or prison safety.\n\nThe very purpose of a \"corrections\" department is to facilitate growth, transformation, and redemption. The death penalty is antithetical to that mission.\n\nI spent almost 50 years working at every level of corrections, and in my experience, death row prisoners are indistinguishable from offenders serving life sentences. If anything sets the condemned apart, it is that they are likely to be poorer, darker skinned, or more mentally impaired; that they were assigned a worse trial lawyer; or that they committed a crime in a county with a more ambitious prosecutor. Death row prisoners are not uniquely dangerous within the prison community, and I've seen no evidence that having the death penalty deters crime at any level.\n\nPresident Biden can address these problems in the federal system with the stroke of a pen. Commuting all federal death sentences to life will ensure that no federal employee faces the risk of lasting trauma due to executions. It will offer a measure of closure to the families of victims without taking another human life. It will honor the promise of redemption that lies within each of us. By using his clemency power to end federal death sentences, President Biden can grant mercy not only to the men on federal death row, but in a larger sense, to the corrections community and to all of us.\n\nGary Mohr served as the Director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction from 2011-2018 and has spent nearly 50 years working in corrections. After retiring, he served as president of the American Correctional Association. Gary continues to work on corrections-related issues across the country through his consulting business, Mohr Correctional Insight.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\n*Gasp*\n\nThat is the sound I remember most from the night of the presidential debate.\n\nI was in a room filled with mostly Democratic voters at BusBoys & Poets, a well-known restaurant and progressive hub in the heart of Washington D.C., where I was preparing to give my post-debate analysis.\n\nGoing into the evening, I admittedly had had relatively low expectations; we have all seen former President Trump and President Biden on a debate stage before, and it was not pretty. I was under no illusion that this bout would be any better.\n\nEven though my expectations were low, the performance by both men failed to clear the lowest bar. Former President Trump lied repeatedly and oftentimes refused to answer direct questions. But it was President Biden's performance that sent the Democratic Party into chaos, from think pieces written by the President's allies calling on him to exit the race to donors going on TV to defend his candidacy.\n\nBut as a progressive, my primary response has been a single question: Should this be a fight progressives take on?\n\nOver the past four years, even before he was the Democratic nominee, I have been critical of Joe Biden and his policies. During his presidency, I have not shied away from publicly calling him and his administration out. I do not believe his policies go far enough to address the material needs of the American people, which among other things, makes him a liability electorally.\n\nAll of which is to say, it would be easy for someone like me to call on this President to drop out of this race.\n\nBut when trying to determine whether it is the job of progressives to fight for a different nominee after last week's debate performance, we need to answer three other questions: How did we get here in the first place, what are the alternatives, and does the establishment want to listen to us?\n\nLet's start with how we got here. In the 2020 primary, former HUD Secretary Julián Castro famously pointed out Biden's memory issues on stage, a comment that left Castro off the list of speakers at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Establishment Democrats then decided to coalesce around Biden as Senator Bernie Sanders gained momentum.\n\nFast forward four years and the DNC made sure that there would be no Democratic primary, that consulting firms that work for anyone running against a historically unpopular president would be blacklisted and prevented from working with other Democratic candidates, that there would not be primary debates, and even in some cases like Florida, that only President Biden's name would appear on the Democratic primary ballot.\n\nStill, despite the enormous pressure to stand down, some candidates stepped up to primary this president. Congressman Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson ran against Biden, and even Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ran as a Democrat, until it became clear the primary process was simply for show, leading him to run as an Independent.\n\nMeanwhile, any of us advocating for debates were met with the criticism that we were somehow \"helping Trump.\"\n\nIn the days since the debate debacle, there has been speculation on who could possibly take over at the top of the ticket. The names that have been floated are wide ranging, but the ones that consistently come up are Vice President Kamala Harris , Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer , California Governor Gavin Newsom , and Maryland Governor Wes Moore. All have shut down speculation.\n\nBut the only truly viable option to take over for president Biden is the Vice President. She has name recognition, has been on the ballot nationally, and is in the line of succession. It would not make sense for the Democratic Party to skip over the first Black woman to serve as vice president. Doing so would spell disaster amongst the Democratic coalition.\n\nBut even if we progressives were to pick a candidate to push over Biden, It's clear that the Democratic Party in its current configuration of power does not care to hear progressives out. Just look at what happened two days before the presidential debate, when Democratic insiders were celebrating as New York Representative Jamaal Bowman lost his primary to a Republican-lite candidate, George Latimer, who benefitted from upwards of $14 million from AIPAC and other outside spending.\n\nIf progressives were to push to oust a historically unpopular candidate, we would not be listened to-though you'd better believe we'll be blamed when their hand-picked replacement loses (we always are).\n\nSo, where does that leave progressives?\n\nSimple: This is someone else's problem. Pushing for Biden to be replaced is not our fight. The Democratic establishment has made clear that progressive voices are not listened to, which means the predicament establishment Democrats find themselves in is of their doing and is theirs to fix.\n\nOur fight is to make sure that those who put us in this position, who nominated a historically unpopular president whom 72 percent of voters do not believe has the mental or cognitive health to serve as president, are held accountable.\n\nIt is on progressives within the Democratic Party to take power away from those who say that Medicare for All and tuition-free college are impractical-then believed it was practical to nominate a candidate who most Americans believe is unfit to serve, as a potential second President Trump term looms.\n\nIt is not on progressives to fight for a different candidate; it is on us to fight for a party that centers the people over the donor class.\n\nThe Honorable Nina Turner is a former Ohio State Senator.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDemocrats are rallying nationwide to oppose President-elect Donald Trump 's controversial immigration policies, launching a wave of grassroots mobilization , legal challenges and legislative efforts aimed at protecting immigrant communities .\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a letter signed by seven leading Democratic Party senators seen by Newsweek was sent to President Joe Biden , urging him to act now to protect current legal migrants.\n\nTrump has pledged to carry out the largest deportation program in U.S. history , shut down the CBP One app , end the catch-and-release policy and reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" program as part of his hardline immigration agenda. He has also vowed to go after those admitted into the United States under programs established to protect migrants from certain countries .\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email on Monday.\n\nBefore he won his second term, the president-elect said he would force the million-plus people who arrived under Humanitarian Parole or were allowed to stay in the U.S. through Temporary Protected Status (TPS), to leave.\n\nLawmakers and advocate groups have raised alarms about the potential human and economic toll of such policies , highlighting the critical roles that undocumented immigrants play in industries such as agriculture, healthcare and construction.\n\nNevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto told Newsweek that she had spoken to the White House about her proposals for President Joe Biden to extend protections to citizens who are in the country through TPS.\n\n\"There are horrific conditions in these countries that satisfy the provisions of TPS and this is an opportunity now for this administration to extend that status or provide that status based on those horrific conditions in those countries, because I know the next administration, their immigration policy is chaotic and President Trump has basically said he's going to engage in master deportation and nobody's going to be safe,\" Masto said.\n\nCurrently, 16 countries are included on the list, including Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, along with Afghanistan, Burma, El Salvador, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. The Biden administration did allow TPS to lapse for Venezuelans after two years in October, however.\n\nMasto and other colleagues on the Hill want to see action before inauguration day to keep those immigrants safe from mass deportations, alongside DACA recipients, who also face an uncertain future.\n\nAlongside Illinois Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, New Jersey's Cory Booker, New Mexico's Ben Ray Luján, Hawaii's Mazie Hirono , and California's Alex Padilla , Masto wrote that Biden needed to do something now.\n\n\"We write now because the window to secure and finalize your administration's policies is closing rapidly,\" the letter shared with Newsweek read. \"We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families.\"\n\nIn a withering critique, Padilla issued a stark warning that mass deportations will \"rip\" residents from their communities and lead to a \"less prosperous\" America, which would leave Americans paying \"higher prices for everyday goods and services.\"\n\n\"Trump's threat to deport millions of people from the U.S. will rip longtime residents like DACA recipients, TPS holders, and immigrant essential workers away from their communities, leaving the American people to pay higher prices for everyday goods and services. Mass deportations will lead to a less prosperous America for all,\" Padilla told Newsweek.\n\nGovernor Jared Polis of Colorado has also voiced strong concerns about the potential economic and societal fallout of mass deportations, calling them \"a recipe for a major recession.\"\n\nAlly Sullivan, a spokesperson for Polis told Newsweek that the governor supported removing dangerous criminals, but not hard-working Americans.\n\n\"Mass deportation of farm workers would increase the cost of food and mass deportation of construction workers would increase the cost of housing even more,\" Sullivan said. \"Governor Polis fears for all Coloradans that mass deportations of law-abiding residents would be a recipe for a major recession.\"\n\nAcross the aisle, GOP lawmakers are preparing to enact Trump's hardline immigration policies, including Remain in Mexico, designed to keep immigrants out of the U.S.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz told Newsweek in November that enacting mass deportations would tackle cartel violence and human trafficking.\n\n\"I can guarantee that it will significantly reduce it. We're not going to eliminate criminals in the world,\" he said. \"We will also see the revenue that the cartels are earning go down significantly.\"\n\nTrump, who won the popular vote for the first time in three attempts, has continued to lay out his immigration plans despite the concerns from Democrats and economists. In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, he suggested mixed-status families could be deported and pledged to end birthright citizenship.\n\n\"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous,\" Trump said, before conceding it might not be possible. \"Well, if we can, through executive action.\"\n\nRepublican Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville told Newsweek that most Americans were in support of Trump's policies.\n\n\"Once the country sees red states successfully implementing President Trump's America First Agenda, leading to safer communities and healthier local economies, blue state politicians are bound to follow suit,\" he said in a statement. \"Otherwise, blue state governors can enjoy a mass exodus as their residents move to red states.\"\n\nTexas Senator Chip Roy also said that Republicans needed to implement policies Americans voted for.\n\n\"I don't want to hear one excuse from any Republican across this great country about why we don't do our job to secure the border of the United States and, yes, deport the millions of people that were released unlawfully and purposely into the United States,\" he said in a statement shared with Newsweek .\n\nSenator Masto said that Trump was using the immigration issue for political gain, but that regardless of what any president does, be it Biden or Trump, Congressional action is needed.\n\n\"We can strengthen our border, but we can also fix a broken immigration system, and it requires my colleagues to have the courage to come forward and do just that and not play politics with people's lives,\" she said.\n\nBillal Rahman is an immigration reporter based in London, U.K. He specializes in immigration policy and border security.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has done fewer interviews during his tenure than his six predecessors at the same point in their presidencies, a recent Axios report found.\n\nAfter Biden had skipped several high-profile interviews, including last February's Super Bowl pregame interview, Democrats hoped that the first presidential debate, which aired last Thursday, would show Biden as a sharp, energetic candidate amid criticism that the 81-year-old was not mentally or physically fit to serve another four years. Instead, Biden's weak showing on the Atlanta debate stage against former President Donald Trump caused a panic within the Democratic Party .\n\nOn Wednesday, Axios came out with a report on the number of press conferences and media interviews each president from Ronald Reagan to Biden did as of June 30 of each president's fourth year in office.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama , a Democrat, had the highest number at 570 interviews and press conferences. Trump, the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee, followed behind with 468. Meanwhile, Biden trailed behind his six processors, only having conducted 164 interviews and press conferences so far.\n\nFrom the 1980s to early 2000s, the presidents' number of interviews and press conferences ranged in the 200s to 370s.\n\nReagan, a Republican , did 262 interviews and press conferences; George H.W. Bush , a Republican, did 376; Bill Clinton , a Democrat, did 310 and George W. Bush , a Republican, did 248.\n\nThe data was collected by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor emerita at Towson University.\n\nWhile Biden may have done fewer interviews and press conferences than his predecessors at the same point in their presidencies, Biden has done a greater number of more informal talks with select, small groups of reporters than any of his six predecessors except for Trump.\n\nAccording to Kumar, Biden has conducted 588 of these Q&A (questions and answers) sessions compared to Trump's 664.\n\n\"President Biden has done 45 interviews this year-including with CNN , ABC News, Time and Univision-and engaged in 588 question-and-answer sessions with the White House press corps during his term,\" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in a statement to Axios.\n\nBates said that Biden \"is also meeting Americans where they are through innovative digital strategies and constituency and local media,\" adding, \"Joe Biden has always stood up for the critical role of the free press in our democracy and looks forward to his next press conference next week.\"\n\nWhen contacted for comment on Saturday afternoon, Bates referred Newsweek to his previous statement to Axios. Newsweek also contacted Biden's reelection campaign via email for comment.\n\nOn Friday, Biden had his first one-on-one interview since the debate with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, in which he said that he would only drop out if God Almighty tells him to .\n\nStephanopoulos asked the president if he was \"convinced\" he could not beat Trump, \"will you stand down?\" Biden replied: \"If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\"\n\nBiden's interview came amid calls for the president to drop out of the race and for another prominent Democrat to take his place. However, Biden has vowed to stay in the race.\n\nWhile debating Trump last week, Biden mumbled through his administration's accomplishments and goals in a hoarse voice. Often times he struggled to give a coherent answer. Biden's team later said he had a cold and was suffering from jet lag. Meanwhile, Trump, 78, is only three years younger than Biden and has also faced scrutiny about his age and cognitive ability .\n\nUpdate 7/7/24, 11:24 a.m. ET: The headline for this article has been updated.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nRachel Dobkin is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

      "text": "Trump and Biden: The National Debt\n\nThe national debt is on course to reach a record share of the economy under the next presidential administration, due in part to policies approved by Presidents Trump and Biden during their time in office, including executive actions and legislation passed by Congress.\n\nWhile it is important to understand the fiscal impact of the promises candidates make on the campaign trail - particularly because they reflect the candidates' own policy preferences and are not impacted by unexpected external events or the actions of Congress - the fact that both leading candidates have served as President also allows for a comparison of their actual fiscal records. This analysis focuses on the estimated ten-year debt impact of policies approved by Presidents Trump and Biden around the time of enactment. 1 In this analysis, we find:\n\nIn companion analyses, we will show:\n\nNote: bipartisan indicates legislation passed with votes from both political parties in either chamber of Congress. *Includes $23 billion of executive actions in the form of student debt payment pauses.\n\nDuring his four-year term in office, President Trump approved $8.4 trillion of new ten-year borrowing above prior law, or $4.8 trillion when excluding the bipartisan COVID relief bills and COVID-related executive actions. Looking at all legislation and executive actions with meaningful fiscal impact, the full amount of approved ten-year borrowing includes $8.8 trillion of deficit-increasing laws and actions offset by $443 billion of deficit-reducing actions. 2\n\nThese estimates are based on scores of legislation and executive actions rather than retrospective estimates. Scores are generally made on a conventional basis, though the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is scored dynamically. The actual debt impact of the policies was likely somewhat higher than these scores. In particular, the TCJA likely reduced revenue more than projected and saved less from repealing the individual health care mandate penalty, 3 while the Employee Retention Credit was likely far more expensive than originally estimated.\n\nSources: CRFB estimates based on CBO and OMB projections.\n\nThe major actions approved by President Trump (and ten-year impact with interest) include:\n\nOver his first three years and five months in office, President Biden has approved $4.3 trillion of new ten-year borrowing, or $2.2 trillion when excluding the American Rescue Plan Act. This includes $6.2 trillion of deficit-increasing legislation and actions, offset by $1.9 trillion of legislation and actions scored as reducing the deficit.\n\nThese estimates are based on scores of legislation and executive actions rather than retrospective estimates and do not include preliminary rules, unexecuted \"side deals,\" or actions ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. Updated scores and in-process actions would increase the total. For example, an updated estimate would likely wipe away the $252 billion of scored savings from the Inflation Reduction Act, 4 the informal FRA side deals would reduce its savings by about $500 billion , and the new student debt cancellation plan could cost $250 to $750 billion .\n\nSources: CRFB estimates based on CBO and OMB projections.\n\nThe major actions approved by President Biden so far (and ten-year impact with interest) include:\n\nThe next presidential term will present significant fiscal challenges. While past performance is not necessarily indicative of future actions, it is helpful to examine the fiscal performance from each President's time in office for clues as to how they plan to confront these challenges or how high of a priority fiscal responsibility will be on their agendas.\n\nBoth candidates approved substantial amounts of new borrowing in their first term. President Trump approved $8.4 trillion in borrowing over a decade, while President Biden has approved $4.3 trillion so far in his first three years and five months in office. Of course, accountability also rests with Congress as a co-equal branch of government, which passed legislation constituting the majority of the fiscal impact under both presidents.\n\nSome of this borrowing was clearly justified, particularly in the early parts of the COVID-19 pandemic when joblessness was rising rapidly and large parts of the economy were effectively shut down. However, funding classified as COVID relief explains less than half of the borrowing authorized by either President, and arguably, a meaningful portion of this COVID relief was either extraneous, excessive, poorly targeted, or otherwise unnecessary. 5\n\nIn supplemental analyses, we will compare a number of other aspects of the candidates' fiscal records.\n\nDuring the next presidential term, the national debt is projected to reach a record share of the economy, interest costs are slated to surge, the debt limit will re-emerge, discretionary spending caps and major tax cuts are scheduled to expire, and major trust funds will be hurtling toward insolvency.\n\nAdding trillions more to the national debt will only worsen these challenges, just as both Presidents Trump and Biden did during their terms along with lawmakers in Congress. The country would be better served if the candidates put forward and stuck to plans to reduce the national debt, secure the trust funds, and put the budget on a sustainable long-term path.\n\nThis analysis estimates the additional borrowing approved by Presidents Trump and Biden through tax and spending changes passed by Congress or contained in executive actions from their administrations. It does not estimate the amount of debt that accumulated over their terms, which partially reflects actions taken prior to their time in office and does not account for the fiscal impact of the actions approved by the President but incurred outside of his four-year term. We will publish changes in debt during their terms in a supplemental analysis.\n\nOur analysis incorporates all major pieces of legislation and executive actions - those with more than $10 billion of ten-year budget impact - approved by Presidents Trump and Biden. Estimates rely on ten-year budget scores, as under standard convention. In order to rely on official scores wherever possible, however, all estimates are based on the ten-year budget window at the time of enactment - meaning different policies cover different time frames and thus are not purely additive or comparable.\n\nIn general, estimates rely on official estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) presented prospectively. When such scores are not available or not comprehensive, we may use estimates from the Office of Management and Budget, the regulatory agencies, or our own estimates.\n\nEstimates are not updated to incorporate data and results made available well after implementation; no legislation signed by either President Trump or President Biden has been re-estimated in full to incorporate observed costs or effects, and partial updates would bias the overall numbers. However, possible differences between initial scores and actual costs, including from the TCJA, the IRA, and COVID relief, are discussed throughout this paper.\n\nEstimates incorporate impact on interest costs, which we calculate using the most recent CBO debt service tool at the time of enactment, unless interest impact is included in the estimate. Estimates are generally based on conventional scoring, but in the case of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we incorporate macroeconomic impacts as estimated by CBO shortly after enactment.\n\nAll estimates are in nominal dollars at the time of approval, which means deficit impact from earlier budget windows generally represent a larger share of GDP per dollar due to higher price levels and output over time.\n\nFinally, the estimates are based on the policies as written and do not try to correct for arbitrary cliffs, side agreements, or other budget gimmicks that may create a misleading picture of the intended fiscal impact of the policy.\n\n1 Our estimates compare ten-year estimates of each action before implementation, generally using prospective scores of policies and adding them together despite being over different windows. Although this is not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison for a variety of reasons, it allows us to rely on official numbers and continue to compare over time. See the methodology section for a more detailed explanation.\n\n2 Many pieces of legislation with fiscal impact include tax and spending changes that both add to and reduce projected deficits. The $8.8 trillion figure is based on the net deficit impact of deficit-increasing bills, rather than the gross deficit increases within those bills. For example, the $1.9 trillion impact of the TCJA represents the combination of tax cuts, base broadening, lower spending as a result of repealing the individual mandate penalty, interest, and dynamic effects on revenue and spending.\n\n3 The larger deficit impact from the TCJA is due to a combination of a larger nominal tax base, lower health savings from individual mandate repeal, the unexpected use of a SALT cap workaround, reduced revenue collection from the limit on pass-through losses, higher revenue loss related to bonus depreciation, and other factors.\n\n4 Due to higher prices and output, greater demand for subsidized activities, and laxer-than-expected regulations, the IRA's energy provisions are now expected to have a fiscal impact of $660 billion - about two-thirds more than the original estimate of roughly $400 billion. This excludes the effects of the Administration's vehicle emissions rule, which we've scored separately. At the same time, revenue collection under the IRA is also likely to be higher in light of higher-than-projected nominal corporate profits , greater expected voluntary tax compliance , and less-than-expected responsiveness to the buyback tax. Overall, we believe a re-estimate of the IRA would be roughly budget neutral. The emissions rule approved by President Biden would increase deficits by about $170 billion - mainly by further increasing the fiscal impact of the IRA tax credits - and is included in our tally of his executive actions.\n\n5 In a previous analysis, we estimated that $500 to 650 billion of COVID relief was extraneous - unrelated to the pandemic or subsequent economic fallout - including $300 to $335 billion enacted under President Trump and $200 to $315 billion under President Biden. These prior estimates are not perfectly comparable to estimates in this paper but give a sense of scale. In additional analyses, we estimated that the American Rescue plan likely significantly overshot the output gap it was aiming to close while providing excessive relief to a number of sectors. There were also excesses and lack of targeting in earlier COVID relief packages, including as it related to stimulus checks , the additional $600 of weekly unemployment benefits , and the Paycheck Protection Program."

      "text": "Biden Rushed Out Billions for Green Energy Projects Before Trump Took Office\n\nGovernment Spending\n\nJoe Lancaster | From the April 2025 issue\n\nOn President Joe Biden's way out the door, officials in his administration were busy-not just packing up their offices, but shoveling as much money as possible before incoming President Donald Trump could get his hands on it.\n\nPer the U.S. Department of Energy's website, its Loan Programs Office (LPO) provides \"clean energy and advanced transportation technologies....with access to needed loans and loan guarantees when private lenders cannot or will not.\" As of August 2022, the LPO had loaned out only $32.7 billion, but Biden-era spending bills supercharged the office, increasing its loan authority for infrastructure projects to $400 billion. Of that total, though, $290 billion would expire in September 2026, with another $50 billion expiring in 2028.\n\nBesides, Trump is famously skeptical of green energy projects and would be unlikely to use the cash on projects favored by progressives. So in the roughly two months between Trump's election and inauguration, Biden administration officials worked diligently to approve as many projects-and spend as much taxpayer money-as possible.\n\nIn November 2024, just weeks after the election, the LPO announced \"a direct loan of up to $6.57 billion\" that would allow Rivian, a luxury electric vehicle (E.V.) manufacturer, to finish construction on its new factory in Georgia-even though that state's government previously awarded the company tax credits and incentives worth as much as $1.5 billion. Also in November, the LPO announced a loan guarantee of up to $4.9 billion for the Grain Belt Express Phase 1, a high-capacity network of power lines running from Kansas to Missouri.\n\nIn a single week in December, the LPO announced a $9.63 billion loan for BlueOval SK to build three Ford Motor Co. E.V. and E.V. battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky; a $1.25 billion loan for EVgo to expand its network of public E.V. chargers; a $1.45 billion loan to Qcells, a South Korean manufacturer building a solar panel factory in Georgia; a $7.54 billion loan to a subsidiary of Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) building an E.V. battery factory in Indiana; a $2.5 billion loan guarantee to We Energies in Wisconsin for \"a portfolio of individual projects\"; and a loan guarantee of up to $15 billion to Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), the utility that provides gas and electricity to much of California, to modernize the state's power grid.\n\nThe LPO originally planned on $30 billion for PG&E, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time, but \"the amount was cut in half, in part because of PG&E concerns about the hefty upfront payments such a large loan would have required.\" The Journal also noted that the LPO was racing to close the loan before Trump's inauguration over \"fear [that] Trump officials could curtail loans from the office.\"\n\n\"Under President Biden, the office has announced roughly $54 billion in loans or loan guarantees,\" The New York Times wrote on December 6, 2024. \"Of that, $19 billion was announced in the weeks after the election\"-and several of the loans listed above were announced after the Times ' article went to press.\n\nSpending taxpayer money to boost, prop up, or bail out private businesses is bad enough. But the accelerated timeline also increases the likelihood that some of these deals, perhaps undertaken in haste, will prove poor investments.\n\nThis was already a concern before the election, with the fund's looming expiration in 2026 and beyond. \"The pressure to beat these deadlines introduces the risk that the LPO will enter into loans it otherwise would not....because of insufficient time to conduct rigorous due diligence, to negotiate terms that could effectively mitigate the risks identified during the due diligence, and to consider alternative projects that might offer a more favorable risk profile,\" according to a November 2024 report from the Department of Energy Office of the Inspector General.\n\nRegardless of the efficacy of using public money to issue or guarantee loans to private companies, it's alarming for a presidential administration to spend its final days rushing to approve new spending just so the incoming president can't. It signals an all-too-common attitude in government that taxed money is better spent than returned to the taxpayers who provided it.\n\nThis article originally appeared in print under the headline \"Biden Rushed Billions Out Before Trump Took Office.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Biden Will Not Enforce TikTok Ban For Final 36 Hours Of His Presidency\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nJosh Blackman | 1.16.2025 9:55 PM\n\nThe TikTok ban goes into effect at 12:01 AM on January 19, 2025. President Biden has the power to grant an extension if certain conditions are met, though it doesn't seem like that will happen. Instead, President Biden has simply announced that he will not enforce the law for the final 36 hours of this presidency. Or more precisely, the Biden Administration will not impose any fines on companies that allow TikTok to operate. Instead, they will let Trump deal with it.\n\n\"Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement,\" a White House official said.\n\nWhat a mess. For starters, what about the Take Care Clause? The President has a duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. The Solicitor General has vigorously argued that the law is constitutional, and essential to national security. Yet, Biden has simply told his administration to not enforce the law, full stop. What plausible justification is there for this decision? I eagerly await the return of the Take Care Blog.\n\nTrump is not President yet. The buck stops with Biden until January 20. But President Biden's capitulation on the issue is a recognition that Trump is really in charge. Again, elites mocked the Trump amicus brief , but it accurately described the state of play.\n\nThis video is an example. A reporter asked Biden who takes credit for the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, him or Trump. Biden could only muster, \"Is that a joke?\"\n\nMore pressingly, this decision undermines the Solicitor General's argument to the Supreme Court. The government defended the ban as a necessary means to protect Americans from a foreign adversary. But when push comes to shove, the President simply doesn't care. China can keep on doing whatever it is they are doing. Could it be that the government's arguments in defense of the TikTok ban are, as they often are, exaggerated?\n\nWhere does all this news leave the Court? Do the Justices really want to write a landmark First Amendment decision in a few days for a law that the President won't even enforce? I am skeptical. I think an administrative injunction is looking like a pretty good option now. I suggested this option before argument, and Justice Alito raised the possibility during argument . The Court can just put the law on hold and let Trump make a deal.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Timeline: Hunter Biden granted pardon after legal, political scrutiny\n\nProsecutors had been investigating the president's son since 2018.\n\nA month before leaving office, President Joe Biden announced that he has issued a pardon for his son Hunter Biden, who was convicted on federal gun charges and had pleaded guilty to nine tax-related charges, including three felonies.\n\nIn pardoning his youngest son, the president spared Hunter Biden the possibility of significant prison time stemming from convictions in two federal cases brought by special counsel David Weiss. For the tax charges, he faced up to 17 years in federal prison and $1.35 million in fines, while his gun-related conviction carried a potential of up to 25 years in prison.\n\nThe younger Biden had been scheduled to face sentencing on Dec. 12 for the gun-related charges in Delaware and on Dec. 16 for the tax charges in California.\n\nHere's a timeline of Hunter Biden's legal and political scrutiny.\n\nA month after Joe Biden wins the 2020 presidential election, Hunter Biden announces that federal prosecutors in Delaware are investigating his \"tax affairs. \"\n\nA source with knowledge of the investigation tells ABC News that the tax probe began in 2018, but that the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware waited to notify Hunter Biden's legal team due to sensitivities around the election.\n\nInvestigators are looking into Hunter's business dealings in China and elsewhere, including scrutinizing whether he may have committed tax crimes stemming from those overseas business dealings, sources tell ABC News.\n\nOutgoing Attorney General William Barr says he doesn't intend to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden, as President Donald Trump and others have suggested.\n\nIn a new memoir, Hunter Biden addresses many of the topics that emerged as fodder for his father's political foes during the presidential campaign, including his struggles with substance addiction, his dealings in China, and his seat on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas firm during his father's tenure as vice president -- a role that later led to then-President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial on charges that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Hunter Biden's position on the board. Trump was subsequently acquitted.\n\nThe memoir, titled \"Beautiful Things,\" also offers lurid details as it chronicles the younger Biden's repeated relapses into drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nABC News reports that the federal investigation into Hunter Biden over his tax affairs has intensified , according to sources.\n\nSources say a number of witnesses have appeared before a grand jury Wilmington, Delaware, in recent months, and have been asked about payments Hunter Biden received while serving on the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, as well as about how he paid off tax obligations in recent years.\n\nFresh off the GOP regaining control of the Senate in the midterm elections, congressional Republicans say they're poised to push ahead with an investigation into President Joe Biden's family, including Hunter Biden, in the coming session.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Comer of Kentucky, two high-ranking members expected to helm powerful committees when Republicans take control of Congress in January, pledge to \"pursue all avenues\" of wrongdoing, calling investigations into the president's family a \"top priority.\"\n\nAhead of an expected deluge of Republican probes, Hunter Biden retains high-powered defense lawyer Abbe Lowell to help navigate congressional oversight.\n\nTestifying in his annual oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Merrick Garland says that U.S. Attorney David Weiss has been told he has \"full authority\" to make any charging decisions stemming from the Hunter Biden investigation, even if that would involve bringing a case in a district outside of Delaware.\n\nGarland also says he has pledged to Weiss any resources necessary to conduct his investigation, and has received no reports thus far of the his investigation being stymied in any way by personnel at the main Justice Department.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden file counterclaims alleging invasion of privacy in response to a defamation lawsuit brought by Delaware-based computer repairman John Paul Mac Isaac, who they say triggered the infamous laptop controversy in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe counterclaim is in response to an ongoing defamation lawsuit against Hunter Biden and others that was filed in October 2019 by Mac Isaac, who Hunter Biden's attorney say obtained and later disseminated data from a laptop allegedly belonging to the younger Biden.\n\nABC News reports that a supervisor at the IRS has told lawmakers that he has information that suggests the Biden administration could be mishandling the investigation into Hunter Biden, according to sources.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers obtained by ABC News, the lawyer for the IRS whistleblower says his client is an IRS criminal supervisory special agent \"who has been overseeing the ongoing and sensitive investigation of a high-profile, controversial subject since early 2020 and would like to make protected whistleblower disclosures to Congress.\"\n\nThe letter says that \"The protected disclosures: (1) contradict sworn testimony to Congress by a senior political appointee, (2) involve failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition of the case, and (3) detail examples of preferential treatment and politics improperly infecting decisions and protocols that would normally be followed by career law enforcement professionals in similar circumstances if the subject were not politically connected.\"\n\nABC News reports that the GOP-led House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena demanding the FBI produce a record related to an alleged \"criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Joe Biden and a foreign national.\"\n\nThe subpoena seeks an unclassified FD-1023 document, which is generally defined as a report from an informant. The White House denounces the contents of the document as \"anonymous innuendo.\"\n\nAttorneys for the IRS whistleblower inform key members of Congress that their client -- along with his \"entire investigative team\" -- has been removed from the probe into the president's son. The Justice Department defers comment to U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who does not comment on the claim.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer announces his intention to initiate contempt of Congress hearings over FBI Director Chris Wray's refusal to physically turn over the FD-1023 document that Republicans believe is related to President Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden agrees to plead guilty to a pair of tax-related misdemeanors and enter into a pretrial diversion agreement that would enable him to avoid prosecution on one felony gun charge, potentially ending the yearslong probe.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the younger Biden will acknowledge his failure to pay taxes on income he received in 2017 and 2018, until they were paid in 2020 by a third party, identified by ABC News as attorney and confidant Kevin Morris. In exchange, prosecutors will recommend probation, meaning Hunter Biden will likely avoid prison time. For the gun charge, he will agree to pretrial diversion, with the charge being dropped if he adheres to certain terms.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika sets a court date of July 26 for Hunter Biden to make his initial court appearance related to the plea deal he has agreed to.\n\nThe GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee releases transcripts of their interviews with two IRS whistleblowers that they say show that senior Biden administration officials stymied U.S. Attorney David Weiss' investigation into Hunter Biden. In their testimony, the whistleblowers claim that senior Justice Department officials blocked prosecutors' attempts to bring charges against Hunter Biden in Washington and California, and refused to grant Weiss special counsel status.\n\nJustice Department officials dispute the claim, saying, \"As both the Attorney General and U.S. Attorney David Weiss have said, U.S. Attorney Weiss has full authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when, and whether to file charges as he deems appropriate. He needs no further approval to do so.\"\n\nABC News reports that House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has been given access the redacted FD-1023 document that allegedly contains claims about what Comer calls a \"criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions.\" But Comer tells reporters that reading the document was \"a total waste of my time,\" as more than half of the document was redacted. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight panel, says the Trump-era Justice Department investigated the claims and, \"in August 2020, Attorney General [William] Barr and his hand-picked U.S. Attorney signed off on closing the assessment.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans have also seized on a July 2017 WhatsApp message in which the younger Biden purportedly threatened a Chinese business associate by invoking his father's political connections, allegedly writing, \"I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled. Tell the director that I would like to resolve this now before it gets out of hand, and now means tonight.\"\n\n\"And, Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zhang, or the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction,\" the message continues. \"I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father.\"\n\nAt the time of the message, Joe Biden's term as vice president had already ended and he held no political office. But Republicans say the message undercuts President Biden's claim that he never discussed overseas business endeavors with his son. Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, reiterates that \"the president was not in business with his son.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland disputes outright the IRS' whistleblowers' claim that Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney David Weiss had requested to be named a special counsel but was turned down, saying, \"Mr. Weiss never made that request to me.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, regarding the IRS whistleblowers' claim that Garland turned down Weiss' request to be named a special counsel in the Hunter Biden probe, tells Fox News, \"If it comes true what the IRS whistleblower is saying, we're going to start impeachment inquiries on the attorney general.\"\n\nABC News reports that Weiss has pushed back on the IRS whistleblowers' allegations, writing in a letter to Sen. Lindsey Graham of the Senate Judiciary Committee: \"To clarify an apparent misperception and to avoid future confusion, I wish to make one point clear: in this case, I have not requested Special Counsel designation.\"\n\nSeparately, in an appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray is asked by Rep. Matt Gaetz , \"Are you protecting the Bidens?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Wray answers.\n\nHunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell sends a cease-and-desist letter to Trump's legal team claiming that Trump's rhetoric on social media and elsewhere \"could lead to [Hunter Biden's] or his family's injury.\"\n\n\"This is not a false alarm,\" Lowell writes. \"You should make clear to Mr. Trump -- if you have not done so already -- that Mr. Trump's words have caused harm in the past and threaten to do so again if he does not stop.\"\n\nIn congressional testimony, the two IRS whistleblowers -- 14-year IRS veteran Gary Shapley and IRS investigator Joseph Ziegler, who has previously been unidentified -- reiterate their claims that Justice Department officials stymied Weiss' probe of Hunter Biden.\n\n\"It appeared to me, based on what I experienced, that the U.S. Attorney in Delaware in our investigation was constantly hamstrung, limited and marginalized by DOJ officials,\" Ziegler says. \"I still think that a special counsel is necessary for this investigation.\"\n\nIn an unusual move, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, releases the FD-1023 document containing a confidential FBI informant's unverified claim that, years ago, the Biden family \"pushed\" a Ukrainian oligarch to pay them millions of dollars.\n\nThe document cites an unnamed source who says that in 2015, Mykola Zlochevsky, the chief executive of Burisma -- the Ukrainian energy firm that hired Hunter Biden as a board member in 2013 -- claimed that he was \"forced\" to pay Joe and Hunter Biden $5 million each, apparently in exchange for orchestrating the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor named Viktor Shokin who was purportedly investigating Burisma at the time.\n\nThe assertion that the elder Biden, who was then vice president, acted to have Shokin removed in an effort to protect Burisma has been undercut by widespread criticism of the former Ukrainian prosecutor that led the U.S. State Department itself to seek Shokin's ouster.\n\nA White House spokesperson, responding to the document's release, says \"congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.\"\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, during a press briefing, answers \"No\" when asked if there is any possibility that President Biden could end up pardoning his son Hunter Biden for any of the federal charges he faces.\n\nUnder questioning from reporters, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre reiterates that President Biden \"was never in business with his son.\"\n\nHunter Biden appears before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika to formally agree to the plea deal negotiated in June -- but during a contentious hearing, Judge Noreika defers the deal after taking issue with the structure of the arrangement.\n\nNoreika requests additional briefings from the parties before she'll determine next steps. In the meantime, Hunter Biden enters a plea of not guilty.\n\nFormer Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer testifies before the House Oversight panel , telling legislators that Burisma, through Hunter Biden, benefitted by its association with the so-called \"Biden brand\" -- but that Hunter Biden only provided the \"illusion of access\" to his father and did not discuss his business dealings with him, according to committee members who participated in the closed-door hearing.\n\nHouse Republicans release the complete transcript of Devon Archer's testimony before the Oversight panel, which include his recollection that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone or referenced his father being on the phone in front of business associates \"maybe 20 times\" in the 10 years that Archer and Hunter Biden were business associates -- which included a period when Biden was vice president -- but that Joe Biden's interactions with Hunter Biden's associates were \"not related to commercial business\" and that Joe Biden had no involvement with Burisma or took any actions to benefit Burisma or Hunter Biden, according to the fully transcribed interview with the committee.\n\nArcher confirms that he was not aware of any wrongdoing by President Biden, according to the transcription.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appoints Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel in his investigation of Hunter Biden, after the Trump appointee asked Garland to be appointed special counsel in the case.\n\nWeiss says in court documents filed within minutes of his appointment that plea negotiations have reached \"an impasse\" and that he intends to drop the misdemeanor tax charges against Hunter Biden in Delaware and instead bring them in California and Washington, D.C., where prosecutors say the alleged misconduct occurred.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden say in a court filing that federal prosecutors reneged on the plea deal that would have resolved tax and gun charges against Hunter Biden.\n\nDespite their acknowledgement that the plea agreement on tax charges is \"moot,\" attorneys for Hunter Biden argue that the second part of the deal -- a diversion agreement on a separate gun charge -- remains in effect, since it is a separate contract negotiated and entered into by the parties outside the judge's purview.\n\nIn court filings, prosecutors for Weiss push back on Hunter Biden's assertion that they \"reneged\" on the ill-fated plea deal, and dispute defense counsel's claim that the diversion agreement on a gun possession charge remains \"valid and binding.\"\n\nCourt documents filed by special counsel David Weiss say that Weiss intends to bring an indictment against Hunter Biden by the end of the month, pertaining to the felony gun charge that was previously brought under the pretrial diversion agreement brokered by the two parties.\n\nHunter Biden's legal team argues that the pretrial diversion agreement remains in effect.\n\n\"We believe the signed and filed diversion agreement remains valid and prevents any additional charges from being filed against Mr. Biden,\" says Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Hunter Biden. \"We expect a fair resolution of the sprawling, 5-year investigation into Mr. Biden that was based on the evidence and the law, not outside political pressure.\"\n\nHunter Biden is indicted by special counsel David Weiss on felony charges that he lied on a federal form when he said he was drug-free at the time that he purchased a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver in October 2018. His legal team maintains that the pretrial diversion agreement from July remains in effect, though Weiss' team says it's null and void.\n\n\"As expected, prosecutors filed charges today that they deemed were not warranted just six weeks ago following a five-year investigation into this case,\" Hunter Biden attorney Abbe Lowell says in a statement. \"We believe these charges are barred by the agreement the prosecutors made with Mr. Biden, the recent rulings by several federal courts that this statute is unconstitutional, and the facts that he did not violate that law, and we plan to demonstrate all of that in court.\"\n\nHunter Biden files a lawsuit against the IRS over alleged \"unlawful disclosures\" made by the pair of whistleblowers who accused government prosecutors of mishandling their investigation into him.\n\nHunter Biden's attorney files court papers seeking to have his client's arraignment, scheduled for Oct. 3 in a Delaware court, take place via video conference instead of in person.\n\nA judge denies Hunter Biden's effort to avoid appearing in person at his arraignment on federal gun charges, ordering him to appear at a hearing scheduled for Oct. 3.\n\nThe same day, Attorney General Merrick Garland, testifying for five hours before the House Judiciary Committee, is grilled by GOP lawmakers about his department's handling of criminal probes into Hunter Biden and others. Garland pushes back on GOP claims that he's taken any directives from the White House, saying, \"I am not the president's lawyer. I am not Congress' prosecutor. The Justice Department works for the American people. Our job is to follow the facts and the law, and that is what we do.\"\n\nHunter Biden files a lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, accusing the former Trump attorney of computer fraud over his role in obtaining and sharing the alleged contents of the infamous laptop. In a statement responding to the suit, Giuliani adviser Ted Goodman says, \"I'm not surprised he's now falsely claiming his laptop hard drive was manipulated by Mayor Giuliani, considering the sordid material and potential evidence of crimes on that thing.\"\n\nHunter Biden, appearing in the same Delaware courthouse where his federal plea deal with prosecutors fell apart over the summer, formally enters a plea of not guilty to the three felony gun charges that were part of the original plea agreement.\n\nABC News reports that Hunter Biden is urging the Justice Department to investigate his former business associate Tony Bobulinski over claims that Bobulinski lied to federal investigators during an interview in the weeks leading up to the 2020 presidential election when he alleged that the Bidens had lied to the public about the nature of then-candidate Joe Biden's involvement in Hunter Biden's proposed overseas business ventures.\n\nHunter Biden is subpoenaed by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer to appear before the committee , along with his former business associate Rob Walker, President Biden's brother James Biden, and other members of the Biden family.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys file a motion seeking court approval to issue subpoenas to former President Donald Trump, former Attorney General William Barr, and two ex-Justice Department officials for documents they say could shed light on whether the federal gun charges Hunter Biden is facing were the result of \"a vindictive or selective prosecution arising from an unrelenting pressure campaign beginning in the last administration.\"\n\nABC News reports that special counsel David Weiss is using a Los Angeles-based federal grand jury to pursue the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs, according to sources. The grand jury has issued a subpoena to James Biden, the brother of President Joe Biden, as part of the probe, a source says.\n\nResponding to his subpoena to appear before the House Oversight Committee, Hunter Biden, in a letter from his attorney to Republican lawmakers, says he is willing to testify before the panel -- but only in a public forum.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss files nine tax-related charges against Hunter Biden, accusing him of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes from 2016 to 2020. The indictment alleges that the younger Biden earned millions of dollars from foreign entities and \"spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle at the same time he chose not to pay his taxes.\"\n\nHunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, claims the 56-page indictment includes \"no new evidence\" and says, \"Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought.\"\n\nAttorneys representing Hunter Biden ask a federal judge to dismiss three felony gun charges he faces in Delaware. The president's son pleaded not guilty to all three charges in October, after Weiss indicted him on the charges in September.\n\nAs GOP lawmakers convene to depose Hunter Biden in a closed-door session that he has informed them he won't attend, he addresses members of the media outside the U.S. Capitol and slams House Republicans for refusing to allow him to answer questions in a public forum, saying, \"I am here to testify at a public hearing today, to answer any of the committees' legitimate questions.\"\n\nHunter Biden makes a surprise appearance at a hearing of the GOP-led House Oversight Committee on whether to hold him in contempt of Congress for refusing a subpoena to testify before the committee behind closed doors. The committee approves a resolution recommending he be held in contempt for his refusal of provide closed-door testimony.\n\nHunter Biden, appearing in federal court in Los Angeles, enters a plea of not guilty to the nine felony and misdemeanor tax charges in special counsel David Weiss' December indictment.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss' office issues a biting rebuttal to Hunter Biden's attempt to have the three felony gun charges against him thrown out, calling his selective prosecution claim \"a fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\nThe filing comes on the same day that the Justice Department files a motion seeking to dismiss a civil lawsuit filed by Hunter Biden against the Internal Revenue Service over its alleged failure to protect his tax information from disclosure by the two whistleblowers who accused the Biden administration of mishandling the probe into the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden, after weeks of back-and-forth with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, agrees to sit for a closed-door deposition on Feb. 28, avoiding the threat of contempt of Congress charges.\n\nA longtime business partner of Hunter Biden, Eric Schwerin, tells the House Oversight Committee in a closed-door interview that he is \"not aware of any financial transactions or compensation\" that then-Vice President Joe Biden received related to business conducted by this family members.\n\nTony Bobulinski, the onetime business associate of Hunter Biden who has become a critic of the Biden family, testifies before the House Oversight Committee, reiterating claims he made during the 2020 election that Joe Biden was \"an enabler\" of several of his family's overseas business schemes that \"sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government.\"\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss indicts Alexander Smirnov , an FBI confidential source who provided derogatory information about President Biden and his son Hunter Biden, on felony false statement and obstruction charges. Smirnov is the same person that Republicans have called \"a highly credible FBI source\" and have used to claim Joe Biden is corrupt, multiple senior congressional sources tell ABC News.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden move to dismiss the tax-related charges brought by special counsel David Weiss in California, accusing prosecutors of selectively targeting the younger Biden, violating a statute of limitations, and filing duplicative charges on three counts of failure to pay and tax evasion.\n\nIn a court filing, special counsel David Weiss says that one-time FBI informant Alexander Smirnov had high-level Russian contacts and that, following his arrest the week before, Smirnov told the FBI that \"officials with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story\" about Hunter Biden.\n\nA measured and defiant Hunter Biden addresses a litany of allegations during six hours of closed-door testimony before the GOP-led House Oversight and Judiciary committees. The deposition appears to include no major bombshells as he repeatedly invokes his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction -- telling the committee he is \"embarrassed\" by some of his conduct at the time -- while vehemently and repeatedly denying that his father had any involvement in his business life.\n\nA week after Hunter Biden's closed-door testimony on Capitol Hill, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer invites him to appear for a public hearing on March 20.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss files his rebuttal to efforts by Hunter Biden to have his nine tax-related charges in California dismissed, slamming his arguments in court filings as a \"conspiracy theory,\" a \"house of cards,\" and \"shapeshifting claims.\"\n\nA week after his closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee as part of their impeachment inquiry, Hunter Biden, through his attorney, declines an invitation by congressional Republicans to testify in public -- but suggests he would attend a hearing on foreign influence peddling if lawmakers also invited members of former President Donald Trump's family.\n\nThe development comes on the same day that the judge overseeing Hunter Biden's felony gun case in Delaware tentatively schedules his trial for June 3 -- just weeks before his Los Angeles-based tax trial is scheduled to begin on June 20.\n\nJudge Mark Scarsi, the federal judge overseeing Hunter Biden's tax case in California, hears several defense motions to dismiss the charges and says afterward that he will issue a ruling by April 17.\n\nJudge Scarsi denies all eight of Hunter Biden's motions to dismiss his nine-count tax indictment in California, paving the way for a June 20 trial.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika denies attempts by Hunter Biden to dismiss the three federal gun charges he faces, all but ensuring he will stand trial in June.\n\nAttorneys representing Hunter Biden threaten to sue Fox News for violating \"revenge porn\" laws and publishing since-discredited bribery allegations as part of a scheme to \"paint him in a false light,\" according to a letter obtained by ABC News.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss' office suggests in court papers that they will call multiple women who had relationships with Hunter Biden to testify in his upcoming felony gun trial, including his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, and the widow of his late brother Beau Biden, Hallie Biden.\n\nProsecutors say in a court filing that they plan to use Hunter Biden's infamous laptop as evidence in his upcoming felony gun trial to help them prove that he unlawfully obtained a firearm in 2018.\n\nThe development comes on the same day that U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi grants Hunter Biden's request to postpone his Los Angeles trial on tax charges until Sept. 5 -- raising the likelihood that a jury could be deliberating whether to convict the president's son on several felony counts in the waning weeks of the 2024 election.\n\nA jury of six woman and six men is sworn in on Day 1 of Hunter Biden's federal gun trial in Delaware, where the president's son is accused of lying on an ATF form when he said he was not using drugs at the time of his gun purchase in 2018.\n\nProsecutors enter Hunter Biden's infamous laptop as evidence on Day 2 of the trial , with an FBI special agent testifying that investigators were able confirm the laptop was his by matching its serial number to his iCloud account.\n\nProsecutors cite messages found on the laptop to argue that Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs at the time of his 2018 gun purchase, and also play audiobook excerpts from his 2021 memoir in which he discusses his past drug use. But the FBI witness acknowledges under cross-examination that she cannot verify that his drug use was continuous during that period.\n\nProsecution witnesses Kathleen Buhle and Zoe Kestan, Hunter Biden's ex-wife and ex-girlfriend, testify on Day 3 of the trial about Hunter Biden's drug use to bolster the government's argument that he was using drugs at the time he purchased the gun in Delaware in October 2018.\n\nKestan, however, concedes on cross-examination that she had \"no idea\" what Hunter Biden was up to from Sept. 23, when he left California for Delaware, until November, when the two reconnected.\n\nHallie Biden, the widow of President Joe Biden's late son Beau Biden who was romantically involved with Hunter Biden at the time he purchased the gun at the center of the case, testifies on Day 4 of the trial about how she discovered the firearm in Hunter Biden's vehicle on Oct. 23, 2018, and, in a panic, disposed of it in a trash receptacle outside a local supermarket.\n\nShe tells jurors that she also found \"remnants\" of crack in Hunter Biden's vehicle at the time she discovered the gun -- but acknowledges under cross-examination that she did not see Hunter Biden abusing drugs or alcohol for most of the month of October, potentially undercutting the prosecution's contention that he was using drugs at the time he purchased the gun on Oct. 12.\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden tells ABC News anchor David Muir in an exclusive interview that he will accept the outcome of the trial and that he would rule out issuing a pardon for his son.\n\nAfter the government rests it case, Hunter Biden's daughter Naomi Biden, testifying for the defense, tells jurors on Day 5 of the trial that her dad \"seemed great\" just days after he purchased the Colt revolver at the center of the case -- but her testimony under cross-examination suggests that drug remnants found in his truck by his then-girlfriend Hallie Biden 11 days after the gun purchase likely came from him.\n\nThe defense rests its case without Hunter Biden taking the stand on Day 6 of the trial .\n\nProsecutors tell the jury in closing arguments that Hunter Biden \"knew he was using drugs\" when he said otherwise on the gun-purchase form, while the defense argues that prosecutors failed to \"fill in the gaps\" about Hunter Biden's drug use around the time of the gun purchase \"because they don't have the proof.\"\n\nHunter Biden is found guilty on all three counts in his federal gun case: two counts of making false statements for saying on a federal form that he was not addicted to drugs at the time he purchased the firearm at the center of the case, and a third count of illegally obtaining the firearm while addicted to drugs.\n\nPresident Joe Biden says he will accept the outcome of his son's case and that he will \"continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\"\n\nPresident Biden tells reporters that he would not commute any sentence handed down to his son Hunter Biden following the younger Biden's federal gun conviction.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden request a new trial in his federal gun case, arguing that his \"convictions should be vacated\" because the trial commenced before a circuit court formally issued a mandate denying his appeal.\n\nHunter Biden sues Fox News and its parent company over their production of the fictional miniseries \"The Trial of Hunter Biden,\" which his attorneys call \"an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\"\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden withdraw their bid for a new trial in his federal gun case, conceding in court papers that a motion they filed last month misunderstood a technicality in the district court's capacity to carry out a trial.\n\nAttorneys for Hunter Biden, citing a decision by a federal judge in Florida to dismiss the classified documents case against Donald Trump, file a pair of motions in California and Delaware seeking to dismiss both federal criminal cases against him.\n\nHunter Biden drops his lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company over the fictional miniseries \"The Trial of Hunter Biden,\" with the intention of refiling it against new defendants.\n\nAsked during a White House briefing if President Biden would considering pardoning his son Hunter Biden, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says, \"It's still a no. It will be a no. ... And I don't have anything else to add. Will he pardon his son? No.\"\n\nThe judge overseeing Hunter Biden's federal gun case schedules sentencing for Nov. 13, a week after Election Day.\n\nIn a court filing in Hunter Biden's federal tax case, special counsel David Weiss accuses him of accepting payments from a Romanian businessman who was attempting to \"influence U.S. government agencies,\" while his father Joe Biden was vice president. Hunter Biden's attorneys call the claim an \"inflammatory and incomplete, and therefore misleading, characterization.\"\n\nHunter Biden's attorney Abbe Lowell confirms reports that Hunter Biden, while his father was vice president in 2016, attempted to enlist the support of the U.S. ambassador to Italy for a prospective business deal in what Lowell says was a \"normal and proper practice.\"\n\nThe judge overseeing Hunter Biden's federal tax case rejects Hunter Biden's latest attempt to dismiss several of the charges against him, all but ensuring that the case will go to trial in September as scheduled.\n\nThe judge overseeing the case of the former FBI informant charged with lying about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden's overseas business ties rejects an effort to challenge the legitimacy of special counsel David Weiss' appointment on the same grounds that a federal judge dismissed Donald Trump's classified documents case.\n\nAs prospective jurors gather for jury selection in Hunter Biden's federal tax trial, the president's son, in a surprise move, says he will seek a plea arrangement -- then ultimately pleads guilty to all counts . The plea, which avoids a lengthy and potentially embarrassing trial, means that he will face up to 17 years in prison when he is sentenced on Dec. 16.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, the judge overseeing Hunter Biden's conviction on gun charges, agrees to push back his sentencing date three weeks, from Nov. 13 to Dec. 4, to allow more time for Hunter Biden's legal team to gather materials for the sentencing memorandum.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika again agrees to push back Hunter Biden's sentencing date in his gun case, from Dec. 4 to Dec. 12, due to scheduling conflict with special counsel David Weiss' case against former FBI confidential source Alexander Smirnov.\n\nSpeaking to reporters a day after Donald Trump wins reelection over Vice President Kamala Harris, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says that President Joe Biden does not plan to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, after the younger Biden is sentenced on separate tax and gun charges in December.\n\nWhite House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, asked if President Biden is still committed to no clemency for his son Hunter Biden, says, \"I don't have anything to add to what he's said already.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden pardons Hunter Biden , weeks before the younger Biden is to be sentenced on tax evasion and federal gun charges. The outgoing president, who previously said he would not pardon his son, says that \"raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice\" in which his son was \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.\"\n\nThe blanket pardon comes one day after President-election Donald Trump nominates Kash Patel , a staunch Trump ally who previously said \"Democrats should be very afraid\" of a new Trump administration, for director of the FBI.\n\nIn a pair of court filings, prosecutors in special counsel David Weiss' office push back against President Joe Biden's allegation that their charges against Hunter Biden were motivated by politics, and urge the judges overseeing Hunter Biden's two federal cases not to dismiss the indictments, but instead close the docket in each case -- which would allow the records to continue to exist.\n\nTwo days after President Joe Biden pardons his son, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika terminates Hunter Biden's gun case in the manner requested by prosecutors, while U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi agrees to terminate Hunter Biden's tax case but slams the president's criticism of the case as an improper attempt to \"rewrite history.\"\n\nOne-time FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who was set to be sentenced in January, reaches a plea deal on charges of lying about the Biden family's business dealings plus additional tax-related charges.\n\nThe Justice Department releases special counsel David Weiss' final report on his multiple investigations into Hunter Biden. Weiss, in the report, blasts President Joe Biden's characterization of his probe being \"infected\" with \"raw politics,\" saying his prosecutions were \"the culmination of thorough, impartial investigations.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "President Biden Regrets Selecting Merrick Garland As Attorney General\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nJosh Blackman | 12.29.2024 1:30 AM\n\nThe Washington Post has an in depth profile of President Biden's administration. Apparently, Biden regrets selecting Merrick Garland as Attorney General, and would have preferred former Alabama Senator Doug Jones.\n\nIn private, Biden has also said he should have picked someone other than Merrick Garland as attorney general, complaining about the Justice Department's slowness under Garland in prosecuting Trump, and its aggressiveness in prosecuting Biden's son Hunter, according to people familiar with his comments.\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential transition, Biden's attorney general selection pitted some of his closest aides against each other. Former senator Ted Kaufman (D-Delaware) and Mark Gitenstein, both longtime friends of Biden, advocated for the president naming then-Sen. Doug Jones (D-Alabama) as attorney general, arguing that as a politician he would be better able to navigate the bitterly partisan moment.\n\nBut Ron Klain, Biden's incoming chief of staff, pushed for Garland. He stressed that Garland - a federal judge with a sterling reputation for independence and fairness - would show Americans that Biden was rebuilding a department badly shaken by Trump's political attacks.\n\nBiden was persuaded, and some Democrats believe the decision had devastating results. Had the Justice Department moved faster to prosecute Trump for allegedly seeking to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling classified documents, they say, the former president might have faced a politically damaging trial before the election. (Others blame the Supreme Court and a Trump-appointed judge in Florida for repeatedly siding with the former president and delaying the cases; the Justice Department declined to comment.)\n\nThis episode demonstrates that this notion of the Department of Justice as \"independent\" has always been a ruse. The Attorney General works for the President. Garland's efforts to make the institution separate from the President backfired, in a way that left no one happy. Moreover, Biden expressly viewed the criminal prosecution of Trump as a way to harm his primary political opponent. The stuff about protecting democracy was just a veneer, as evidenced by the silence about insurrection and fascism in the lead-up to January 6, 2025.\n\nBy the way, when is Garland going to resign? Garland should have stepped down when Biden criticized him for the Hunter Biden prosecution, but didn't. Attorney General Loretta Lynch stayed on until January 20, 2017. Will Garland continue to ride this out till the bitter end?\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Kennedy, Jr. receives 14 \r\npercent support, Green Party candidate Jill Stein receives 2 percent support, and independent candidate Cornel \r\nWest receives 2 percent support.\n\nThere is no clear leader in either of these matchups as the leads are within the margin of error, making the \r\nrace too close to call.\n\nNineteen percent of voters who chose a candidate in the matchup with third-party candidates say it is \r\neither very likely (3 percent) or somewhat likely (16 percent) that they will change their minds about their choice \r\nfor president before the election, while 80 percent say it is either not so likely (12 percent) or not likely at all (68 \r\npercent) that they will change their minds before the election.\n\nAmong voters supporting Biden, 15 percent say it is either very likely (3 percent) or somewhat likely (12 \r\npercent) that they will change their minds, while 84 percent say it is either not so likely (9 percent) or not likely at \r\nall (75 percent).\n\nAmong voters supporting Trump, 8 percent say it is somewhat likely that they will change their minds, \r\nwhile 92 percent say it is either not so likely (13 percent) or not likely at all (79 percent).\n\nAmong voters supporting Kennedy, 52 percent say it is either very likely (11 percent) or somewhat likely \r\n(41 percent) that they will change their minds, while 46 percent say it is either not so likely (16 percent) or not \r\nlikely at all (30 percent).\n\nVoters were asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of:\n\nGiven a list of 11 issues and asked which is the most urgent one facing the country today, the economy \r\n(28 percent) tops the list, followed by preserving democracy in the United States (21 percent) and immigration \r\n(16 percent).\n\nVoters were asked who they think would do a better job handling six issues...\n\nVoters give President Biden a negative 39 - 56 percent job approval rating, an improvement from a \r\nnegative 35 - 61 percent job approval rating in Quinnipiac University's April 24 poll.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 voters (72 percent) think it is likely that they will watch the televised debate between \r\nPresident Biden and former President Trump scheduled for late June, while 27 percent of voters think it is \r\nunlikely that they will watch the debate.\n\nMore than a month after former President Trump's criminal trial began in New York City in connection \r\nwith charges of falsifying business records, including a hush money payment to an adult film actress, 70 percent \r\nof voters say they are following news regarding the trial either very closely (32 percent) or somewhat closely (38 \r\npercent), while 30 percent say they are following it not too closely.\n\nSix in 10 voters (60 percent) think the charges against Trump in this trial are either very serious (37 \r\npercent) or somewhat serious (23 percent), while 36 percent think the charges are either not too serious (11 \r\npercent) or not serious at all (25 percent).\n\nForty-six percent of voters believe Trump did something illegal, while 29 percent believe he did \r\nsomething unethical but nothing illegal, and 21 percent believe he did not do anything wrong.\n\nVoters were asked how it would impact their vote if Trump were convicted in this case. Among Trump \r\nvoters, 6 percent say if he were convicted they would be less likely to vote for him, 24 percent say they would be \r\nmore likely to vote for him, and 68 percent say it would not make a difference to their vote.\n\nFollowing reports that more than a decade ago independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. contracted a \r\nparasitic worm that ended up in his brain from which his campaign says he made a full recovery, when asked \r\nwhether voters are concerned about Kennedy's fitness to serve as president, they say 65 - 30 percent that they are \r\nnot concerned.\n\nVoters 43 - 35 percent disapprove of the way Israel is responding to the October 7th Hamas terrorist \r\nattack. In Quinnipiac University's December 20, 2023 poll, voters were split, with 43 percent approving and 42 \r\npercent disapproving.\n\nVoters 49 - 43 percent oppose the United States sending more military aid to Israel for their efforts in the \r\nwar with Hamas.\n\nVoters were asked whether their sympathies lie more with the Israelis or more with the Palestinians. \r\nForty-six percent of voters say the Israelis, 29 percent say the Palestinians, and 25 percent did not offer an \r\nopinion.\n\nRoughly 4 out of 10 voters (38 percent) think the United States is doing too little to provide humanitarian \r\naid to civilians in Gaza, while 37 percent think the U.S. is doing about the right amount, and 13 percent think the \r\nU.S. is doing too much.\n\nVoters 55 - 36 percent oppose the student protests being held on college and university campuses \r\nresponding to Israel's actions in Gaza.\n\nSeventy-four percent of voters think prejudice against Jewish people in the United States today is either a \r\nvery serious problem (35 percent) or a somewhat serious problem (39 percent), while 21 percent think it is either \r\na not so serious problem (15 percent) or not a problem at all (6 percent).\n\nSixty-four percent of voters think prejudice against Muslim people in the United States today is either a \r\nvery serious problem (25 percent) or a somewhat serious problem (39 percent), while 31 percent think it is either \r\na not so serious problem (20 percent) or not a problem at all (11 percent).\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters (65 percent) think supporting Ukraine is in the national interest of the United \r\nStates, while 29 percent think it is not in the national interest of the United States.\n\nA quarter of voters (25 percent) think the United States is doing too little to help Ukraine, 33 percent \r\nthink the U.S. is doing about the right amount to help Ukraine, and 36 percent think the United States is doing too \r\nmuch to help Ukraine.\n\nThirteen percent say the United States should do more to support Ukraine, even if it means increasing the \r\nrisk of the United States getting into a war with Russia; while 34 percent say the United States should do more to \r\nsupport Ukraine, but not if it means increasing the risk of the United States getting into a war with Russia; and 47 \r\npercent say the United States is already doing enough to support Ukraine.\n\n1,374 self-identified registered voters nationwide were surveyed from May 16th - 20th with a margin of \r\nerror of +/- 2.6 percentage points.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Doug Schwartz, Ph.D. since 1994, conducts independent, \r\nnon-partisan national and state polls on politics and issues.

      "text": "Biden Is Against Corporate Welfare Except When He's for It\n\nCorporate Welfare\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 4.1.2024 7:00 AM\n\nNot that many Americans expect politicians to be truthful, but for the sake of naïfs walking among us at this late date, let's point out that, when President Joe Biden rails against giveaways to big business, it means a lot of money is on its way to favored corporations. To the extent the president is serious about the anti-business animus in his speeches, it's directed only at private enterprises that go their own way; entities that follow government direction are recipients of all sorts of privileges and largesse.\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\n\"I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together - a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get the - all the tax breaks,\" President Biden huffed during this year's State of the Union address.\n\nThe president's speech was marked by the usual theatrics that accompany these monarchical spectacles, including applause from his supporters, scowls from his opponents, and the occasional protest. It also continued the time-honored political tradition of being laden with bullshit.\n\nBiden \"is a hypocrite,\" points out Cato Institute budget expert Chris Edwards. \"He signed into law three massive bills handing out hundreds of billions of dollars of narrow tax breaks and spending subsidies to big corporations. It is the biggest gusher of corporate welfare ever.\"\n\nBiden barely broke stride in moving on from ranting against tax breaks for big corporations to handing huge sums of taxpayer money to giant businesses who, we might suspect, are perfectly capable of investing in projects they expect to generate profits.\n\n\"My CHIPS and Science Act led to partnership with companies, investing billions and billions of dollars across the country, bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to America - jobs of the future back to America,\" Biden boasted just two weeks after the State of the Union speech, during a stop in Chandler, Arizona at the site of an Intel chip-making plant.\n\nSpecifically, Intel is on the receiving end of $8.5 billion from the federal government to help fund its expansion. Biden himself pointed out that the taxpayer funds are \"being paired with over $100 billion from Intel\" that the company is putting into its own project, so it's clear that Intel is perfectly capable of making business decisions and investments on its own. But a purely private project wouldn't provide a photo-op for politicians. Unfortunately for us all, those photo-ops are expensive .\n\n\"Taxpayers will pony up over $283,000 per job created-and that's counting only the $8.5 billion in direct payments to the company,\" Reason 's Eric Boehm recently wrote about the Intel subsidies.\n\nOf course, if private industry is left to its own devices, it may not invest in precisely the way government officials want to invest-for example, in a purple state considered crucial to the 2024 presidential contest. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), an Intel competitor, asked the federal government for billions of dollars in support before it would continue with a planned Arizona expansion, which involves higher costs than existing operations in Taiwan.\n\nAnd the flow of money doesn't end there.\n\n\"Rather than trickle‐down economics, this is a Niagara Falls of subsidies flooding from Washington to the president's favored industries and corporations,\" Cato's Edwards writes of the Biden administration's efforts to encourage economic development the White House likes, in places that provide political benefit. \"Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, which increased federal subsidies by $548 billion. Tens of billions of dollars were handed out to railroads, electric utilities, broadband companies, the EV industry, and others.\"\n\nBiden also approved tens of billions of dollars in subsidies through the CHIPs and Science Act of 2022, and $868 billion in energy subsidies in the badly misnamed Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\n\"The US government could spend more than $1.8 trillion over ten years on energy tax subsidies,\" Edwards's colleague Adam N. Michel, a tax policy expert, recently noted .\n\nThis is all part of a return to the bad old days of industrial policy , under which government officials openly poke and prod private businesses to develop and grow in ways that politicians prefer, whether or not they make economic sense. The Biden administration makes no bones about favoring this approach.\n\n\"A modern American industrial strategy identifies specific sectors that are foundational to economic growth, strategic from a national security perspective, and where private industry on its own isn't poised to make the investments needed to secure our national ambitions,\" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan insisted last April.\n\nSullivan spoke a month after the Harvard Kennedy School's Ruchir Agarwal wrote for the International Monetary Fund that \"industrial policy is gaining momentum in many countries, with some economists pointing to China's model as a success.\"\n\nMost observers think China is in serious , self-inflicted economic distress , so it's difficult to know just what \"success\" inspires others to adopt industrial policy-unless it's control for its own sake. But even many \"conservatives\" from formerly market-oriented circles embrace state-guided economies .\n\n\"Market economies do not automatically allocate resources well across sectors,\" Oren Cass, now executive director of American Compass , insisted in 2019. \"While the policies produced by our political system will be far from ideal, efforts at sensible industrial policy can improve upon our status quo.\"\n\nSensible industrial policy apparently involves paying Intel billions of dollars for projects to which it's already committed, while paying billions more to TSMC to motivate the construction of economically uncompetitive chip plants. It also involves additional fortunes to subsidize electric vehicles for which drivers show limited enthusiasm . Industrial policy seems to rest on the assumption that, if you build what politicians want, consumers will come. There's little evidence to support that claim.\n\nThough maybe subsidies will win political favor. In November, we'll have to see how the Niagara Falls of taxpayer funding breaks down in cost per vote.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

      "text": "President Biden Makes a False Claim About Inflation in CNN Interview\n\nThe annual rate of inflation was 1.4 percent when he entered office, not 9 percent.\n\nEditor's note, May 15, 2024: This piece has been updated to incorporate a second claim by President Joe Biden.\n\nIn an interview this week with CNN's Erin Burnett, President Joe Biden claimed that the inflation rate was 9 percent when he entered office, crediting his administration with bringing that inflation under control. \"No president has had the run we've had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation,\" Biden said in the interview. \"It was 9 percent when I came to office, 9 percent.\"\n\nBurnett did not interject or push back on the president during the interview, but Biden's claim is false: The annual rate of inflation was significantly lower when he took office in January 2021 and did not reach 9 percent until June 2022.\n\nDespite the claim being fact-checked by multiple outlets in the days after he made it, Biden repeated the assertion in an interview with Yahoo Finance on May 14. \"I think inflation has gone slightly up,\" Biden told Brian Sozzi. \"It was at 9 percent when I came in and it's now down around 3 percent.\"\n\nAccording to the consumer price index -the most common measure of U.S. inflation-the annual rate of inflation was only 1.4 percent in January 2021, the month Biden was sworn into office. Inflation quickly rose in the ensuing months, reaching a peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022 before retreating to 3 percent by June 2023. Year-over-year inflation has ranged from 3.1 to 3.7 percent in the 11 months since then, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' most recent reading -for March 2024-was 3.5 percent.\n\nA separate measure of inflation-the Bureau of Economic Analysis' personal consumption expenditures index -followed a similar trajectory . By that metric, the annual rate of inflation stood at 1.6 percent when Biden took office in January 2021, reaching a peak of 7.1 percent in June 2022. In March 2024, the most recent month in which data is available , the year-over-year rate had fallen to 2.7 percent.\n\nEconomists disagree on the extent to which Biden administration policies have been responsible for high U.S. inflation rates since he took office-supply and demand pressures created by the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to elevated inflation rates across most developed economies .\n\nAs The Dispatch Fact Check reported last year , however, many economists believe excess federal spending signed into law by Biden early in his presidency led prices to rise faster than they otherwise would have. \"If we hadn't had excessive monetary and fiscal stimulus, I think we still would have had inflation that was considerably above the Fed's target,\" Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told The Dispatch last fall. \"But, I don't think it would have been nearly as expensive as we have now.\"\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Gaming Out a Biden Exit\n\nAn open convention seems scary, but it might beat the alternative.\n\nLet's start with the stipulation that President Joe Biden can't be kept from the Democratic presidential nomination if he is determined to accept it.\n\nThe president has won 3,894 of 3,937 available pledged delegates-nearly 99 percent. Even if party leaders universally agreed Biden should be replaced, the rules make it almost impossible to do so.\n\nDemocratic National Committee bylaws state: \"Delegates  ... shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\" This \"good conscience\" clause could theoretically allow delegates to vote for someone other than Biden on the grounds that he is too infirm to serve another term.\n\nSo, yes, it's possible that if the bulk of the party turned against him that at least 1,919 of Biden's delegates-enough to hold him under the 1,976 he needs to win-could join a mass movement to vote their conscience and throw open the nominating process. But that seems extremely unlikely .\n\nMaking such a possibility even more remote is that the DNC plans to nominate Biden before the Chicago convention that begins on August 19. Purportedly to comply with Ohio's 90-day ballot deadline, Biden will be nominated via \"virtual roll call\"  that will take place by August 7 at the latest. All the work of organizing the rebellion would have to be done remotely, not up close and  personal at the convention. This was, I assume, part of the reason that the Biden DNC glommed on to the virtual nomination, and stayed glommed even after Ohio changed its deadline and the threat had passed.\n\nThat's all a long way of saying that unless Biden steps aside, there's no clean way to take the nomination away from him.\n\nBut what if someone tried ... or at least threatened to?\n\nThursday's debate was even worse than we feared, and I certainly feared it would be pretty bad . But the magnitude of the Democratic freakout would still seem excessive, unless we understand it in its proper context.\n\nFor four years, Democrats have been hyping themselves up to believe that Biden isn't really too enfeebled to be president. And for the past year particularly , it has been increasingly hard work. We didn't see anything on the debate stage that we hadn't been told by those in a position to know or been able to observe ourselves . But at each point, Democrats sucked it up and said \"Yes, but this is our best shot ...\"\n\nThe freakout isn't all about the debate performance, but the debate performance was so obviously bad and at such an important event, the Democrats who had felt obliged to stifle their anxieties publicly were finally free to give them voice, or give them voice again .\n\nThe freakout flood wasn't in response to the debate, per se , but the debate breached the dam that had been holding it all back. And as each Democrat joined the flow, others felt emboldened to do the same.\n\nWhen the New York Times ' editorial  board wrote \"It's too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden's age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes,\" it was saying something many of its members have no doubt believed for a long time, but now felt able-obliged, even-to say.\n\nYes, the most likely scenario is that Democrats will yet again rebuild the earthworks and the great wash of conventional wisdom for Biden to drop out will slow and return to little rivulets of dissent seeping out of a yet-still-weakened barrier. Indeed, the best bet would seem to be that Biden survives this, but never quite manages to stop the leakage of support. Words like those written by the Times will fade but never be erased.\n\nLet's consider, though, the less likely scenario. That's the one in which when Washington returns from the Independence Day recess, Biden's performance in the polls is living down to the fears being expressed publicly by the press and privately by Democratic elected officials and party leaders. Let's say that Biden is down 10 points by mid-July.\n\nWhat might happen then?\n\nOn August 7, 1974, Republicans Sen. Barry Goldwater , House Minority Leader John Rhodes , and Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott went to the White House and told President Richard Nixon not so much that he should resign, but what they would do if he didn't. They told Nixon that when the House inevitably impeached Nixon for lying about the Watergate break-in and obstructing the investigation into the crime that he would be convicted and removed with the support of Republicans in the Senate.\n\nShortly after the meeting, but before Nixon announced his resignation the next day, Goldwater told reporters that the issue of  resignation \"never came up.\"\n\n\"I don't think it would be proper for me to say what I think,\" Goldwater said at the time . \"And, anyway, I'm not sure the president would pay much attention.\"\n\nGoldwater and company were not there to tell Nixon what he should do, but rather what they would do: leave him to his fate and inevitable removal from office.\n\nImagine now that this summer, 50 years later, a group of similar Democratic solons carried a similar message to Biden. Not that he should drop out, but what they would do if he did not: withdraw their endorsements of him and urge the Democratic National Committee to write new rules for the convention unbinding the delegates.\n\nA lot of the speculation about how Biden might be gotten out of the race centers on whether former President Barack Obama might be the one to nudge Biden. That seems unlikely to work given the nature of their relationship . Or that first lady Jill Biden should be the one to make her husband see the light .\n\nBut for Biden, a creature of Congress, personal persuasion doesn't seem to be the right approach. The right emissaries would seem to be respected former colleagues and legislative leaders. Imagine Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer , Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin , and Rep. Jim Clyburn taking the message to Biden not that he should go, but that they have left him.\n\nAgain, this is not the most likely scenario. There's not a lot of reason to think that in an era when Republicans couldn't stand up to Trump in the aftermath of January 6, 2021, that the other party would be so brave as to do the same to a president from their own team. After all, Republicans are right now feeling a lot better about knuckling under to Trump and, after all, Biden's unfitness is a matter of decline, not design. Doing nothing and hoping for the best-or at least avoiding the blame-is always appealing.\n\nBut it is hardly fantastical to think that Democrats in 10 days or two weeks will view pushing Biden out as risky, but that sticking with him means certain defeat.\n\nThen what?\n\nIf the president were to drop out before being formally nominated by Zoom sometime in the next six weeks, all his delegates would suddenly become \"unpledged\" and free to support whomever they wish. Poof.\n\nShould he decide to endorse another candidate, the president would undoubtedly have sway with some of his former delegates, but they can ultimately support anyone. There is no mechanism by which Biden's delegates would automatically \"transfer\" to Vice President Kamala Harris . She would have to win at the convention, the same as any other candidate.\n\nBut then comes the revenge of the superdelegates. Deemphasized after the contentious 2016 Bernie-Hillary primary, these 700 or so party insiders no longer vote on the first ballot at the convention, unless the outcome is assured (as it would be, should Biden stick around).\n\nBut if no candidate receives the requisite delegates, as would seem likely in an open convention, then the superdelegates would participate in the second round of voting. These insiders' insiders could deliver more than a third of the needed delegates to a favored candidate, maybe Harris or maybe someone else . Maybe even someone you're not thinking about right now .\n\nIt's a scary prospect for Democrats to think about what might come out of an open convention, no doubt. But, if in two weeks time, the Biden team hasn't rebuilt the reservoir to hold in all these anxieties, the raging waters of uncertainty may look a lot more appealing than being sunk with the incumbent.\n\nHoly croakano!

In 2020, just one state, Maine, split its Senate and presidential votes, going for President Joe Biden by 9 points and reelecting Republican Sen. Susan Collins by a similar margin.' So how about a discussion of the current split in polling between Biden vs. Trump and incumbent Democrat senators vs. Republican challengers? Will the popular senators have reverse coattails and pull Biden over the line in swing states or will Biden pull down incumbents and give Republicans substantial gains in the Senate? Trump leads Biden by 2.3 in Pennsylvania, where Casey leads McCormick by 6-8. It is hard to imagine a Trump/Casey or Biden/McCormick voter so I tend to think Biden wins this state. Trump's challenge in Michigan and Wisconsin seems even more daunting. His lead over Biden is smaller in both states and the Democrat senators are polling well. Even Arizona where Trump apparently has a commanding lead raises the question of how there could be a significant Trump/Gallego vote. So I am thinking the Republicans pick up the Arizona Senate seat by the skin of their teeth while Biden scrapes out a narrow electoral college win in the rustbelt swing states. Not sure anything else is in play but would love to read your assessment.\" - Peter Sperry , Greenville, South Carolina\n\nMr. Sperry,\n\nThe conventional modern meaning of \"reverse coattails\" is the idea that down-ballot candidates help the top of the ticket. There's another understanding of it-that reverse coattails means hurting the candidates of the same party on the ticket.\n\nDown-ballot candidates do frequently help the top of the ticket, but it is often more organizational than attitudinal. A presidential candidate would benefit, for example, by a hotly contested congressional race in a swing state if it meant that the candidate of her or his party would be multiplying get-out-the-vote efforts, multiplying campaign ad spending, and keeping voters engaged.\n\nBut while Senate candidates often outperform presidential ones, I can't think of many, if any, recent instances where the Senate candidate bailed out a losing presidential candidate. There will be a number of Ohioans who vote for both Sen. Sherrod Brown and Trump, just as there will be Floridians who vote for President Biden and Sen. Rick Scott . It's harder to imagine a persuadable voter, though, who is inclined to vote differently on the presidential level because of his or her Senate preference. Again, a presidential campaign might piggyback on the turnout efforts of a state-level candidate, but not for persuasion. Indeed, there's evidence to suggest that it works the other way: Voters might prefer divided government, and split their ticket accordingly. If they're voting to return Trump or Biden to power, voters might want to keep them in check with a Senate of the opposite party.\n\nBut motivation can work in reverse, too. The way presidential coattails of any length work is that the big contest changes the composition of the electorate and helps or hurts those beneath. If, for instance, Democrats think that Biden is doomed, they have less motivation to go out and vote, depriving his fellow Democrats of core support they need to even get to a place where they can start working on bringing over the ticket splitters.\n\nAll best,\n\nc\n\n\"As an Ohio voter who leans Republican and followed the Senate primary fairly closely I was kind of surprised you didn't slot Bernie Moreno in as a flaky candidate along with Kari Lake . Character and his stance on entitlements are two of my major problems with him. I hope the  Republicans win the majority, but I can't bring myself to vote for a Trump sycophant like Moreno.\" - Huston Harrah , Logan Ohio\n\nMr. Harrah,\n\nI am sure that there are many more candidates ( in both parties) who actually are flakes. The question is whether voters know it.\n\nSince winning the Republican nomination, Moreno has seemed to be trying to run a pretty conventional kind of Senate campaign. This is perhaps not a surprise given his origins in a politically connected and wealthy family . It is possible that Moreno was faking some of his mega MAGA energy to try to win the primary. Now we get to find out if he was a fake flake or a real one.\n\nI promise we will keep tabs.\n\nAll best,\n\nc\n\nYou should email us!

      "text": "It Was Never Really About Trade at All\n\nDid Biden's international economic policy fail ... or did it never really even try?\n\nIn August 2020, The Dispatch Management TM asked me to sketch out my predictions for U.S. trade policy under a possible Biden administration. Contrary to the prevailing optimism at the time among many on the centers right and left, my take was pretty measured, predicting some modest improvement over the chaotic and costly Trump 1.0 years, some continuation of Trumpian protectionism (with less bluster), and even some deterioration on things like industrial policy and \"Buy American\" mandates.\n\nOn the second and third points, I didn't score too badly. On the first, however, I was dead wrong, and with the supremely disappointing Biden years now behind us, it's time for one last Capitolism Airing of Grievances .\n\nWhat most sticks out about Biden's trade legacy is just how little trade it involved. Instead, as we've documented here at Capitolism repeatedly , the era was one of U.S. stasis or outright retreat from the global stage. For example:\n\nOutside of these traditional trade areas, there were other disappointments. Via industrial policy measures like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act and various executive actions, the Biden team expanded \"Buy American\" protectionism and clamped down on enforcement of existing local content restrictions (e.g., on what qualifies as \"American\" and on possible waivers). The administration also dramatically broadened China-centric sanctions and export controls, costing American companies billions in lost revenue but failing to seriously dent Beijing's technological ambitions (and annoying many allies in the process). And then Biden officials capped it all off with the Nippon Steel-U.S. Steel embarrassment and a last-minute, error-riddled report by the Office of U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on shipbuilding that basically echoes (incorrect) union talking points.\n\nBeyond the lack of achievement was the incoherence-in both rhetoric and policy. On the former, our own U.S. trade representative-tasked by law with being federal government's chief trade negotiator (and chief trade cheerleader)-frequently parroted left-wing talking points, criticized U.S. trade liberalization (aka \"trickle-down trade\"!), and praised protectionism. Tai even once went so far as to claim tariffs didn't raise prices-a position the administration immediately (and hilariously) walked back . Amid all the \" polite protectionism ,\" meanwhile, other administration officials were proud globalists, boldly praising Biden's work to rebuild international alliances, encourage \"friendshoring,\" and otherwise boost the United States' standing in the world.\n\nU.S. trading partners could not be reached for comment.\n\nOn the policy incoherence, nowhere was this more evident than climate change. At one moment, Biden officials were championing trillions of taxpayer dollars to boost domestic consumption of renewable energy (and thus combat the \"existential crisis\" of climate change). Two seconds later, they were championing tariffs and Buy American rules-and no, not just to block Chinese products-that directly discouraged the proliferation of \"green\" technologies (by increasing prices, reducing variety, and delaying deployment). Related policy thus routinely ended up erratic, inconsistent, and sometimes downright contradictory-as we saw with wind, solar, and EVs. Policy toward China was similarly incoherent: Governments around the world were asked to ditch Beijing and join Team America (sometimes at significant economic cost), yet the United States refused to offer the one thing these nations wanted in return: preferential access to the U.S. market. Indeed, they sometimes got more tariffs (and the occasional lecture on labor and environmental rights). Then, the administration topped it all off by calling publicly traded Nippon Steel a national security threat-for having the gall to invest billions in a struggling U.S. steel company-on the very same day the U.S. sold Japan billions in advanced weaponry.\n\nIt was all enough to have many foreign governments admit before the election that they were pining for the better trade days of ... the Trump administration :\n\nSome foreign governments are reaching an uncomfortable conclusion as election season comes to a head: their best chance for negotiating a trade deal- however arduous it may be-lies in Donald Trump retaking the White House. While Trump derailed decades of free trade orthodoxy with tariffs and other hostile economic actions, his team often used those moves as leverage to strike deals with foreign governments- reforming NAFTA into the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, reshaping pacts with Japan and South Korea, and even striking a short-lived deal with China. Separately, Trump launched new free trade talks with the U.K. and Kenya. Biden, by contrast, swore off pursuing conventional free trade deals out of fear of electoral backlash and a belief from his team- particularly his trade chief- that lowering tariffs won't help the U.S. economy.\n\n...\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration's unofficial \"ban\" on new free trade talks has frustrated allies who had hoped they would be more open to new tariff-lowering deals, which are critical for their domestic economies. While Trump is by no means a free trader, foreign diplomats also do not believe he would be as rigidly opposed to lowering tariffs, if the circumstances are right.\n\nNow that the election is over, all but the most partisan and/or protectionist of trade-watchers-not just us libertarian \"fundamentalists\" (lol)-have declared the Biden era to have been a near-total failure on the international economic front. The Financial Times ' Alan Beattie, for example, offered a \"requiem for friendshoring, that abandoned orphan of Bidenomics\" that was finally put out of its misery by the Nippon Steel mess. Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute called trade a \" major deficiency \" of Biden's foreign policy, while the Baker Institute's Simon Lester politely documented how the administration's \"trade policy for the middle class\" didn't noticeably help many people in, you know, the actual American middle class . Bill Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies offered an \"obituary,\" noting that-except for the area of trade agreement enforcement (which can often just be backdoor protectionism, by the way)-the administration failed on its own \"pro-worker\" terms. \"The result,\" he adds, \"has been a classic case of failure to launch along with a boatload of missed opportunities to expand market access for U.S. exports, notably in agriculture, where we are now in our fourth year of trade deficits after nearly a half-century of surpluses.\" And on export controls, Geoffrey Gertz of the Center for a New American Security explained that Biden's \"small yard with a high fence\" strategy with China-strong restrictions on a narrow list of core technologies and countries-failed to achieve its (also contradictory) goals of fundamentally shifting global tech competition without \"upending the global economic order.\" Aside from winning over a few allies like the U.K., Gertz documents, the policy was ill-defined, overbroad, and costly-economically and geopolitically-and teed up Donald Trump to do even more (if he wants).\n\nThe Fletcher School's Dan Drezner perhaps sums it all up best. After detailing how Biden policy fomented the \"enshittification of global economic governance\" (lol), he concludes:\n\nThe Biden administration put an intellectual patina on rank protectionism, and then got offended when anyone pointed out the policy contradictions. And for continuing to justify a foreign economic policy that alienates allies while accomplishing little of economic substance, I will not miss having to write about Biden's foreign economic policy team ever again.\n\nWoof.\n\nAs these and other postmortems demonstrate, Biden's \"worker centered trade policy\" failed on its own public terms. But I'm left wondering whether-contra all the hackneyed jibberjabber about yards and workers and friends and stuff-those things, and trade more broadly, were really the Biden team's main objectives at all. Indeed, if you think about the last four years of U.S. trade policy as far less about trade and far more about, as Matt Yglesias has popularized, \" the groups \" that took over Democratic policymaking in recent years (and pushed it far to the left), it makes a lot more sense. In this particular case, the main progressive \"group\" at issue is U.S. labor unions, who have long opposed any trade liberalization, have more recently seen trade deals as a way to block foreign competition and to guide (bully) foreign labor, environmental, competition, and other nontrade policies; and as we saw with the Nippon Steel deal, have had immense influence over both President Biden and his trade-skeptical trade representative, Katherine Tai.\n\nYou can see this, I think, in Tai's farewell piece in Foreign Policy , which focused on everything but trade-antitrust, labor regulation, the environment, global governance, \"economic security for working people,\" you name it-and was literally titled \"The Real Purpose of Trade Policy.\" You can see it in FOIA'd communications between USTR and various left-wing groups. And, as demonstrated by the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity debacle-whereby Tai demanded developed-country standards from developing countries that couldn't possibly afford them, offered nothing in return (while lecturing these governments that this was all for their own good), and then abruptly walked away when a few union-aligned senators got mad-you can see it in actual U.S. policy too.\n\nIn this light, Biden's incoherent international economic policy starts to gel: It was never really about trade at all. It was about winning elections, about cementing future political support or career prospects, about pushing various progressive domestic priorities (labor, antitrust, etc.), and about keeping the people who actually wanted more U.S. trade and engagement-businesses, farmers, foreign governments, the WTO, etc.-on the hook until the very end. Under this new math, the messy stasis adds up-especially when championed by those angling for a future with \"the groups\" at issue.  (And, to be clear, I'm certainly not the only one who's noticed.)\n\nEven this more coherent retelling of Biden's trade legacy, however, runs into real problems. The first is that, as the United States government was taking a pause on \"globalization,\" much of the rest of the world-developing and developed alike-was having none of it. A brand new WTO report , for example, calculates that more than 80 percent of all global trade still occurs under the organization's multilateral rules (MFN column below)-about the same as in 2017 before all the trade wars began.\n\nNations are also still signing free trade agreements (FTAs)-and have been for years. Since the last new U.S. FTA entered into force in 2012, in fact, other governments have implemented a whopping 131 of them. This includes 17 by the EU, 15 by China, four by Mexico, and 38 by the post-Brexit U.K. (including its accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal that Trump abandoned and to which Biden refused to return). In just the Biden era alone, there have been 58 new FTAs-even as pandemic and war and geopolitical strife and \"deglobalization\" raged. And, as we've discussed, there are plenty of new non-U.S. FTAs under negotiation today. So, while the United States sits still, other nations-including China-are writing the rules on 21 st century issues like digital trade; their companies, farmers, and consumers are gaining better access to overseas markets than what their U.S. counterparts now have.\n\nThe second problem is perhaps even more obvious: Whether by design or incompetence, all this group-driven policy \"failure\" didn't win Team Biden/Harris the election. Maybe that's because most Americans don't care about trade policy (ranking it dead last among issue priorities in the Cato Institute's 2024 survey) or because most workers don't work in manufacturing or because fewer still are in a private-sector union today. (As the union-friendly folks at the Center for American Progress noted right after the election, for example, \"The results from exit polls and voter surveys conducted on Election Day suggest that union voters may have responded more positively to the pro-worker Biden-Harris administration and Harris-Walz campaigns than working-class voters overall.\") Or maybe it's because most American voters don't vote on wonky issue particulars at all but instead vote on broad outcomes like the national economy, the job market, and kitchen-table issues like grocery prices-or on entirely non-economic things like culture or candidate personality. Whatever the reason, it's clear that trying to cobble together a winning political coalition by catering to \"the groups\" in your policymaking-trade or otherwise-doesn't just make a mess of policy but also doesn't guarantee political victory.\n\nBut it does probably help you get a job with the groups.\n\nEurope now buys a lot of U.S. natural gas\n\nWill China's GDP ever catch the USA's (at market exchange rates)?\n\nRemind me when the tariffs and trade wars started ( more )\n\nIs this the dumbest protectionist comment ever?\n\nTrump tariff threats cause wave of uncertainty among U.S. businesses ( more ) ( even more )\n\nCounting all the different (and contradictory) justifications for Trump tariffs\n\nUnder California anti-gouging laws, consumers can't even offer to pay more\n\nSmall farmers refuse to raise prices during egg shortages\n\nU.S. data center construction boom\n\nSound thinking on trade and competition\n\nCBO debt projections are scary\n\nMore minimum wage economics\n\nDeflation in China hits hardest in manufacturing\n\nTSMC to start 1.6nm production in Taiwan next year\n\nRegulations thwart modular homebuilding\n\nMore Jones Act absurdity\n\nMilei deregulates food imports and exports ( more )\n\nCrypto supporters think Trump's meme coin is \"grifty and cheap\"\n\nScott Lincicome is the author of the Capitolism newsletter, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, and a visiting lecturer at Duke University Law School.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "The Problem With Biden's 'Don't' Doctrine\n\nThe president's emphasis on de-escalation ignores that geopolitical instability didn't start on October 7.\n\nAfter Iran's massive drone and missile attack on Israel Saturday, President Biden reportedly told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, \"You got a win. Take the win .\" Most of the weapons, the first Iran had ever fired on Israel from its own territory, were successfully intercepted.\n\n\"From its own territory\" is a very loaded qualifier. It speaks to both the complexity and the stupidity of the situation.\n\nIran has been attacking Israel for decades, but not from its own soil. Instead, Iran has given Hamas and Hezbollah weapons, training, and other support to do its dirty work from Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.\n\nIndeed, it's clarifying to think of Hamas and Hezbollah as Iranian drones in human form. If your neighbor hired and equipped agents to throw Molotov cocktails into your home and worse, you probably wouldn't think it was a particularly meaningful distinction that they didn't do so from his property. And if you prevented the Molotov cocktails from doing much damage with the help of other neighbors, you might not regard \"take the win\" as the soundest advice.\n\nGeopolitical deterrence is often a stupidity agreed on with sophistication. That's because perception-of strength, resolve and so on-is an essential part of statecraft.\n\nIran felt it had to retaliate following an Israeli strike on its consulate in Syria this month. Among those killed in that attack was Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader who according to Israel played a key role in the \" planning and execution \" of Hamas' October 7 attack.\n\nThat's part of the stupidity of deterrence doctrine. Every rung on the escalatory ladder may be treated by one side or the other as the beginning or end of hostilities. (That's partly why so many enemies of Israel started calling for a ceasefire before Israel had even responded to October 7.)\n\nEven before the Iranian attack hit Saturday, Iran's U.N. delegation announced, \" The matter can be deemed concluded .\" But from Israel's perspective, firing some 300 drones and ballistic missiles at its territory can't go unanswered. Deterrence demands that Iran understand such aggression has consequences.\n\nBiden disagrees. Because America and other allies helped Israel intercept the drones and missiles, he believes, Israel should stand down and \"take the win.\" \"Our aim is to de-escalate regional tensions ,\" a senior Biden official told the Washington Post . It's a reasonable desire but, for Israel, not necessarily a reasonable request.\n\nWhat's clearly unreasonable are the demands for restraint from opponents of U.S. military aid for Israel. Insisting that Israel shouldn't retaliate because its U.S.-funded defense systems successfully blocked an attack is logically and morally incompatible with calling for an end to American aid. Without those defenses, thousands of Israelis might have died, and Israel would have no choice but to respond offensively, which could ignite the regional war everybody wants to avoid.\n\nBut the real problem isn't with the perception of Israel's willingness to defend itself. It's with Biden's-and America's-willingness to deter our adversaries.\n\nAfter October 7, Biden had a one-word message for Iran and other bad actors seeking to take advantage of the situation: \" Don't .\" Iran ignored that advice Saturday. But it also ignored it months earlier, when Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Iranian-backed Houthis attacked Israel and Western shipping.\n\nMoreover, regional and geopolitical instability didn't start on October 7. Biden's early abandonment of the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan arguably started this cascade of uncertainty. Vladimir Putin may have seen it as a sign of Western weakness contributing to his decision to invade Ukraine.\n\nBiden's subsequent vow to provide Ukraine with \"whatever it takes, as long as it takes\" to defend itself was realized too haltingly. Now, thanks to Republican opposition in Congress, it could be a dead letter.\n\nDomestic politics have severely undermined the perception that America is a reliable ally. The war in Gaza is unpopular with the base of the president's party, prompting his near-constant rhetorical undermining of Israel. And even as Ukraine's front with Russia is buckling, the administration has told Kyiv that it shouldn't attack Russian oil installations for fear of inflated oil prices in an election year.\n\nIt's almost as if Biden's \"Don't\" doctrine gives allies just enough support to lose slowly.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Biden Drops Out of Presidential Race\n\nThe president endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, but her path to the nomination isn't yet guaranteed.\n\nHappy Monday! Your Morning Dispatchers have decided to give up on weekend plans for the foreseeable future-though we can't say that we had it as badly on Sunday as CNN's Wolf Blitzer .\n\nPresident Joe Biden will be a one-term president.\n\nThat may be the only thing we can say for certain today. After more than three weeks of unrelenting pressure from politicos, donors, and members of his own party, the 81-year-old president announced his decision to withdraw from the presidential race on Sunday and almost immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him. Key lawmakers, kingmakers, and potential nominees seemed to quickly fall in line with Harris as the new standard-bearer, but the matter is nowhere near settled as Democrats start the countdown to their Chicago convention-now just three weeks away-where the party will formally pick a ticket to face off against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, in November.\n\nThere was no dramatic East Room address to close out Biden's ill-fated presidential campaign on Sunday, nor a rally where he could make a show of passing the torch to the next generation-as he once promised to do .\n\nNo, the president-recovering from COVID-19 at his Rehoboth, Delaware, residence-instead took a page out of his predecessor's book, delivering history-changing news in a tweet. The statement reportedly came together in less than 24 hours over the weekend, the work of a tight circle of just a couple of Biden's most trusted advisers. Harris apparently learned of Biden's decision only minutes before the tweet went live, and many White House staffers found out their boss was dropping out of the race when they saw it on social media.\n\n\"While it has been my intention to seek reelection,\" Biden wrote in the letter posted early Sunday afternoon, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nScores and scores of Democrats had been waiting to hear those words since Biden's disastrous debate performance on June 27. The president, whom voters have long believed is too old to do the job, looked feeble and gaunt and sounded functionally incoherent during the debate, shocking even loyal Democrats into pushing for a change at the top of their party's ticket.\n\nSince June 27, roughly three dozen congressional Democrats had publicly called on the president to step aside, including several sitting senators. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had reportedly warned Biden in recent days that he was destined for a shellacking in November, and that he would be a potentially majority-losing drag on House and Senate races. Donors-and the people who assemble them-were jumping ship , too, prompting questions about whether the president's war chest could hold out until November.\n\nAs we've reported several times , Biden made a handful of unsuccessful attempts to reassure his erstwhile allies and the American people that the debate was \"one bad night,\" as so many Biden surrogates put it, and not the norm for an octogenarian three years into arguably the most stressful job in the world. He did sit-down interviews, called into MSNBC's Morning Joe , and delivered remarks from a teleprompter at several campaign events. He also addressed the nation in prepared remarks about the Supreme Court, during an hour-long press conference to cap the NATO Summit, and in an Oval Office address about the attempt on Trump's life last week.\n\nAnd those appearances were, by-and-large, not pretty. When faced with questions about his age and fitness, Biden was frequently defensive and hostile . At the NATO summit, he confused Harris for Trump in his first answer-after only hours earlier calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"President Putin.\" When asked by NBC News' Lester Holt what would happen if he had another \"episode\" like he had at the debate, Biden paused, tried to repeat the question, and uttered something the NBC News transcript could only mark down as \"INAUDIBLE.\" In a recent interview with Black Entertainment Television, Biden seemed unable to recall the name of his own secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, calling him instead \"the black man.\"\n\nSuch performances did little, if anything, to assuage voters' concerns. Biden's poll numbers-already poor before the debate-have been in freefall in the weeks since. As of Wednesday, 65 percent of Democrats surveyed by the Associated Press-NORC thought he should step aside. One by one, formerly safe blue states-like Virginia, New Hampshire, and New Mexico- turned purple or were at risk of moving into \"toss-up\" territory. The latest national polling from CBS News showed Trump running 5 points ahead of Biden. All the while, Biden insisted the polling wasn't accurate. \"You guys keep saying that,\" Biden told ABC News' George Stephanopolous earlier this month, when Stephanopolous pressed him about falling behind in the polls. \"Do you-look, you know polling better than anybody. Do you think polling data as accurate as it used to be?\"\n\nThe steady stream of leaks from concerned Democrats and public calls for Biden's withdrawal seemed to dry up immediately after the assassination attempt on Trump last Saturday, but it was a rushing river once again again by the latter half of the week. On Wednesday, Biden was diagnosed with COVID-19, and retreated to Delaware. On Friday, some dozen more Democratic lawmakers called on him to step aside .\n\nThe Biden campaign and the White House were unwavering in their denials of the rumors late last week that Biden was nearing a decision to withdraw from the race. \"Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump,\" Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, said on Morning Joe Friday morning. Twice that same day, White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates tweeted denials of reports that Biden was considering dropping out, saying \"Keep the faith.\"\n\nBiden was reportedly telling his own staff as late as Saturday morning that it was \"full steam ahead\" on his reelection bid, and seemed set to hit the campaign trail again next week, after he'd recovered from COVID-19.\n\nBut that changed Saturday evening. Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon, two of Biden's closest advisers, drove from Washington, D.C., to Delaware to tell him that new internal polling-the first of some crucial battlegrounds in two months-had revealed there was now no path to victory in November, Politico reported on Sunday . Not only was he losing in the six key swing states, he was cruising toward a loss in Virginia and New Mexico. Biden finally believed the numbers.\n\nAt 1:45 p.m. ET, he informed some key staff he was dropping out. At 1:46 p.m. ET, the tweet went live.\n\nHis announcement was followed about 30 minutes later by a full endorsement of Harris . \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" he tweeted. \"And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.\"\n\nHarris, for her part, quickly put out a statement of her own confirming she was interested in the top of the ticket. \"I am honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" she tweeted.\n\nBefore Biden dropped out, who would replace him in the event that he did was more or less an open question. While Harris was viewed as the favorite, a handful of Democratic up-and-comers-including Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Jared Polis of Colorado, Gavin Newsom of California, and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois-seemed like potential contenders who could try to leapfrog the unpopular vice president .\n\nBut in a flash on Sunday, Democrats-who had spent the last month in the deepest kind of disarray-fell squarely in line behind Harris as they praised Biden for his selflessness and patriotism. Nearly 150 of the 212 Democratic House members and 32 of the 51 senators who vote with the Democratic majority endorsed Harris. The vast majority of the governors who'd seemed most likely to try to box her out backed Harris, as did Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg-potentially in an effort to earn the running mate nod. \"The best path forward for the Democratic Party is to quickly unite behind Vice President Harris and refocus on winning the presidency,\" Shapiro said in a statement . \"The contrast in this race could not be clearer and the road to victory in November runs right through Pennsylvania-where this collective work began. I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as the 47th President of the United States.\"\n\nIn another boost for Harris, the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue reported that it had taken in more than $50 million in donations on Sunday, one of the strongest fundraising days Democrats have ever seen. The Biden reelection campaign reported having almost $100 million cash-on-hand at the end of June-and it's unclear whether or how Harris or any other nominee could get ahold of that money. Politico reported that the $95 million war chest would automatically transfer to Harris to use, since she was already on a ticket with Biden and the Biden campaign transferred the FEC filing into her name.\n\nBut our own Sarah Isgur is not so sure. \"This was a primary. Joe Biden was running the primary,\" Sarah explained on Dispatch Live (🔒) Sunday night. \"Joe Biden dropped out of the primary-same as lots of people do in every primary. You don't just get to give all of your money to your favorite candidate who's still in the primary. ... [Harris is] not officially on anything.\" The Biden PAC could , Sarah suggested, transfer the money to the Democratic National Committee for it to spend on her behalf.\n\nEndorsements and fundraising aside, in order to formally become her party's nominee at the convention in Chicago set for August 19-21, Harris would have to secure the votes of the more than 4,000 Democratic delegates-many of whom, unlike the Republican Party's delegates, are professional political operatives vetted for loyalty to the president. Harris and her team are reportedly already making calls to shore up their support, and with Biden's endorsement, it seems likely that she will be able to secure the requisite number to become the nominee.\n\nThe opponent switcheroo is a development the Trump campaign has been preparing for, egging on, and dreading, all at once. \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation,\" Trump posted on social media shortly after the announcement, gloating over Biden's decision to drop out. \"He was not fit to serve from the very beginning, but the people around him lied to America about his Complete and Total Mental, Physical, and Cognitive Demise.\"\n\nBut in a perhaps more revealing post just a few hours later, the reality of facing another opponent seemed to have hit the former president. \"So, we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race,\" he wrote . \"Now we have to start all over again. Shouldn't the Republican Party be reimbursed for fraud?\"\n\nIndeed, Tim Alberta, who interviewed Trump campaign co-chairs Chirs LaCivita and Susie Wiles, wrote for The Atlantic last week that the campaign wasn't prepared for another opponent. \"If Wiles and LaCivita were too successful-if too many Democrats decided, too quickly, that Biden was no longer capable of defeating Trump, much less serving another four years thereafter-then they risked losing an ideal opponent against whom their every tactical maneuver had already been deliberated, poll-tested, and prepared,\" he reported. \"Campaigns are usually on guard against peaking too soon; in this case, the risk for Trump's team was Biden bottoming out too early.\"\n\nThe Republican narrative in the aftermath of Biden's decision seemed to coalesce around the idea that Biden should resign the presidency if he's too impaired to run for reelection-and that Harris was complicit in covering up Biden's mental state. The main super PAC for Trump on Sunday launched ads in key battleground states to that effect, saying Harris was \"in on it\" and had worked to cover up \"Joe Biden's obvious mental decline.\"\n\nAt this point, what this all means for the general election is anyone's guess. But back in January, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley predicted that \"the first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the one who wins this election.\"\n\nDemocrats are surely hoping that she was right.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, in a tweet referencing Kamala Harris' viral \"coconut tree\" saying: \"Madam Vice President, we are ready to help.\"\n\nAssociated Press : South Korea Restarts Blaring Propaganda Broadcasts to Retaliate Against North's Trash Balloon Flying\n\nCalifornia rock band Dawes released the first single off its new album- Oh Brother , out in October-last week. While Declan may take issue with the implication in one lyric in \"House Parties\" that there's ever a \"wrong time of year\" to go to Chicago, we think it's a fun, light-hearted \"yacht rock\"-esque tune to get us through these, well, trying times. And for the record, it's right about Chicago.\n\nDo you think Kamala Harris will ultimately be the Democratic nominee?

      "text": "Details Remain Scant on Joe Biden's Supreme Court Overhaul\n\nThe White House and Kamala Harris want Supreme Court term limits but won't answer key questions about their proposal.\n\nOn Monday, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris called for dramatically restructuring the U.S. Supreme Court but provided almost no details about how they would implement the proposal. Several senators told The Dispatch this week that they were not sure exactly what the president and vice president had in mind.\n\n\"I support a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the Supreme Court,\" Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. \"President Biden and I are calling on Congress to pass important reforms-from imposing term limits for Justices' active service, to requiring Justices to comply with binding ethics rules just like every other federal judge,\" Harris said in a statement .\n\nMost scholars have argued that term limits may only be imposed on Supreme Court justices via constitutional amendment because the Constitution states that all justices and federal judges \"shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour\"-meaning that Supreme Court justices must serve until death or resignation if they aren't removed by the impeachment process. Spokesmen for the Biden White House and the Harris presidential campaign, however, did not respond to requests for comment from The Dispatch about whether they are proposing Supreme Court term-limits via amendment or statute.\n\nTheir statements implicitly suggest they're open to the latter. Biden in his op-ed explicitly called for a constitutional amendment to address the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity, but included no such caveat on his term-limit proposal. Harris' statement similarly treats the immunity question as separate from her call for \"Congress to pass important reforms\" on term-limits and ethics and recusal legislation.\n\nAnd how would their proposal of 18-year-term limits affect sitting Supreme Court justices? Biden's op-ed, Harris's statement, and a White House fact sheet do not say, and Biden and Harris spokesman again did not respond to requests for comment from The Dispatch .\n\nThree sitting justices-Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito-already have 18 years of service or more under their belts, but the term-limit bill that already has the backing of eight Senate Democrats and a panoply of progressive groups wouldn't immediately deem those justices retired. The \"Supreme Court Biennial Appointments and Term Limits Act\" was introduced in 2023 by Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts, and three other Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee. It would allow presidents to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a new Supreme Court justice in the first and third years of a presidential term. Only the nine most recently appointed justices would be allowed to vote in almost all important cases-those under appellate jurisdiction -while all justices would vote in the few cases where the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction . In other words, if the bill were enacted tomorrow, the winner of the presidential election would be able to effectively replace Justice Clarence Thomas in 2025 and Chief Justice John Roberts in 2027.\n\nThe bill as written would take effect after an intervening presidential election, so a President Harris and Democratic Senate wouldn't immediately get to replace justices if the bill were enacted in 2025. But there's no guarantee from the Harris campaign or Senate Democrats to keep that provision.\n\n\"A lot of these details for me are open to negotiation,\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, an original sponsor of the bill, told The Dispatch on Tuesday. \"We're trying to make this a bipartisan bill. Right now, it's not.\"\n\n\"We were actually excited to see them draw from the work that me, [California Sen. Alex] Padilla, Whitehouse, and [Connecticut Sen. Richard] Blumenthal have done,\" Booker said. While the White House kept Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin and top House Judiciary Committee Democrats in the dark about its proposal, Whitehouse told the Washington Examiner last week that he was \"in touch\" with the Biden White House.\n\nThe legislation has no chance of passing Congress with a Republican House, and the term-limit proposal would need to overcome some skepticism even in a unified Democratic Congress. \"I think it has to be a constitutional change. The Constitution says they should serve [during] 'good behaviour,'\" Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, told The Dispatch . Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, meanwhile, was more circumspect. \"My superficial response is that term limits would require a constitutional amendment, but I don't know that,\" he told The Dispatch . \"And as a lawyer, one of the things I've learned is don't answer if you don't really know, so please mark me down as looking into it.\" Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada all said they were undecided. \"We're going to look at all of them,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said of Biden's proposals in an interview with Politico on Wednesday. \"We're going to look at all the various proposals.\"\n\nAdvocates of the bill contend it is constitutional because the Constitution states that \"the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\"\n\n\"We don't need a constitutional amendment for that because we can by law set the various criteria for the Supreme Court,\" Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono, an original cosponsor of the term-limit bill, told The Dispatch .\n\nIn December 2021, the Biden-convened Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court noted in its final report (see pages 137 and 138 ) that critics of an \"original/appellate jurisdiction\" term-limit proposal contend that \"Congress's statutes must comport with the Good Behavior Clause and the Appointments Clause\" and that \"everyone who holds the office of 'Judge of the supreme Court' must be able to participate in substantially all of the Court's final decisions.\" The report notes that critics argue that the regulations clause \"allows Congress to decide what appeals the Court can hear, but not who hears the appeals.\" While the Constitution states that \"[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court,\" critics contend the appellate/original jurisdiction scheme effectively creates two Supreme Courts. Furthermore, as legal scholar Adam White, a member of the commission, wrote at The Dispatch earlier this week, if Congress has the power to strip senior justices of their ability to decide important cases, Congress could play a number of games to strip disfavored justices of their power.\n\nSupreme Court term-limit legislation has already drawn fire from moderate GOP senators. Amid news reports last week that Biden was set to release various \"reforms\" of the Supreme Court, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney told the Washington Examiner : \"It's a separate branch. Keep the nose of Congress and the administration out of it.\"\n\n\"Term limits politicize the court and compromise its independence,\" Maine Sen. Susan Collins told The Dispatch on Tuesday. \"It treats judges as if they were members of the Senate or some other legislative body. That's not their job.\"\n\nJohn McCormack is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Joe Biden's Bad 'Vibes'\n\nVoters aren't in the mood for the president's policy-focused campaign.\n\nA batch of new polls from the New York Times , Siena College, and the Philadelphia Inquirer has very bad news for President Biden: He's losing. Among registered voters, he's significantly behind in five of the six battleground states that are most likely to decide the election. He does slightly better among likely voters but remains behind in five key states.\n\nIt's a snapshot, but it's consistent with the overall trend of this campaign-which is, again, he's losing .\n\nBiden and many of his supporters seem to think the solution is to get right with the issues-the economy, the Israel-Hamas war, student loans, pot legalization, the threat to democracy and so on. If he can just find the sweet spot on policy, they believe, voters will come home.\n\nThat might be true to some extent. But I think focusing on the issues misses Biden's real weakness: vibes.\n\n\"Vibes\" is just the trendy word for \"mood\" or \"feelings.\" Whatever you call them, the relationship between attitudes and issues is not always as rational as some think.\n\nPeople who care passionately about issues think issues are really important. On one level, this is a fairly ridiculous tautology. But what I mean is that people who are really engaged in politics-activists, journalists, donors-believe issues drive everyone else's engagement with politics.\n\nPoliticians take popular positions on issues based on the understandable assumption that they will be popular as a result. Obviously, it often works this way. But sometimes the causality goes in the other direction. Some people start as rabid partisans or superfans of a politician, and that drives their views of the issues.\n\nIn 2012, for instance, when Barack Obama endorsed gay marriage, millions of Democrats suddenly switched from opposition to support. In 2017, when Donald Trump made protectionism a centerpiece of his agenda, many Republicans changed their positions. (They also changed their position on \"character,\" but that's another story.) I suspect that at least some of Biden's low approval ratings on many issues have less to do with people's policy preferences than with their starting assumption that he's wrong.\n\nThe Biden campaign wants to leverage the issue of abortion. That's smart. After the overturning of Roe v. Wade , abortion really is an issue that can overpower vibes. But consider that a constitutional referendum to legalize abortion has 61 percent support in Florida, while Biden is polling around 37 percent in the state. When abortion rights outpoll a Democratic candidate nearly 2-to-1, vibes are an issue.\n\nThe best analogy is to 1992. While some partisans and ideologues convinced themselves that they hated George H.W. Bush, the truth is most people were just exhausted with him, Republicans, or the status quo.\n\nThe Bush economy wasn't great, but the relatively mild recession of 1990-91 was far from the depression portrayed by many in the media , the Democratic Party, and the electorate. But Bush, who hated campaigning, often helped his detractors paint him as \" out of touch .\" It's difficult to describe the reaction to the moment the president looked at his watch during a debate question about the recession, allegedly signifying his aloofness, or seemed impressed by a new supermarket checkout scanner , supposedly revealing that he didn't understand how normal people live. In any case, many voters agreed with the worst interpretations.\n\nThe mainstream media isn't remotely as hostile to Biden, but that's not the advantage it seems to be. In a populist age, elite media support feels like establishment wagon-circling, not just to the Trump-friendly but also to disillusioned young and progressive voters. Even when the press thinks it's helping Biden, it perpetuates the out-of-touch vibe. For starters, the whole Biden-likes-ice-cream thing is played out.\n\nMore to the point, voters resent the idea, pushed by many pundits , that they should wake up to the fact that the economy is actually doing much better than they think. Biden is exacerbating the problem by constantly boasting about the economy rather than emulating the elder President Bush's successful opponent and emphasizing his empathy for what people are experiencing.\n\nThe economy really is better than vibes suggest, although inflation and high interest rates tend to overwhelm all other indicators. The other problem is that, as political scientist Seth Masket notes , \"Presidential approval is largely untethered from economic growth these days.\" That's vibes.\n\nObviously, it would help if Biden could fix inflation and interest rates. But he can't. Moreover, his vibe problem extends beyond the economy.\n\nHis desperation to fix his problems with poll-driven policy and rhetoric underscores the sense that he's flailing and can't keep up with the demands of the job. This both fuels and is fueled by his age problem. Biden seems exhausted, and people are exhausted with him.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

The Epoch Times contacted a representative for the younger Biden for comment Sunday.\n\n\"We are honored to join the President in endorsing Vice President Harris and will do whatever we can to support her,\" the Clintons wrote, adding, \"Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we've got to elect her. America's future depends on it.\"\n\nFormer President Trump also reacted to the announcement that his rival was dropping out of the race. He encouraged voters cast their ballots for him in November to \"remedy the damage\" that was done, while criticizing the president's record.\n\nAt the same time, several top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), suggested that President Biden step down from office immediately.\n\nSunday's announcement marks yet another seismic shift in the 2024 presidential race, coming just over a week after former President Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. The former president, during the Republican National Convention, accepted his party's nomination on July 18.\n\nPresident Biden made his announcement about a month before the start of the Democratic National Convention, which will be held between Aug. 19 and Aug. 22 in Chicago. During that event, Democratic Party delegates will officially nominate a candidate to run in November.\n\nIn his announcement, President Biden said that \"it has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nHis statement added that he will address the nation later this week about his decision."

Others did not mention Ms. Harris, suggesting support for an open nomination process.\n\n\"Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called President Biden \"one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history.\"\n\n\"America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity,\" Mr. Jeffries said. \"We are forever grateful.\"\n\nA number of Democrats have thrown their support behind Ms. Harris.

There has been speculation about both governors as possible replacements for President Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nRepublicans were critical both of the decision and the administration more broadly.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) portrayed it as a matter of party elites' trying to override the will of the people in the Democratic primaries.\n\nHe also called on President Biden to resign, saying his decision to drop out indicated that he is not fit to serve as president."

      "text": "Biden Determined to Stay in 2024 Race, Urges Democrats to Move Forward\n\nWASHINGTON-Democrat lawmakers, returning from their Fourth of July holiday recess, were met with a forceful letter from President Joe Biden on July 8 that unequivocally stated that he has no intention of stepping aside and is \"running this race to the end.\"\n\nThat same morning, the president called in to MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" to double down on his stance.\n\n\"I am not going anywhere,\" President Biden said.\n\nThe president's comments were made after highly publicized efforts by a handful of lawmakers and media pundits to push him out of the presidential race following his June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I wouldn't be running if I didn't absolutely believe that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024,\" he said during the MSNBC interview.\n\n\"I don't care about what those big names think.\"\n\nThe president was referring to media organizations and pundits who have recently called on him to quit the race.\n\nPresident Biden criticized the media for underestimating his performance.\n\n\"They were wrong in 2020,\" President Biden said. \"They were wrong in 2022 about the red wave.\"\n\nHe asked the media pundits to follow him closely and watch how voters respond to him on the campaign trail and form an opinion afterward.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, who has voiced continued support for President Biden, criticized recent calls from the media and lawmakers for the president to step aside as \"undemocratic.\"\n\n\"The American people have spoken. He's the nominee. And so any will to try to take that away from him is actually disrespecting the democratic process,\" he told The Epoch Times.\n\nSince the first debate, President Biden has been actively rallying support. As part of this effort, the president participated in a call with the Biden Victory Fund National Finance Committee on July 8, along with Mr. Moore, according to the Biden campaign.\n\nThe call was about focusing on the future and hearing the president's vision, Mr. Moore said.\n\n\"I think that the people on the call appreciated his honesty about the fact that he did not have a good night,\" he said, referring to the president's debate performance on June 27.\n\nDavid Carlucci, a Democrat strategist and former New York state senator, agreed with the president's appeal for unity, noting that \"the only direction for Democrats is forward.\"\n\nHe warned that starting from scratch with a new candidate would harm the party's momentum, particularly in crucial battleground states.\n\n\"Some media sources love to spin this as a doomsday scenario with the entire party turning on the president,\" Mr. Carlucci told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"Yes, a few lawmakers have voiced their concerns, but these aren't influential voices like House Minority Leader Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Schumer, or former Speaker Pelosi.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters at a press conference on July 9, \"As I've said before, I'm with Joe.\"\n\n\"I am getting so frustrated by the elites ... in the party,\" President Biden said during his interview with MSNBC, saying that they think \"they know so much more.\"\n\nHe invited them to \"challenge me at the convention\" in August in Chicago if they wish to remove him from the presidential race.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, who was cited as being among the lawmakers who called on the president to end his candidacy, told reporters on July 9 that his concerns about the president are \"beside the point.\"\n\n\"He's going to be our nominee, and we all have to support him,\" he said before a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe president also targeted donors during the interview.\n\n\"I don't care what the millionaires think,\" he said.\n\nSeveral Democratic Party megadonors have supported efforts calling for President Biden to drop his reelection bid. These donors included Abigail Disney, an heir to entertainment titan Disney; Ari Emanuel, a prominent Hollywood talent agent; and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix.\n\nOthers continue to back his reelection campaign, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, real estate heiress Amy Goldman Fowler, billionaire Mark Cuban, and Alex Soros, son of billionaire George Soros.\n\n\"We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\" the president wrote in the letter, which was distributed by his campaign.\n\nPolitical strategist Christopher Bruce agrees, saying President Biden has made a compelling case for why he is the best candidate to win the 2024 election.\n\n\"His letter states the process for the primary; he's won the votes, and he deserves to be the presumptive nominee going forward,\" Mr. Bruce told The Epoch Times. \"He is like most Americans, in my opinion, who are ready to move on from this chapter.\"\n\nDemocrat strategist Christy Setzer described the situation as \"tricky.\"\n\n\"There are good arguments for President Biden to stay the course and for him to step aside in favor of VP Harris,\" Ms. Setzer told The Epoch Times in an email.\n\n\"One dynamic in his favor, though: Voters don't like it when they sense a pile-on effect; often, they rally around the [piled-upon] candidate when that happens.\n\n\"They may very well have thought Biden's debate performance was bad, but after 10 days of brutal media coverage, there's a sense of 'that's enough.'\"\n\nIn response to media queries, President Biden's physician, Kevin O'Connor, issued a detailed letter on July 8, explaining the reasons for Dr. Kevin Cannard's frequent visits to the White House over the past year. Dr. Cannard is a neurologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\n\"As I have written in each of the President's medical reports, as part of the President's annual physical, he sees a team of specialists that have included Optometry, Dentistry, Orthopedics (Foot and Ankle), Orthopedics (Spine), Physical Therapy, Neurology, Sleep Medicine, Cardiology, Radiology, and Dermatology,\" Dr. O'Connor wrote.\n\n\"Dr. Cannard was the neurological specialist that examined President Biden for each of his annual physicals. His findings have been made public each time I have released the results of the President's annual physical.\"\n\nHe referred to his most recent exam outlined in his February letter, confirming that the president has no symptoms of a neurological disorder, including Parkinson's."

      "text": "Could Ticket Splitters Hurt Biden in 2024?\n\nPresident Joe Biden is struggling to win over key Democratic voting blocs in battleground states, according to recent polls. Yet, it's becoming increasingly evident that this challenge is largely unique to the incumbent president himself, rather than indicative of a broader issue within the Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by the New York Times and Siena College, the president trailed former President Donald Trump among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup in five out of six key swing states: Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. Wisconsin was the only state where the president had the advantage.\n\nAmong likely voters, which are considered a more accurate reflection, the race was tighter, with President Trump holding his advantage in five states and President Biden edging ahead in Michigan.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate races are showing a very different picture.\n\nIn four battleground states, Democratic Senate candidates outperformed President Biden, according to the New York Times/Siena College survey.\n\nHowever, that trend has become a lot less common in recent years.\n\nIn 2020, nearly 90 percent of candidate Biden and President Trump voters also opted for a congressional candidate from the same party. However, in the 1970s and '80s, that ratio was roughly 70 percent, according to the American National Election Studies.\n\n\"Split ticket voting at the Senate level is not as prevalent as it used to be,\" Ford O'Connell, a political analyst and Republican strategist, told The Epoch Times.\n\nMaine was the only state in 2020 where voters split their tickets, electing Democrat Mr. Biden for president and Republican Susan Collins for Senate.\n\nAside from Nevada and Arizona, President Biden is underperforming in Pennsylvania, where Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) leads by 5 points, and in Wisconsin, where Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) leads by 9 points, according to the New York Times/Siena College poll.\n\nEven in red states like Ohio and Montana, where President Trump enjoys overwhelming popularity, Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) lead their Republican opponents in polls.\n\nThis is the opposite of what happened in 2020 when congressional Republicans outperformed President Trump and President Biden outperformed congressional Democrats.\n\nMitchell Brown, pollster and director of political strategy at Cygnal, said the large gaps are driven by President Biden's historically low approval ratings.\n\nThis creates the possibility that President Trump could win several battleground states in 2024, while Democratic incumbent senators retain their seats in those races, Mr. Brown told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"When you look at Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, those are states where there's a very real possibility of Trump winning, and then no one down the ticket following suit,\" he said.\n\nDavid Carlucci, a Democratic strategist and former New York state senator, believes that there is still hope for President Biden to narrow these gaps in swing states.\n\n\"The silver lining for Biden is that these voters haven't fully abandoned the Democrats and might still be swayed back to his side,\" Mr. Carlucci told The Epoch Times.\n\nRecent polls indicate a decline in support for President Biden among younger, black, and Hispanic voters, a big concern for President Biden's re-election campaign. These groups of voters express dissatisfaction with his economic management and response to the Gaza crisis.\n\nRon Klink, a senior policy adviser and former Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, feels it's too early to predict November with polls that aren't very reliable, but he acknowledges that Americans are overall dissatisfied with President Biden's performance.\n\n\"I think part of it is that people forgot how bad it was and how sick we were, literally and figuratively, with COVID, and with the drama each and every day that we had during the Trump presidency,\" Mr. Klink told The Epoch Times.\n\nMr. O'Connell believes President Trump's strong lead in some swing states, as well as Ohio and Montana, poses a challenge to incumbent Senate Democrats. He believes the former president's increased support among young, black, and Hispanic voters could help Republican candidates in tight Senate elections.\n\n\"If Trump wins, say, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio by enough points, he can carry all three Republican Senate candidates across the line against very tough Democratic incumbents,\" he said.\n\nMr. Brown from Cygnal predicts that President Trump will contribute most to Senate elections by increasing voter turnout.\n\n\"How Trump helps is just the turnout game, because there's a group of Republicans or a group of voters who didn't turn out in 2022,\" he said.\n\nRecent surveys show that President Trump is more competitive in the Sun Belt swing states-Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona- than in the Midwest.\n\nAmong registered voters, President Trump leads President Biden by 12 points in Nevada, 10 points in Georgia, 7 points in Arizona and Michigan, and 3 points in Pennsylvania, according to the New York Times/Siena Poll.\n\n\"The Sun Belt is right now much more favorable territory for Trump than the Midwest,\" Mr. O'Connell said. \"In the Sun Belt states, you have more Hispanics, more independents, who basically say inflation is the biggest problem.\"\n\nMr. O'Connell says President Trump is performing considerably better in polls, in part because battleground states, particularly those in the Sun Belt, have a relatively high economic misery index.\n\nThe Bloomberg Economics Misery II index, which measures economic distress by adding cumulative inflation rates over four years to the most recent unemployment rate, is greater in the seven battleground states than elsewhere in the country. This partially explains President Biden's dismal poll numbers.\n\nAmericans consider the economy important, but it's not the sole factor influencing their decisions, Mr. Brown said.\n\nIn 2022, many expected the economy to be the decisive issue, but that wasn't the case for Democrats, he noted, where abortion played a crucial role in their success.\n\n\"Relying on the economy alone is not enough for Republicans to win,\" he said."

      "text": "Biden Open-Door Policy: Some Facts and Historical Context\n\nWhat has been missing these past couple of months from the coverage of and debate over the failed immigration bill? Some important basic facts and lots of historical context.\n\nFirst, basic facts. Coverage in left-leaning newspapers and even in the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page has suggested that without new legislation, the Biden administration would lack the legal authorization to reduce the record number of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border and remaining in the United States.\n\nThe record is not in doubt. Customs and Border Protection has reported 302,000 immigrant encounters in December 2023, the highest in history. Similarly, the total for the first three months of the fiscal year-October, November, and December 2023-was 785,000 encounters, again a historical high. There's no escaping the fact that illegal border crossings have been at record levels during the Biden administration.\n\nAnd there's no escaping-though in journalism, there has been plenty of evading-the fact that this surge of illegal immigration is the direct and predictable result of changes in regulation and administrative practice by the Biden administration.\n\nFor example, the president long boasted of signing on his first day in office an executive order repealing former President Donald Trump's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy. That policy was the product of President Trump's pressure on Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in response to a significantly smaller border surge.\n\nPresident Joe Biden should be able to undo by executive order the policies that he put in place by executive order. Any order issued on Day 1 of an administration should be revokable just as rapidly by the same administration.\n\nEvidently, some Biden advisers agree. According to the left-leaning Axios website, President Biden \"has considered ... an executive order that would dramatically stanch the record flow of migrants into the Southwest,\" to be issued before his March 7 scheduled State of the Union address.\n\nSo the claims that Republicans, by opposing the Senate measure that the Senate never passed, have prevented President Biden from effectively enforcing the border are incorrect. And the reason for Republicans' skepticism about whether President Biden would use enhanced border control authority is obviously justified by President Biden's refusal to use the authority that he currently has.\n\nPresident Biden has let in this record surge of illegal immigrants. He could cut it off.\n\nThis surge, by the way, includes relatively few Mexicans. Instead, many are from troubled Latin nations-Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador-and, as Fox News' Bill Melugin reports, from farther afield: China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Africa.\n\nThe fact is that when Donald Trump came down the escalator in June 2015 and said Mexico was \"not sending their best,\" the surge of low-skill immigration from Mexico, which lasted from 1982 until the mortgage security crisis in 2007, was already over. We were in the midst of a pause in mass immigration, something like the pause that occurred after the 1924 Immigration Act, which limited immigration beyond Western and Northern Europe.\n\nImmigration restrictionists say that earlier pause allowed or furthered assimilation of the huge 1892-1914 Ellis Island surge of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. The post-2007 pause seems to have facilitated the assimilation of legal Latin immigrants, as evidenced by, among other things, increased willingness to vote Republican, which I noted in a recent column.\n\nThat 1982-2007 immigration surge may have occurred in response to the labor market's low supply of low-skill workers because of reduced workforce participation by low-skill black and white Americans. The argument then made was that it was too much to expect urban ghetto residents to travel a dozen miles to new suburban workplaces. But Mexican immigrants proved willing to travel 1,200 miles and more for those jobs.\n\nThere's an echo here of the 75 years after the Civil War, when few black or white Southerners were willing to move to the higher-wage but culturally hostile North. Instead, the rapidly expanding number of jobs in garment sweatshops in Manhattan and steel mills along the Monongahela and Mahoning rivers were filled by Ellis Island immigrants from Eastern Europe and southern Italy.\n\nAre the million-plus illegal immigrants that the Biden administration has let into the country, with some told to report for court hearings in 2031, filling a gap not filled by American workers? Or, as seems more likely, is the United States getting a million-plus low-skill residents who will be stuck in illegal status indefinitely?\n\nThere's little evidence that the Biden administration ever pondered such questions in its haste to overturn the policies of the Evil Orange Man and slam the border wide open."

Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), campaign surrogate, told reporters at a news conference in Milwaukee.\n\nMs. Beatty said she is confident that Democrats will unite behind President Biden, referring to the calls for him to step down as \"family discussions\" among the Democratic coalition.\n\n\"I am very comfortable that we will be more unified because we understand that diversity is our strength and we are a party of diverse individuals, but we also recognize greater than that, that unity is our power,\" she said.\n\nOn July 17, media reports revealed that top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), had spoken separately with the president to raise concerns about the possibility of Democrats losing control of Congress in 2024 and advise him to reconsider his reelection bid.\n\nIn response to these reports, campaign surrogate Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said the party will eventually unite behind President Biden at the Democratic National Convention, which starts on Aug. 19.\n\n\"We will unite. Our convention is still a few weeks away, but it'll be here before you know it,\" he said. \"Then you're going to see the unity during the Democratic National Convention.\"\n\nThe senator was asked about reports suggesting that Mr. Schumer asked the president to drop out of the race during a private discussion on July 13.\n\nMr. Padilla said that as Democrats, \"of course, there's going to be a little diversity in what folks are thinking and feeling,\" but stressed a difference in strategy between Senate and presidential campaigns.\n\n\"Yes, our incumbents in some of the tougher states are facing tougher elections, but they're doing well,\" the senator said.\n\n\"And I do think there is a difference between the presidential campaign politics and strategy and state-by-state Senate campaign politics and strategy.\"\n\nT.J. Ducklo, senior adviser for communications for the Biden campaign, referred to the media reports as \"baseless conjecture from anonymous sources.\"\n\nAndrew Bates, the White House senior deputy press secretary, also responded to the reports about Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries.\n\n\"The President told both leaders he is the nominee of the party, he plans to win and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families,\" he said in a statement.\n\nOn July 18, Mr. Bates responded to another report, which stated that President Biden is under pressure to reconsider his reelection bid and could drop out of the race as early as this weekend.\n\nHe also shared a post stating that, on the contrary, the president is \"preparing to hit the campaign trail again next week.\"\n\nSpeculation has started to build since Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) issued a surprise statement on July 17, asking President Biden to pass the torch.\n\nMr. Schiff told the Los Angeles Times in a statement that he now has \"serious concerns\" about President Biden's chances of defeating former President Trump in November.\n\nHe said that although the decision to drop out of the race ultimately lies with the Democratic incumbent, he believes \"it is time for him to pass the torch.\"\n\nAmid growing concerns, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), in a July 17 social media post, urged Democrats to stop attacking President Biden.\n\n\"Fellow House Democrats, can we in this moment unify, show some decency, and simply wish @POTUS a speedy and full recovery?\" he wrote on X after the president tested positive for COVID.\n\n\"Please do not use this moment to advance your own political agenda by launching more private or public attacks on Biden.\""
