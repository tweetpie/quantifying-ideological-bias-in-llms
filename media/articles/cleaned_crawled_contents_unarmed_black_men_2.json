      "text": "The Phantom Waistband Maneuver: When Police Shoot Unarmed Black Men\n\nAt nearly midnight on Thanksgiving Day 1976, a group of curious black teenage boys ambled up to two white New York cops who'd been called to a Brooklyn housing project on a report of an armed prowler. One of the boys, Randolph Evans, 15, asked Officer Robert Torsney whether his building there at the Cyprus Houses in East New York would be searched.\n\nSuddenly and without provocation, Torsney unholstered his revolver and fired a shot from two feet away that hit Evans in the head, killing him. Amid screams and chaos, Torsney turned and calmly walked back to his patrol car, where he sat down and refilled the empty chamber in his pistol.\n\nLater that night, his precinct commander asked Torsney, 32, a six-year police veteran, to explain why he shot the kid.\n\n\"What difference does it make?\" Torsney replied. \"You're guilty anyway.\"\n\nBut after consulting a police union attorney, Torsney began to craft a narrative that led down a well-trodden path: He said Evans had reached toward the waistband of his trousers, as if he were going for a gun.\n\nThere was no gun.\n\nFor decades, the phantom firearm grab has served as a virtually unimpeachable excuse when cops shoot unarmed citizens, a companion to the \"furtive movement\" in the police-shooting playbook. How often has the waistband reach been cited? It's impossible to say. U.S. law enforcers don't even count their shootings, let alone tabulate circumstances.\n\nBut anecdotal evidence strongly indicates that most victims of phantom-reach shootings are black men or boys. And new research that builds on the venerable scientific concept of \"affective realism\" suggests an explanation that springs from a stereotype: Cops may \"see\" guns that don't exist because their experiences convince them that an African American male they perceive to be an adversary is likely to be armed.\n\nAs psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett and her associate Jolie Wormwood put it recently in a New York Times op-ed, \"If you are in a part of town with a high crime rate, your brain may well predict a weapon.\"\n\nGun Imagined in Ferguson\n\nIn a headline example, Officer Darren Wilson cited a waistband-reach to explain his shooting of the unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Wilson described the interaction to a grand jury, which declined to indict him:\n\n\"... I tell him to get on the ground! Get on the ground!' He turns, and when he looked at me, he made like a grunting, like aggravated sound, and he starts, he turns and he's coming back towards me. His first step is coming towards me. He kind of does like a stutter step to start running. When he does that, his left hand goes in a fist and goes to his side, his right one goes under his shirt in his waistband and he starts running at me.\"\n\nWilson fired 12 shots. He insisted he feared for his life. But some see his waistband explanation as another dubious example of cop-splaining.\n\n\"I've been hearing about these waistband incidents since my first months on the job,\" Timothy T. Williams Jr., a retired detective who spent 29 years with the Los Angeles Police Department and the past 12 as a private investigator and police use-of-force expert, told me. \"I'm skeptical. 'Reaching for the waistband' often is boilerplate language used to justify what an officer has done.\"\n\n\"It's a fallback explanation they give all the time,\" adds Kenneth Williams , a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. \"It's just hard to believe that this scenario occurs so frequently.\"\n\nBut it does, if you trust the police accounts that crop up with regularity. Most recently:\n\nQuestionable police shootings with waistband citations have occurred so regularly in the past five years that journalists have begun aggregating them . The growing list includes three waistband-reach police shootings in an 11-month period in San Diego in 2013-14, as well as disturbing recent cases in Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nAmong them, the San Jose case six weeks ago seems to stand out as a glaring gotcha moment in the long history of waistband cases.\n\nSamuel Walker, the veteran Nebraska-based criminologist and police accountability watchdog, told the San Jose Mercury News that it seemed clear that police had prematurely seized upon the \"easiest\" explanation-the waistband reach-in a questionable shooting.\n\nAfter police admitted to a fabricated explanation, Walker said, \"It makes everything else they say suspect.\"\n\n\"In communities of color, this is the concern, that the standard response is that 'he made a furtive movement and went for something in the waist,'\" LaDoris Cordell, the recently retired director of San Jose's Office of the Independent Police Auditor, told the paper. \"We've heard it a million times. Now we hear it again in this one. I can tell you, I'm getting emails from people in San Jose saying, 'How are we going to trust the police department?'\"\n\nThe Torsney Outcome\n\nCordell might reasonably expect that the phantom waistband reach would be invalidated as a police-shooting justification once and for all, now that the San Jose police lie had been exposed. (The official police version is that a \"mistake\" had been \"rectified.\")\n\nBut the vexing waistband storyline has endured even the controversial Torsney shooting in Brooklyn nearly 40 years ago.\n\nA prosecutor called that slaying \"totally unprovoked, unjustifiable and intentional.\" The loved ones of the slain teenager were encouraged when Torsney became just the fifth cop in NYPD history to face murder charges. (For his part, Torsney said his arrest was \"the biggest shock of my life ... Obviously, I didn't do anything wrong.\")\n\nAt the officer's trial in 1977, police union attorneys employed a hired-gun shrink whose imaginative psycho-babble explanations deflected attention from the brutality of the point-blank shooting by the cop.\n\nDr. Daniel Schwartz, chief of forensic psychiatry at Kings County Medical Center, testified that Torsney had been afflicted with \"organically caused amnesia\" and a rare form of epilepsy in which sufferers experience false sights and sensation.\n\nArchival newspaper clippings also reveal that Schwartz said the officer \"had acted automatically\" based upon \"false memory\" when he believed that the teen was reaching for a gun.\n\n\"The weapon was only a delusion,\" Schwartz said. \"But that's not nothing. That's pretty important.\"\n\nSchwartz quoted Torsney concerning the stress he felt working in the East New York ghetto: \"I can't say that I like black people, but I don't let that affect me. There is lots of violence down there ... My life is in danger.\"\n\nOn Nov. 30, 1977, an all-white jury found Torsney not guilty by reason of insanity. A cousin of the victim told reporters, \"It's a racist system and society, and this trial was a subterfuge from beginning to end.\"\n\nTorsney was briefly confined to a state hospital. Declared cured, he tried but failed to get his police job back.\n\nIf the NYPD drew lessons from the Torsney case, they have not been apparent. The waistband reach has been cited regularly in New York police shootings since 1977.\n\nNotably, a man \"reaching for something in his waistband \" was used as justification on Nov. 25, 2006, when five police officers fired 51 shots into a car parked outside a Queens nightclub, killing Sean Bell and wounding two others.\n\nThere was no gun in the car. Three of the officers faced criminal charges; they were acquitted, including one who reloaded and fired a total of 31 shots. The three lost their jobs, and the city paid $7 million in damages to the victims and Bell's survivors.\n\nThe Reality of Racism\n\nTimothy Williams, the ex-LAPD detective, said officers are rarely held criminally responsible in phantom waistband-reach shootings because an entrenched internal affairs investigatory structure in law enforcement gives officers the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"Just because the cop says it's so doesn't make it so,\" Williams told me. \"It's just like a witness who says he watched this person or that person rob a bank. Well, as a detective it's your job to corroborate that statement. You're not simply going to take that witness's word for it without doing an investigation. Yet that is what I see in many cases of police investigating themselves. I often find that internal affairs investigators do not-I underscore do not-have the investigative background to do a thorough, scientific job of analyzing these cases.\"\n\nKenneth Williams, the Houston law professor, sees a \"major flaw\" in a template provision in police contracts that allows officers as many as 10 days of \"recovery time\" before they are required to make a statement after a shooting incident.\n\n\"This makes no sense,\" Williams told me. \"Research tells us that the most reliable statements from crime witnesses are those made immediately after an incident happens, when the details are fresh and before they have an opportunity to hear what other people have to say. ... It's not three days later or five days later, after you've had the opportunity to think about it, ponder it and tailor your statement to the evidence.\"\n\nHe said the ongoing expansion of police body cameras may help identify and ultimately diminish false reports of waistband reaches. He said contract reforms to allow timely debriefing of officers after violent episodes could help legitimize the investigatory process.\n\nBut the \"affective realism\" that apparently prompts cops to predetermine that black men and boys are threats may be a more intractable problem.\n\n\"There is a different type of policing going on in the white community versus the minority community, and if anyone tells you there isn't, they're lying,\" said Timothy Williams, who, like Williams, is African American. \"And certainly there may be a stereotype that the officer has that a black individual must have a gun-must be a dangerous person.\"\n\nKenneth Williams added, \"I think it tells us that racism is deeply ingrained and that we have a lot of subconscious racism that we really as a society haven't dealt with very well. For a cop to just assume, based on a stereotype, that someone is armed because of their race speaks to a very deep problem in our society-and not just for the cops.\""

      "text": "The True History of the Origins of Police: Protecting and Serving the Masters of Society\n\nIn most of the liberal discussions of the recent police killings of unarmed black men, there is an underlying assumption that the police are supposed to protect and serve the population. That is, after all, what they were created to do. Maybe there are a few bad apples, but if only the police weren't so racist, or didn't carry out policies like stop-and-frisk, or weren't so afraid of black people, or shot fewer unarmed men, they could function as a useful service that we all need.\n\nThis liberal way of viewing the problem rests on a misunderstanding of the origins of the police and what they were created to do. The police were not created to protect and serve the population. They were not created to stop crime, at least not as most people understand it. And they were certainly not created to promote justice. They were created to protect the new form of wage-labor capitalism that emerged in the mid- to late-19th century from the threat posed by that system's offspring, the working class.\n\nBefore the 19th century, there were no police forces that we would recognize as such anywhere in the world. In the northern United States, there was a system of elected constables and sheriffs, much more responsible to the population in a very direct way than the police are today. In the South, the closest thing to a police force was the slave patrols. Then, as Northern cities grew and filled with mostly immigrant wage workers who were physically and socially separated from the ruling class, the wealthy elite who ran the various municipal governments hired hundreds and then thousands of armed men to impose order on the new working-class neighborhoods.\n\nClass conflict roiled late-19th century American cities like Chicago, which experienced major strikes and riots in 1867, 1877, 1886 and 1894. In each of these upheavals, the police attacked strikers with extreme violence. In the aftermath of these movements, the police increasingly presented themselves as a thin blue line protecting civilization, by which they meant bourgeois civilization, from the disorder of the working class. This ideology has been reproduced ever since - except that today, poor black and Latino people rather than immigrant workers are the main threat.\n\nOf course, the ruling class did not get everything it wanted. It had to yield on many points to the immigrant workers it sought to control - this is why, for instance, municipal governments backed away from trying to stop Sunday drinking and why they hired so many immigrant police officers, especially the Irish. But despite these concessions, businessmen organized themselves to make sure the police were increasingly isolated from democratic control. The police, meanwhile, increasingly set themselves off from the population by donning uniforms; establishing their own rules for hiring, promotion and firing; working to build a unique esprit de corps; and identifying themselves with order. And despite complaints about corruption and inefficiency, they gained more and more support from the ruling class, to the extent that in Chicago, for instance, businessmen donated money to buy the police rifles, artillery, Gatling guns and buildings and to establish a police pension out of their own pockets.\n\nThere was a never a time when the big city police neutrally enforced \"the law\" - nor, for that matter, a time when the law itself was neutral. Throughout the 19th century in the North, the police mostly arrested people for the vaguely defined \"crimes\" of disorderly conduct and vagrancy, which meant that they could target anyone they saw as a threat to \"order.\" In the post-bellum South, they enforced white supremacy and largely arrested black people on trumped-up charges in order to feed them into convict labor systems.\n\nThe violence the police carried out and their moral separation from those they patrolled were not the consequences of the brutality of individual officers, but of policies carefully designed to mold the police into a force that could use violence to deal with the social problems that accompanied the development of a wage-labor economy. For instance, in the short, sharp depression of the mid-1880s, Chicago was filled with prostitutes who worked the streets. Many policemen recognized that these prostitutes were generally impoverished women seeking a way to survive and initially tolerated their behavior. But the police hierarchy insisted that the patrolmen arrest these women, impose fines and drive them off the streets and into brothels, where they could be ignored by some members of the elite and controlled by others. Similarly, in 1885, when Chicago began to experience a wave of strikes, some policemen sympathized with strikers. But once the police hierarchy and the mayor decided to break the strikes, policemen who refused to comply were fired.\n\nThough some patrolmen tried to be kind and others were openly brutal, police violence in the 1880s was not a case of a few bad apples - and neither is it today.\n\nMuch has changed since the creation of the police - most importantly, the influx of black people into Northern cities, the mid-20th century civil rights movement and the creation of the current system of mass incarceration in part as a response to that movement. But these changes did not lead to a fundamental shift in policing. They led to new policies designed to preserve fundamental continuities. The police were created to use violence to reconcile electoral democracy with industrial capitalism. Today, they are just one part of the \"criminal justice\" system that plays the same role. Their basic job is to enforce order among those with the most reason to resent the system - in our society today, disproportionately among poor black people.\n\nIf there is one positive lesson from the history of policing's origins, it is that when workers organized, refused to submit or cooperate and caused problems for the city governments, they could force the police to curb the most galling of their activities. The murders of individual police officers, as happened in Chicago on May 3, 1886, and more recently in New York on December 20, 2014, only reinforced calls for harsh repression. But resistance on a mass scale could force the police to hesitate. This happened in Chicago during the early 1880s, when the police pulled back from breaking strikes, hired immigrant officers and tried to re-establish some credibility among the working class after their role in brutally crushing the 1877 upheaval.\n\nThe police might back off again if the widespread reaction against the killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and countless others continues. If they do, it will be a victory for those mobilizing today, and will save lives. But as long as this policing system endures, any change in policy will be aimed at keeping the poor in line more effectively.\n\nA democratic police system in which police are elected by and accountable to the people they patrol is imaginable. But as long as we have an economic and political system that rests on the exploitation of workers and pushes millions of people into poverty, we are unlikely to see policing become any more democratic than the rest of society.\n\nThis article was adapted from an earlier version published on the Labor and Working-Class History Association blog."

      "text": "A Tale of Two Unarmed Black Men Shot in Kentucky\n\nThis week, a Kentucky grand jury declined to indict a police officer in the shooting of an unarmed black man; elsewhere in Kentucky an officer is fired for the same charge; and an Australian government pamphlet \"tells the truth\" about marijuana and schizophrenia. April 15- The Lexington (KY) Herald-Leader reports: Although it expressed sympathy to the victim's family, a Letcher County grand jury yesterday declined to indict a Kentucky State Police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man during a January drug deal in Jenkins. James E. Alexander, 62, of Roanoke, Va., was shot twice with an automatic rifle Jan. 14 by state police Sgt. Bobby Day during a drug investigation using undercover officers at a Jenkins house. There were reports afterward that Alexander was shot when he reached under his jacket for a cell phone, said Sgt. Phil Crumpton, a state police spokesman in Frankfort. \"You're looking at a high-stress situation when someone is given a specific order and he makes an aggressive move that we feel is a threat to us,\" Crumpton said. \"That's what these things narrow down to.\" Alexander's family members and friends appeared upset yesterday. \"If they didn't find any drugs on him or guns on him, how can they do that?\" asked Alexander's uncle, James L. Alexander, 78, of Lebanon, Va. The Virginia Department of Corrections had no record of Alexander being imprisoned. But his uncle said Alexander served several years in federal prison on a drug charge about 15 years ago. Beverly Hunt, 38, of Roanoke, was outraged. \"Even if he was a drug dealer, how can they justify shooting James twice when he wasn't armed?\" she asked, sobbing. \"I was with James for two and a half years. He never carried a gun. \"They're just covering up. They've done it again. They've done it again. I've talked to the police and the way they were talking, I could tell they were thinking: We just got another black man off the street.\" April 16- The Lexington (KY) Herald-Leader reports: A Louisville police officer who fatally shot a black man in the back was fired yesterday after the department ruled he violated policy on using deadly force. \"Your conduct is alarming and has damaged the bond which we have established with our community,\" Chief Robert White wrote in a termination letter to McKenzie Mattingly. Mattingly has pleaded not guilty to murder in the Jan. 3 death of Michael Newby, 19, who was shot three times in the back. Mattingly is free on bond and has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. \"Specifically, I felt that Michael Newby was not an immediate threat to the officer's life or his physical well being,\" White said at a news conference. \"Nor was any other person in the area clearly in immediate danger because of Newby's actions.\" Mattingly, 31, was indicted March 5 on charges of murder and wanton endangerment. Civil rights activists and many black residents held protests and called on White to fire Mattingly, who is white. Newby was the seventh black man to be fatally shot by Louisville police in the past five years. In the previous shootings, no officers were charged criminally or fired. Police said the shooting occurred during an attempted under-cover drug buy. Mattingly told investigators he was robbed during the drug transaction. He tried to arrest Newby but the two became involved in a struggle, according to court records filed by prosecutors after Mattingly was indicted. April 16- The Age (Australia) reports: The Howard Government's drug taskforce is launching a new offensive against marijuana, with a booklet that the taskforce's head says will \"tell the truth\" and combat the \"trivialization\" of the drug's dangers. Australian National Council on Drugs chairman Brian Watters yesterday said a \"pro-marijuana lobby\" had successfully promoted the idea that cannabis was no more dangerous than alcohol and should be legalized. \"I think there has been a really concerted effort in some quarters to trivialize its effects,\" he said. \"The pro-marijuana lobby have done very well. They are very, very active.\" Major Watters, a Salvation Army officer with extensive experience in drug management, said he was \"very opposed\" to marijuana, because he had seen the damage it did. Marijuana has been linked with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, but opinion differs on whether it causes psychosis or simply triggers latent mental illness. Major Watters dismissed the distinction. \"I've always said, 'Who cares?' If my son suddenly develops schizophrenia, I don't care whether the marijuana caused it or triggered it,\" he said. \"The result is he has a great deal of turmoil in his mind.\""

      "text": "America's Decay Into a Violent, Cruel Place\n\nIt seems police can get away with anything: choking men who have surrendered; shooting unarmed teens; knocking pregnant women to the ground. While the issues involving race, civil rights and the relationship between law enforcement and communities are essential for examination and correction, few are talking about how all of this fits into the larger pattern of America's cultural decline and decay. America has become a society addicted to violence and indifferent to the suffering of people without power. Whenever there is a combination of a culture of violence and an ethic of heartlessness, fatal abuse of authority will escalate, and the legal system will fail to address it.\n\nCritics are right to condemn the criminal justice system for its embedded inequities and injustices, but they are hesitant to condemn the actual jurors giving killer cops get-out-of-jail-free cards. These jurors are representational of America: ignorant and cold. They hear testimony from eyewitnesses claiming Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown while he had his hands in the air, and set Wilson free without trial. They listen to reports of three officers choking Robert Saylor, an unarmed man with Down syndrome who wanted to see a movie without a ticket, and they send the police back to work. They watch video footage of police choking Eric Garner in New York, and of two police officers brutally beating Keyarika Diggles, a woman in Texas, and they decline to make them pay for it.\n\nHave they been programmed into cruelty and apathy by American schools, churches, families, politics, and pop culture?\n\nThere are practical demands that the sane minority of Americans can make as they march the streets of Ferguson, New York and Chicago. Body cameras on police officers is a technological aid to the people who live under military occupation from the blue army. Tougher requirements for entering the police force, and better training methods for those in the academy are essential, as is a sweeping and radical review, best led by the White House, of a racist and predatory criminal justice system.\n\nJesse Jackson has offered the excellent proposal that the Department of Justice begin investigating police departments to determine if they are following civil rights laws on hiring, employment issues and law enforcement policy. If they are not, as it appears with Ferguson, they should no longer receive any federal funding. Jackson's idea to \"fight civil rights violations with civil rights law\" is a brilliant plan to punish police departments that obstruct justice, prevent further abuses by exerting financial pressure for compliance and strike a blow against the militarization of police. No more armored vehicles or special forces gear for police departments that do not hire minorities, or that systemically target Latinos and African Americans for arrest.\n\nWhile this all seems unlikely to happen, let us pretend America magically transforms into a decent society and begins policing the police, moves toward fairness in criminal justice and actually prioritizes civil rights. There is still the cancer at the heart of a culture committed to venerating violence, celebrating selfishness and condemning compassion.\n\nNoam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman wrote the classic Manufacturing Consent , about the manipulative and exploitative relationship corporate media has with the American public. What if the consent is not manufactured? What if, as historian Morris Berman contends, the plutocratic theft of American lives and treasure is not actually a robbery, but a transaction?\n\nWilliam of Ockham famously devised the problem-solving principle, Occam's razor: Cut away the unnecessary complications and the simplest answer to a question is most likely the correct answer. After all the analysis of the normalized dysfunction of democracy in America, launched with the assumption that the political system fails to represent the will of the people, the question remains: what if it actually does represent the will of the people? That the system is actually succeeding in upholding its representational promise might be the simplest and most probable answer to the mystery of America's comatose slumber in a nightmare of torment for the oppressed and treasures for the oppressors.\n\nMore optimistic liberals will identify the masses of protestors filling the streets with rage and disgust over the state-sanctioned murder of two unarmed black men, but the thousands of people protesting in major cities are only the sane minority. The sane minority fights against the \"silent majority\" of Richard Nixon's delight. The disgraced president was right in 1969 when he pointed out that the majority of Americans were not part of anti-war demonstrations or countercultural movements; they were his voters, and their children became Reagan's voters. From beyond the grave, he is still right.\n\nThe police officers who shoot teenagers for the crime of stealing cigarillos, the cops who choke men to death and beat women, along with the police administrators and county prosecutors who protect them, are not from Mars. They are not lizards in disguise, as some of the wildest conspiracy theorists suggest. They are Americans. They are products of American institutions and culture, and they staff and supervise the enforcement of our laws.\n\nIn all of the attacks on the \"system\" for endorsing the behavior of murderous cops, few critics actually condemn those most responsible for the decisions not to press charges: the jurors. No one reasonable can doubt that the county prosecutor, Robet McCulloch, in Ferguson, did his best to corrupt the process, but clearly no one marching in solidarity with Michael Brown's family would have let Darren Wilson live comfortably with the $1 million his supporters raised to assist him through his financial difficulties. A large part of the problem lies with the jurors who accepted their roles as McCulloch's toys and Wilson's collective shield.\n\nThere is no imaginable defense of the jury in the Eric Garner case. They had visual evidence of the police murdering a man begging for his life. They, like the police they protect, are average Americans. They are not cyborgs. They are your neighbors.\n\nTwelve more Americans in Texas felt no horror or sympathy when watching two police officers beat Keyarika Diggles in a police station. Perhaps they viewed it with the same amusement we when watching the destruction of lives on reality television. One thing that is for certain is that they did not watch as decent human beings.\n\nThere is no question that the criminal justice system is racist, and that the American political system is vicious. Black people have always suffered the worst beating and battering in America, because the mental disease of racism is too viral to quickly heal. African Americans were three-fifths human during slavery, and it seems that in 2014, with a biracial man in the White House, they are four-fifths human. America has made progress, but no one but the blind can believe that black life has equal value as white life.\n\nThese \"systems,\" however, are not giant computers. They are institutions run and powered by people. The people are the face of America. Darren Wilson, Robert McCulloch and the jurors who failed to punish police officers for killing, are part of the silent majority. They are the same silent majority of voters responsible for the election of officials who dismiss poverty as an unimportant issue, who assault public education, and who continually call for the enhancement of killing Muslims in the Middle East. They are the same silent majority, 66 percent according to polls, who support air strikes against Iraq, and they constitute the 40 percent, which will only grow if the propaganda campaign picks up again, that support a ground invasion.\n\nFor a particularly horrific glimpse into the creep show of American values of violence, consider that, according to a recent Pew Report, 51 percent of Americans believe that torture, such as rectal feeding, waterboarding and other gruesome methods described in the Senate Intelligence Committee report, is justified. Another 20 percent said that they have no opinion.\n\nIt seems the jurors in the Brown, Garner and Diggles cases were easy to deceive, and in the case of Ferguson, likely because they had little knowledge of American history or law. They are likely part of the 71 percent of Americans who never read a newspaper, the 80 percent of American families who bought no books last year, and the 70 percent who cannot name a single part of the Bill of Rights.\n\nThey are the natural products of a culture that has steadily mutated into embracing destructive hyper-individualism. The for-profit healthcare system, the prison-industrial complex, and the bitter segregation along race and class lines in the public education system are also natural products, along with deranged and violent police who face no consequences for shedding blood. The victims of this culture, whether they are the children caught in the crosshairs of drone strikes or the women beaten in police stations, are made invisible or insignificant by myths of American exceptionalism and benevolence.\n\nSpeaking to me about Michael Brown's death and the racial divide in America, Jesse Jackson said, \"We've removed the layer of skin-the epidermis-that separates us. So now we can vote together, work together, date each others' sisters, but this thing is bone-deep. That's what people don't want to acknowledge. We know how to survive apart, but we must learn how to live together.\"\n\nThe acknowledgment of America's need to learn to live together has a simplicity that masks its profundity. Robert Putnam, in Bowling Alone , documented the extent of Americans' isolation from each other. Mass shootings, rates of violent crime higher than the rest of the developed world and outrages like Garner's and Brown's deaths demonstrate that the inability to peacefully coexist in America goes beyond race. It is a bone-deep dysfunction with social costs, political implications and spiritual disasters. Inequality will continue to grow and injustice will continue to worsen until America is made to actually deal with its levels of selfish indifference to suffering, from ordinary people on grand juries to those who occupy the highest thrones of power.\n\nThe sane minority might ostensibly protest the racism of the criminal justice system, but they are actually demanding that America become a civilized society. No civilization would tolerate what America has recently done, but it is that very concept -the idea of civilization-that the silent majority so fiercely seems to hate and reject."

He led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl and was just a few plays away from winning the title and lifting the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBut America's focus on Kaepernick's athletic success waned in 2016. That's when he began to kneel before games during the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to protest the deaths of young Black men at the hands of white police officers.\n\nThey included Alton Sterling and Philando Castile , two unarmed Black men killed by police in the summer of 2016.\n\n\"To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,\" Kaepernick said in The Guardian newspaper. \"There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\"\n\nKaepernick's activism, coinciding with the reemergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, received varied responses.\n\nSome NFL players, like Kaepernick's then-teammate Eric Reid , imitated Kaepernick's actions , generating a wave of anti-racist activism - not just in football but in other sports, too, like women's basketball. Others, including several NFL executives, responded with vitriol and hate .\n\nA recent study I conducted with colleagues Lisa Kiang and Elizabeth Seagroves examines American attitudes toward sports activism , providing insight into the stark responses to Kaepernick's advocacy and those of other athletes.\n\nWe surveyed 207 college students and 33 residents in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where I teach, to examine their views on racial justice activism among professional athletes.\n\nWe found there were three general perspectives.\n\nOne group supported the sports activism and tied it to changing the status quo. People in this group back athletes' ability to serve as activists and role models, and they hope the protests generate meaningful sociopolitical change.\n\n\"I thought it was very necessary and good,\" said one participant in the study, referring to athletes' activism. \"I think that if they can use their platform for something good, they should.\"\n\nWhen we asked about Kaepernick's activism in 2016, these participants lauded him for his courage .\n\nThey felt Kaepernick's protests, along with the Black Lives Matter movement, helped raise awareness of racial injustices in the United States.\n\nOther participants in our study expressed support for athletes' right to protest, but they rejected their racial justice advocacy.\n\nThey said athletes have the freedom to say what they think. And they tied the protests to the United States' commitment to freedom of speech . But they disapproved of kneeling during the playing of the national anthem, labeling it as disrespectful.\n\n\"I think most of it is good. If you have a platform, you should use it,\" one participant told us. \"However, when misinformation is spread, it becomes bad.\"\n\nSeveral participants felt the conflation of the national anthem with protesting racial injustices was misleading and wrong, and this participant considered Kaepernick's protest \"misinformation.\"\n\nKaepernick's activism elicited similarly mixed feelings at the time. A majority of the public viewed Kaepernick's refusal to stand as unpatriotic . Most, however, also supported his right to free speech.\n\nIn May 2018, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell barred athletes from protesting on the sidelines during the national anthem, but he gave them the option to remain in the locker room during the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" if they preferred. The move came after players had protested racial inequality and police brutality for two seasons.\n\n\"We want people to be respectful of the national anthem,\" Goodell said, according to ESPN . \"We want people to stand - that's all personnel - and make sure they treat this moment in a respectful fashion. That's something we think we owe. But we were also very sensitive to give players choices.\"\n\nIn June 2020, in the wake of George Floyd's death and years into Kaepernick's activism, Goodell apologized to players and reversed the policy, saying, \"We were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier.\"\n\nBut team protests varied throughout the league.\n\nSome teams such as the Green Bay Packers and Jacksonville Jaguars, at least on one occasion, remained in their locker rooms during the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nSome teams acted uniformly with the exception of one or two players. Dallas Cowboys player Dontari Poe was the only person on his team to kneel during the playing of the national anthem.\n\nThe fact that not all players protested, and that teams had distinct approaches to protesting, is not surprising given the public's varied responses to athlete activism.\n\nA third group of participants in our study disapproved of sports activism entirely. And these participants often accompanied their criticism by saying that athletes strayed from their role as entertainers.\n\n\"I don't think it's good because it's giving people a reason not to like a professional athlete when their job is to play a sport. They are not politicians and haven't been able to prove they can make a change,\" said one participant.\n\nFor example, when responding to WNBA player Skylar Diggins-Smith's call for the imprisonment of the police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, involved in the 2020 shooting death of Breonna Taylor during a nighttime apartment raid, one participant said: \"It's not for the average citizen to call for police officers to be investigated. It's just not OK for a professional athlete to push their agenda like that.\"\n\nOur study, much like other studies, found that people who are white , older and politically conservative are more opposed to racial justice activism in sports than their counterparts.\n\nAs seen in our study, U.S. views toward sports protests are tied to the role people believe athletes should play in society.\n\nFor some, athletes can and should be role models; that includes by raising awareness of racial injustices. For others, athletes should only express their perspectives under certain conditions.\n\nAnd yet other Americans believe athletes are performers whose only role should be to entertain.\n\nStill, there's no doubt Kaepernick's activism changed the playing field, even if his NFL career suffered . After the 2016 season , he was never picked up by another team .\n\nKaepernick's activism inspired people to attend protests and donate to political causes .\n\nThe NAACP has asked college athletes to avoid attending schools that are dismantling their diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr and All- Star Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors regularly voice their political views and draw attention to injustices.\n\nSeveral sports associations - the NFL , NBA , WNBA and NWSL - have implemented social justice initiatives and councils that strive to mobilize voters and educate the electorate on political issues.\n\nColin Kaepernick's activism may have ended his Super Bowl dreams, but his legacy extends far beyond the game of football.\n\nBetina Cutaia Wilkinson , Associate Professor & Associate Chair of Political Science, Wake Forest University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Here's What Happens to Police Officers Who Shoot Unarmed Black Men\n\nIn the week since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, initial autopsy findings, police reports, and eyewitness accounts have begun to provide some insights into the circumstances of his death. But plenty of questions remain unanswered, not the least of them: Where is Officer Darren Wilson, and what's likely to happen to him? Wilson, who was put on administrative leave after killing Brown, reportedly left home with his family a few days before his name was made public. A fundraising campaign launched on August 17 has already raised more than $10,000 to cover the financial needs of Wilson's family, \"including legal fees.\" (The campaign has since increased its goal to $100,000.)\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Wilson will face criminal charges, but a limited review of similar killings by police suggests that the officers more often than not walk away without an indictment, and are very rarely convicted. Delores Jones-Brown, a law professor and director of the Center on Race, Crime, and Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, looked at 21 publicized cases from 1994 through 2009 in which a police officer killed an unarmed black person. Of those, only seven cases resulted in an indictment-for criminally negligent homicide, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, or violation of civil rights-and only three officers were found guilty.\n\nLet's take a closer look at five specific cases in which an unarmed black man was killed by officers while allegedly fleeing or resisting in some fashion.\n\nCity: Memphis, Tennessee Date: October 1974 Officers: Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright Victim: Edward Garner What happened: Officers Hymon and Wright were responding to a burglary call when Hymon spotted Garner, an unarmed 15-year-old, by a fence in the backyard of the home in question. After Hymon ordered Garner to halt, the teenager tried to climb the fence. In response, the officer shot him fatally in the head. A federal district court ruled that the shooting was justified under a Tennessee statute-the law said that once a police officer voices intent to arrest a suspect, \"the officer may use all the necessary means to effect the arrest.\" Garner's father appealed, and the case ended up in the Supreme Court, which ruled the Tennessee statute unconstitutional and the killing unjustified. Justice Byron White wrote for the majority: \"It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape. Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so. It is no doubt unfortunate when a suspect who is in sight escapes, but the fact that the police arrive a little late or are a little slower afoot does not always justify killing the suspect. A police officer may not seize an unarmed, non-dangerous suspect by shooting him dead.\" Despite the reversal, the officer who shot Hymon was never charged.\n\nCity: Bronx, New York Date: December 1994 Officer: Francis X. Livoti Victim: Anthony Baez What happened: Officer Livoti choked to death 29-year-old Anthony Baez in a case that would later be featured in a PBS documentary titled Every Mother's Son. After their football struck his patrol car, Livoti had ordered Baez and his brother to leave the area. When the brothers refused, Livoti attempted an arrest. After Baez allegedly resisted, the officer administered the choke hold that ended his life. Livoti, who had been accused of brutality 11 times over 11 years , was charged with criminally negligent homicide, but found not guilty during a state trial in October 1996. He was fired the following year, however, after a judge ruled his choke hold illegal. In June 1998, a federal jury sentenced him to 7.5 years in prison for violating Baez's civil rights, and the Baez family received a $3 million settlement from the city later that year. In 2003, two more cops were fired for giving false testimony in Livoti's defense.\n\nCity: Bronx, New York Date: February 1999 Officers: Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Kenneth Boss, Richard Murphy Victim: Amadou Diallo What happened: Amadou Diallo, an unarmed, 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was killed in the vestibule of his own building when four white police officers fired 41 shots, striking him 19 times. Diallo had just returned home from his job as a street vendor at 12:44 a.m. when he was confronted by the plainclothes officers. The officers later said he matched the description of a rape suspect, and that they mistakenly believed he was reaching for a gun. (He was pulling out his wallet.) Three of the officers had been involved in previous shootings, including one that led to the death of another black civilian in 1997. The four cops were acquitted of all charges, prompting citywide protests. They were not fired , either, but lost permission to carry a weapon-although one of the officers eventually had his carrying privilege restored . In 2004, Diallo's family received a $3 million settlement from the city. His mother said her son had been saving to attend college and become a computer programmer. A foundation in Diallo's name seeks to promote racial healing.\n\nCity: Los Angeles, California Date: October 2000 Officer: Tarriel Hopper Victim: Anthony Dwain Lee What happened: Lee, a 39-year-old black actor who had roles in the 1997 movie Liar Liar and the TV series ER , was attending a Halloween party when the LAPD showed up, responding to a noise complaint. According to police accounts , a group of officers were searching for the party's host when they found Lee and two other men in a small room, engaged in what the police claimed looked like a drug deal. Lee, who was dressed as a devil, allegedly held up a toy pistol, whereupon Officer Hopper fired several times, wounding him fatally. The LAPD's internal review board determined that the shooting was justified because Hopper had believed Lee's pistol was real and feared for his life.\n\nCity: Oakland, California Date: January 2009 Officer: Johannes Mehserle Victim: Oscar Grant What happened: Early on New Year's Day, BART transit officers responding to reports of fighting on a train detained Oscar Grant, 22, and several other men on the platform at Fruitvale Station. In an incident captured on cell phone cameras, Officer Mehserle pulled out his gun and fatally shot Grant, who was face down on the platform at the time. Mehserle later testified that he thought he was reaching for his Taser while trying to put handcuffs on Grant, who resisted. A jury found Mehserle guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced him to two years in jail. He was released after serving 11 months at the Los Angeles County Jail. The episode was turned into the acclaimed 2013 feature film, Fruitvale Station.\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nView Non-AMP Version"

      "text": "5 Times the Media Has Smeared Black Victims of Police Killings Since Michael Brown\n\nMike Brown was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson exactly one year ago Sunday . His death not only sparked a nationwide movement against police violence generally known as #BlackLivesMatter, it also provided the script which all of the frequent subsequent police shootings of unarmed black men and women have played out in the media.\n\nFrom the beginning, the media was quick to contextualize Brown's shooting by finding unflattering personal details about his life including routine run-ins with the law. The most shameless case was the now infamous August 25th profile in the The New York Times that insisted \"Mike Brown was no angel\" as if anyone had argued otherwise about him, or another human being on earth. It was a piece that feigned nuance, but was really a part of a weeks-long posthumous trial of the dead teenager. For Brown, and countless black victims like him, they were as much, if not more, on trial than the person who had done the actual killing. They were being tried posthumously and without PR counsel.\n\nIn the wake of a police shooting, the need to rationalize police violence -- typically under the guise of \"balance\" -- almost always means demonizing the victim through public records requests, government leaks, and selective interviews. When one adopts a \"both sides\" mentality for police shootings, based on the nature of murder, one person cannot speak for themselves, invariably leaving us with one perspective: that of the police.\n\nPolice Departments have millions in PR budgets, while the victim's families are almost always poor and unschooled in press manipulation. The state has records on the victim, and yet the family is barred in most states from even knowing their son or daughter's killer. The deck, to put it mildly, is stacked in favor of the powerful -- rendering appeals to objectivity hollow. Howard Zinn famously said , \"you can't be neutral on a moving train.\" This has never been more obvious that in the dozens of cases of African-Americans killed by police over the past year, almost all of whom found themselves being tried in absentia by a press which prioritizes \"objectivity\" over fairness and access over justice.\n\nHere are the five worst examples of demonization of black victims of police violence since Mike Brown's death at the hands of a police officer on August 9th 2014:\n\n1. Eric Garner\n\nChoked on camera in broad daylight for \"resisting arrest\" with his hands up, Eric Garner's death was one of the few cop killings that was so egregious it resulted in relatively bipartisan outrage - including, strangely enough, from former President George W. Bush. who said the decision not to indict Eric Garner's killer Daniel Pantaleo was \"hard to understand.\"\n\nBut it's important to stress the word \"relatively\" because rightwing trolls wouldn't have it. Outlets from Breitbart , to Fox News to The New York Post to NewsMax dedicated considerable time to smearing Eric Garner as a \"career criminal\" who somehow caused his own death by resisting arrest. Vulgar human Bob McManus would pen one of the more offensive mainstream Garner smears, the day after his killer was set free by a Staten Island Grand Jury:\n\nBlame only the man who tragically decided to resist\n\nEric Garner and Michael Brown had much in common, not the least of which was this: On the last day of their lives, they made bad decisions.\n\nEpically bad decisions.\n\nEach broke the law - petty offenses, to be sure, but sufficient to attract the attention of the police. And then - tragically, stupidly, fatally, inexplicably - each fought the law. The law won, of course, as it almost always does.\n\nThere it is. Because Mr. Garner was a \"career criminal\" who, for once, resisted arrest in the most benign way possible, he deserved to die. No account of whether such extreme force was needed. No account for the banned chokehold, no account for whether or not six white men jumping on top of one black man was, at all, racially charged. No, in authoritarian rightwing land, anything short of complete submission to the police is punishable by death. And, because to them black life is cheap, their deaths become a morality tale for other black people to follow -- obey the police or suffer the same fate. In this sense, black deaths aren't just ignored, they are used as a warning to others.\n\n2. Sandra Bland\n\nA combination of a likely illegal arrest, harassment, and outright neglect led to Sandra Bland's death last month. Whether or not that was by way of suicide is yet to be determined, but thus far it seems she took her own life. In many ways, as other commenters have noted , it doesn't matter. And in many ways, the media treated it no differently. In the wake of Ms. Bland's death, aside from the aforementioned and entirely predictable authority worship from Fox News , another common smear tactic was trotted out: \"marijuana in the system.\"\n\nIt's a popular line and one the media and St. Louis County authorities echoed time and time again in the wake of Mr. Brown's death. That somehow having cannabis in one's system is either relevant or inculpatory. As Managing Director of the Drug Policy Alliance Sharda Sekaran noted in the Huffington Post:\n\nAt a news conference discussing the preliminary findings of an autopsy following Bland's alleged suicide at the Waller County Jail in Texas last week, officials placed heavy emphasis on marijuana reported to be found in the young woman's system.\n\nWhy this emphasis? What does this have to do with widespread demands for accountability around the circumstances of her death? Are we expected to believe the not so subtle insinuation that marijuana use played a part? How is this still happening? Take a sample of random people in any walk of life in this country at any given moment in time, and you are likely to find marijuana in the system of many of them.\n\nThe reason for the emphasis is clear: in an effort to justify police killings under the guise of \"balance\" the media rushes to find anything -- no matter how common or innocuous -- to criminalize the victim. And, since roughly 1 in 9 Americans smokes cannabis regularly, an easy go-to is the \"weed in the system\" line.\n\n3. Sam Dubose\n\nEven after Hamilton County's right-wing prosecutor delivered what has to be one of the most clear condemnations of a killer cop ever, Fox News couldn't help itself, trying to muddy the waters soon after by, once again, blaming the victim.\n\nAs Media Matters noted at the time , Eric Bolling of Fox News's The Five would repeat the ol' \"Don't resist arrest line\" because, as we all know, the punishment for resisting arrest is summary execution:\n\nBut everyone is rushing this, prosecutor just said the cop is guilty of murder. He's already indicted him. And I'm not defending this at all. But people have to realize you can't resist arrest. This guy is taking off. I don't think that cop was fearing for his life. So I think he'll probably be found guilty or something, but stop resisting.\n\nAnother Fox News contributor and former NYPD detective,  Bo Dietl wouldn't miss a beat, telling Sean Hannity later than night, \"Listen to me. I said it doesn't outweigh the shooting. But should he have just driven away from the cop? Eric, is that right for him to just drive away from the cop? That's not right either. \"\n\nBody camera footage from the incident seems to contradict the claim that Dubose fled from the officer. The footage seems to suggest that, in contrast to what the officer claimed, Dubose's car propeled forward after he was shot.\n\nThe impulse for the media, especially the right-wing media, to blame black victims for their own deaths is so strong, that even in the face of official Republican condemnation the bottom feeders at Fox News will still apologize for the police's actions. Even when video is released that shows, beyond any reasonable doubt, a white police officer wrongfully killed a black man, the impulse to blame the victim cannot be contained. It's not just bias, it's a pathology.\n\n4. Charly \"Africa\" Keunang\n\nOne of the lesser known police killings is also one of the more egregious examples of the media taking it upon themselves to smear a black victim. A video showing an unarmed homeless man being shot in broad daylight quickly went viral on March 1st, resulting in the LAPD going on the defensive. Per usual, the entirely unrelated criminal record of Keunang, who friends called \"Africa,\" would be leaked to the press and shamelessly repeated even thougt they had no bearing on the case whatsoever.\n\nOne reporter, in particular, Kate Mather of the Los Angels Times would feel the need to time and time again bring up a bank robbery Mr. Africa had committed over fifteen years ago. As I wrote at the time for FAIR :\n\nThis arrangement would become even sleazier yesterday when city authorities-and thus the LA Times-went into full on character assassination mode, with back -to- back smear pieces about Africa's totally irrelevant criminal past. This screencap of the LA Times' Kate Mather's bio page sums it up nicely:\n\nHer jolly face contrasted with the scary, entirely non sequitur mugshot of Africa raises the question: Why? What does whether he robbed a bank 15 years ago have to do with anything? How is it relevant? How can it do anything but serve to posthumously try and convict him on unrelated charges of being poor and mentally ill?\n\nThis case illustrates an important point as well: the smearing of black victims isn't just a staple of the rightwing media, it's a very routine practice in local and corporate media who are in desperate need of information and always willing to uncritically repeat whatever the local police departments hand them inexchange for it. Which brings us to the last and most well-known smear:\n\n5. Freddie Gray\n\nThe death of Freddie Gray was ruled a homicide and the officers involved were eventually arrested and charged with a number of crimes, including murder and manslaughter. But not after a week of smear pieces coming from anonymous police sources that attempted to blame Mr. Gray for his own death. Indeed, much of what the Baltimore Police said during the week of unrest in late April turned out to be bogus, including a \"gang conspiracy\" to take out cops that was uncritically repeated by the media but later revealed to be false by the FBI.\n\nIn addition to telling lies to discredit protestors, the Baltimore Police Department was content telling lies that also discredited the source of their outrage: Freddie Gray. Two days before prosecutors would indict the cops who were responsible for Gray's death, the Washinton Post would run a rather bizarre -- and ultimately discredited -- piece based on anonymous BPD leaks detailing how Freddie Gray was trying to injure himself the day of his arrest:\n\nA prisoner sharing a police transport van with Freddie Gray told investigators that he could hear Gray \"banging against the walls\" of the vehicle and believed that he \"was intentionally trying to injure himself,\" according to a police document obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nEventually, follow up corrections to the piece as well as the DA's indictment would go a long way to discrediting the idea that Gray was supposedly responsible for his own death but in many ways the damage was done.\n\nLike smears against protestors that almost always turn out to be bogus, smears again police victims are more about managing public outrage than they are about truth. They're about playing to racist tropes and criminalizing victims so the power establishment -- largely white and wealthy -- will side with the killer, not the killed. They're about justifying state violence either because of ideology or credulity. They're, above all, about erasing black suffering from the national conversation and turning victims into criminals and criminal cops into heroes."

      "text": "'Stop this onslaught': Pat Robertson comes out with a surprising rebuke of police killings and abuse\n\nConservative televangelist Pat Robertson is speaking out against the \"onslaught\" of police officers killing unarmed Black men, including Sunday's fatal shooting of 20-year old Daunte Wright by officer Kim Potter and last year's killing of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin.\n\n\"She shot that poor guy to death,\" said Robertson, who is considered a far right wing conservative who toes the partisan line, in a surprising segment Thursday on his \"700 Club\" show. He was speaking of former Brooklyn Center, Minnesota police officer Kim Potter, who allegedly thought she had pulled out her taser, but instead was holding her handgun when she pulled the trigger shooting a single bullet into Daunte Wright's chest. He died minutes later.\n\n\"You can feel the difference. There's just no comparison,\" Robertson said as he weighed both a handgun and a taser in his hands. \"If you can't tell the difference in the field it's crazy.\"\n\n\"She deserves - \" Robertson said, apparently about to criticize Potter, before stopping himself.\n\n\"You know, I am pro-police folks, I think we need the police, we need their service, and they do a good job,\" Robertson declared. \"But if they don't stop this onslaught, they cannot do this.\"\n\n\"You know, the police in Virginia picked up a, a lieutenant in the Army, and began to give him trouble and our state police are highly trained, but why they didn't stop this,\" he said, referring to police who conducted a reportedly illegal traffic stop and then pepper-sprayed Second Lt. Caron Nazario, an Army medic.\n\n\"And this thing is going on in Minnesota,\" Robertson continued, referring to former police officer Derek Chauvin, currently on trial fo killing George Floyd by putting his knee on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.\n\n\"They ought to put him under the jail,\" Robertson said of Derek Chauvin, who he mentioned by name. \"It's caused so much trouble, by kneeling on - the death of George Floyd - on his neck. It's just terrible, what's happening, and the police, why don't they open their eyes to what the public relations are, they've got to stop this.\"\n\nWatch:"

      "text": "What Schools Never Teach About the Black Panther Party, but Should\n\nFifty years ago this month, the Black Panther Party was born. Its history holds vital lessons for today's movement to confront racism and police violence, yet textbooks either misrepresent or minimize the significance of the Black Panthers.\n\nThe first issue of the Black Panther newspaper, which at its height had a weekly circulation of 140,000 copies, asked, \"WHY WAS DENZIL DOWELL KILLED?\" Helping Dowell's family demand justice in Richmond, California, was one of the first major organizing campaigns of the Black Panther Party . Anyone reading the story of Denzil Dowell today can't help but draw parallels to the unarmed Black men and women regularly murdered by the police. The disparity between the police's story and the victim's family's, the police harassment Dowell endured before his murder, the jury letting off Dowell's killer, even the reports that Dowell had his hands raised while he was gunned down, eerily echo the police killings today that have led to the explosion of the Black Lives Matter movement .\n\nYet when we learn about the early years of the Panthers, the organizing they did in Richmond-conducting their own investigation into Dowell's death, confronting police who harassed Dowell's family, helping mothers in the community organize against abuse at the local school, organizing armed street rallies in which hundreds filled out applications to join the party-is almost always absent. Armed with a revolutionary socialist ideology, as the Panthers grew, so did what they organized around. They fought in Black communities across the nation for giving the poor access to decent housing, health care, education, and much more.\n\nThis local organizing that Panthers engaged in has been erased in the textbooks, yet it is precisely what won them such widespread support. By 1970, a Market Dynamics/ABC poll found that Black people judged the Panthers to be the organization \"most likely\" to increase the effectiveness of the Black liberation struggle, and two-thirds showed admiration for the party. Coming in the midst of an all-out assault on the Panthers from the white press and law enforcement, including FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's claim that the Panthers were \"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country,\" this support is remarkable.\n\nThe Textbook Version of the BPP\n\nTextbooks often associate the Panthers with violence and racial separatism. For example, Teacher Curriculum Institute's History Alive! The United States reads,\n\nBlack Power groups formed that embraced militant strategies and the use of violence. Organizations such as the Black Panthers rejected all things white and talked of building a separate black nation.\n\nWhile ignoring that the Panthers believed in using violence only in self-defense, this passage also attempts to divide the Panthers from \"nonviolent\" civil rights groups. The Panthers didn't develop out of thin air, however, but evolved from their relationships with other civil rights organizations, especially the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) . The name and symbol of the Panthers were adopted from the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) , an independent political organization SNCC helped organize in Alabama, also called the \"Black Panther Party.\" Furthermore, SNCC allied with the Panthers in 1968 and while the alliance only lasted five months, it was a crucial time for the growth of the Panthers.\n\nThe passage from History Alive! also incorrectly paints the Panthers as anti-white, erasing their important work building multiracial coalitions. Most famously, Chicago Panther leader Fred Hampton organized the Rainbow Coalition including the Puerto Rican Young Lords and the Young Patriots-a group of poor Southern white migrants. The Black Panthers helped the Patriots set up their own community service programs. In California, the Panthers made an important alliance with the mostly white Peace and Freedom Party. The Peace and Freedom Party ran Eldridge Cleaver for President in 1968 in an attempt to provide an antiwar, anti-racist alternative to the Democratic Party. An editorial in the Black Panther explained: \"The increasing isolation of the black radical movement from the white radical movement was a dangerous thing, playing into the power structure's game of divide and conquer.\"\n\nSome textbooks erase the socialist character of the Black Panther Party. Holt McDougal's The Americans , reads, \" Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded a political party known as the Black Panthers to fight police brutality in the ghetto.\" While the textbook later acknowledges other things the Panthers advocated, by reducing the reason for their founding to fighting police brutality, The Americans profoundly diminishes the important ideological basis of the party. More clearly than any other national civil rights organization, the Panthers linked the fight against racism with the fight against capitalism. As Newton explained in The Black Panther , reprinted in The Black Panthers Speak , \"We realize that this country became very rich upon slavery and that slavery is capitalism in the extreme. We have two evils to fight, capitalism and racism. We must destroy both.\" The Panthers understood that Black people could not achieve socialism on their own and their work building multiracial anti-capitalist coalitions flowed from that analysis. In fact, the Panthers developed an education requirement for joining the party that consisted of reading 10 books relating to Black liberation and socialism.\n\nSeveral textbooks also blame the Panthers for the end of the Civil Rights Movement, while ignoring or downplaying the role the FBI played in destroying the party. In a later section in The Americans , the authors write, \"Public support for the civil rights movement declined because some whites were frightened by the urban riots and the Black Panthers.\" What textbooks like this fail to mention, is the decline in public support was a result of the counterintelligence program ( COINTELPRO ) of the FBI. According to scholar Ward Churchill in Agents of Repression :\n\n. . . the Black Panther Party was savaged by a campaign of political repression, which in terms of its sheer viciousness has few parallels in American history. Coordinated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . . . and enlisting dozens of local police departments around the country, the assault left at least 30 Panthers dead, scores of others imprisoned after dubious convictions, and hundreds more suffering permanent physical or psychological damage. Simultaneously, the party was infiltrated at every level by agents provocateurs , all of them harnessed to the task of disrupting its internal functioning. Completing the package was a torrent of \"disinformation\" planted in the media to discredit the Panthers before the public, both personally and organizationally, thus isolating them from potential support.\n\nWith minimal and problematic coverage in the history textbooks, there is little curriculum for teachers hoping to provide students with the crucial history of the Black Panther Party.\n\nTeaching the Panthers Through Role Play\n\nTo try to give students a fuller picture of the party's history, we wrote a mixer activity in which each student takes on a role of someone who was in or connected to the Black Panthers. The roles give students a thumbnail sketch of that person's biography along with details that help illuminate aspects of the party. We tried to emphasize why people joined the Black Panther Party. For example, the role of Kathleen Cleaver begins:\n\nAs a young Black woman growing up in Alabama in the 1950s, you wanted to challenge injustice. You were inspired by powerful women leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). . . . These women were creating a social revolution in the Deep South and all worked with SNCC. . . . In 1966, you went to organize in SNCC's New York office and then to Atlanta. You had joined SNCC at the time it took up the slogan \"Black Power,\" and you saw the Black Panther Party as taking the positions SNCC was headed toward. . . . You decided to move to San Francisco and join the Panthers.\n\nStudents also meet Ruby Dowell, Denzil Dowell's sister who joined the party after the organizing the Panthers did in Richmond.\n\nWe also tried to highlight the repression the Panthers faced along with some of the lesser known, but important stories of Panther community organizing. The role for Lumumba Shakur, founder of the New York Black Panther Party chapter, explains how the entire New York Panther leadership was arrested on flimsy evidence. The role continues:\n\n. . . you spent two years in prison while the trial proceeded. You organized prisoners to fight for better living conditions and at one point took control of the jail from the prison guards. You demanded and received bail hearings for every prisoner. Hundreds of prisoners were released as a result of the new hearings.\n\nStudents also encounter Panther allies in the Young Patriots, the American Indian Movement, the Brown Berets, and the Young Lords. They also meet Panther \"enemies\" like FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and Los Angeles police officer Pat McKinley.\n\nOne of the most overlooked aspects of the Panthers we tried to highlight was their role in the struggle for anti-racist education. In Living for the City: Migration, Education, and the Rise of the Black Panther Party in Oakland , historian Donna Murch details how the Panthers had their origins in \"Agitation for Black Studies courses and debates about the 'relevance' of education,\" and describes the membership of Panthers as \"Composed largely of Southern migrants under 25, including many students recruited from local high schools and community colleges. . . .\" The Panthers were formed out of a study group at Oakland's Merritt College. The Panthers' belief in the need for an education beyond what was being taught in the school system led them to develop a network of liberation schools for youth.\n\nIn the mixer, the role of Ericka Huggins highlights the Panthers' flagship liberation school in Oakland. Other roles highlight the Panthers' fight for ethnic studies and their Free Breakfast Program that fed hundreds of hungry children before school and was eventually adopted by the U.S. education system-one of the party's most meaningful and lasting reforms.\n\nStudents are often blown away by the stories presented. \"My character's a badass!\" one student exclaimed after reading about Bobby Seale's acts of defiance in the courtroom when he was put on trial after participating in the 1968 antiwar demonstration at the Democratic National Convention. Students are often eager to learn the stories in the room and a buzz fills the air as they grab one another and share their roles.\n\nWe hope the mixer we wrote, Wayne Au's lesson on the Panthers' Ten Point Program , and Ursula Wolfe-Rocca's lesson on COINTELPRO , can be starting points for educators who hope to arm a new generation with the story of the Panthers. As the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panther Party draws new attention to the organization, these lessons should be just a few of many to come that help teachers and students explore this rich-and too often ignored-history."

      "text": "Police confront 2 men, 1 white, 1 black: Only 1 is shot\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) - In the course of 15 months and in the space of one city block, Milwaukee police twice encountered two suspects they believed were armed.\n\nOne was black; one was white.\n\nOne was in fact unarmed; one had a gun.\n\nOne was shot; one was not.\n\nThat the black man was the one who was shot - though he had no weapon - might come as little surprise at a time when police shootings involving black men seem commonplace nationally.\n\nMilwaukee has been an epicenter. In 2014, Dontre Hamilton , a mentally ill man, was shot 14 times by police. In August 2016, 23-year-old Sylville Smith was killed by an officer . After the first, the city equipped police with bodycams; after the second, there were riots.\n\nThe shooting of 19-year-old Jerry Smith Jr. in 2017 did not set off similar convulsions. And the blood-free resolution of the standoff involving 20-year-old Brandon Baker this past November drew little notice. But taken together, they prompt a difficult and unanswerable question:\n\nIf their races were reversed - if Smith were white, and Baker were black - would Baker have been the one who was left bleeding and writhing in pain?\n\n___\n\nIn the darkness on Nov. 6, Election Day, Baker took to the roof of his apartment building and started firing guns. His neighbors, alarmed, called police.\n\nUntil then, his criminal record consisted of minor traffic violations, pot possession, and carrying a concealed weapon in September.\n\nHe'd created his Twitter account a few days prior and started writing about running for governor, promising money for underfunded schools, pledging to legalize marijuana. He would pardon all felons so they could regain their right to bear arms.\n\nJust after 5 a.m., two police officers sent to the scene encountered Baker on Michigan Avenue, in front of the entrance to the building.\n\nHe refused to drop the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle he was holding. He admitted that he had fired the shots earlier, and said he had posted a video of it on Twitter. He told the officers he was running for governor, that he was going to the polls to \"air it out,\" that he was going to start a militia. He had a right to bear arms, he said.\n\nAs they talked, other officers approached him quietly from behind, and tackled him.\n\n\"I'm not moving, don't shoot me!\" Baker screamed in the video he was broadcasting, which WISN-TV obtained before its removal from Twitter.\n\nNot a shot was fired.\n\nIn addition to the rifle he was holding, Baker had three loaded handguns - one in his backpack, another in his waistband, and a third in his jacket, prosecutors said. In his apartment, they said officers found 232 grams of THC, the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana; 14 stamps saturated with LSD; and 73 jars of what were believed to be psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nBaker faces numerous charges, including recklessly endangering safety and \"maintaining a drug trafficking place.\" His public defender, who did not respond to requests to comment, has ordered a second doctor's evaluation to determine whether he's competent to stand trial.\n\n___\n\nOn Aug. 31, 2017, officers Melvin Finkley and Adam Stahl were on patrol when they received a call about a man with a gun in the predominantly black neighborhood west of downtown Milwaukee. Finkley is black; Stahl is white.\n\nIt was around 1 p.m. when they got to the parking garage at North 29th Street and West Wisconsin Avenue. Jerry Smith was on the roof.\n\nThat afternoon, he and a friend had gone to a house in the neighborhood to confront someone with whom Smith had a problem. Police later said Smith and his friend were looking for a fight, and after a brawl ensued with several others, Smith left to get a gun. When an officer approached him to ask about the fight, he ran away and took to the roof.\n\nA handful of officers below were yelling commands, telling him to put his hands up because they had him surrounded.\n\nTwo officers stood on the stairs leading up to the garage's roof. When Finkley and Stahl approached, Finkley asked: \"He got the gun in his hand?\"\n\n\"He doesn't have a gun in his hand, but he was hiding behind the AC unit,\" an officer responded.\n\nThe tip that Smith had a gun came from the people he'd been fighting.\n\nFinkley and Stahl climbed to the roof with their guns trained on Smith and joined the chorus of officers yelling commands. Smith briefly extended his arms just above his waist to show his empty hands, palms out, then began crouching slowly to the ground. That's when the two officers fired three shots, with one bullet grazing Smith's head and the others striking his abdomen.\n\n\"I'm going to die!\" Smith wailed in agony, on the ground. \"I didn't do nothing.\"\n\nThe encounter lasted about 10 seconds. No gun was found.\n\n___\n\nSmith survived, but his right leg is partially paralyzed and he needs a cane to walk. He wasn't charged with a crime and has a pending federal lawsuit against the police, alleging officers acted \"with deliberate indifference.\"\n\n\"I had my hands up. It's on them,\" Smith said at a recent news conference.\n\n\"Everybody scared of the police, every black man that's from around\" the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, he said.\n\nBut the Milwaukee district attorney's office reviewed Smith's shooting and concluded the officers' actions were justified because they \"reasonably believed\" Smith was armed, based on information from dispatch, and they thought he might reach for a gun behind the air conditioning unit.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales said people need to consider \"the totality of the circumstances\" when an officer is involved in a shooting. He said officers are under stress and taking in a lot of information - from what they are told while responding to a call to their own observations - and they have to make sense of it all in seconds.\n\n\"I've been involved in these things. And I can tell you, in the incidents I've been involved in more than once, when it happened, my body just did it. ... There are things that are instinctual after you do it over and over again,\" Morales said, at a Dec. 6 meeting of the Milwaukee Common Council.\n\nThis shooting was recorded in its entirety by Stahl's body camera. Experts who viewed the video at the request of The Associated Press were not in agreement on what it revealed, though they acknowledged that there was little in it that justified the shooting.\n\nJeff Noble, an officer for 30 years who's now a law enforcement consultant, said he saw no \"immediate threat\" posed by Smith but echoed Morales' wariness of criticizing the officers' reactions, if only because the camera did not capture everything the officers saw: \"I have the luxury of sitting here in my office watching this and playing it back multiple times.\"\n\nKevin Cokley, a psychology professor and director of the Institute for Urban Policy Research & Analysis at the University of Texas at Austin, was unequivocal: \"This was not a justified shooting.\"\n\nSmith didn't exactly follow the officers' commands to keep his hands up, Cokley said, but he also didn't make a move toward his pocket or waistband and police already had a tactical advantage with their guns pointed at him.\n\nCokley, who has written op-eds about police shootings of unarmed black men, said, \"Reactions based on fear within the context of policing are often driven by implicit bias. Black males are viewed as more dangerous, even in instances when they pose no danger.\"\n\n___\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett declined to comment on Smith's shooting because there's pending litigation, but in a statement he cautioned against comparing the Smith and Baker cases.\n\n\"Comparing two separate incidents is inevitably problematic because circumstances police officers face and observations they make are different in every situation,\" he said.\n\nOthers, though, are troubled by two encounters with very different outcomes.\n\nAlderman Khalif Rainey, who is black, contrasted Smith's shooting with how police apprehended Baker \"without having to harm him at all.\"\n\nRainey said he's stopped believing he'll never find himself in a situation like Smith's.\n\n\"It's real serious. At one point in time I thought, 'Not me,'\" he said. \"But now it's like, something goes wrong, you make the wrong move, you make the wrong gesture ... and now I'm shot. Now I'm paralyzed. Now I'm dead.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "LAPD officer won't face charges in killing of unarmed man\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Nearly three years after a police shooting that sparked protests in Los Angeles, prosecutors said Thursday they will not file charges against the officer who killed an unarmed homeless man, despite a recommendation for charges from the police chief.\n\nProsecutors declined to bring charges because they couldn't prove Officer Clifford Proctor acted unlawfully when he shot Brendon Glenn in the back in 2015 in Venice, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said.\n\n\"We have concluded that there's insufficient evidence to overcome a claim at trial by Officer Proctor that he did that in defense of his partner or himself,\" Lacey said.\n\nGlenn, 29, of Troy, New York, was on his stomach and trying to push himself up when Proctor shot him, according to police.\n\nGlenn wasn't trying to take a gun from Proctor or his partner when he was shot, and Proctor's partner told investigators that he didn't know why the officer opened fire, police have said.\n\nPolice Chief Charlie Beck had recommended that prosecutors charge Proctor. In addition, a civilian oversight panel found the officer violated department policy when he shot Glenn twice in the back.\n\nAn attorney for Glenn's family called Lacey's decision \"spineless\" and said it highlighted a conflict of interest when prosecutors are tasked with deciding whether to charge police officers.\n\n\"Officer Proctor did not act to deescalate the situation,\" lawyer V. James DeSimone said in a statement. \"This tragic death could have been avoided with common sense policing.\"\n\nThe shooting, which came amid tensions nationwide over police killings of unarmed black men, drew angry protests in the city. Both Glenn and Proctor are black.\n\nGlenn's name has become a rallying cry against police shootings in Los Angeles, and activists have held a series of protests outside Lacey's office. The activists say the office hasn't prosecuted an on-duty officer for a fatal shooting in more than a decade.\n\nBeck's unprecedented recommendation to charge the officer was not helpful to the case, Lacey said. Such letters raise expectations when the evidence may not be there to support the conclusion, she said.\n\nGlenn was killed during a struggle with officers outside a bar where he had fought with a bouncer. A police report said Proctor told investigators that he saw Glenn's hand on his partner's holster and thought he was trying to grab the other officer's gun.\n\nSurveillance video from a nearby bar did not show Glenn reaching for the weapon, and Proctor's partner, Jonathan Kawahara, said he didn't see Glenn's hand go near his gun, a district attorney's report said.\n\nProsecutors said even if Glenn wasn't reaching for Kawahara's gun, the struggle could've caused Proctor to fear that he was.\n\nThe district attorney did not decide the shooting was justified and instead said Porter \"could have a rather credible and successful claim that in this struggle to lawfully arrest this man that he feared that there was a threat of death or great bodily injury.\"\n\nProctor's attorney, Bill Seki, said he believed the district attorney made the right decision and Proctor was in imminent danger when he shot Glenn.\n\n\"That's been our position all along that his actions weren't criminal,\" Seki said.\n\nProctor resigned from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2017. The city paid $4 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit that was brought by Glenn's relatives.\n\nThe report included officer body-camera footage , which is rarely released by Los Angeles authorities, and surveillance videos. Investigators said they also took statements from 10 civilian witnesses, used DNA analysis and brought in a use-of-force expert to consult on the case.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file police officers, said Lacey \"followed the evidence in this case and did not succumb to political posturing or pressure.\"\n\nWhile Proctor was on leave after the shooting, internal affairs investigators referred a case to the district attorney's office against him because they found he \"was not at home when he was supposed to be,\" but prosecutors declined to bring criminal charges.\n\nIn 2016, Proctor was charged in a separate case with domestic battery and is also accused of violating a court order and dissuading a witness from testifying, Orange County prosecutors said. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Balsamo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1 .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "This Supreme Court ruling is alarming for Black people with mental illness\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nIf you are mentally ill and Black, you already have two strikes against you if you come into contact with law enforcement. In fact, one in four victims of a police shooting have signs of mental illness, according to The Washington Post's police shooting database. And the unrelenting spate of police shootings of unarmed Black men that dominates the national news demonstrates the dangers of being Black.\n\nPolice officers shot and killed Saheed Vassel, a Black man well known (even among police) as someone who lived with mental illness, on a Brooklyn street corner when they mistook a metal pipe that he was holding for a gun. Days before the shooting came, a new U.S. Supreme Court decision was made that stunned civil rights advocates and revealed a third strike: the unwillingness of our justice system to hold police accountable.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of an Arizona officer who shot a woman with a history of mental illness.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent that the court's recent decision was not only wrong, but it tells law enforcement that officers \"can shoot first and think later, and it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished.''\n\nSotomayor, who was joined in the dissent by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, warned that the doctrine of limited immunity for police is being used as \"an absolute shield for law enforcement officers.''\n\nShe's right. I see that shield allowing more and more officers who use excessive and often deadly force - especially on unarmed people of color and those with a mental illness - to get away with murder.\n\nIn the Arizona case, an officer shot victim Amy Hughes four times when she refused to drop a kitchen knife. The officer said he shot Hughes because he thought she posed a threat to her roommate. Later, the roommate said that Hughes had a history of mental illness and that she didn't feel concerned for her own safety. In fact, as the New York Times reported, Hughes \"was not moving, spoke calmly, held the knife at her side and made no aggressive movements.\"\n\nHughes, who survived and was not charged with any crime, filed a lawsuit against the officer for shooting her.\n\nAs her case made its way through the courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of Hughes, overturning an earlier district court's summary judgment in favor of the officer. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that there were real questions of fact, such as whether Hughes had presented a real threat and whether the officer had given adequate warning before shooting.\n\nBut the Supreme Court sided with the officer, shielding him from the lawsuit. The court said the officer believed Hughes was a threat to her roommate and had \"mere seconds to assess the potential danger.\" The justices - without briefing or oral argument - overturned the appeals court ruling.\n\nCould it be that the justice system's apathy toward holding police officers accountable for their actions is empowering police to shoot first without thinking - just as Sotomayor said in her dissent?\n\nIn the case of the late Vassel in Brooklyn, witnesses told the New York Times that the officers appeared to shoot almost immediately after arriving at the street corner where Vassel was standing.\n\nIn Houston, Danny Ray Thomas, an unarmed Black man who was clearly in mental distress, was shot and killed when a Harris County deputy sheriff arrived at a busy intersection where Thomas was walking with his pants down.\n\nAccording to his relatives, Thomas suffered from depression - two of his children were murdered in 2016. His family said he wasn't a bad man, just deeply troubled.\n\nThe community is left to wonder: Couldn't law enforcement have found a less violent, more humane way to intervene rather than killing a man who even the sheriff said was \"obviously in a state of crisis of some kind?\" - (CNN)\n\nBut because he was Black, the odds were stacked against him. The Washington Post's ongoing tally of police-involved shootings shows that officers have killed 57 people known to suffer from mental illness so far this year. Of those, 31 (54 percent) were white and 11 (19 percent) were Black. Yet the U.S. census shows whites make up 77 percent of the population, and Blacks make up just 13 percent.\n\nThe color of one's skin and the state of one's psyche should not be compounding risk factors. And when police make mistakes based on those factors, our institutions of justice have a moral obligation to stand up for the diverse and vulnerable people who make up our country.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "How cases involving 2 NYC cops and 2 unarmed men measure up\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The indictment of New York Police Department Officer Peter Liang Wednesday on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the stairwell shooting of Akai Gurley comes two months after a grand jury declined to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. Both were unarmed black men who died at the hands of police, and the officers became the subject of criminal investigations.\n\n\"But the similarities stop there,\" criminal law professor James Cohen said. Garner's death touched off massive protests and calls for police reform. The encounter was captured on video and widely viewed online. The officer testified before the grand jury.\n\nGurley's death occurred during a chance encounter on a pitch black stairwell in a Brooklyn housing project. Liang fired a single shot and his finger never should have been on the trigger, prosecutors said, but no one believes he intentionally wanted to kill Gurley. Liang didn't testify in his defense.\n\nHere's a look at the two cases:\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES:\n\nAkai Gurley, 28, was having his hair braided by his girlfriend at her apartment in the Louis Pink Houses in Brooklyn on Nov. 20. He had just given up waiting for the elevator so he could leave when he stepped into a darkened stairwell to walk to the lobby. Meanwhile, Officer Peter Liang and his partner were patrolling the stairwells of the public housing complex. Liang, 27, had his gun drawn, his finger on the trigger, prosecutors said. As he pushed open the door with his shoulder, he fired one shot that ricocheted, striking Gurley on the floor above. Gurley made it down two flights before collapsing and later died. Liang is Chinese-American. His lawyer says the shooting was an accident.\n\nEric Garner, 43, was standing outside a Staten Island convenience store and was suspected of selling loose cigarettes on July 17. Officer Daniel Pantaleo and others accused tried to arrest him but he resisted. In an incident captured on video and widely viewed, the officer tries to take the heavyset Garner down, wrapping an arm around his neck. He cried \"I can't breathe,\" lost consciousness and later died. The officer said he was using a legal takedown maneuver but critics said it was a chokehold, banned under NYPD policy. Pantaleo is white.\n\nTHE BOROUGHS:\n\nStaten Island, where Garner died, is by far the least populated of the city's five boroughs, with about 472,000 residents, the most conservative and least racially diverse, dominated by homeowners rather than renters, and home to many current and retired police officers. According to the 2010 census, it's the only borough where non-Hispanic whites make up a majority - 64 percent. It had the lowest percentage of blacks at 9.5 percent. The borough leans Republican.\n\nBrooklyn, where Gurley was killed, has 2.5 million people, and houses some of the wealthiest and poorest in the city. According to census figures, the borough is 36 percent non-Hispanic white, and 35 percent black. The median household income is $49,000. It contains areas with some of the highest crime rates in the city, and also the highest level of police involvement.\n\nTHE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS:\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson won a contentious race in 2013, displacing the longtime incumbent, and his tenure so far has been marked by a series of exonerations. The bulk of the cases stem from concerns about the investigative tactics of a now-retired detective. On Wednesday, Thompson said Liang's case was not to be seen in the shadow of Garner. \"This case has nothing to do with Ferguson or Eric Garner or any other case,\" he said. \"This case has to do with an innocent man who lost his life and a young New York City police officer who has now been charged with taking his life,\" he said.\n\nStaten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan has held the job for a little over a decade. He is currently planning to run for the Congressional seat formerly occupied by disgraced Rep. Michael Grimm in a special election. Donovan asked for some details of the Garner grand jury to be released, but not a transcript of the minutes. The New York Civil Liberties Union and others asked a court to order Donovan to release the transcript, detailed descriptions of evidence and other documentation. A judge is weighing a request.\n\nNOW WHAT:\n\nFederal prosecutors are reviewing the Garner case, and the family has filed paperwork to sue the city.\n\nLiang likely will face a judge, not a jury, and experts say it will be difficult to win a conviction because they will have to prove he knew there was a substantial risk of causing someone's death and disregarded it to be convicted on the top charges. \"It's a very tough sell,\" said Bennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor and former prosecutor. \"I give the DA a lot of credit; it was a courageous use of authority here. Now comes the tough part. It's easy to get a grand jury to indict; it's quite different to win a conviction.\" The family of Gurley also has filed paperwork to sue the city.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Developments in tensions between police and communities\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nThe killings of unarmed black men by white police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, and in New York City last year touched off protests and a national debate over police conduct that has continued with the recent deaths of black men at the hands of law enforcers in North Charleston, South Carolina, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. A police officer was injured by protesters in New York on Tuesday in one of several demonstrations targeting police brutality nationwide. Here are some recent developments amid the tension between police and communities.\n\n___\n\nAUTHORITIES SAY RESERVE DEPUTY THOUGHT GUN WAS A STUN GUN\n\nA 73-year-old Oklahoma reserve sheriff's deputy who authorities say fatally shot a suspect after confusing his handgun for his stun gun was booked into Tulsa County Jail on Tuesday on a manslaughter charge. Robert Bates was released after posting bond.\n\nThe Tulsa County Sheriff's Office said Bates, an insurance executive who was volunteering on an undercover operation in Tulsa, accidentally shot 44-year-old Eric Harris on April 2. Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Bates on Monday with second-degree manslaughter, punishable by up to four years in prison.\n\nA video of the incident shows a deputy tackle Harris, who authorities say tried to sell an illegal gun to an undercover officer. A gunshot rang out as the deputy wrestled with Harris on the ground and a man says: \"Oh, I shot him. I'm sorry.\"\n\nHarris died at an area hospital.\n\n___\n\nPASSENGER SAYS THERE WAS NO CONFRONTATION BEFORE FATAL SHOOTING\n\nThe attorney for a man in the car with Walter Scott before Scott was killed by a North Charleston, South Carolina, police officer said Wednesday his client heard the crackle of a Taser and shots fired but didn't see what happened.\n\nAttorney Mark Peper said that according to his client, Pierre D. Fulton, there was no confrontation between officer Michael Slager and Scott when Scott was pulled over April 4 for a broken tail light.\n\nScott later ran and a cellphone video showed Slager firing eight shots at Scott.\n\nFulton released a statement Monday saying he didn't know why Scott ran after his car was stopped. Peper said his client has also given a statement to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.\n\nScott was behind $18,000 in his child support payments and family members have said he may have run because he was worried about going to jail.\n\n___\n\nOFFICER USES POLICE CAR TO RAM SUSPECT\n\nDash-cam video released this week shows a police officer in a suburb of Tucson, Arizona, using his cruiser to ram an armed suspect Feb. 19, sending him flying in the air before the car smashes into a wall.\n\nMarana police Sgt. Chris Warren said 36-year-old Mario Valencia robbed a convenience store, broke into a church, invaded a home and stole a car. Warren said Valencia drove the stolen car to Marana, just north of Tucson, where he stole a rifle from a Wal-Mart.\n\nDash-cam video shows an officer slowly driving behind Valencia as he shoots the rifle in the air. The officer tells others to stay back because the suspect is armed. But within seconds, a different officer drives his patrol car at high speed and rams into Valencia, sending him flying into the air.\n\nThe Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer, Michael Rapiejko, of any wrongdoing and he is back on the force.\n\nValencia faces felony charges, including assault on a police officer. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\n___\n\nPROTEST OVER KILLING BY OFFICER BLOCKS STREET\n\nHigh school students blocked a street in Madison, Wisconsin, on Tuesday to protest the death of an unarmed biracial man at the hands of a white police officer last month. Police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to leave the street. At least one person was arrested.\n\nMadison Police Officer Matt Kenny shot 19-year-old Tony Robinson in an apartment house near the Capitol on March 6. Police said Robinson attacked Kenny. Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is weighing whether to file charges against Kenny.\n\n___\n\nOFF-DUTY OFFICER INJURED IN PROTEST\n\nSeveral arrests were reported as demonstrators against police brutality clashed with officers in New York City on Tuesday. Police said an off-duty officer driving home on the Brooklyn Bridge was assaulted by protesters when he got out of his car to investigate. He was hospitalized with injuries to his face and an arm.\n\nLast year, two officers were assaulted on the bridge during a protest over Eric Garner's chokehold death in the New York borough of Staten Island. Seven people were seen on amateur video pushing, kicking and punching the two officers. Five people were later arrested in that assault.\n\nLast December, Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot to death in their squad car in Brooklyn by a man who had made statements on social media suggesting that he planned to kill police officers and was angered about the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown in Missouri.\n\nOrganizers said the Wisconsin and New York protests Tuesday were among 28 being held across the country.\n\nSome New York officers have said they feel under threat as protests continue.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Black officers torn between duty and race\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nJorge \"Jinho\" Ferreira feels the tension between being black and carrying a badge every day as a sheriff's deputy in Alameda County, California.\n\n\"I feel like you have to prove yourself on every level,\" said Ferreira, 39, who patrols about 30 miles east of San Francisco. \"You have to prove yourself to the black community, you have to prove yourself to all of your co-workers, you have to prove yourself to society.\"\n\nWith the nation roiled by two grand juries' recent decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men, some black officers say that as they enforce the law, they also wonder whether the system they're sworn to uphold is stacked against black men.\n\nIn interviews conducted by Associated Press reporters across the nation, retired and active black officers expressed concern about how black men are treated by the largely white police forces in the United States, an issue that has led to protests alleging police brutality. The officers say they want change just as much as anyone else, and advocate for it where they can because they, too, have something to lose.\n\n\"A lot of us have sons, and we want to make sure our colleagues are treating our young boys with dignity and respect,\" said Oakland Police Lt. LeRonne Armstrong, a 16-year veteran.\n\nSince the summertime deaths of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, who gasped \"I can't breathe\" while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in New York, thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest their deaths, the grand juries' decisions - and the nation's police forces.\n\nCaught in the middle are blacks working in law enforcement. There were an estimated 55,267 African-Americans in local police departments and an additional 15,500 in sheriff's departments in 2007, the latest information available from the Justice Department.\n\n\"We're called things like Uncle Toms and traitors to our community, in spite of the fact that we sympathize or we agree with the anger that our community holds, because we feel that same anger,\" said Noel Leader, a retired New York City police sergeant who in 1995 co-founded an advocacy group, 100 Blacks In Law Enforcement Who Care.\n\nBlack officers point out that they contend with many of the same racial issues as black civilians, such as stereotypes, racism on the job and even confrontations with the police. Black plainclothes or undercover police officers have been shot by their white counterparts, as in the 2009 death of NYPD Officer Omar J. Edwards, who was killed while he was chasing a man who had broken into his car.\n\n\"I understand that when I am given directions from the police, I am very cautious and careful to comply with their demands or commands until it could be understood what is really going on,\" said Michael Williams, a 15-year veteran and president of the police union Memphis Police Association. \"We have to take responsibility for our actions, even in the black community, and we can avoid a whole lot of this.\"\n\nKevin A. Minor, a St. Louis County Police recruitment officer and field training officer, remembers being followed around a discount store by a security officer while trying to shop. \"If that's what makes him feel like he's doing his job, oh well,\" Minor said. \"Because I know why I'm there, and I'm going to leave there with what I'm going to buy and that's it.\"\n\nTask forces and commissions around the nation are being formed to study ways to improve relations between police forces and minorities. Three high-ranking House Democrats on Tuesday pressed for congressional hearings on police tactics and race, and President Barack Obama told Black Entertainment Television, in an interview aired Monday, that a variety of factors, from training to subconscious racial fears, have combined to create \"a national problem that's going to require a national solution.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the rage felt by communities that feel persecuted by the police, some of the black officers were not quick to blame race for some of the deadly encounters.\n\n\"I believe that some of these incidents could have been prevented if you comply with the law,\" Williams said. \"If someone says put your hands up, put your hands up.\"\n\nFerreira says he felt inspired to become a law enforcement officer after attending a rally decrying Oscar Grant's shooting death at the hands of a white transit police officer in Oakland 2009. But he also says there often is nothing racial about how officers operate.\n\n\"There are two people involved that decide the outcome: It's the cop and the suspect,\" Ferreira said. \"Both of them contribute to the outcome of the interaction. It's not going to be the color of one's skin.\"\n\nBlack officers say they can help quell some of the hostility between police and the communities they patrol. \"I think law enforcement leaders have to recognize that minority officers can be that bridge to build trust because they understand where the mistrust comes from,\" Armstrong said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jesse J.

      "text": "Lawsuit: Black man fatally shot by DC police posed no threat\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - An unarmed black motorcyclist posed no threat to the District of Columbia police officer who fired two fatal shots from the passenger seat of his police car, the man's parents said in a $50 million wrongful-death lawsuit filed Thursday.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, 31-year-old Terrence Sterling sideswiped a police car \"with minimal force\" before Officer Brian Trainer fatally shot him in the back and neck in the early-morning hours of Sept. 11. Police have said Sterling intentionally rammed the police car with his motorcycle while trying to flee a traffic stop.\n\nSterling was shot twice, according to the lawsuit. The city Medical Examiner's officer had said previously that Sterling died of wounds to the back and neck but did not specify whether he was wounded by one bullet or two.\n\nTrainer was also negligent in failing to activate his body camera, the lawsuit said. City officials have acknowledged that the officer, who has been on administrative leave since the shooting, did not turn on his camera, and the city has since ordered 911 operators to remind officers to activate their cameras.\n\nThe department has not specified the race of the officer, but Jason Downs, the lead attorney for Sterling's family, has said his understanding is the officer is white. Sterling's death prompted protests by activists affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"The killing of unarmed black men by police officers must stop. Mr. Sterling's death was senseless and tragic,\" attorney Hassan Murphy, a partner in the firm representing Sterling's family, said in a statement.\n\nThe Baltimore-based law firm also represented the family of Freddie Gray, a Baltimore man who died after an injury he suffered in a police van. Gray's death last year prompted widespread unrest and some rioting and led to a Justice Department investigation of Baltimore police. The District's police department reformed its use-of-force policies after a 2001 agreement with the Justice Department.\n\nThe complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court on behalf of Sterling's parents, contains few new details about the officers' encounter with Sterling. Downs had said previously that there was no evidence that Sterling posed a threat.\n\nSterling was a heating and air-conditioning technician from Fort Washington, Maryland. It's not clear what he was doing in Washington before he was shot. Police have said the officers were responding to reports of a motorcyclist driving erratically.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Trainer and the officer who drove the police car had a prior encounter with Sterling before the shooting and did not activate their cameras at that time, either. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office released body-camera footage from the other officer that shows only the aftermath of the shooting. The video shows the officers performing CPR on Sterling as he bled heavily onto a sidewalk and a woman screamed in the background.\n\nA police department spokeswoman, Rachel Reid, said the department could not comment on pending litigation. A spokesman for Bowser declined to comment for the same reason.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Video key in ex-officer's stiff sentence for killing\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - The video was viewed millions of times around the world. It was somewhat blurry, recorded from a distance, but it clearly showed an unarmed black man running from a white officer, who shot him five times in the back.\n\nOn Thursday, relatives of that fleeing motorist described the pain of reliving Walter Scott's death each time the cellphone video aired. Over and over, they've watched Scott crumple to the ground, never to rise again.\n\nThey know nothing will bring back Scott, the 50-year-old father who loved football, cartoons and Saturday morning pancake breakfasts with his family. But they also know the images helped bring them solace, in the form of a 20-year federal prison sentence for the man responsible.\n\nWould Michael Slager have received such a stiff sentence without the video?\n\n\"Of course not,\" Chris Stewart, an attorney for Scott's family, said Thursday. \"You can't believe the initial narrative. Investigate.\"\n\nThe officer's first story, the one Scott's family disputed since the April 4, 2015, shooting, was Slager's claim of self-defense. The North Charleston officer said he felt afraid and threatened when Scott grabbed his stun gun and charged at him.\n\nIt's the story Slager first told state police officers when they questioned him several days after the shooting.\n\nThen the video surfaced. The bystander who shot it on his way to work at a barber shop said he was afraid to take it to police after the officer's narrative emerged, and instead shared it with Scott's family. When they released the images publicly, people could see the shooting themselves - and see that Slager was lying, Stewart and prosecutors have said.\n\nThe video doesn't capture the fight between the two men, but it shows Slager shoot Scott from a distance, run back to retrieve his stun gun, and then drop it by the man's lifeless body. He had fired eight shots, hitting Scott five times in the back as he ran from a traffic stop.\n\nThe images set off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans. Many seized on the video as proof of what they had argued for years: White officers too often use deadly force unnecessarily against black people.\n\nSlager, 36, was fired after the video became public, and is one of only a few police officers to go to prison for an on-duty shooting. His sentence is by far the stiffest since shootings of unarmed black men came under scrutiny in recent years.\n\nBefore sentencing, Scott's relatives urged a judge to mete out a significant punishment. Through tears, they also told Slager they felt sorrow for him and the loss his young children would feel in his absence. In the end, U.S. District Judge David Norton ruled it second-degree murder, not manslaughter, and sentenced Slager to 20 years in prison for violating Scott's civil rights.\n\nFor the Scott family, it was the justice they had sought ever since that stranger came to them with the video.\n\n\"I forgive Michael Slager. I forgive you,\" Scott's mother, Judy, said as she turned toward her son's killer. \"I pray for you, that you would repent and let Jesus come in your life.\"\n\nSitting just a few feet away, Slager wiped tears from his eyes and mouthed: \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nSlager's attorneys have continued to reiterate his self-defense claim, saying race didn't play a role and Slager never had any \"racial animus\" toward minorities. But the officer in May pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations, with prosecutors agreeing to drop state murder charges.\n\nSlager apologized to the family, calling Scott's mother and brothers by their names.\n\n\"With my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that,\" Slager said. Of their forgiveness, he added: \"I am very grateful.\"\n\nSlager's emotions stood in stark contrast to his stoic demeanor during his state murder trial when jurors deadlocked over a verdict. He has several weeks to appeal his federal sentence and will be housed at the Charleston County jail until assigned a federal prison.\n\nWhen state jurors failed to reach a verdict, many observers were shocked and distressed, because the video seemed to some to be an open-and-shut case. Some despaired of ever seeing justice.\n\nThe shooting angered local African-Americans who have complained for years that North Charleston police harassed black people, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course.\n\nIf Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison.\n\nConvictions in officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S.; prison time is even rarer.\n\nSouth Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat-belt-violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars.\n\nStewart said he hopes Slager's punishment will give officers around the country pause.\n\n\"Stop and think, or you could end up 20 years behind bars,\" Stewart said. \"People are watching, and people are starting to actually care.\"\n\n___\n\nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

A judge cleared the way for a police disciplinary trial to begin next week for Pantaleo in the death of Garner, after rejecting his claim that a police watchdog agency didn't have jurisdiction to prosecute the case. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The deadly confrontation five summers ago flickers in Gwen Carr's mind, competing for attention with warm, happy memories of her late son Eric Garner's life. For all the smiles and laugher they shared, there are flashes of Garner being grabbed by a New York City police officer and crying out: \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nCarr said she has been reliving what she pointedly calls \"my son's murder\" every day since his July 2014 death : Her first born succumbing to cardiac arrest after a white officer wearing plainclothes, Daniel Pantaleo, restrained her 34-year-old son with what she contends is an illegal chokehold and what Pantaleo's lawyer argues is an approved technique.\n\nA long-delayed internal disciplinary trial that could lead to Pantaleo's firing is slated to begin on Monday. A ruling late last week requires the police watchdog agency bringing the case prove not only that Pantaleo violated department rules, but that his actions fit the criteria for criminal charges. Pantaleo does not actually face criminal charges.\n\n\"It has been five long years,\" Carr told The Associated Press last week. \"Pantaleo and all those other officers who actually murdered my son that day, they are still collecting their salaries. They still go home every day and it's business as usual with them. But with me, we relive this every day.\"\n\nVideo of the struggle on a Staten Island street corner quickly went viral, amplifying Garner's plaintive pleas of \"I can't breathe\" into a rallying cry in the face of police brutality against unarmed black men and women.\n\n\"Very troubling,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time.\n\nPantaleo was placed on desk duty. Investigations were launched. The medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide caused by a police chokehold.\n\nAnd then nothing happened.\n\nA grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo on criminal charges. Facing a July deadline, federal prosecutors don't appear inclined to file civil rights charges, either.\n\nPantaleo has remained on the city payroll, stripped of his gun and badge but pulling in a hefty salary - peaking at more than $120,000 in 2017, according to city payroll records.\n\nThe NYPD argued the federal investigation was holding up Pantaleo's disciplinary case. Last summer, however, the department decided to move forward anyway. It will begin 1,761 days after Garner's death.\n\nPantaleo's administrative trial is open to the public, but space in the court-like room at police headquarters in lower Manhattan is limited. The police department won't allow video, photos or even a sketch artist. The trial is expected to take about two weeks.\n\nThe Civilian Complaint Review Board said it expects to call fewer than 20 witnesses. Stuart London, Pantaleo's attorney, said he'll bring up to 10 people to the stand. They include a retired NYPD training sergeant who London said taught Pantaleo an approved technique known as a \"seat-belt hold\" that is being confused for a chokehold.\n\nThe NYPD's chief surgeon ruled in 2014 that Pantaleo hadn't used a chokehold on Garner, contradicting the medical examiner's findings, London said. London said part of his defense case would focus on attacking the medical examiner's report, which he called a \"political document\" and \"the worst possible autopsy ever done.\"\n\nPantaleo's union, the Police Benevolent Association, has blamed the 350-pound Garner's poor health and resisting arrest for his death. Garner shouted at officers as they approached him, saying: \"Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today. I'm minding my business. Please just leave me alone.\"\n\nGarner, a father of six, had been arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes numerous times and was suspected of doing the same when officers approached him, police said. The man who recorded the video of the confrontation said that wasn't true and that Garner had just broken up a fight between two other men.\n\nGarner, who had asthma, suffered a heart attack in an ambulance and was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nThe city paid Garner's family $5.9 million in 2015 to settle a wrongful death claim. Carr said that money went to Garner's wife, not her.\n\nUse of force complaints against the NYPD have fallen sharply in the years since Garner's death, according to data compiled by the review board. In 2014, there were 2,412. In 2018, there were 1,764, marking a 27% drop. But alleged chokeholds have still been a problem. Last year, the review board reported receiving 133 chokehold complaints. So far in 2019, there have been 39.\n\nThe NYPD hasn't fired an officer for a fatal chokehold since Francis Livoti , who was dismissed from the department and convicted by a federal jury for violating the civil rights of a Bronx man prosecutors say died after Livoti used a choke hold on him in 1994.\n\nA few weeks after Garner's death, 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. A few months after that, officers in Cleveland fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Other confrontations followed between police officers and people of color, sparking tensions, calls for reform and nationwide protests.\n\nCarr, turning to activism as a means of healing from her grief, lobbied for an executive order directing New York's attorney general's office to review cases in which unarmed civilians are killed by police. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed it a year after her son's death. She also wrote about her life and Garner's death in a book, \"This Stops Today,\" published last October.\n\n\"All of this needs to stop,\" Carr said. \"This is very important to me for Eric, but not only for Eric - for the other families, and for the families that we know will be.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak\n\n___\n\nSend news tips, documents and recordings to AP securely and confidentially: https://www.ap.org/tips\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Mostly peaceful protests have followed the shooting.\n\nPolice have said officers who shot Clark \"saw the suspect facing them, advance forward with his arms extended, and holding an object in his hands.\"\n\nCrump was not available for an interview with The Associated Press but said during the March 26 news conference that Clark's death \"is reminiscent of so many police shootings of unarmed black and brown people.\"\n\n\"We will fight for Stephon until we get justice for Stephon,\" he said.\n\nBy taking on police and communities in wrongful death and brutality cases, Crump has become a \"voice for the voiceless,\" according to Sean Walton, a Columbus, Ohio-based attorney who also represents families in lawsuits involving police.\n\n\"Ben Crump has been a pioneer for his ability to generate attention to matters that normally get swept under the rug,\" Walton said. \"We're actually doing what we can to convince local prosecutors to bring charges against police officers.\"\n\nCrump is best known for representing the families of Martin and Brown.\n\nMartin, 17, was shot to death in 2012 in Sanford, Florida, by white neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who was later acquitted of all charges.\n\nBrown, 18, was killed by white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who was cleared of wrongdoing and later resigned.\n\nBoth Martin and Brown were unarmed. Crump said Brown \"was executed in broad daylight.\"\n\nCrump also represents the family of Terence Crutcher, 40, who was shot to death by white Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer Betty Jo Shelby. Police video showed Crutcher, who was unarmed, walking away from officers and toward his SUV with his hands up when he was shot. A jury found Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter.\n\nCrutcher's estate has filed a civil rights lawsuit against Tulsa, Shelby and other police officers.\n\n\"I applaud his tenacity,\" Crutcher's father, the Rev. Joey Crutcher, said of Crump. \"We needed to have a hard-hitting blow from somebody.\"\n\nSome attorneys who take high-profile cases walk a tight line between representing clients and adhering to ethics, according to Michael Downey of the Downey Law Group in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nMost states have rules to ensure lawyers don't do things outside the courtroom that harms the process inside court, said Downey who teaches courses on legal ethics.\n\n\"\"It has certainly become more common for lawyers to be engaged in aggressive behavior,\" he said. \"The vast majority of them are trying to do civil things - trying to increase the recovery by settlement or judgment.\"\n\nA 2016 survey of police officers by the Washington-based Pew Research Center shows a significant number of departments have taken steps to reform policies involving interactions between citizens and police, said Rich Morin, Pew senior editor.\n\n\"We do know police behavior has changed - some good. Some, depending on the interpretation, not so good,\" he said.\n\nMorin said nine out of 10 officers reported being concerned about their safety, but three-quarters were reluctant to use force. About three-quarters of people in a separate survey said interactions with police and black residents have become more tense.\n\n\"Many said police now are less willing to stop and question people who seem suspicious,\" he said. \"On one hand, you can say 'great! Police aren't rousting folks just for sport.' On the other hand, some will say the police are reluctant to do their jobs these days.\"\n\nUnder former President Barack Obama, the Justice Department opened investigations into the slayings of Martin, Brown and Crutcher. However, President Donald Trump's administration has said Clark's death is a local issue.\n\n\"It is a clear signal to the base, which Trump has been careful about, that he is going to take the side of police in these kinds of matters and is not going to criticize them or hold them to great scrutiny,\" said Nicholas Valentino, an associate professor of communication studies and political science at the University of Michigan.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The NRA's Catch-22 for Black Men Shot by Police\n\nA National Rifle Association spokesperson says Botham Jean would still be alive if he'd had a firearm. But when African Americans legally bearing arms are shot by police, the organization's media outlet doesn't defend them.\n\nThe city of Dallas, Texas, has been rocked by news of an off-duty police officer shooting a black man in his own apartment. On September 6, the off-duty police officer Amber Guyger entered Botham Jean's apartment and shot him dead. She has since claimed-after a number of shifting accounts-that she mistakenly thought she was entering her own apartment and believed it was being burglarized.\n\nMost people reacted to the news of the shooting with outrage-regardless of the circumstances, shooting an innocent man dead in his own home is a horrible tragedy. Conservatives such as National Review' s David French have argued that Guyger \"committed a crime by forcing open Jean's door, deliberately took aim, and killed him.\" Commentary 's Sohrab Ahmari observed , \"Even within the four walls of his castle, his home, Jean was not safe from undue police violence.\"\n\nThe National Rifle Association's spokesperson sees the incident a bit differently. Dana Loesch argued that Jean would still be alive had he been armed and shot Guyger instead. \"I don't think there's any context that the actions would have been justified,\" Loesch acknowledged, but asserted that \"this could have been very different if Botham Jean had been, say he was a law-abiding gun owner and he saw somebody coming into his apartment.\" At a time when many conservative writers were expressing empathy for Jean and hoping that justice would be served, Loesch's disciplined adherence to the NRA's bottom line stands out.\n\nDana Loesch and the NRA's maternity theater\n\nLoesch's reaction is an example of what one might call the \"Rice rule,\" after Tamir Rice, the 12-year old killed by a white police officer while playing in a park with a toy gun: There are no circumstances in which the responsibility for a police shooting of an unarmed black person cannot be placed on the victim.\n\nAt the same time, scolding dead people for being unarmed is standard procedure for the NRA, which attacked Clementa Pinckney, the pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church, where nine parishioners were massacred by the white supremacist Dylann Roof, for supporting gun control . The group similarly suggested that shootings at Planned Parenthood ; at Umpqua Community College in Oregon ; in Fresno, California ; and at the Capital Gazette in Maryland were so deadly because the victims weren't armed. The NRA even faulted James Shaw Jr., who prevented a mass shooting at a Waffle House by tackling the shooter, for not being armed while he did it . Ted Nugent, the closest thing the NRA has to a celebrity spokesperson, once called mass-shooting victims \"losers\" who \"get cut down by murderous maniacs like blind sheep to slaughter.\"\n\nBut the NRA's conspicuous lack of outrage after the shootings of Philando Castile, Jason Washington, and Alton Sterling , all black men killed by police while in possession of a firearm, suggests an impossible double standard. When armed black men are shot by the police, the NRA says nothing about the rights of gun owners; when unarmed black men are shot, its spokesperson says they should have been armed. To this day, Loesch defends Castile's shooting as justified -despite the fact that Castile informed the officer he was carrying a firearm. In Washington's case, Loesch said she was \"never going to keyboard quarterback what police are doing.\"\n\nDo African Americans have the right to bear arms?\n\nThere's also a catch-22 here: If Jean had been armed, Guyger would have a much more plausible defense. If innocent unarmed black men like Jean are shot, it's because they lack firearms; if innocent black men who are armed like Castile or Sterling are shot, it's because they had a gun. Heads, you're dead; tails, you're also dead.\n\nYet the NRA did release an ad siding with President Donald Trump against the NFL players protesting police violence. One might ask why the NRA waded into the conflict over the NFL protests at all. The group has long urged citizens to arm themselves against the possibility of government tyranny, only to come down on the side of the state when it kills innocent people who are black. An additional irony is that, historically, the only American population to be forcibly deprived of its weapons was black Americans at the end of Reconstruction, disarmed by racist paramilitary groups.\n\nIn recent years, the NRA has made frequent forays into culture-war disputes that have little to do with gun rights per se. This week, its NRATV hosts attacked a children's program featuring anthropomorphic trains for introducing a train from Kenya. Previously, they argued that undocumented children separated from their parents under the Trump administration are \"better off,\" complained that American men \"are being turned into second-rate women,\" described laws banning anti-gay discrimination as \"slavery,\" called for the imprisonment of people protesting Trump Cabinet officials, dismissed the Women's March as \"anti-American,\" and attacked the media for being insufficiently pro-Trump . None of this has anything to do with gun restrictions. So why is the NRA doing it?\n\nLive-streaming the apocalypse with NRATV\n\nThe answer may have less to do with the defense of gun rights than the sale of firearms. As Josh Sugarmann, the executive director of the Violence Policy Center, told NPR , the NRA is \"a de facto trade association masquerading as a shooting-sports foundation,\" funneling millions of dollars each year to the group and its affiliates. Marketing violent fantasies to its members encourages them to buy firearms. According to the Pew Research Center , three in 10 Americans own a gun, while 29 percent of gun owners own five or more. This is the NRATV's target demographic; given its demonization of Democrats and liberals, it's clear the outlet is uninterested in the 20 percent of Democrats who own firearms.\n\nThe NRA has long nurtured the fantasy of revolutionary violence against a tyrannical government-in 1995 former President George H. W. Bush resigned from the organization after the NRA chief Wayne LaPierre called federal law-enforcement officials jack-booted thugs . During the Barack Obama-era, however, this sort of rhetoric went into overdrive, and gun sales skyrocketed as right-wing figures warned of a need for liberty-minded citizens to prepare themselves for armed struggle against the government. It's no coincidence that this coincided with the election of America's first black president. During Reconstruction, terrorist groups such as the White League promulgated hoaxes about armed blacks seeking to kill white men en masse and rape white women, in order to scare up recruitment and preemptively justify violence against their political rivals. The specter of \"negro rule\" proved a powerful motivator.\n\nWith Obama's departure, the NRA lost its chief gun salesman. Since then, the NRA message machine has gone into overdrive, seizing on culture-war issues that can sell as many guns as having a black president once did. NRA representatives now compare liberals to the terrorist group ISIS , publish fiction warning that Syrian refugees would establish an ISIS branch in the United States , argue that \"minorities\" should be blamed for gun violence , and, in a startlingly on-the-nose echo of Reconstruction-era racist propaganda, warn that if Black Lives Matter isn't stopped whites will face mass rape and murder like white people in South Africa . No wonder former Republican Representative Joe Scarborough observed in February that NRA messaging can \"come close, pretty close to inciting violence.\"\n\nNRATV tells its viewers that they are under assault from liberals , black people , undocumented immigrants , and Muslims , and that they might one day need to kill them-in self defense, of course. Like the president, the NRA has correctly divined that fomenting and exploiting white people's fears and hatreds is an effective sales strategy . If marketing murder fantasies is what it takes to move the product, then so be it. When the answer to any problem has to be \"Buy more guns,\" then absurd logic, such as holding dead people responsible for being shot by police in their own home, is inevitable."

      "text": "Death by Police\n\nMore than 500 people have been shot and killed by officers in America so far this year. We know, because the internet is counting.\n\nUpdated on July 7 at 10:05 a.m. ET\n\nIt wasn't until recently that it became easy to find a number to go with the gruesome reality that black people-and black men in particular-live with every day: the ever-present threat of police violence.\n\nPolice officers fatally shot nearly 1,000 people last year, according to The Washington Post's ongoing count . Halfway through 2016, police have shot and killed 506 more. \"Unarmed black men are seven times more likely than whites to die by police gunfire,\" the Post wrote last year.\n\nAnd though it seems overly clinical to talk about hundreds of civilian deaths as a number; there's power in knowing that number. The Washington Post's impressive tracking work represents the professionalization of an effort that first bubbled up on individual blogs and among smaller advocacy groups .\n\nOf course, this is just one count. The Guardian 's tally is 561 deaths, including 526 shootings. And that discrepancy suggests that as important as these efforts have been, in the absence of a comprehensive federal effort to track such shootings, the full scope of the problem remains unknown.\n\nStill, attempts to track police shootings are meaningful. Coupled with video footage of police violence against black people-grainy, raw, and deeply disturbing in ways that are foreign to many white people but all too familiar to people of color-new technology is forcing Americans to confront life-and-death realities of inequality in the United States.\n\nAnd as technology helps drive a national conversation about race and police violence, much of that conversation is taking place in digital forums: in tweets and in Facebook posts, and in self-published essays. \"It's the incessant threat of daily life,\" the journalist Justin Ellis wrote in an essay in 2014, \"the feeling that at any given moment, in any day at any time, everything I have could get snatched away as I'm going through the motions of being me.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter has organized its movement largely on social media, which is also where videos of police shootings are published and shared. The larger question is what happens now? Heightened awareness of a drumbeat of killings-including two this week-leaves many people feeling angry, exhausted, and powerless. Counting the number of dead and watching videos of them die doesn't prevent it from happening again. In one in five fatal shootings , the names of the police officer responsible is never disclosed. Even when they are, many officers face no consequences .\n\nYet there may be reason for hope. Ethan Zuckerman, the director of the MIT Center for Civic Media and a scholar who has done much thinking and writing about online activism, has written about the importance of monitoring what he calls the equitability of activism in both the digital and physical realms.\n\n\"'Monitoring' sounds passive, but it's not-it's a model for channeling mistrust to hold institutions responsible, whether they're the institutions we've come to mistrust or the new ones we're building today,\" he wrote in a blog post last year. \"When the Black Panthers were founded in Oakland, CA in the late 1960s, they were an organization focused on combatting police brutality. They would follow police patrol cars and when officers got out to make an arrest, the Panthers-armed, openly carrying weapons they were licensed to own-would observe the arrest from a distance, making it clear to officers that they would intervene if they felt the person arresting was being harassed or abused, a practice they called 'Policing the Police.'\"\n\nThis kind of monitorial citizenship, he says, benefits hugely from technology-whether it involves building a dedicated website for counting fatal shootings by police, forming an organization to videotape crime , or leveraging digital networks to share footage of a deadly police confrontation. As Zuckerman puts it in his blog post, \"it allows many people working together to monitor situations that would be hard for any one individual to see.\"\n\n\"The one stance that's not acceptable as far as I'm concerned,\" he added, \"is that of disengagement, of deciding that you're powerless and remaining that way.\""

      "text": "How Much of a Factor Is Race When Cops Kill?\n\nA reader, Charles Black, ventures into fraught territory, and my colleague Conor responds below:\n\nI've become a regular reader over the past several months. I'm looking forward to the new Notes section. And I want to point out some facts about police shootings and crime rates that a couple of your authors seem unaware of.\n\nIn this Atlantic piece from May, the author cites a ProPublica study claiming that blacks are 21 times more likely than whites to be killed by police. That study-\" Deadly Force, In Black and White \"-has been thoroughly discredited in separate work by criminologist Peter Moskos and RealClearPolicy editor Robert VerBruggen . Even criminologist David Klinger, who was consulted by the ProPublica study's authors, has accused them of cherry picking the data and said the study \" needs to be shut down .\"\n\nSo that study should only be referenced to point out how bad it is. But the question remains: Are blacks more likely than whites to be killed by police? When you account for the much higher violent crime rates among blacks, the answer, given the best current evidence, appears to be no.\n\nMoskos , Verbruggen , and Hassert have all done simple analyses that are slightly different, and they tend to show that blacks are killed by police a little less than expected, given their higher rates of violent crime.\n\nCertainly, more sophisticated research could be done and may reveal a more nuanced story. But much of the alarmist rhetoric from activists and much media appears to be unfounded: We may have a police brutality problem, but the police are applying it \"equitably\" in response to crime-so the best evidence suggests.\n\nI don't deny that African Americans continue to be discriminated against in many areas of American society. I even think that the evidence shows that police discriminate against blacks for smaller offenses. But the assertion that blacks are being discriminated against in the application of deadly force by police doesn't have much to stand on at present.\n\nSo to some extent, Conor Friedersdorf is wrong when he writes that \"blacks are disproportionately victimized.\" And obviously if \"the problem of violent crime is longstanding and universally acknowledged,\" as he claims, then media wouldn't repeatedly release articles talking about racial disparities in killings by police, never mentioning the large gap in violent crime rates. Such an omission misleads the public.\n\nI'm guessing this issue is too taboo for The Atlantic to take on directly-even if you are of no party or clique:)  But I would love to see some debate on this issue-perhaps in the new Notes section?\n\nConor's response:\n\nThe reader refers to my claim that black Americans are disproportionately victimized by \"deadly abuses and incompetence.\" He counters that \"blacks are killed by police a little less than expected, given their higher rates of violent crime.\" I don't share his expectations.\n\nIf all abusive or incompetent police killings occurred while officers were responding to violent crimes or arresting violent criminals his intuition would make more sense. But many police killings have little if anything to do with violent crimes--and this is even more true of abusive or incompetent police killings, which I focus on in my work and are the subject of my claim. Think of all the violent crimes that take place without any police intervention. Now think of all the mentally ill people who are killed by the police and every officer-involved killing you've seen or read about that began during a routine traffic stop when the only crime was a minor infraction. What have those killings to do with the racial breakdown of violent criminals? And yet the reader doesn't adjust for them.\n\nIt's telling, in my view, that racial disparities in police killings seem to exist not just for the total number people killed, but also the subcategory of unarmed people killed by police. Consider 2015. The Washington Post reports that police have killed 60 unarmed people so far this year--and that 40 percent of them were black men, \" even though they make up just 6 percent of the U.S. population... black men were seven times more likely than white men to die by police gunfire while unarmed.\"\n\nNot all shootings of unarmed people are unjustified.\n\nStill, it would seem difficult to explain away the fact that unarmed black men are killed at 7 times the rate of unarmed white men by pointing to higher violent crime rates. And the difficulty is underscored by recalling specific cases. Freddie Gray was not a violent criminal. He was stopped illegally by Baltimore police. And he was killed while handcuffed and in custody, not in a violent altercation. Officer Michael Slager shot an unarmed black motorist in the back as he ran away during a routine traffic stop for a non-functioning brake light. Tamir Rice, a black child in a park with a toy gun, was killed the instant police arrived on the scene. Eric Garner was killed in a choke-hold after being caught selling loose cigarettes. Ray Tensing is facing murder charges for shooting an unarmed black motorist during a traffic stop. Those black individuals shouldn't have been more likely to be killed by police while unarmed because other black individuals are committing violent crimes-- they had a Constitutional right and moral claim to be treated as individuals.\n\nWhat would it take for me to peg my expectations about police killings to the violent crime rates of different racial groups? Persuasive evidence that the violent criminals and the people that police officers kill are the same people. As best I can tell, assuming that sameness is unfounded.\n\nYour thoughts? Email hello@theatlantic.com , especially if you have empirical data to point to."

      "text": "The Shooting of an Unarmed Black Man in Oklahoma\n\nDashboard camera footage shows Terence Crutcher had his hands in the air when he was fatally shot by police last week.\n\nNEWS BRIEF Footage released Monday by Tulsa police shows 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was unarmed and held his hands in the air when he was fatally shot by officers last week.\n\nPolice released the footage Monday. It can be found here and may be disturbing to some viewers.\n\n\"The video is very disturbing, it's very difficult to watch,\" Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan said in a press conference Monday before the video's release. \"We will do the right thing-we will not cover anything up.\"\n\nThe footage comes from the dashboard camera of a police car that responded to a report of a stalled SUV in the middle of the road in Tulsa. The video shows the car arriving at the scene, where another police car is stopped behind the disabled SUV. Crutcher can be seen walking away from the cop cars and toward the driver's side of his car, with his hands raised over his head. One police officer follows him, her gun pointed at his back. Three officers join her, obscuring the camera's view of Crutcher. Crutcher then collapses to the ground. One of the officers' voices can be heard saying, \"Shots fired.\"\n\nThe department identified two officers involved in the shooting, according to the Associated Press. The first, Tyler Turnbough, was said to have fired a stun gun at Crutcher. The second, Betty Shelby, fired the shot that killed him. Shelby, who has served as an officer in Tulsa since 2011, was placed on paid leave.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Jeanne MacKenzie said Saturday that Crutcher refused the officers' commands to put his hands up. Members of Crutcher's family, who saw the video before to it was released to the public, said the footage contradicts that claim.\n\n\"We saw that Terence did not have any weapon. Terence did not make any sudden movements. We saw that Terence was not being belligerent,\" Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for Crutcher's family, said in a press conference Monday.\n\nSoloman-Simmons said the video also raises questions about when Crutcher died. Police said he died Friday night in a hospital after the shooting.\n\nMacKenzie said the county would investigate whether Crutcher's civil rights had been violated and if criminal charges should be brought against the officers responsible, assuring that \"we will achieve justice in this case.\"\n\nDanny Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma, said the Department of Justice would conduct a separate civil-rights investigation.\n\nThis incident is the latest in a number of officer-involved shootings of unarmed black men in the United States this year. According to a database of officer-involved deaths maintained by The Guardian , Crutcher is one of 32 unarmed black men to be killed by police in the United States this year."

      "text": "Police Brutality Leads to Thousands Fewer Calls to 911\n\nIt might be making neighborhoods less safe.\n\nBlack Americans are less likely to dial 911 immediately following, and for more than a year after the highly publicized assault or death of a black person at the hands of police. That's the conclusion in \"Police Violence and Citizen Crime Reporting in the Black Community,\" a study to be published in October's American Sociological Review , the official publication of the American Sociological Association.\n\nThree sociologists-Matthew Desmond at Harvard, Andrew Papachristos at Yale, and David Kirk at Oxford-screened and analyzed over 1.1 million 911 calls made to Milwaukee's emergency dispatch between March 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010. They isolated and further analyzed some 883,000 calls in which a crime was reported within city limits in black, Latino, and white neighborhoods where at least 65 percent of residents fit the race category, per 2000 Census data. They chose those dates in order to study what, if any, impact the brutal beating of Frank Jude by several police officers might have had on residents dialing 911 for help. The effect they found was significant.\n\n\"Police misconduct can powerfully suppress one of the most basic forms of civic engagement: calling 911 for matters of personal and public safety,\" the authors wrote in the study. The author's conclusions may also shed some light on the controversial \"Ferguson effect,\" that is, the idea that a rise in crime follows a high-profile incident of police brutality.\n\nThe study makes for a grim chronicle. On October 23, 2004, Jude and a black male friend arrived at a private party in a white middle-class neighborhood as guests of two white women college students. Shortly after arriving, the four headed to their vehicle, but it was soon surrounded by at least 10 men.\n\nThe men  accused Jude and his friend of stealing Andrew Spengler's police badge, and all four were pulled from their truck. Jude's male friend had \"his face slit with a knife\" and escaped, according to the authors. Jude suffered blows to his face and torso; his arms were pinned behind his back; he was kicked in the head; an officer stomped on his face \"until he heard bones breaking;\" he was picked up and kicked in the groin so hard \"his feet left the ground;\" he had a pen inserted deep into his ear canals; his fingers were \"bent back\" until \"they snapped;\" before finally being left naked from the waist down on the sidewalk in a pool of his own blood.\n\nJude's story would not become public until months later when the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published a report on the incident on February 6, 2005, and recounted the police cover-up that had followed. Black residents protested almost immediately, demanding action from the district attorney. A month later, nine officers were dismissed. Spengler and two others were tried and acquitted by an all-white jury. Protests ensued again. A federal investigation led to the conviction of seven of the officers involved.\n\n\"Once the story of Frank Jude's beating appeared in the press, Milwaukee residents, especially people in black neighborhoods, were less likely to call the police, including to report violent crime,\" David Kirk, one of the authors of the report, said in a statement. \"This means that publicized cases of police violence can have a communitywide impact on crime reporting that transcends individual encounters.\"\n\nA total of 22,200 fewer calls were made to 911 during the year following Jude's beating, according to the researchers, with over half of that loss (56 percent) happening in black neighborhoods. The authors of the study see the significant decline as worrisome given how heavily police work depends on resident-initiated interactions, such as calling the emergency line. \"Police work of every kind relies on citizen participation, especially reports of law breaking ... If police misconduct lowers crime reporting throughout black communities, it directly threatens public safety within those communities, many of which already have high levels of crime,\" the authors concluded in the article.\n\nTo test their theory that police brutality makes black Americans less likely to contact police, the authors also analyzed the impact of other highly publicized incidents of violence against black men by law enforcement, including two that happened outside of Milwaukee. They looked at the killing of Sean Bell in Queens, New York in 2006, the assault of Danyall Simpson in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 2007, and the killing of Oscar Grant in Oakland, California in 2009. Of these three, only the latter did not trigger a drop in calls to 911. The data again led to the conclusion that \"other local and national cases of police violence against unarmed black men also had an impact on crime reporting in Milwaukee.\"\n\nBut since suspicion and mistrust of police among black Americans are not new issues,  what do we really learn from the study? A few things.\n\nFirst, the study established a direct link between police misconduct and the decrease in residents' participation in ensuring their own safety. \"It is one thing to disparage law enforcement in your thoughts and speech after an instance of police violence or corruption makes the news. It is quite another to witness a crime, or even to be victimized, and refuse to report it,\" the authors wrote. \"The events of that October morning affected not only Frank Jude and his family but Black Milwaukee as a whole.\"\n\nThe whole-neighborhood effect that led to many people choosing not to call 911 reflects the idea that police lose authority and legitimacy as citizens associate their actions with lawlessness and violence.\n\nSecond, MPD 's ability to do their jobs was severely curtailed due to losing over 20,000 emergency calls that could have resulted in the  prevention of serious crimes. \"[B]y driving down 911 calls-thwart the suppression of law breaking, obstruct the application of justice, and ultimately make cities as a whole, and the black community in particular, less safe,\" the researchers summarized.\n\nIn the six months after Jude's story was published-March through August 2005-87 homicides took place in Milwaukee, adding up to a 32 percent increase in homicides relative to the same six-month period in 2004 and 2006, according to a release from ASA. \"In fact, March through August 2005 was the deadliest spring/summer in the seven years that the researchers examined,\" the authors said in a statement.\n\nThird, although the death of a resident at the hands of police elicited the biggest drops in 911 calls from black neighborhoods, a death was not always necessary to register a significant drop in such calls. Danyall Simpson's non-fatal assault set off a drop in calls immediately after it was reported in the local media. The study's authors offered some insights into the significance of this:\n\nThis indicates that high-profile cases of excessive police force constitute a severe breach in the social contract that exists between citizens and the criminal justice system. That breach is so sudden and violent when unarmed black men are beaten or killed that virtually no institutional response, from public apologies to sanctioning offending officers, can swiftly repair it.\n\nFourth, \"the Jude effect\"-as the authors have labelled the drop in calls to 911 they documented-appears to be most pronounced in black neighborhoods. Though they also examined neighborhoods that were majority-white and majority-Latino, the researchers determined that they would not expect to see equally significant drops in 911 calls in those neighborhoods because the underlying historic factors are not the same as in black neighborhoods. These factors include: \"a centuries-old tradition of state-sanctioned assaults on the black body\"; blacks collectively perceiving \"an assault of a black man by white police officers as an assault on the black community writ large\"; and the acute segregation in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Police departments and city politicians often frame a publicized case of police violence as an 'isolated incident,'\" Papachristos said in a statement. He also said that \"no act of police violence is an isolated incident, in both cause and consequence. Seemingly isolated incidents of police violence are layered upon a history of unequal policing in cities.\""

      "text": "A Legal Twist in the Ezell Ford Case\n\nTwo LAPD officers-one white and the other Hispanic-who fatally shot the unarmed black man in 2014 filed a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the police department.\n\nNEWS BRIEF Two LAPD officers who fatally shot an unarmed black man in 2014 filed a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the police department Thursday, alleging their careers were curtailed because of their race and the race of the shooting victim.\n\nOfficers Antonio Villegas and Sharlton Wampler claim their role in the shooting death of Ezell Ford two years ago led to unwarranted discrimination against them from other LAPD officers. Villegas is Hispanic; Wampler is white.\n\nAmong their complaints are the loss of career advancement opportunities, denial of overtime and other benefits, and their continued assignment to desk duty during the investigations into Ford's death.\n\nThe two officers rose to prominence after they killed Ford during an altercation on August 11, 2014, two days after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown's death sparked nationwide protests over police killings of unarmed black men and women, overshadowing Ford's story in the national media. Ford's death sparked large local protests in the Los Angeles area nonetheless.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times has more :\n\nWampler and Villegas were members of an anti-gang unit patrolling the LAPD's Newton Division when they encountered Ford walking outside. Wampler stated that he was attacked by Ford, who tried to grab his firearm, according to the lawsuit. Villegas fired two shots at Ford, and Wampler used a secondary gun to shoot Ford in the back.\n\nLAPD Chief Charlie Beck concluded that Wampler and Villegas acted within department policy. Investigators found evidence backing Wampler's assertions that he had been in a fight for his life as he and Ford wrestled for the officer's gun. They identified Ford's DNA on the weapon, and scratches on the holster and hands of the officer and Ford.\n\nBut in June 2015, the Police Commission, the civilian panel that oversees the LAPD, rejected Beck's finding and determined that Wampler violated the department's deadly force policy. The commissioners concluded that Wampler did not have an adequate reason for stopping Ford in the first place. His handling of the encounter, they decided, was so flawed that it led to the fatal confrontation.\n\nThe panel disapproved only of Villegas' initial decision to draw his weapon early on in the confrontation, but said he ultimately was right to fire at Ford to protect Wampler.\n\nDespite no official finding of misconduct by the commission, both officers could still face criminal charges from the L.A. County district attorney's office for their roles in Ford's death."

      "text": "Inner-City Violence in the Age of Mass Incarceration\n\nHarsh criminal-justice policies have thrown America's poorest urban communities into chaos.\n\nOver the summer, media outlets across the country fixated on the mounting death toll of young people in inner cities across America. \"11 shot, including 3-year-old boy, as Chicago gun violence worsens,\" read the large headline of one major U.S. newspaper , while another, the Chicago Tribune , published a painfully graphic photo essay that chronicled the degree to which gun violence in particular had shocked and destabilized entire neighborhoods in 2014.\n\nThis fall, television reporters still stand nightly outside of dimly-lit apartment buildings and row houses, telling yet more stories of children felled by bullets and showing new heartbreaking scenes of mothers wracked by sobs. And yet, other headlines suggest that this nation is far safer and much less violent than it used to be. They note that gun violence has plummeted a startling 49 percent since 1993 and, aside from some brief spikes and dips in the last few years, most policymakers seem to feel quite good about America's overall crime rate, which is also at a noticeable low.\n\nWhy is it then that some American neighborhoods, from the south side of Chicago to the north side of Philadelphia to all sides of Detroit , still endure so much collective distress? Might there be something about these particular neighborhoods, pundits wonder, that make them more prone to violence?\n\nAccording to one well-respected scholar , \"high rates of black crime\" continue to exist despite declining crime rates nationally because African Americans live in highly segregated and deeply impoverished neighborhoods. Not only does his work suggest that both segregation and poverty breed violence but, more disturbingly, that the ways in which poor blacks decide collectively and individually to protect themselves seems only to \"fuel the violence,\" and gives it \"a self-perpetuating character.\"\n\nSegregation and poverty are indeed serious problems today, and too many of America's poorest all-black and all-brown communities also suffer a level of violence that, if one disregards the horrific killing sprees in places like Columbine , Seattle , or Sandy Hook , is largely unknown in whiter, more affluent neighborhoods. Whereas the violent crime rate in the mostly black city of Detroit was 21.23 per 1,000 (15,011 violent crimes) in 2012, that same year the virtually all-white city of Grosse Point, Michigan nearby reported a rate of only 1.12 per 1,000 (6 violent crimes).\n\nNotwithstanding such seemingly damning statistics, though, we have all seriously misunderstood the origins of the almost-paralyzing violence that our most racially-segregated communities now experience and, as troublingly, we have seriously mischaracterized the nature of so much of the violence that the residents of these communities suffer.\n\nTo start, locating today's concentrated levels of gun violence in hyper-segregation and highly concentrated poverty is quite ahistorical. As any careful look at the past makes clear, neither of these social ills is new and, therefore, neither can adequately explain why it is only recently that so many children of color are being shot or killed in their own communities.\n\nIndeed, throughout the twentieth century, racially-segregated communities have been the norm . Everything from restrictive covenants to discriminatory federal housing policies ensured that throughout the postwar period, neighborhoods in cities such as Detroit or Chicago would be either all white or all non-white and, until now, none of these segregated spaces experienced sustained rates of violence so completely out of step with national trends.\n\nTo suggest, as both scholars and the media have, that the violence experienced by all-black or all-brown neighborhoods today stems in large part from their residential isolation is problematic for other reasons as well. It leads some to suspect that if people of color simply spent more time with white people, lived next to them, and went to school with them, they would be less violent-they would perhaps learn better ways to resolve disputes and deal with stress and anger. Again, though, history belies this logic.\n\nWhite Americans also have a long history of violence-not only when asked to share residential space with African Americans or even to treat them as equals in schools or on the job, but also when nary a person of color is near. From the lynching of blacks in the Jim Crow era to the crimes committed against African Americans every time they tried to move onto a white block after World War I and World War II, ugly incidents of white violence were both regular and unremarkable. Even among those who look just like them, whites historically have engaged in a variety of violent behaviors that would make many shudder-from their propensity to engage in brutal duels and to \"eye gouge\" their fellow whites in the decades before the Civil War, to their involvement in mass shootings in more recent years.\n\nJust as hyper-segregation doesn't explain the violence that so many have to endure today in America's inner city communities while still raising children, attending church, and trying to make ends meet, neither does highly-concentrated poverty. Because of their exclusion from virtually every program and policy that helped eventually to build an American middle class, non-whites have always had far less wealth than whites. From the ability to maintain land ownership after the Civil War, to the virtual guarantee of welfare benefits such as Social Security and FHA loans during the New Deal , to preferential access to employment and housing in the postwar period, white communities have always had considerably more economic advantage than communities of color. And yet, no matter how poor they were, America's most impoverished communities have never been plagued by the level of violence they are today.\n\nBut if neither racial segregation nor the racial poverty gap can account for the degree to which poor communities of color are traumatized today, then what does? What is altogether new is the extent to which these communities are devastated by the working of our nation's criminal justice system in general and by mass incarceration in particular.\n\nToday's rates of incarceration in America's poorest, blackest, and brownest neighborhoods are historically unprecedented . By 2001, one in six black men had been incarcerated and, by the close of 2013, black and Latino inmates comprised almost 60 percent of the nation's federal and state prison population. The numbers of incarcerated black women are also stark.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , young black women ages 18 to 19 were almost five times more likely to be imprisoned than white women of the same age in 2010.\n\nWhen President Lyndon B. Johnson passed the Law Enforcement Assistance Act in 1965-legislation which, in turn, made possible the most aggressive war on crime this nation ever waged-he was reacting not to remarkable crime rates but to the civil rights upheaval that had erupted nationwide just the year before. This activism, he and other politicians believed, represented not participatory democracy in action, but instead a criminal element that would only grow more dangerous if not checked.\n\nNotably, the national policy embrace of targeted and more aggressive policing as well as highly punitive laws and sentences-the so-called \"War on Crime\" that led eventually to such catastrophic rates of imprisonment- predated the remarkable levels of violence that now impact poor communities of color so disproportionately.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. homicide rate in 1965 was significantly lower than it had been in several previous moments in American history: 5.5 per 100,000 U.S. residents as compared, for example, with 9.7 per 100,000 in 1933. Importantly, though, whereas the violent crime rate was 200.2 per 100,000 U.S. residents in 1965, it more than tripled to a horrifying 684.6 per 100,000 by 1995. Though mass incarceration did not originate in extraordinarily high rates of violence, mass incarceration created the conditions in which violence would surely fester.\n\nThe quadrupling of the incarceration rate in America since 1970 has had devastating collateral consequences . Already economically-fragile communities sank into depths of poverty unknown for generations, simply because anyone with a criminal record is forever \"marked\" as dangerous and thus rendered all but permanently unemployable. Also, with blacks incarcerated at six times and Latinos at three times the rate of whites by 2010, millions of children living in communities of color have effectively been orphaned .  Worse yet, these kids often experience high rates of post-traumatic shock from having witnessed the often-brutal arrests of their parents and having been suddenly ripped from them.\n\nDe-industrialization and suburbanization surely did their part to erode our nation's black and brown neighborhoods, but staggering rates of incarceration is what literally emptied them out . As this Pew Center of the States graphic on Detroit shows, the overwhelmingly-black east side of the Motor City has been ravaged by the effects of targeted policing and mass incarceration in recent years with one in twenty-two adults there under some form of correctional control. In some neighborhoods, the rate is as high as one in 16.\n\nSuch concentrated levels of imprisonment have torn at the social fabric of inner city neighborhoods in ways that even people who live there find hard to comprehend, let alone outsiders. As the research of criminologist Todd Clear makes clear, extraordinary levels of incarceration create the conditions for extraordinary levels of violence. But even mass incarceration does not, in itself, explain the particularly brutal nature of the violence that erupts today in, for example, the south side of Chicago. To explain that, we must look again carefully and critically at our nation's criminal justice system.\n\nThe level of gun violence in today's inner cities is the direct product of our criminal-justice policies-specifically, the decision to wage a brutal War on Drugs. When federal and state politicians such as New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller opted to criminalize addiction by passing unprecedentedly punitive possession laws rather than to treat it as a public health crisis, unwittingly or not, a high level of violence in poor communities of color was not only assured but was guaranteed to be particularly ugly. This new drug war created a brand-new market for illegal drugs-an underground marketplace that would be inherently dangerous and would necessarily be regulated by both guns and violence.\n\nIndeed, without the War on Drugs, the level of gun violence that plagues so many poor inner-city neighborhoods today simply would not exist. The last time we saw so much violence from the use of firearms was, notably, during Prohibition. \"[As] underground profit margins surged, gang rivalries emerged, and criminal activity mounted [during Prohibition],\" writes historian Abigail Perkiss , \"the homicide rate across the nation rose 78 percent...[and] in Chicago alone, there were more than 400 gang-related murders a year.\"\n\nAs important as it is to rethink the origins of the violence that poor inner city residents still endure, we must also be careful even when using the term \"violence,\" particularly when seeking to explain \"what seems to be wrong\" with America's most disadvantaged communities. A level of state violence is also employed daily in these communities that rarely gets mentioned and yet it is as brutal, and perhaps even more devastating, than the violence that is so often experienced as a result of the informal economy in now-illegal drugs.\n\nThis is a violence that comes in the form of police harassment, surveillance, profiling, and even killings-the ugly realities of how law enforcement wages America's War on Drugs. Today, young black men today are 21 times more likely than their white peers to be killed by the police and, according to a recent ProPublica report , black children have fared just as badly. Since 1980, a full 67 percent of the 151 teenagers and 66 percent of the 41 kids under 14 who have been killed by police were African American. Between 2010 and 2012 alone, police officers shot and killed fifteen teens running away from them; all but one of them black.\n\nThis is the violence that undergirded the 4.4 million stop-and-frisks in New York City between 2004 and 2014. This is the violence that led to the deaths of black men and boys such as Kimani Gray, Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell, Oscar Grant, and Michael Brown. This is the violence that led to the deaths of black women and girls such as Rekia Boyd, Yvette Smith, and 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones . And this is the violence that has touched off months of protests in Ferguson, Missouri just as it also touched off nearly a decade of urban rebellions after 1964.\n\nA close look at the violence that today haunts America's most impoverished and most segregated cities, in fact, fundamentally challenges conventional assumptions about perpetrators and victims. America's black and brown people not only don't have a monopoly on violence, but, in fact, a great deal of the violence being waged in their communities is perpetrated by those who are at least officially charged with protecting, not harming, them. As residents of Ferguson well know, for example, in the same month that Michael Brown was shot to death by a police officer, four other unarmed black men were also killed by members of law enforcement.\n\nIndeed, the true origins of today's high rates of violence in America's most highly segregated, most deeply impoverished, and blackest and brownest neighborhoods-whoever perpetrates it-are located well outside of these same communities. Simply put, America's poorest people of color had no seat the policy table where mass incarceration was made. But though they did not create the policies that led to so much community and state violence in inner cities today, they nevertheless now suffer from them in unimaginable ways."

      "text": "Black-on-Black Racism: The Hazards of Implicit Bias\n\nHow the politics of respectability twists society\n\nIn his year-end press conference, President Obama was asked about the state of black America . He responded by saying blacks are \"better off than they were,\" but juxtaposed that with the lingering issues evinced in the recent tragic police encounters with unarmed black men. Interestingly, he took particular care in calling out the \"hidden biases that we all carry around,\" a sentiment he echoed in another recent interview .\n\nMy own hidden biases punched me in the gut last week, as I stared in disbelief at a test result on my computer screen. Before I started the racial-bias assessment, a disclaimer explicitly warned me that those who are not prepared to receive uncomfortable news should not proceed. I was too intrigued to turn back, but it turns out I was unprepared for the outcome.\n\nAccording to the Implicit Association Test , I have a \"strong automatic preference for European Americans compared to African Americans.\" That's a sterile way of saying that I'm biased against black people. For most people, such a designation would probably be unsettling. After all, the United States is a nation that ostensibly aspires not to judge others \"by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\" But for me, it caused a mini-existential crisis.\n\nWhy? Because I'm black.\n\nAs I read the results, I thought about what it means to be black and biased against other black people. Does it mean harboring a subconscious contempt for my race? Or considering myself to be part of the blessed segment of an otherwise unfortunate lot? Is it even possible for a black person to be racist against black people? In a moment of self-dramatization, I felt as if Kanye had just announced on national television that I didn't care about black people.\n\nThen, the tropes saturated my thoughts. I wondered if my bias was the undergirding of the sort of intra-race prejudice colloquially expressed in phrases like \"Uncle Tom,\" \"crab in a barrel,\" and \"acting white.\" Since my results were the same as the 88 percent of white Americans who show a bias in favor of white people, it seems to me that this demonstrated \"strong preference\" is the very definition of acting white-a well-worn pejorative that pained me as an awkward adolescent and suddenly felt fresh again.\n\nThe Project Implicit test has been around for a few years, but a recent Mother Jones article titled, \" The Science of Why Cops Shoot Young Black Men \" gave it wider currency and helped explain the role of implicit bias in the recent events in Ferguson, Cleveland, and Staten Island, where the aggressive policing of black people turned deadly. The IAT measures the ability to quickly and correctly sort selected words as positive and negative and to distinguish faces as belonging to a white or black person. Through a series of paired word and face sequences, the test detects in milliseconds the time it takes the respondent to associate black faces with positive and negative words relative to the time it takes to match white faces. When a respondent pairs black faces and negative words more quickly than other pairings, it reveals implicit bias.\n\nAs difficult as it was to learn about my black-on-black bias, such results are fairly common. This is sadly comforting. The data reveal that black respondents' implicit biases are split just about evenly between pro-white and pro-black. Other research has also shown that black participants tend to have a strong pro-black explicit bias. A conflict emerges: When blacks are asked about their predilections, they express a solid preference for their group over whites, but, in general, performance on the IAT suggests they subconsciously hold a slight preference for whites over blacks.\n\nThis dynamic is obviously a direct result of racism. Too often, racism is seen as a social phenomenon that happens to black people. But it happens through black people as well. That is, the negative associations thrust upon black people and black culture can color how we black people view each other. Blacks and whites receive the same narratives and images that perpetuate stereotypes of black criminality and flippancy while synonymizing white culture with American values. It is to be expected that there will be an observable impact on black intragroup perceptions.\n\nThe construct of racism is efficiently designed to politically and socially subjugate a segment of the population. For the oppressed, a natural response is to advocate for conformity with the dominant culture as an appeal for equal treatment. If black people were only more respectable, one line of argument runs, they would be less subject to the ills of racism.\n\nThe contrast between black respondents' explicit and implicit biases is a fingerprint of the politics of respectability, a term coined by Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham in her book In Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880-1920 . In her conception, the politics of respectability involves the \"reform of individual behavior as a goal in itself and as a strategy for reform.\" Higginbotham argued that black Baptist women \"rejected white America's depiction of black women as immoral, childlike, and unworthy of respect of protection\" by teaching blacks to mind their manners, dress and speak appropriately, and remain free from sexual and other vices. Thus, the politics of respectability say that if black people behaved more like the proffered white ideal, the result would be equal treatment and the demise of racial discrimination. This tactic was a form of political protest based on an appeal to white humanity, but it has had troublesome side effects.\n\nThis thread has persisted in black scholarship and society for decades. From W.E.B. DuBois' Talented Tenth in 1903 to Bill Cosby's infamous Pound-Cake Speech a hundred years later, the politics of respectability has often taken on the quality of black theology. Members of the black community are told that wearing the mask, playing the game, and being twice as good are the keys to making it in America. It's as if to say, \"If we only knew how to act, racism would just fall away.\" This is, of course, absurd. Good behavior and attire deemed proper do not abrogate racism. Discrimination does not come with a dress code.\n\nThe politics of respectability is really a coping mechanism. It affirms the inferiority and unattractiveness of black culture. And it contributes to the formation of implicit biases that lead black people to prefer white people over their own.\n\nBut it's not the only option. Unable to live with my \"strong automatic preference,\" I took the test a few more times. Through repeated attempts, I trained myself to react evenly to the black, white, positive, and negative pairings. In a sense, through acknowledgement of the bias and a concerted effort to modify my behavior, I suppressed the implicit bias. By my fourth and final attempt, I exhibited no preference at all. If each of us is willing to recognize our implicit biases and police our actions accordingly, there may be hope for the racial aspect of the American experiment after all."

      "text": "Death by Police, Cont'd\n\nMy colleague Adrienne wrote a post last week about the efforts of various online groups and publications-namely The Washington Post and The Guardian -to create a running tally of the number of Americans killed by police officers. Her post begins:\n\nIt wasn't until recently that it became easy to find a number to go with the gruesome reality that black people-and black men in particular-live with every day: the ever-present threat of police violence. Police officers fatally shot nearly 1,000 people last year, according to The Washington Post's ongoing count . Halfway through 2016, police have shot and killed 506 more. \"Unarmed black men are seven times more likely than whites to die by police gunfire,\" the Post wrote last year.\n\nBelow is a lengthy reader dissent from Nick Selby, a Texas police detective and lead author of the new book In Context: Understanding Police Killings of Unarmed Civilians . Adrienne gave the go-ahead to post Selby's response:\n\nWith respect to Adrienne LaFrance's \"Death by Police ,\" there are some serious structural problems with the data on which she bases much of her analysis. I don't for one second believe she is intentionally manipulative, but I do want to point out, as with most things in law enforcement (the one place where Occam's Razor does not apply), these numbers are not as straightforward as they might appear.\n\nSome of the contextual issues from the piece that should be clarified are around The Washington Post 's numbers, because in the way they are quoted by Ms. LaFrance, they only tell half the story. It is undoubtedly true that newspaper's Fatal Force study showed that, by the end of 2015, U.S. police had fatally shot 986 people (it was later raised to a total of 990 ). That number sounds truly terrible given Ms. LaFrance's apparent inference that the 990 people were innocently going about their day when the police killed them. That is, of course, not the case. Yet Ms. LaFrance implies that it is. \"In one in five fatal shootings,\" she writes, \"the names of the police officer responsible is never disclosed. Even when they are, many officers face no consequences.\"\n\nAs a police detective who has intensely studied this issue, the underlying datasets, and media efforts to count them, I must point out that the implication of that passage is based, at best, on a lack of understanding of the numbers. As my co-authors and I wrote in our book , that passage fails \"to differentiate killings by police who are behaving badly from those in which cops were doing what we want them to do-that is, standing between civilians in danger of losing their lives and those who would take their lives from them.\" I think that to tell readers of The Atlantic , who want to better understand the truly important questions about how Americans-especially non-white Americans-are being policed, it's not helpful to imply (even unintentionally) that all police shootings are unjustified. We as citizens should not be as interested in police using appropriate force as we are in their inappropriate use of deadly force.\n\nIn an interview on this topic with David Krajicek of The Crime Report , I said:\n\nWhen Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez opened fire on military personnel at a Chattanooga recruiting station, you'd have been hard pressed to find an average citizen who didn't agree that police acting to stop that deadly threat were justified. I'm not interested in looking at that case. What I am (and I think all of us are) interested in is a case like that of Walter Scott , where you'd be hard-pressed to find a reasonable person who thought that officer was justified. I wanted to know how many Walter Scotts are there vs. Muhammad Abdulazeezes.\n\nHow do I know The Washington Post numbers did not refer to unjustified killings? Well, because they told us. It is a very important and often missing fact in discussions about this matter, but the fact remains-as Peter Moskos and I wrote in The Washington Post -that most police shootings are justified.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I don't blame Ms. LaFrance for missing this, because The Washington Post didn't say this loudly. In fact, their analysis of this was fairly well hidden in the tenth paragraph of an article. In fact, it was so well hidden that my own Post editor couldn't find the reference until I gave him the specific URL -but there it is:\n\n[74 percent of those fatally shot by the police in 2015] had already fired shots, brandished a gun or attacked a person with a weapon or their bare hands... These 595 cases include fatal shootings that followed a wide range of violent crimes, including shootouts, stabbings, hostage situations, carjackings and assaults... Another 16 percent of the shootings came after incidents that did not involve firearms or active attacks but featured other potentially dangerous threats. These shootings were most commonly of individuals who brandished knives and refused to drop them.\n\nSo with their own analysis, The Washington Post has taken us from an image of police run amok and shooting black men to one in which, on its face, looks as if five percent of police shootings from last year look \"bad.\" Nine in ten people killed by police, according to the newspaper, were in fact justified killings of criminals in the midst of fatal or potentially fatal attacks. Our research independently confirms this.\n\nWhat is more, The Washington Post leaves out what we estimate to be 46 percent of unarmed people who died after an encounter with police-whom the police DID NOT SHOOT. Focusing on shootings limits the true scope of the concern.\n\n***\n\nAre Black People More Likely To Be Shot Dead by Police?\n\nAnother statement by The Washington Post quoted in \"Death By Police\" is the statement that unarmed black men are \"seven times more likely to die\" at the hands of police than are white men. This statement has been repeated by many well-intentioned journalists and it is, sadly, not just intensely misleading but demonstrably incorrect. I believe The Washington Post didn't intend to be misleading; I believe they believe the number to be accurate. It's just that the Post reporters have leaped to some rather sophomoric statistical conclusions.\n\nThe figure was arrived at through an attempt to control for the population disparity in the United States between black and white people [1] : While the raw number of white people shot dead by the police is higher than the raw number of black people, remember that black people only comprise about 13 percent, and black males only 6 percent, of Americans. The reporters (after the release of a report by ProPublica , written by reporters I happen to know were warned by scholars before publication that their numbers were inaccurate and misleading) sought to adjust the numbers to represent a count. For some reason they settled on the unorthodox \"X-per-million\" designation as opposed to most rate calculations which are given as \"X-per-100,000.\"\n\nThe mistake here, of course, is that by leaving out the context of what the decedent was doing at the time of his death, the calculation becomes truly meaningless. In the words of Joseph Cesario , director of the Social Cognition Laboratory at the Michigan State University, \"To adjust the raw shooting numbers on population proportions assumes that ... an officer buying a cup of coffee is as likely to shoot the cashier selling him the coffee as he is to shoot a citizen with an outstanding warrant who has just been pulled over for speeding. Not only does common sense suggest this is wrong, the data do not support this assumption.\"\n\nCesario's research showed whites as 1.27 times more likely than blacks to be killed during a violent crime arrest. I would caution against relying completely on that number because, again, this stuff is super complex.\n\n***\n\nSo how can we answer the question of \"Are black people more likely to be shot dead by police?\" The problem in answering comes down to the data itself. As someone who led a project in which 15 people pored over these states for almost a year, I can say that the problems are around capture of the data, coding of it, and the fact that ultimately there are issues of veracity, since as we know, cops sometimes lie. Not a lot, not as much as you might think, but there's just no dataset that does not have falsehoods and errors.\n\nAdditionally, non-police scientists attempting to code police narratives have fallen victim repeatedly to what I call Starsky & Hutch Effect: Having grown up on TV shows and movies, we Americans believe truly that we understand policing, when what we really understand is policing on cop shows .\n\nSo now comes Roland G. Fryer, Jr., a frickin' genius at Harvard, who just released ( as you noted earlier this week ) a study titled \" An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force .\" The beauty of this study (it's a working paper, covered gushingly in The New York Times ) is actually not the conclusions, but the methodology. Even if you've never read a methodology section before, I urge you to read Fryer's. His method of capture of narrative into coded data was simply wonderful-in that, for the first time, someone took the trouble to treat police data like most other data. The result was, as Fryer himself stated in the Times , \"the most surprising result of my career.\" After studying 1000 shootings at ten major agencies, Fryer found (wait for it) no racial bias in fatal shootings by police.\n\nIt is highly important to point out that his study did find racial bias in lesser (non-deadly) uses of force, particularly that officers of any race were more likely to go \"hands-on\" or use non-deadly tools like OC spray, clubs, or TASER on blacks than whites. This is a different problem.\n\n***\n\nFinally, in terms of counting, Ms. LaFrance is absolutely correct that, shamefully, the U.S. government has not provided us with a comprehensive count of civilians killed by police. This is changing, but only slowly.\n\nHowever, her post mis-states an important difference between the extant projects (which, for the record, began with D. Brian Burghart's Fatal Encounters , on which all other data-sets including mine are based). \"Of course,\" writes Ms. LaFrance, of The Washington Post 's dataset (506), \"this is just one count. The Guardian 's tally is 561 deaths, including 526 shootings. And that discrepancy suggests that as important as these efforts have been, in the absence of a comprehensive federal effort to track such shootings, the full scope of the problem remains unknown. Still, attempts to track police shootings are meaningful.\"\n\nRespectfully, that is simply incorrect. The discrepancy is both understandable and predictable and speaks directly to the totally different, but published and readily available, methodologies employed by the two projects. The Washington Post counts line-of-duty fatal shootings. The Guardian tracks all DEATHS-shootings and other deaths that include car wrecks, overdoses, strangulation, personal conflicts, and other non-line-of-duty or off-duty incidents, prison deaths (prison guards are not police officers), jail guards (ditto), and others.\n\n***\n\nAs you can see, this data collection is really complicated and difficult to determine. But as a journalist, I think Ms. LaFrance wasn't skeptical enough, and that caused its own issue, because she based much of her theses and statements (some of which I happen to agree with) on data from a source that wasn't as complete as it appeared to her to be. In support of that, I quote Professor Fryer, in what has become my favorite footnote of the year: \"Data constructed by the Washington Post has civilian demographic identifiers, weapons carried by civilian, signs of mental illness and an indicator for threat level but no other contextual information.\"\n\nUpdate with another part of Selby's correspondence I forgot to include:\n\nNone of all the above (including the findings of Mr. Fryer) is to suggest that there is a \"correct\" number, and I think that is my overall TL;DR.\n\nBut I was remiss not to mention the excellent work of Cody Ross in PLOS [excerpted by an Atlantic reader in a previous note ], which looks to the U.S. Police-Shooting Database ( USPSD ) for answers to these questions and found, \"...significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the probability of being {black, unarmed, and shot by police} is about 3.49 times the probability of being {white, unarmed, and shot by police} on average.\" I have a panoply of bones to pick with the USPSD, but not with Mr. Ross' superb analysis-though W. David Ball has done an extraordinary analysis of that , plus a description of Bayesian analysis in general and a super-cool critique of the Fryer paper in particular.\n\nAnd then, this morning came Radley Balko, who wrote in his superb blog, The Watch, that it is quite simply impossible to calculate the percentage of police shootings that are legitimate . [2]\n\nThe reason the Fryer paper and the Ross paper and Bell's critique and Fatal Encounters and StreetCred: Police Killings in Context and my book are so important, I think, is that they are serious attempts to take almost comically imperfect data about complex, insanely multi-variate situations and try to provide meaningful insight. The fact is, we can geek the hell out over these numbers and grant points and get great takeaways, but in the end, this is worth repeating:\n\nLaw enforcement data is the one place where Occam's Razor does not apply. Journalists who state facts based on studies do so at their peril.\n\n[1] Since 1997, the federal Office of Management and Budget has required all federal agencies to use a minimum of five race categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Note the lack in the federal OMB requirements of the term, \"Hispanic or Latino.\" Since the 2010 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau has treated \"Hispanic or Latino\" as an ethnicity separate from race (White, Black, American Indian, etc.). The Census Bureau's document, \" Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 \", attempts to clarify: \"'Hispanic or Latino' refers to a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.\" While this is probably ultimately the correct decision, it has created heaps of confusion in the statistics and demographics community, and resulted in a large range of descriptions from non-statisticians and non- demographers that conflate \"race\" with \"ethnicity.\"\n\n[2] Radley and I spoke by direct message after the printing of that column (I like the hell out of Radley, who I think is a great guy, but in my opinion, he got the 74% analysis only partly right in his column. I aver he mistakenly believes that the \"16%\" of additional attacks were part of the 74% of killings that interrupted a fatal attack. But if you read the original you will see that the article flatly stated that \"74 percent\" had fired shots or been in the midst of a deadly attack, and \"another 16%\" involved people who didn't have firearms but involved \"other potentially dangerous threats\", \"most commonly\", knives."

      "text": "The Killing of Unarmed Black Men Is Hurting America's Image Abroad\n\nSo now it is a therapist lying on the ground , hands in the air, helpless and bleeding beside an autistic kid he tried to help. At least he lived, which is a horrifyingly low bar. Before that it was Philando Castile , then Alton Sterling .\n\nEvery time I lay off these grafs for a few weeks, a few days even, a new video appears, a new horror, a new grief. We have come to the point where the last moments of a man's life have to be live-streamed so that the indignity of being killed for a busted taillight can be believed. Even after so many deaths, the abruptness of each jolts to the core. All those years, all those joys and sorrows, everything that life means is taken in an instant. For what? A toy truck? A traffic infraction? For being black...\n\nAs a Foreign Service Officer, I serve our country abroad because I am deeply proud of the ideals it represents. I have lived in fragile states. I have seen lands where entire police forces are corrupt and violent, or where there are no police at all. These are not places you want to live. Respect for and trust in law enforcement, earned by high standards in police conduct, are the cornerstones of peaceful and prosperous societies. In the United States, every day, millions of times over, our police save lives, protect children, keep commerce flowing, and resolve disputes peacefully. That's not to mention the youth leagues, charity drives, and innumerable other ways they contribute to the fabric of our society. Police are, after all, a reflection of us: a diverse collection of men and women drawn from our communities, paid for by our money. After five of our finest were gunned down by men fueled by despicable anti-police hate in Dallas, then three more in Baton Rouge, our country mourned, as we ever mourn whenever our police are lost in the line of duty. We know that they face dangers so that we do not all have to be cowboys and vigilantes. No matter where you stand on gun rights, our police give us the freedom to not carry weapons wherever we go. When somebody opens fire in a bar, or a movie theater, or at an elementary school, police officers respond. In this era of terrorism and mass murder, we need the protection of our police more than ever.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhich is why when police engage in extrajudicial killings with the regularity that we see in the United States, we have to take a hard look at ourselves. This must stop. Extrajudicial killings have a disproportionate effect on the national psyche. Each is a stain on all of us, and especially on the honor of brave police officers throughout the land. If these killings continue, innumerable good deeds will go overlooked and the basic social contract will break down. I get that in matters of criminal justice there are larger social justice issues at play, structural inequities of the past still ingrained in the our layered local, state and federal systems that leave us with difficult race, gender and class divides. But life is the cardinal value and change must start there.\n\nFor these very reasons, the annual State Department Country Reports on Human Rights, mandated by Congress, highlight \"Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life\" at the very top. Having contributed to many of these reports, in many different countries, I have spent many days in previous assignments listening to the protestations of host country officials. They have told me that their government cannot be held responsible for every bad cop, that the cases are misrepresented, that we are talking about a fraction of the police force and that the actions of a few do not fairly represent the whole picture. As a trained lawyer, I know well that any case can be distinguished on its facts and that nearly every death outside a judicial process can be explained away. Yet as a diplomat, I have told those officials that legal parsing won't cut it.\n\nSo when I see that in a Cleveland park a child with a plastic gun is shot moments after police pull up, or that in the streets of Chicago a 17-year-old is hit with nearly one bullet for every year he lived, or that in Baton Rouge a man is tackled, pinned down by two cops and shot in the chest, after all the shock and the sadness, I inevitably think about how any of these extrajudicial killings would have been described in our Human Rights Report, and the kind of conversations I would have had, if they had occurred in some country other than my own.\n\nI would have approached the host country officials and told them that the United States wants the killings to stop. I would have told them that tools to address the problem are well known and widely available, and in some cases we could assist in providing them: our highly professional police train others around the world, to good effect. I would have discussed the need for refined vetting and recruitment strategies, for advanced community policing techniques, for mandatory human rights training, continuous and at all levels, and for rigorous prosecution of abuses. I would have talked about reform to rules of engagement and described how, in Afghanistan, I saw young U.S. soldiers, under daily attack, refrain from firing at hostile gestures, movements, or even armed combatants in order to minimize the chances of civilian casualties. I would have said that standards for the use of deadly force against your own citizens can't be lower than those applied by your soldiers in a war zone. These are the reforms and best practices that need to be pushed into every corner of the country, I would have said, and pushed over and over until the number of extrajudicial killings hits zero. And if the host country officials were to have dismissed me, told me that our Human Rights Report was not credible and did not represent the problem accurately... I would have replied: no excuses. Fix it.\n\nThe views expressed are the author's own and not necessarily those of the United States Department of State or the United States Government.\n\nDante Paradiso is a career Foreign Service Officer, a lawyer, and the great-grandson of a New York City police officer .\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Video Emerges of MAGA-Loving Tulsa Ex-Jailer Shooting Unarmed Black Man\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nWARNING: This post contains content, including video of a shooting, that may be disturbing to viewers.\n\nThis month, as anti-racism protests erupted across America, a former jail sergeant and motel security guard in Tulsa, Oklahoma, attacked an unarmed Black man with pepper spray, then shot him to death in a parking lot. Now newly-released footage of the disturbing incident reveals the guard sprayed the victim when he wasn't looking, sparking an altercation that ended with the guard taking the man's life.\n\nChristopher Straight, 53, is charged with first-degree manslaughter in connection to the death of Carlos Carson, who was gunned down June 6 outside the Knights Inn. A probable cause affidavit reveals that officers responding to the scene found Carson, a 36-year-old father of three children, had been shot in the head in broad daylight.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStraight was arrested following the deadly encounter and released two hours later from the Tulsa County jail on a $50,000 bond. On Thursday, Straight hung up on a Daily Beast reporter seeking comment.\n\nAccording to his family, Carson was struggling with mental health issues and had been staying at the motel for a few days. His brother, Ananias Carson, an officer at the Tulsa Police Department, said Carlos had PTSD from a stint in prison. \"We're not trying to paint him out to be an angel or saint,\" Ananias said. \"But no one needs to be assaulted, then shot, because they defended themselves.\"\n\n\"My brother didn't deserve what he got, especially in the manner that it happened. He didn't deserve that,\" Ananias said.\n\nStraight, who in 2018 resigned as a Tulsa County detention officer, has a history of troubling allegations against him, The Daily Beast has learned. Shelley Free, a former deputy who worked under him, said she submitted memos on Straight's behavior toward women and people of color to then-chief deputy Michelle Robinette. (The sheriff's office didn't respond to questions about Free's claims.)\n\nAnd, on two other occasions, Tulsa police took reports of Straight pepper-spraying people trespassing on motel property. In May of this year, \"Straight was issued a citation for assault and battery, however, the victim then decided she did not want to cooperate and the officers had to void the citation,\" Tulsa Police Department Lt. Brandon Watkins said in an email.\n\nAround noon on June 6, the motel's manager allegedly called Straight to respond to an agitated guest. The manager told police that Carson stayed the night before and had become upset that his vehicle had been vandalized. The manager asked \"Carson to leave the premises due to Carson's agitated state,\" then called for security, the affidavit says.\n\nSecurity footage shows Carson and Straight speaking as Carson leaves the property, the court filing states. But about five minutes later, Carson returns to the area, close to Straight's truck, and the guard exits his vehicle.\n\n\"As Carson is standing near the wall,\" the affidavit notes, \"Straight sprays Carson with a burst of OC Spray. It did not appear that Carson was physically aggressive at that moment to provoke Straight to spray Carson.\"\n\nSurveillance footage reviewed by The Daily Beast shows Carson walking toward the motel, as Straight exchanges words with another person from inside his vehicle. As Carson passes Straight's truck, Straight steps out and deploys his pepper spray when Carson isn't looking. In reaction to the ambush, Carson hurls his coffee at Straight's truck and charges at the guard as he remains inside the pickup.\n\nCarson appears to thrust his arms through the driver's side window and seconds later, the car door opens. The fight lasts about 20 seconds before Straight fatally shoots Carson, who falls to the pavement. Later in the video, as first responders swarm the scene, Straight removes his shirt and wanders around the parking lot.\n\nIn an interview with cops, Straight admitted that Carson returned to the motel property after being ordered to leave but that \"Carson did not actually make an aggressive move towards him...\" Indeed, Straight claimed he used the chemical weapon first to \"deter\" Carson from acting aggressively, the affidavit alleges. The guard \"planned on detaining Carson for trespassing until police arrived,\" the document adds.\n\nSmolen & Roytman, the Tulsa law firm representing Carson's estate, said Carson was shot twice-the second shot fired as he fell away from Straight's pickup.\n\n\"Suddenly, and utterly unprovoked, Straight, while sitting in his vehicle, aimed a dispenser directly at Carlos and drenched his head and face with pepper spray,\" the statement says. \"This attack was completely unwarranted, excessive and unreasonable. At the time that Straight pepper-sprayed Carlos, he posed no threat to Straight or anyone else. It was nothing more than a cowardly 'sneak attack.' Blinded, in obvious pain and enraged, Carlos understandably attempted to fight his attacker. Straight responded with deadly force, lifting his firearm and shooting Carlos twice. The second shot was fired after Carlos was incapacitated and on the ground, or going to the ground.\"\n\nThe day before the incident, Straight shared a Facebook image with the words: \"How about all lives matter. Not black lives, not white lives. Get over yourself no one's life is more important than the next. Put your race card away and grow up.\"\n\nOn May 31, Straight shared another meme that read, \"If you are anti-police: I'm blue family, unfriend me,\" along with the hashtag #Bluelivesmatter. Three days earlier, he shared an image that declared, \"I support Trump and I will not apologize for it.\" Some Facebook photos show Straight wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" cap.\n\nTulsa County assistant district attorney Mark Collier is handling Straight's case, The Daily Beast has learned. (In 2017, we reported on the wrongful convictions of Malcolm Scott and De'Marchoe Carpenter , who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a murder they didn't commit. Collier was the prosecutor who put them behind bars.)\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up for Carson's funeral expenses.\n\nOne childhood friend, Shanise Harris, told The Daily Beast that Carson \"had a really big heart\" and once fended off some vicious dogs who chased her and a friend when they were in the 6th grade. \"Anytime I'd see him, I'd think about how he protected us from those dogs,\" Harris said. \"That showed me what type of person he was.\"\n\n\"It's a sad and devastating situation,\" added Harris, 34. \"He didn't deserve it. It was provoked. You attacked him and when he defended himself, you killed him.\"\n\nRecords show Carson had a criminal history, including convictions for burglary, false personation and entering with intent to steal copper. But his brother told The Daily Beast he was trying to turn his life around, and went to an appointment on June 1 to be evaluated for medication to help his PTSD. Straight has destroyed Carson's shot at redemption and \"taken away his chance to do anything with his children,\" Ananias told The Daily Beast.\n\nCarson left behind two sons, ages 11 and 14, and a 12-year-old daughter.\n\nStraight was hired by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in July 2005 and worked as a jail sergeant when he resigned in August 2018, amid an internal probe. He was facing a demotion as a result of the investigation by the sheriff's office.\n\nThe ex-sergeant shared his frustrations in a resignation letter reviewed by The Daily Beast. \"I have really tried to set a good example for the troops and to go above and beyond in boosting moral [sic] on my shift,\" Straight wrote, \"but it has become an uphill battle this last year to where I seem to stay on the chopping block for one thing or another and have been placed in a no win situation with the administration running the jail.\" He concluded, \"Again thank you and I am sorry I couldn't live up to the expectations of this management.\"\n\nIn August 2005, Straight was placed on administrative leave with pay. One month later, he was reassigned and demoted to detention officer, though his alleged misconduct is unclear. A memo warned, \"Any further violations of this nature may result in more severe punishment including termination.\"\n\nStraight was again put on leave in February 2011, pending an internal investigation into violations of TCSO policies and procedures. Within a month, he was back on the job, sheriff's office memos reveal.\n\nIn September 2013, Straight received five days' suspension without pay and mandatory supervisory training. \"Your behavior as an officer has compromised the professionalism of the Sheriff's Office and will not be tolerated again for any reason,\" former Undersheriff Tim Albin said in a memo. (The sheriff's office did not comment on why Straight faced disciplinary action over the years. Lawyers for the Carson estate said in a statement that Straight \"was previously under investigation for assaulting people of color and has a documented history of racist conduct.\" And one former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Daily Beast that Straight, \"should have been fired a long time ago. He treated employees and inmates of color like shit. Same goes for women.\")\n\nAnanias Carson told The Daily Beast that Straight got away with bad behavior for too long. \"They kicked the can down the road so he'd be somebody else's problem,\" he said of Straight. \"Unfortunately the can stopped with my family and Carlos. It was my family member whose life was cut short.\"\n\nWhen Straight criticized a jail administrator in a December 2018 Facebook post for wearing a uniform jacket over civil clothing in public, he may have hinted at one of his alleged violations in a comment: \"Kinda like getting me for a taser policy violation and the taser was presented, not deployed. IDIOT.\"\n\nA commenter suggested the jail employee was putting himself in danger by wearing his peace officer jacket, and Straight replied, \"Where are the thugs when you need them?\"\n\nThe shooting of Carlos Carson marks one of multiple killings of unarmed Black men in Tulsa in recent years, and it's one of many racist encounters between people of color and police-or, in this case, former law enforcement-to make national news. (This month, video showed Tulsa cops aggressively arresting two Black teenagers for \"jaywalking,\" and a white Tulsa police major told a talk-radio podcast that systemic racism in policing doesn't exist: \"All of the research says we're shooting African-Americans about 24 percent less than we probably ought to be, based on the crimes being committed.\")\n\nIn April 2015, The Daily Beast reported on the fatal shooting of Eric Harris , 44, who was killed during a sting operation when a wealthy volunteer deputy inexplicably fired his gun at Harris, who was being handcuffed by sheriff's deputies. The reserve deputy, Bob Bates, claimed he meant to grab his Taser and shot Harris by mistake.\n\nAn insurance executive in his 70s, Bates had supplied the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office (TCSO) with equipment and was a close friend of former Sheriff Stanley Glanz. Treating Glanz to cruises in the Bahamas apparently didn't hurt Bates' insider access to the police force. He was ultimately charged with second-degree manslaughter and served about 1.5 years of his four-year sentence for Harris' death.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Bates told a local news outlet, \"They tried to make it into a racial issue, I am not the least bit racial.\"\n\nBut, according to civil suits against the sheriff, racist attitudes had pervaded the office, and perhaps its volunteer cop program.\n\nBates himself was accused of racist statements, according to one pleading in the Harris estate's excessive force lawsuit, which settled for $6 million in 2018. A footnote in the document alleged, \"Bates has stated that he wanted to get a 'black buck' to hang on his wall\" during his volunteer stint. (The footnote also claimed Bates would haunt a local watering hole while wearing a Drug Task Force hat and \"brag to the bar staff about his exploits with TCSO and state that he was going on a 'mission' when he left the bar.\" TCSO's former Drug Task Force supervisor, Tom Huckeby, allegedly joined Bates for drinks.)\n\nTulsa made headlines again in September 2016, after police officer Betty Jo Shelby shot and killed an unarmed Black man named Terence Crutcher. The 40-year-old father stood at his stalled vehicle with his hands up when Shelby fired the fatal bullet. In footage from a police chopper hovering above the scene, an officer says, \"Time for a Taser, I think,\" and \"That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something.\" Shelby would be acquitted of manslaughter a year later.\n\nAccusations of discrimination plagued Tulsa County's detention center, too.\n\nThe Daily Beast investigated the death of Elliott Williams , a Black veteran who died in 2011 after spending days on his cell floor, paralyzed and out of reach of food or water. Jailers allegedly taunted him and accused him of \"faking\" his illness, and the horrors of his final days were captured on surveillance footage. (In November of last year, a lawsuit filed by Williams' family settled for $10 million.)\n\nWilliams, 37, had no criminal record and was arrested after having a mental breakdown at an Owasso hotel in October 2011. At a wrongful death trial in 2017, Sheriff Glanz said he didn't watch footage of Williams' demise until a year-and-a-half later-before a 2013 deposition in the case-despite being in charge of the detention center.\n\nCourtroom testimony also revealed Glanz's jail had been marking employees with the letter \"N,\" which stood for \"n*gronoid,\" if they were Black. Dan Smolen, an attorney for Williams' family, learned of the racially-offensive term after obtaining a 2006 memo, which also listed \"M\" or \"F\" to indicate the gender of certain staffers.\n\nGlanz testified the term \"n*gronoid\" was used in the 1960s and '70s by the FBI, so he didn't take issue with its usage inside his detention center. Still, this was one of many accusations of racism under Glanz's tenure. The sheriff's office paid more than $1 million to settle seven racial discrimination suits filed by employees in 2009 and 2010. Former detention officer Rolanda Harvey claimed, according to one affidavit, that a supervisor told her \"African Americans had nappy heads,\" and that coworkers used the n-word, along with the terms \"n**ger-knocking,\" and \"black b*tch.\" Harvey also stated that \"a Caucasian officer wrote the letter 'N' next to the race of an African-American inmate\" and when she confronted the coworker, \"he scratched it out.\"\n\nMonths after the Williams trial, Tulsa cops fatally shot Joshua Barre, a 29-year-old Black man struggling with mental illness, after trailing him for 15 minutes while he carried two large knives and entered a convenience store. Barre's family said he was killed days after authorities were supposed to transport him to a court-ordered evaluation.\n\nAs protests raged over the death of George Floyd , who died at the hands of Minneapolis police, Barre's family held their own demonstration to push for better police training when dealing with citizens who have mental illness. Their Black Lives Matter protest also touched on what they described as Mental Health Matters. Joshua's mother, Etta Lowe-Barre, told the Tulsa World , \"We have to speak out to help the public understand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Straight was named as a defendant in three different pro se lawsuits filed by prisoners since 2007, federal court records show. Two complaints alleged violations of due process-including one which was tossed after an inmate failed to respond to a motion to dismiss. The suit claimed the prisoner's personal property was discarded and that his visitation and commissary was restricted without any hearings.\n\nA second lawsuit claimed Straight and another sergeant falsely accused a prisoner of stealing another inmate's phone calls and housed him in segregation without evidence. The prisoner claimed the false accusations ultimately led to him being assaulted by two other detainees. (A judge dismissed the complaint, in part, because the allegations \"do not support that his placement in segregation imposed an atypical significant hardship.\")\n\nThe third complaint accused Straight and two other officers of failing to protect a prisoner who warned he was being threatened by another inmate. The prisoner alleges he was beaten unconscious and suffered a \"fractured cheekbone and irreparable tissue damage to his face.\" The court ruled in favor of Straight on the basis of \"qualified immunity,\" a legal doctrine that protects police from federal lawsuits.\n\nStraight was also mentioned in the deposition of Godwin Ehiremen, a Nigerian detention officer who claimed he was terminated because of his race and national origin. (A judge dismissed Ehiremen's 2014 lawsuit against the sheriff's office after the agency argued Ehiremen \"made sexual advances towards multiple inmates.\")\n\nAccording to Ehiremen, when one Tulsa detainee was deported to Nigeria for not having a green card, Straight warned him he could be next. \"Straight said to me, one of your buddy's was just ship home today because he don't have-have no green card. We might have to check you out with this man to see if you have a green card 'cause we don't know what you're doing here,\" Ehiremen testified.\n\nEarlier this year, Straight had been working for the security firm Response Protection, which corporation records show is owned by Cory Johnson and was formed in November 2019. On social media, Straight said the business was \"veteran owned and operated\" and listed one open job as $16 per hour, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.\n\nIn January, Straight wrote on Facebook, \"Alright folks Response Protection is growing, needing more good folks. Must be Armed certified. Pay will depend on experience.\"\n\nJohnson could not be reached for comment.\n\n\"With everything being shut down, let me know if your business or one you know of needs security,\" Straight wrote in March, adding in a comment, \"Bars, restaurants, whatever it is, we can protect it...\" (That month, he also shared a sad post: \"I use to not trust people and pushed everyone away, well the old Chris is coming back.\")\n\n\"Response Protection is needing an armed guard for a graveyard shift in a pretty rough area. HMU,\" Straight posted in April.\n\nStraight twice more put out a call for licensed armed security guards in the days before he shot Carson. \"Probably gonna need at least one more Armed Security guard for a post position,\" he wrote. \"Must have current license.\"\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nkate.briquelet@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

When asked about police brutality, specifically the shooting of unarmed Black men, Barr pointed to other measures to \"put it in perspective,\" saying Black people commit the majority of the murders of other Black people and that \"there are many whites who are shot unarmed by police.\" While the police do shoot unarmed white people, research shows officers use force against Black people at disproportionately high rates .\n\nBarr and President Donald Trump have decried the role of anti-fascist activists in the recent protests against police brutality and the alleged murder of George Floyd, saying \"Antifa\" was the reason some protests turned violent.

      "text": "The Lesson of Stephon Clark and the March for Our Lives: Too Many Guns\n\nStephon Clark shouldn't be dead. He should be alive, hanging out with his family in Sacramento and continuing to live his life. Instead, he is another in a long list of unarmed black men who have been killed by police.\n\nWhile the story of Clark's death is as complex as many others, there is one very simple reason why he isn't alive today: police thought he had a gun.\n\nEven though the officers who killed Clark were tragically, horrifically wrong in thinking he was holding a gun and not a phone, they weren't unreasonable in thinking he was armed. Not because he was black or because of the neighborhood he was in, but because, between one-third and half of Americans have a gun . (Those are the people who report it. There is no federal law requiring gun owners to register their weapons, so the actual number of gun ownership is unknown.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe lead the world in gun ownership and gun deaths, and police are on the front lines of encounters with armed Americans each day.\n\nStephon Clark shouldn't be dead, but his death can be at least partly blamed on the gun-heavy reality of day-to-day police work-and American life. That reality includes armed Americans walking around looking exactly like unarmed Americans. There are no bright orange vests that read, I have a gun .\n\nPut yourselves in the shoes of officers Terrence Mercadal and Jared Robinet, for a moment. Forget the headlines and the data-about 1,000 Americans killed each year by police; more than 10,000 killed each year by a fellow citizen with a gun-and put yourselves in a dark backyard chasing after a suspect breaking into people's homes and cars.\n\nDo you know what's in that backyard? Probably not. But you know you've got to catch the suspect and you know you don't want to die. You're not thinking about the relatively small number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty each year-less than 200 in 2017. You're not thinking about that because you're not a data point. You're a human being-just like Stephon Clark-who wants to live a long and happy life and make it home to your family at the end of each day.\n\nRight-wing media and blindly pro-law enforcement types who happily make arguments based on the police perspective are usually unwilling to do the same from Clark's point of view. Instead they expect perfection from him and everyone else who encounters police: Clark should have immediately put his hands up, stopped running, dropped to his knees and let police know not only that he was surrendering but that he didn't have a gun.\n\nThose on the left who are unwilling to view things from the police perspective expect similar perfection from law enforcement: the officers should have let Clark continue walking towards them as helicopter video shows-again, thinking they saw a gun in his hand.\n\nThere are endless points to debate for every police shooting and police-involved death, and each needs to be examined on its own. I should know, because for two years I covered many of them. Mike Brown , Freddie Gray , Walter Scott , Laquan McDonald , Sandra Bland , Sylville Smith , and Keith Lamont Scott , to name a few. (That's not to mention the ones that didn't make cable news chyrons: Warren Robinson and Ronald Johnson in Chicago, Phillip White in Vineland, New Jersey, Justus Howell in Zion, Illinois and Darius Robinson in Anadarko, Oklahoma.)\n\nLast week began with Clark's death, and it ended with nationwide marches calling for gun control . Those marches came about after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, where Nikolas Cruz used his gun to murder those without guns; after Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, where men with guns did the same; after 100 homicides so far this year in Chicago and thousands of other murders across the country, most of them committed with guns.\n\nWithout guns, there'd be a lot more Americans walking around today. And without guns-and the entirely reasonable fear that quite a few of us might have one-Stephon Clark would almost certainly not have have been killed.\n\nIn fact, guns were reliably one of the leading causes of death for all Americans, until a few years ago when opioid overdoses overtook them.\n\nWe have guns to protect ourselves from other people who might have guns, who in turn have guns because they might need to protect themselves from all of us who also have guns. Most of the time we never use them and live our lives knowing that they're there if we should, God forbid, need them. Police, on the other hand, live each day dealing with people who might just use them, people at their most desperate, angry, tired, lowest, or neediest. When was the last time you called the police when everything was going well?\n\nNever, probably. But you might have called them at some point in your life after hearing gunshots, or after witnessing someone being shot. In January, Sacramentans called the police four times for four separate homicides-at least three done with a gun-and once when a group of armed men barged into a woman's garage.\n\nWe are a gun country, and the young adults from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School understand this. That's why they didn't make this past weekend's marches about school safety, or mental health treatment, they made them about guns. And that's why their fellow young people in Chicago made their march about guns as well : guns, statistically speaking, are one of the biggest killers of people there.\n\nGuns fuel a cycle of fear-buying guns to protect ourselves from other people with guns; police shooting people because they have or think they might have guns-that seems to never end.\n\njustin.glawe@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

I'm furious. As a white person, I'm ashamed. I see what's going on and I think how is this possible that this keeps happening? There's just blatant racism. And it hurts me, it really hurts me.\"\n\nDeGeneres continued to be on the verge of tears as she recounted recent incidents in which black teenagers have been shot for seemingly no reason. \"How is this happening?\" she wanted to know.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the father of two young boys, Jones said this is something he worries about \"every single day.\" He told her, \"It's not just the police. We've got some malware glitch going on in our brains.\"\n\n\"We've got this brain glitch that says, if a white kid [does something bad], eh, maybe they need a little help,\" he continued. \"If a black kid does, we've got to punish them.\"\n\nIn response, DeGeneres said, \"I want to say it's not in my brain. I don't believe that, I don't think that, I don't see myself in that way at all. And it makes my angry.\"\n\nLater, Jones asked the host to consider a hypothetical. \"Can you imagine, as a white parent, if every week you turned on the television and a black officer had shot an unarmed white kid?\" he asked. \"Every week. Week after week after week. By the end of the year, how upset would you be? How completely out of your mind would you be? That's what's going on right now in black America.\"\n\nHe said this should be \"everybody's problem,\" telling DeGeneres, \"You're as hurt as my wife is. And that touches me because we should care about everybody's kids. And I think if people felt like, 'This could happen my child,' it would change tomorrow.\"\n\nSenior Editor\n\nmatt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Cincinnati Campus Cop Kills Unarmed Black Man\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nA newly engaged dad was fatally shot by a University of Cincinnati cop on Sunday-raising questions about the university force's authority off campus and adding to the toll of unarmed black men dying in police encounters .\n\nUC officer Ray Tensing pulled over Sam Dubose, 43, a mile from the school because he was missing a front license plate, police announced Monday.\n\nBut at some point during the 6:30 p.m. traffic stop, Tensing and the father of 13 allegedly began tussling through the car window. Dubose started driving away and Tensing fired a shot into his head, authorities said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Officer Tensing...asked Mr. Dubose multiple times to provide a license,\" university police chief Jason Goodrich said at a press conference. \"He produced a bottle of alcohol inside the car ... but was unable to provide a driver's license.\"\n\nAuthorities say a struggle ensued when Dubose refused to exit the vehicle. He was shot moments after trying to speed off, and the car rolled for a block before stopping. Dubose was pronounced dead at the scene, Goodrich said.\n\nStill, it's unclear how the routine traffic violation turned deadly.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, investigators were waiting to interview Tensing and two other officers at the scene. All three cops declined to make immediate statements but have 24 hours to do so according to their contracts, Cincinnati police Lieutenant Colonel James Whalen said.\n\nAsked if Dubose had a weapon, Whalen replied, \"To the best of my knowledge, no.\"\n\nPolice are reviewing footage from Tensing's body camera and surveillance from a nearby building, Whalen said.\n\nTensing, who has been placed on administrative leave, was knocked to the ground during the incident, Goodrich said. He was treated at a hospital for his injuries, which included \"bruising on his legs,\" the chief added.\n\nGoodrich said traffic stops are \"normal\" for the university force, which comprises 72 officers.\n\n\"It's not our primary mission, but it's not something we shy away from, either,\" Goodrich said. \"Our officers have the discretion to stop vehicles that commit traffic violations the way any other police officer would.\"\n\nUnder a mutual aid agreement, university police can patrol some areas off campus-a pact that's becoming more common at schools nationwide.\n\nIn 2013, UC interim police chief Jeff Corcoran told the Associated Press: \"It used to be we were responsible for the campus. Now there's an expectation, I think, especially with parents, but to a large extent among students, that we're also responsible for these areas off campus.\"\n\n\"We're getting pushed to ignore those imaginary lines on the map and be more proactive in that area,\" he added.\n\nThe UC officers undergo the same training as other law enforcement officers and are \"commissioned by the state of Ohio with full law enforcement authority,\" according to one campus report .\n\nA spokeswoman for the Cincinnati Police Department referred questions to the university. UPDATE: Michele  Ralston, a UC spokeswoman, said campus cops receive the same training  as city police officers. She did not have data on how often the officers  make off-campus arrests.\n\nAs for Dubose, he has been arrested 75 times in the last 20 years, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported . Court records show he's faced charges of misdemeanor drug possession, drug abuse, and marijuana trafficking, for which he served prison time.\n\nIn January, his license was suspended indefinitely after multiple arrests for driving without a license, the Enquirer reported.\n\nFriends set up a memorial Monday morning with balloons and candles at a utility pole close to the scene of the crime. They told local media that Dubose- who got engaged last week-wasn't a violent man despite his criminal history.\n\n\"Everybody in the community loved Sam,\" Hadassah Thomas, a neighbor, told WLWT. \"He was so helpful and he was always around. He used to babysit for my daughter. What men do that? He didn't carry a gun, so why did he get shot?\"\n\nKimberly Thomas, 40, called Dubose \"an awesome man\" and said he never carried weapons. \"He was a dad of 13, and the police got no explanation,\" Thomas told the Enquirer . \"You've got to be doing something-we're upset.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time University of Cincinnati police have made headlines. In 2011, UC student Everette Howard Jr. died after campus police stunned him with a Taser. His family was awarded a $2 million settlement, and campus police agreed to suspend the use of Tasers.\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nkate.briquelet@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Black Chief: My Heart Jumps When I See a Cop Car Behind Me\n\nMinnesota employs roughly 11,000 police officers. Fewer than 250 are Black-or barely 2 percent in a state where 7 percent of the people are Black . Of the 417 law enforcement agencies and departments in the state, only four police chiefs are Black -less than 1 percent.\n\nOne of them is Blair Anderson, the chief in St. Cloud, Minnesota, who acknowledges the disparities and his own fear of unknown police officers but also says that he has seen white officers serve communities of color with compassion. It frustrates him, he says through tears as we speak just after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted on all counts for the murder of George Floyd , that \"they get lumped in with the dumbass who does something so abhorrent that we all get painted with that same broad brush. I see them every day, and they feel like shit. They're like, 'I didn't kill anybody.' All I've done was try to serve.\" He adds, \"We are aware there are bad people in our profession that don't need to be there. But the vast majority of people out here doing this job... are doing it the right way, for the right reasons.\"\n\nStill, Anderson says, there's a lot of work to be done to restore the trust that many have lost in the uniform. As residents reeled from the trauma and grief of the Chauvin trial, for example, Daunte Wright , a Black 20-year-old man, was killed by yet another white police officer in Brooklyn Center, about 10 miles from where Chauvin stood trial. A familiar outcry followed in the state where Black men and women like Philando Castile, Martha Donald, Jamar Clark, and Mark Henderson were all killed at the hands of police. Since 2000, there have been 208 police-involved deaths in Minnesota; 26 percent of victims have been Black. \"I tell my officers that this uniform is a symbol of a lot of things to different people,\" Anderson says. \"It's a symbol of service. It's a symbol of sacrifice. But to some people, it's a symbol of oppression and brutality and violence. I'm not disavowing myself of our country's history.\" In the interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, the chief discusses the Chauvin verdict, rising racial tensions in Minnesota, and the future of policing.\n\nChauvin was found guilty on all counts. What's your reaction?\n\nChief Anderson : The system of jurisprudence works. That might not work for your story because it sounds too canned. [But] I'm just being honest. The jury absorbed the evidence presented and made their decision. They determined that what they saw is not something that should be happening. In my 26 years as a cop, I have never been trained to put my knee on somebody's neck. I've been trained to subdue by putting my knee in between someone's shoulder blades, at the base of their neck. As soon as I have them under control, the training instructs me to roll them over into the recovery position and make sure they are OK.\n\nThis verdict is bigger than the state of Minnesota. This was not a training issue-this was a character issue. Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said that people in our custody are in our care during the trial, and that's the simple truth. It's the oath we take. And that's how we are trained: Anyone in our custody, we're responsible for their welfare, period, no matter what they've done. So when I hire, I look for good character so that I don't have to teach morality.\n\nIt seems, though, America's sigh of relief was short-lived. What's your take on what happened in Columbus (where a Black teenager, Ma'Khia Bryant , was fatally shot by a white police officer on the same day that Chauvin was convicted)? This brings up the issue of de-escalation and the use of excessive lethal force, adding to the rising tensions against policing in America.\n\nIt's tragic. It's horrible that a 16-year-old girl lost her life. After seeing what the body camera captured, one person was going to stab another person that was leaned up against the car (which could've happened in a matter of seconds) and cause them great bodily harm, or worse; the person on the car had nowhere to go; an officer giving verbal commands to the person swinging the knife and came pretty close to stabbing that other person; I don't know what else that officer could have done to prevent harm. Deadly force is authorized by law enforcement to protect the lives of themselves or a third party. And from watching that video that's exactly what it looks like that officer was doing.\n\nShould he have fired four shots? I wasn't there, so I can't assess those split-second decisions. But does it really matter how many times the officer fired? Think about it this way: what would you want that officer to do if you were the person on the other end of that knife? I understand the rising tensions right now. However, civilians should believe their eyes-just as was said during the Chauvin trial. Whether I'm law enforcement or not, does the video show one person attempting to stab, and potentially kill, another person? Is one person in imminent danger and in need of protection? That's what I saw in that two-minute video. The officer gave his verbal commands that were not adhered to, and our job is to serve and protect. Whether people like it or not, that was an authorized use of force situation.\n\nLike everybody else, I'm waiting for the full investigation and I hope that's done by an independent agency. But, I do appreciate not only as a law enforcement professional but as a citizen, that Columbus PD got that footage out as quickly as they did.\n\nYour state has endured the deaths of so many unarmed Black men and women. When it comes to policing communities of color, what could be done to ease those tensions between officers and civilians?\n\nThe tensions are real. I've experienced it myself. I'm the chief of police, and when I see a squad car behind me, my heart skips a beat. When I was a captain, I was wrongfully felony-stopped by a white officer and pulled out of my car, faced down, and [had] a gun pointed at my head. And when the officer approached me, I told him, \"Hey, I'm a police officer. My service weapon is in my bag.\" He responded with, \"Yeah, yeah. Shut up.\" I later had a meeting with his chief and found out that he was already under investigation.\n\nIt's never simple to weed out the bad apples or cut down rotten trees, there's so much red tape to doing what's right for your department and community. In Minnesota, we have the binding arbitration system . Until we change that, we will have difficulty getting rid of people who don't belong in this profession. Officers have due process, as well they should. We ask them to do a tough job. But when somebody creates an offense that is so egregious that it rises right to the level of termination, we have to go through that process. If an arbitrator says, \"You have to take them back,\" we must. These are things that I have implored our state legislature to fix first. Forget about police reform, that is not practical. People insist that we get rid of the bad cops to bolster community relations and ease racial tensions when some have been perpetrators, and some of us have tried. We've just not been successful because the binding arbitration system won't let us.\n\nThen there's retaliation from the officer to worry about. It can be intimidating for some law-enforcement leaders because you don't want to feel like you're retaliating against somebody just because you couldn't fire him. But now the officer has that in their back pocket. The binding arbitration system is not just in Minnesota; it's in other states. This is why people in my position have not been able to get rid of officers who have continuously demonstrated that they are not worthy of the badge.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced he's launching a new investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's policing practices. What does this do for morale?\n\nI don't run the Minneapolis police department so cannot speak to how they are handling this particular probe. But, any good agency, any good cop out on the street should have no problem with accountability, or being investigated, or having other folks find facts and making a determination based on their investigation and what they find.\n\nI would always welcome an investigation into my agency's policing practices. When we do have an incident that involves the death of another human being or whether there's a conflict of interest, we don't wait for outside agencies to come in, we call them. We want to be transparent and we want the public to know that we're not trying to police ourselves. We want somebody who has an independent viewpoint to come in and take a look at what actually happened.\n\nPolice reform; defund the police; ACAB. How do you, as a law enforcement leader, receive all of this?\n\nOur elected local and federal officials need to slow down and not be so impetuous about police reform . Some of the bills I've testified against are not sustainable. People are suggesting there should no longer be no-knock warrants , for example. Do we really believe the bad guys are not listening to that nonsense? Do we think that they are not saying, Oh, yeah, get rid of no-knock warrants? Get rid of all traffic stops so nobody can stop me because my taillight is out.\n\nOne bill that went forward in our statehouse was that all police officers should carry personal liability insurance -who's realistically going to be able to afford that? Then, find me an insurance company that will underwrite that. These types of requirements are going to drive good people out of the profession. I've implored legislators from both sides of the aisle to talk to subject matter experts, speak to us, before drafting or introducing hasty reform bills. Where else in history have we decided we're going to reform an entire industry without talking to anybody in that industry?\n\nI'd like for people to just take a breath, step back and understand what officers have been asked to do. When a call comes in, we go because we don't have the luxury of saying, Can you call us back tomorrow? We respond even after civilians have spat upon us, called us names, threw rocks or bricks or bottles at us, derided or chastised us. The majority of police officers answer the call with one thing in mind: We want things to be better when we leave than they were when we got there.\n\nAnd when we respond and get it wrong, because we're human and we are not mental health professionals, we get the blowtorch. And that's not fair. Go ahead and criticize us when we screw up because we will take the heat. And there are plenty of instances where we do screw up. But stop asking us to be all things to all people. Where are all the other entities that failed that person before they got to us? Nobody wants to talk about that. And that's part of my frustration.\n\nWhat about the future of policing? What can Minnesota, and the country at large, learn from this past year?\n\nIf lawmakers and activists and those clamoring for no police or defund the police get their way, they're going to be sorry. Because the bad folks are watching. Until you can tell me with certainty that there are no more bad people in the world-no more predators, no more murderers, no more robbers-then I don't want to hear what you have to say. I've dedicated my whole life to serving this country, to serving my community, and so have a lot of other people.\n\nLaw enforcement needs to have an opinion on how policing progresses in America and what change can look like, no matter how pissed off people are at us, because of things that have happened historically. As a Black man, I'm offended because I'm used to being judged by the worst element in our group. But that's what's happening to the police across the nation now. We are all being judged by the worst part in our group, even though the whole world knows it's a tiny percentage that act as the perpetrators against the call of the badge.\n\nIs there a plan to increase representation in the police department so more officers look like the communities they serve?\n\nI'm a realist: There are not that many people of color in the applicant pool. Minnesota is one of the first states to require a bachelor's degree to become a police officer. When I came into the profession 26 years ago, most people of color in college weren't thinking about law enforcement or criminal justice. They were in business programs, pre-law, or pre-med. They didn't see policing as a viable career option. So, when it comes to recruiting, we are behind, and we're working on it. When you have such a small pool of applicants to choose from, it's hard to make every community have people of color represented within the different police agencies. They're just not enough people. If I have 40 percent people of color in my community, I'd love to have a 40 percent representation of people of color on the force, but that's just not realistic at the moment.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a Black police chief in America?\n\nI have dedicated my entire adult life to public service: I enlisted in the Army when I was 19 and have served my country and my respective communities since. Right now, the police are in everybody's crosshairs. I'm frustrated, hurt, gut-wrenched, and saddened. There are days when I cry, and I'm not ashamed to admit that. Because when I was twentysomething, I thought by the time I was fiftysomething, we would have figured this-the racial tensions, the division, the inequality-shit out. And we haven't. We have lost ground that was gained for us during the Civil Rights Movement. But, I have to be optimistic. I get an opportunity to try and make a difference every day. Many people are trying and working hard to keep this profession as magnanimous as we all believe it is and should be.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Horrific Body Cam Footage Shows Fatal Police Shooting of Andre Hill\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio-Authorities here have identified 47-year-old Andre Maurice Hill as the unarmed Black man shot and killed by police earlier this week, with body-cam video showing the cop opening fire on him in the garage of a home he was visiting.\n\nAdam Coy, the officer who carried out the shooting , has a remarkably dense history of complaints against him, including a 2012 excessive force case that led to a $45,000 city payout to a victim.\n\nCoy, 44, was responding to a complaint about a man and an SUV early Tuesday morning. Body-camera footage from one of the officers, released Wednesday and published below, shows police approaching Hill. Because the officers had not enabled their body cameras before the shooting, there is no audio of the incident before Coy opens fire.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe footage shows Hill turning around to face the officers. He holds a cell phone in his left hand, with the illuminated screen out, as if to show what he is holding. Shots are heard. In audio that begins after those shots, Coy shouts at another officer not to approach Hill, who is laying on the garage floor, because Coy cannot see the man's left hand. He shouts at Hill to \"put your fucking hands out to the side\" and to \"roll on your stomach, now.\"\n\nEventually, Coy takes one of Hill's arms and rolls him onto his back. Though Hill is immobile, Coy does not immediately give him aid.\n\nNeither Coy nor the Columbus Police Department immediately responded to requests for comment. A police report for the incident is short and grim. \"Officer discharged his firearm upon confronting Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill did not survive his injuries,\" it reads.\n\nCoy is a 19-year veteran of Columbus's police force. But his tenure has been marked with complaints, including allegations of excessive force. His is just part of a remarkably opaque local history of police violence, including the killing of 23-year-old Black man Casey Goodson by a sheriff's deputy just weeks ago.\n\nGoodson's funeral was being held on Wednesday, nearly concurrent to the release of footage showing the killing of Hill.\n\nPaisha Thomas, 46, an artist and racial-justice activist based in Columbus, said the local criminal justice system needs top-down reform, calling for the resignation of Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther and Police Chief Thomas Quinlan. Both men described the fatal shooting of Hill as a disturbing one even before body-cam footage was released, a testament to official awareness of the potential for local outrage to boil over.\n\n\"I think one of the things we need to do right now is get rid of Quinlan. He needs to be fired for gross negligence,\" Thomas told The Daily Beast. \"Ginther has known about this problem, about the egregious, excessive use of force by Columbus Police, before he even took office. They gotta go. They need to be fired.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mayor Ginther called for Coy to be fired, indicating that several minutes passed after the shooting before Hill got medical attention.\n\nAs Coy opened fire, \"I heard 'pop, pop, pop,'\" the neighbor who called 911 about the SUV previously told The Daily Beast . \"No glass, no screams. I said, 'What the hell's going on out here?'\"\n\nAudio of the 911 call, reviewed by The Daily Beast, reveals the neighbor complaining about the SUV idling. He said he hadn't gone out to inspect the situation. \"I'd go out there, but I don't want to get in trouble,\" the caller told 911 with a short chuckle. \"I don't have a gun.\"\n\nWarning: The police body-cam footage below is graphic and disturbing.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio announced on Wednesday that he will review the shooting for potential federal civil rights violations. He will not have to look very hard for evidence of past misconduct.\n\nDuring a drunk-driving stop in October 2012, Coy punched a man, slammed him on the ground, and repeatedly bashed his head into the hood of his car while the man was handcuffed. The incident, witnessed by a college student and Coy's own dashboard camera, was so bad the victim was awarded a $45,000 settlement from the city.\n\nAn internal police investigation found that the driver did not appear to be resisting arrest in the first place.\n\n\"To me, we have to be concerned about somebody from the outside looking in to this type of behavior,\" Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs told Coy during a disciplinary hearing, reported by the Columbus Dispatch . \"You are not allowed to use force that's unnecessary and unreasonable. You have to control yourself.\"\n\nStill, Coy remained on the force, following a 160-hour suspension.\n\nOther incidents have dotted Coy's professional record. The Dispatch reported nine complaints against him in 2003, alone. He received written counseling for those incidents.\n\nA Daily Beast review of Coy's Internal Affairs Bureau file reveal more than 180 complaints against him since he joined the force. Most were labeled as unfounded, unsustained, or within the allowed limits of police force. But at least 16 reports were marked as sustained.\n\nAmong them are six complaints of Coy engaging in \"rude or discourteous language or actions\" during arrests or questioning. Five complaints related to a \"violation of police rules, orders, etc.\" during arrests or questioning are also marked as sustained.\n\nThe fatal shooting, from an officer with a history of complaints, is emblematic of Columbus's police department, where from 2001 to 2017, just six percent of officers made up half of all police complaints, according to a report from The Appeal .\n\nIn one representative case, just two months before Coy was filmed banging a man's head into a car, two police officers beat a Black college student into unconsciousness while arresting him for what ended up as a littering case. One of his arresting officers had 14 misconduct complaints on her record. Another one of the officers had 40 misconduct complaints, Reuters reported .\n\nMorgan Harper, 36, a Columbus attorney and activist, said the deaths of Hill and Goodson had frayed already-tense relations between the community and police.\n\n\"This is another tragedy, and we as a community are sick of seeing unarmed Black men die at the hands of police,\" she said.\n\nColumbus Police and other local law-enforcement agencies have also been criticized for what advocates say is a notable lack of transparency. Details surrounding the death of Goodson remained in dispute even as his funeral took place on Wednesday, with authorities stating officers shot him after he was seen holding a gun, and family members inside his home at the time of the shooting stating that they did not see him with a weapon. There is no body camera footage of his death.\n\nAdvocates for police reform told Reuters that details on some past incidents were missing-because Columbus Police routinely purge their records every four years.\n\n\"We shred them in various cycles,\" a Columbus Police records custodian told the outlet.\n\nA 19-year veteran of the Columbus Police force like Coy might have worked through four of those cycles.\n\nImmediately following Ginther's press conference, a group of about 20 community activists gathered in front of Columbus City Hall. They pinned a banner to the entrance that read \"Columbus Isn't Safe for Black People.\"\n\nCommunity organizer Hana Abdur-Rahim said the purpose of the gathering was to express solidarity with the families of Hill, Goodson, and others who have lost loved ones to police shootings.\n\n\"Everyone's grieving right now,\" she told The Daily Beast. \"We're connecting with them about how they want us to show up for them.\"\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

On Monday, the 2nd Circuit of Appeals ruled a federal judge was wrong to dismiss parts of a lawsuit against the police for excessive use of force. \"My family and I are extremely overjoyed that the original ruling was vacated,\" says Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. \"I think that people are now coming together, and they're saying that extrajudicial killings and summary executions of unarmed Black men, women and children is no longer going to be tolerated.\" We also speak with the family's attorney. \"Most people would be able to agree that when you're at home sleeping and you haven't committed any crime, that you wouldn't expect that the police are going to break your door down and kill you - in particular if they're responding for a medical call where you think that they're there to help you,\" says Mayo Bartlett.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we turn now to a major development in a case of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., who was an African American man killed in his own apartment in White Plains, New York, during a police confrontation in 2011 when he accidentally triggered his medical alert pendant. It was, oh, at 5:00 in the morning. He rolled over on it, and it called the LifeAid company. Well, on Monday, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a federal judge was wrong to dismiss parts of a lawsuit against the police for excessive use of force.\n\nThe tragic case occurred early on the morning of November 19, 2011, when Kenneth Chamberlain, a 68-year-old former marine with a heart condition, accidentally pressed the button on his medical alert system while sleeping. It was 5:22 in the morning. Responding to the alert, from the company calling police, the White Plains police officers arrived at Chamberlain's apartment in a public housing complex. It was shortly after 5 a.m. By the time the police left the apartment, just after 7 a.m., Kenneth Chamberlain was dead, shot twice in the chest by a police officer inside his own home. Police gained entry to Chamberlain's apartment only after they took his front door off its hinges. Officers first shot him with a Taser, then a beanbag shotgun, then with live ammunition.\n\nIn a moment, we'll be joined by Kenneth Chamberlain's son and by the attorney for the Chamberlain family. But first we want to turn to the remarkable series of audio and video recordings from the morning of Mr. Chamberlain's death. Before we play these excerpts, we want to warn you they contain disturbing footage. Much of the audio was recorded by Chamberlain's LifeAid medical alert device. The video was recorded from the police Taser gun used to shoot him before he was shot dead. After the White Plains police arrived at Kenneth Chamberlain's apartment, Chamberlain told an operator from LifeAid that he was not sick, that he didn't need assistance.\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : This is your help center for LifeAid, Mr. Chamberlain. Do you need help?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: Yes, this is an emergency! I have the White Plains Police Department banging on my door, and I did not call them, and I am not sick!\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : Everything's all right, sir?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: No, it's not all right! I need help! The White Plains Police Department are banging on my door!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : After Kenneth Chamberlain told LifeAid he was OK but afraid of the police at the door, the LifeAid operator attempted to cancel the call for police assistance. Chamberlain went on to tell the LifeAid operator that the police had drawn their guns and were attempting to break down his door. Again, listen closely.\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : Officers, this is LifeAid. Are you inside Mr. Chamberlain's home?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: They're breaking in my door! They're breaking in my door!\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : Mr. Chamberlain, I heard you say they're breaking in your door. Are you OK?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: My door.\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : Mr. Chamberlain, are you OK?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I'm fine!\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : OK. You pressed your medical button. That's why the officers are there. Can you go to the door and speak to them?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I'm not opening up the door. They've got their guns out! They have their guns out!\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : OK. Do you have weapon, Mr. Chamberlain?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I [inaudible] weapons. I am just protecting myself.\n\nLIFEAID OPERATOR : OK. They're not there to hurt you. I'm here on the line.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER : Mr. Chamberlain, we're not here to help - hurt you. We're here to give you a hand, help you out.\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I'm OK! I told you I was OK! [inaudible] I'm OK! I'm fine! Leave me alone! I'm fine!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Leave me alone,\" says Kenneth Chamberlain. One of the officers, Stephen Hart, was accused of hurling a racial slur, the N-word, at Chamberlain during the incident. Listen carefully to this audio, released by the White Plains Police Department. You can hear the Officer Hart banging on Chamberlain's window. Chamberlain repeatedly says, \"Don't do that. I'm OK.\" The officer responds, yes, by using the N-word. Listen closely.\n\nOFFICER STEPHEN HART : Mr. Chamberlain!\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: Don't do that, sir. Don't do that. Don't do that, officer. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that. Do not do that! I'm telling you I'm OK!\n\nOFFICER STEPHEN HART : I don't give a [bleep], nigger!\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I'm telling you I'm OK!\n\nOFFICER STEPHEN HART : [inaudible]\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: I'm telling you I'm OK.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A video camera on the police Taser gun recorded the next sequence. You can hear Kenneth Chamberlain say the police have stun guns and shotguns. He then predicts the police will kill him. Again, a warning: This contains disturbing footage.\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: They have stun guns and shotguns! [inaudible]\n\nPOLICE OFFICER : Mr. Chamberlain! Mr. Chamberlain!\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: They've come to kill me with that, because I have a bad heart.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mr. Chamberlain says, \"I have a bad heart.\" While the police were threatening to break down his door, Chamberlain's sister called the police - she was contacted by LifeAid - in an attempt to defuse the situation. Soon after, she was assured the police would not shoot her brother. But that is just what happened. Police video shows the moment police broke down his door and shot him with a Taser. TV viewers will see a few quick glimpses of Kenneth Chamberlain, the 68-year-old man, who was wearing boxer shorts and no shirt. He had been woken up. This video was recorded by a camera on the police Taser. Listen closely. You can hear the sound of the Taser.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER : You got it?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: Shoot! Shoot me! No! Shoot me! Shoot me!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER : Need another cartridge?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: Shoot me!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You can actually see the electricity shooting Kenneth Chamberlain. The video cuts out at this point. Within minutes, Kenneth Chamberlain was shot dead by the police who entered his home. This horrific story is told in the recent feature film The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain .\n\nWell, for more, we're joined by Ken Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., who's been fighting for justice in his father's death since 2011. And we're joined by the family's attorney, Mayo Bartlett.\n\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! This killing that we have covered for years, Kenneth Chamberlain, the significance of what has just taken place? I mean, I share our condolences once again, after all of these years, and I'm sure you are reliving this this week as we deal with the George Floyd case. But in the midst of all of this, a judge has overturned a recent - the decision that threw out the lawsuit you had filed.\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN JR.: Well, thank you, Amy, first, for having us on the show. And just listening to that audio, I've kind of had to kind of regain my composure. It's been a while since I've heard all of the audio like that.\n\nBut we've maintained all along, as the Constitution said, that it is the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects from unreasonable search and seizure, and that no warrant shall issue without probable cause. And this is what this fight has been about, you know, what these officers did on November 19, 2011, when my father inadvertently triggered his LifeAid pendant, and, in doing so, the police responded and ended up killing him.\n\nNow, with this coming out around the killing of George Floyd and the rallying, the protesting, its significance, I can't really speak to. But what I can say is that what you're seeing happening around the world right now is not just about the killing of George Floyd. It's about the killing of Tamir Rice. It's about the killing of Ramarley Graham. It's about the killing of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. and the countless other names that I can't even begin to mention.\n\nSo, we're pleased that these appellate judges vacated the original ruling, and we look forward to our day in court. And hopefully, this time around, we will get a fair trial.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mayo Bartlett, I wanted to ask you the significance of the 2nd Circuit Court decision. This has been now a case, nine years now, that has been, in one way or another, in the courts. And the fact that they claim that the lower court did not - erred in not saying that the police were unlawful in their entry into Mr. Chamberlain's home. Here, a former marine, sleeping peacefully in his own home, ends up dead.\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Yes. Well, thank you very much.\n\nYou know, it was always our position that there was never a reason for Mr. Chamberlain to have had his home invaded in the first place. And it wasn't necessarily the role of the court to make that determination, but it certainly was the role of the court to allow us to at least argue that to a jury so that a jury could make a reasonable determination one way or the other. We were prevented from doing that. So, as a consequence, it's been our position all along that there was no full and fair trial on the merits of this case. And we're thankful now.\n\nAnd it happens to even be something that unites people on the left and the right, because when you look at people who are on the right that you might consider to be extremists, one of the primary things that they talk about is the sanctity of a person's home. And you're right, whether it's the right to bear arms, but certainly the right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. So this is something where I would believe that most people would be able to agree, that when you're at home sleeping and you haven't committed any crime, that you wouldn't expect that the police are going to break your door down and kill you, in particular if they're responding for a medical call where you'd think that they're there to help you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to go to break, then come back to this discussion. We're talking to attorney Mayo Bartlett and Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. He is the son of Ken Chamberlain, a former marine, who was at home sleeping, turned over on his life alert necklace. He had a heart condition. The LifeAid people couldn't reach him and called the police. They came in for a wellness check and ended up shooting him dead. We'll be back with them in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"The Seven Last Words of the Unarmed\" by composer Joel Thompson, performed by the Sphinx, led by conductor Eugene Rogers. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we turn to a film. We're speaking with Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., his father shot dead by White Plains police in 2011, and Mayo Bartlett, the attorney for the family. On Monday, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a federal judge was wrong to dismiss parts of a lawsuit against the police for excessive use of force. A new feature film, The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain , tells the story of what happened the night White Plains police came to Chamberlain's apartment. This is the trailer.\n\nCANDACE WADE : [played by Anika Noni Rose] Mr. Chamberlain, this is Candace Wade with Life Guard Medical Alerts. This line is being recorded. We just received an activation from your pendant. Do you have an emergency? I'm not getting a response from you. I'm going to dispatch emergency services now.\n\nOFFICER ROSSI : [played by Enrico Natale] White Plains police. We're here for a welfare check.\n\nOFFICER JACKSON : [played by Ben Marten] Open this door!\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN SR.: [played by Frankie Faison] You're not coming into my home! Help me! Help me! I need help!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kenneth Chamberlain was played by Frankie Faison in a remarkable film that just recently came out. Kenneth Chamberlain Jr., your thoughts, as this country surges with uprisings all over, not only the country, but the world, this decision coming down in the midst of this?\n\nKENNETH CHAMBERLAIN JR.: Again, first, let me just say that, of course, my family and I are extremely overjoyed that the original ruling was vacated.\n\nI think that - and as far as what's going on in the country, I think that people are now coming together, and they're saying that extrajudicial killings and summary executions of unarmed Black men, women and children is no longer going to be tolerated. I mean, what we have been witnessing for decades are crimes against humanity. So, to see such a diverse group of people coming together, saying that they're no longer going to tolerate this, this is beautiful. And the fact that they made this ruling, if I can use my platform to help effect positive change, then that's what I'm going to do.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mayo Bartlett, I wanted to ask you - the Supreme Court is slated to decide very soon whether it will take up cases that deal with qualified immunity. Could you talk - what is qualified immunity, and how does it affect this particular case?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Qualified immunity is a doctrine which the Supreme Court actually created, which gives police an extraordinary shield for their conduct. And it's a shielding that no other person in the country has, says that unless we can find, basically, that no other reasonable officer anywhere could have done what this officer did, that person is going to be found to be exonerated. You're going to say that their conduct is absolved. And it requires a tremendous burden on the part of people trying to bring these cases.\n\nThe other thing that it does is it deters lots of lawyers from taking these cases, because you dedicate a lot of time and a lot of money into these cases, and it may be four or five years - or, in our case, we're here nine years, almost 10 years later, without having a resolution. And sometimes these qualified immunity decisions don't come until fairly late in the game, after you've already invested a lot of time and money. So it's a deterrent for people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And again, no officer was charged in this case? I mean, there were many officers, including Officer Hart, who shot Kenneth Chamberlain dead, undisputed?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Absolutely. And one of the things we've asked for from the beginning is for an independent investigator. And when you look at these cases, there should also, in my estimation, be a change in the grand jury system. The grand jury should not be an arm of the prosecutor. It should be independent, equally accessible from the defense as well as civil sides and also for the prosecutor, should not be on the third or fourth floor of a DA's office. And you should be able to see what happened in a grand jury. It shouldn't be secret. There's no need for it to be secret. If there is a need, then you can make an application to a court for a protective order. But we believe that needs to change, as well as the disciplinary procedures against police. Where there's been a finding of misconduct, that also should be public and readily available. You should not have to go to the police department to find out what misconduct your officers may have engaged in.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : There's no time limit on murder. Why can't the officer be charged now?\n\nMAYO BARTLETT : Well, you know, it's interesting. There's been no jeopardy that's attached. The officer certainly could be charged now. And you also have to -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to have to leave it there. I want to thank you, though, Mayo Bartlett, attorney for the family of Kenneth Chamberlain, and especially Ken Chamberlain Jr. himself.\n\nThat does it for our show. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. Stay safe.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police drove hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people into the streets, demanding both justice for Floyd and other victims of the police, and fundamental change to policing itself. \"Defund the Police,\" is being heard coast to coast from people tired of the cycle of police violence, protest, promised reform, and then... nothing. In Minneapolis, a supermajority of the city council has committed to dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department.\n\n\"We haven't seen a moment like this in at least half a century,\" said Harvard professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad, author of \"The Condemnation of Blackness,\" speaking on the Democracy Now! news hour, \"with protesters taking to the streets to demand, once and for all, not just police reform and accountability, but the prospect of a new vision of a relationship between state authorities and the health of a community.\"\n\nIn Minneapolis, four officers face prosecution for George Floyd's murder. But the public wants more than convictions, which, in themselves, are far from certain according to Minnesota's first African American Attorney General Keith Ellison. Ellison took charge of the prosecution over concerns that the county prosecutor had a pro-police bias. After decades of impunity, violence against residents, and dismal success solving violent crimes, many in Minneapolis want their police department torn down.\n\n\"We've got to create a system of public safety that works for everybody,\" City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison said on Democracy Now! He is Keith Ellison's son, and knows personally about the MPD's penchant for violence. In 2015, amidst mass nonviolent protests following the police killing of yet another young African American man named Jamar Clark, an MPD officer pointed a gun at Jeremiah's head as he held his hands in the air.\n\n\"We did a study last year of 911 calls, and we realized that one of the top calls that police make are for what we call emotionally disturbed persons or mental health calls,\" Jeremiah Ellison continued. \"Do we need a gun present at a call like that? I think that the answer to that is no.\"\n\nIn New York City, groups have labored for decades to reform the New York Police Department, with its ever-lengthening list of unarmed black men killed by its officers: Amadou Diallo, Patrick Dorismond, Ousmane Zongo, Timothy Stansbury Jr.. Sean Bell, Ramarley Graham, Eric Garner and the list goes on. Veteran activist Linda Sarsour helped organize a march in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, demanding change. \"Over 50,000 people came out with us,\" she said on Democracy Now! \"Let the cops do what the cops are supposed to do: keep people safe. They are not social workers. They are not mental health professionals. They are not educators...All we're saying is, decrease their budget, take that money and reappropriate it into youth, seniors, community development, and with a focus on those who have been the most directly impacted, on communities of color, poor working-class people.\"\n\nAs people have risen up demanding justice for George Floyd and policies to address the enduring plague of racism in the United States, the police, the National Guard, and President Trump and his minions have done everything they can to violently suppress dissent. Activists have been beaten, tear gassed, maced, shot and arrested en masse. Nonviolent protesters and journalists alike have lost eyes, been rammed by cars and trucks, suffered broken limbs. At a rally in San Jose, California, police shot their own anti-bias trainer in the groin with a rubber-coated steel ball bullet, bursting his testicle. Derrick Sanderlin, a 27-year-old African American, may never be able to father children.\n\nAs the tear gas clears, police reform laws are beginning to get passed. Chokeholds have been banned in New York State and Colorado, as well as in Houston and Raleigh, NC. The U.S. House of Representatives is advancing a bill that will ban chokeholds in federal law enforcement. It will also create a national database of violent cops, so a fired officer can't simply move to a police department in some other city or town.\n\nAfter George Floyd's funeral Tuesday, his younger brother, Philonise, flew to Washington, DC, where he testified before the House Judiciary Committee: \"George wasn't hurting anyone that day. He didn't deserve to die over twenty dollars. I am asking you, is that what a black man's worth? Twenty dollars? This is 2020. Enough is enough.\"\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In Ohio, former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing shot and killed 43-year-old Sam DuBose last year after stopping him for not having a front license plate. In North Charleston, South Carolina, officer Michael Slager faces a murder charge after a bystander filmed Slager shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott in the back as he ran away. For more, we speak with Carol Anderson, professor of African American studies at Emory University. She is the author, most recently, of \"White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your book is called White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide .\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the white rage that you're witnessing today.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : That rage covers itself. So, when I talk about white rage, I don't actually mean the Klan and the cross burning, because that's simple. In this society, we know how to identify that. This is the much more subtle, the much more destructive type of racial violence. And it emanates out of Congress, out of the Supreme Court, out of state legislatures. And it's designed to, in fact, undercut black achievement, black aspirations and black advancement.\n\nSo we see that, for instance, with-when Trump, at the presidential debate, and they said, \"Well, how would you handle issues of racial healing and the racial divide?\" and he said, \"I've got words that somebody refuses to say, and that's 'law and order,' and that's 'stop and frisk.'\" That is a dog whistle. That is-those are policies that, in fact, undermined the Civil Rights Act of '64 and the Voting Rights Act of '65, has led to mass disfranchisement, so that you've got almost 8 percent of the black population unable to vote.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to Donald Trump in North Carolina instructing security guards to remove a black man from the crowd, describing him as a thug.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : You know the great thing about that-we have a protester. By the way, were you paid $1,500 to be a thug? Where is the protester? Where is he? Was he paid? You can get him out. Get him out. Out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : While Donald Trump described the man as a protester, it turned out he was actually a Trump supporter. Sixty-three-year-old C.J. Carey said he went to the rally to give Trump a letter. Professor Anderson?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Yes, and it begins to tell you that-so, for all of Trump's outreach to the black community, there was no outreach. The point was, is that his racism was so palpable that it was turning off white educated voters, and so he tried to smooth that edge. But, in fact, the racism that is undermining-undermining, but undergirding, his campaign is there, so a supporter is immediately a thug. So, a black man is immediately criminalized as thug. And this is a businessman who is a Trump supporter. And that gives you some sense of the kind of perspective, the policy perspective, that Trump will enact if he becomes president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What were you most surprised by as you researched White Rage ?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : I was surprised by how consistent and supple white rage was, how it consistently used the language of democracy, the language of freedom, the language of protecting the integrity of the ballot box, as a means to undermine and undercut. So, we get not only the Shelby County v. Holder , which gutted the Voting Rights Act, but we also get, for instance, in the Brown decision, where the Supreme Court has said \"separate but equal\" cannot be the law of the land, and watching these people who say that they are inherently about democracy, in fact, undermining that democracy by violating court orders consistently, over and over again, kind of like what we're seeing right now as the Fourth Circuit, for instance, has told North Carolina, you know, \"Your voter suppression laws can't stand,\" and they keep doing it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about other developments this week. Jury selection began on Monday in two high-profile murder trials: white police officers who killed unarmed black man. In Ohio, the former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing shot and killed 43-year-old Sam DuBose last year after stopping him for not having a front license plate. And then there's the case in North Charleston, South Carolina, officer Michael Slager facing a murder charge after a bystander filmed Slager shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott in the back as he ran away. In that case, Walter Scott was stopped by the police officer as he was driving into the AutoZone shop right nearby for, I think it was, a broken taillight. He was stopped for the taillight, and he ends up being shot by the police officer.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Yes, yes, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The trials come as a Justice Department investigation into the choking death of unarmed African American Eric Garner by New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo is in disarray. The New York Times reported last week that the New York-based FBI agents and federal prosecutors are no longer assigned to the investigation. They did not feel Pantaleo should be charged. The shake-up leaves prosecutors with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in charge, making it far more likely officers will face criminal charges.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : And part of what we're seeing right here is the policy of stop and frisk, which came after the advances of the civil rights movement. And so, stop and frisk is based on the broken windows theory of policing. And it says, what we have to do-if we stop these little minor crimes, then we can really stop the big ones form happening. But that's not what really goes on. In fact, you get the criminalization of blackness. In New York City, for instance, although blacks and Latinos made up 50 percent of the population, they accounted for 84 percent of those stopped, although twice as many weapons were found on the handful of whites that were stopped as opposed to blacks and Latinos. And so, if this was really about law enforcement, you would see greater policing of the white population. This is about something else. And so, what we're seeing in the case of the broken taillight, in terms of the expired tag, that's that hyperpolicing that's going on because of stop and frisk, and it leads to the death of black people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have linked the problem with policing today to education.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You say we wouldn't face anything like this today, if what?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : If Brown had really been implemented. Because part of what we know is that what a solid, quality education does, in terms of employment, in terms of health, in terms of voting rights-all of those things are really linked to education. But Brown -after Brown , the states fought back so intensely, even to the point where they shut down a public school system for five years. And so, it's like you were in school at the fifth grade, and your school doesn't open again until you're in the 10th? And the states fought back so hard that we're ending up with large numbers of African Americans who do not have the quality education that they have a constitutional right to. And so, now we're asking the police force to then deal with those issues emanating out of poverty, emanating out of the lack of quality education.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you see-how do you assess President Bill Clinton's administration when it comes to issues of white rage, black disempowerment, black empowerment, and then Hillary Clinton?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : So, for Bill Clinton, part of what I see is that he went the route of the Southern strategy, which was to play to the blacks as criminals. And this is where you see-and blacks as welfare cheats. And so, this is where you see his workforce legislation. This is where you see the kind of hyperpolicing with superpredators and all of that. And this led-again, it fed into the mass incarceration of the black population. Now, what Bill Clinton would do is he would try to play culturally black-so that was, you know, the saxophone on Arsenio or all that-but the way that his policies worked were in fact very anti-black. Now, with Hillary, what I see is that she was there with him in the '90s.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, let's go back to that moment in 1996 when she was first lady, when she described some African-American youth as superpredators.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Yes.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON : They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators-no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : At CNN's Democratic debate in Flint, Michigan, earlier this year, Clinton was asked about her comments again.\n\nDON LEMON : Secretary Clinton, in 1996, you used the term \"superpredators\" to describe some young kids. Some feel like it was racial code. Was it? And were you wrong to use that term?\n\nHILLARY CLINTON : Well, I was speaking about drug cartels and criminal activity that was very concerning to folks across the country. I think it was a poor choice of words-I never used it before, I haven't used it since, I would not use it again.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that was Hillary Clinton. That was during the primaries, when she was debating Bernie Sanders. Your comments, Professor Anderson?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : My comments are that when I see that, it's like Hillary was, in that moment in 1996, right along with Bill, and now that she realizes that the demographics in the Democratic Party have changed, that that coding doesn't work as well, it doesn't play as well, and so you see her stepping back. And I think part of what I'm also seeing, frankly, has been the pushing on that from the Black Lives Matter activists, who are helping her-and the Bernie folks, who are helping her begin to see what structural racism actually does in this society. So, in fact, when she mentioned-I think it was in the-one of the presidential debates, that we have to deal with structural racism, that was a major leap forward. But that requires then consistent pressure consistently be put on her to deal with what that really means policywise, so it can't just be a slogan that gets dropped during the presidential campaign.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Carol Anderson, I want to thank you very much for being with us. Carol Anderson is professor of African American studies at Emory University. Her new book is called White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide . When we come back from break, we go to Iceland to speak with the poet and activist Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She is co-founder of the Pirate Party, that made major gains in Iceland. That's the anarchist party of Iceland. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Despite comprising about 66 percent of the local population, African Americans accounted for 93 percent of arrests, 88 percent of incidents where force was used, 90 percent of citations and 85 percent of traffic stops. The Justice Department, which launched its report after the police killing of Michael Brown, also uncovered at least three municipal Ferguson emails containing racist language or images. \"The report does not give me hope.

What we see now is that we do have the power to make things change. The question is are we going to transition from protest politics to long-term, strategic movement building?\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: The U.S. Justice Department has concluded that police and city courts in Ferguson, Missouri, routinely engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against African Americans. Attorney General Eric Holder ordered the report-that's being issued today-after the police shooting of unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown last August. Brown's death sparked months of protests in Ferguson and around the country. In a separate report, the Justice Department is expected to clear the police officer, Darren Wilson, of civil rights violations in the shooting of Brown.\n\nThe Justice Department study of Ferguson's records from 2012 to 2014 found African Americans made up 93 percent of arrests in Ferguson while accounting for only 67 percent of the population. In addition, the report found in 88 percent of the cases in which Ferguson police used force, it was against African Americans, and all 14 cases of police dog bites involved blacks.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Investigators also found that African Americans constituted 96 percent of people arrested in traffic stops solely for an outstanding warrant, 95 percent of jaywalking charges, 94 percent of failure-to-comply charges, 92 percent of all disturbing-the-peace charges. With traffic stops, African-American motorists are twice as likely to be searched when pulled over, even though searches of white drivers are more likely to turn up drugs or other contraband.\n\nThe Justice Department report uncovered at least three municipal Ferguson emails containing racist language or images. One email sent by a Ferguson police or municipal court official joked in 2008 Barack Obama would not remain as president for long because, quote, \"what black man holds a steady job for four years.\" Another email suggested more abortions by African-American women would lower crime. It read, quote, \"An African-American woman in New Orleans was admitted into the hospital for a pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, 'Crimestoppers.'?\" A third email uncovered in the Ferguson probe included a cartoon depicting African Americans as monkeys. It has not been revealed yet who wrote those emails.\n\nThe Justice Department report has renewed calls for police accountability from activists and those close to Michael Brown's family. This is St. Louis City Alderman Antonio French, followed by Brown family attorney Anthony Gray.\n\nANTONIO FRENCH : To me, that demands a certain level of accountability, and I think the chief out there has to resign. It's the only way that this community can move forward.\n\nANTHONY GRAY : No shock here at all, no surprise, as we have to take now what is publicly known to be a situation, come up with solutions, then execute whatever those solutions are, go back and measure the results, and then see if we made some progress from there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Michelle Alexander, civil rights advocate, author of the best-selling book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness . She's a law professor at Ohio State University. Her New York Times op-ed in November was titled \"Telling My Son About Ferguson.\"\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now!\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : I'm happy to be here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It's great to have you with us. I know you're giving two major addresses here in New York, at Union Theological Seminary tonight and then Friday night at Columbia University. But let's start with that op-ed. What did you tell your son about Ferguson?\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : Well, it's difficult, you know, as a mother to have to tell your son, my 10-year-old son, that I knew that the officer who shot Michael Brown wouldn't be charged. And I knew it before the grand jury came back. I knew it before the Justice Department announced that it wouldn't be filing charges. I knew it because police officers are almost never charged for killing unarmed black men. And that's the way it is in this country. And it was incredibly difficult to tell him that. And I found, as I began to talk to him about the realities of race and justice in America, that I was tempted to lie. I was tempted to say, \"No, really, nothing like that could ever happen to you, son.\" And yet, unfortunately, today, in this current era, you know, a time of so-called colorblindness, the age of Obama, parents have to have conversations with their children that are eerily reminiscent of the kinds of conversations parents had to have with their kids decades ago. And so, it's my hope-really, my prayer-that the uprising we saw in Ferguson is the beginning of a new, bold, radical, courageous movement for justice that will ensure that parents in the future don't have to tell their children that in the eyes of their law they don't matter.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: When you talk about parents having to have these conversations with their children, notably, here in New York City, the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, discussed that very issue in the midst of the Ferguson protests about having to have a conversation with his biracial son about watching out for interactions with police, and he took enormous heat and enormous attacks by the local police union over even daring to talk about that. I'm wondering your reaction when you heard about that.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : Well, telling the truth isn't popular today. That's the reality. And I think, though, what we've seen, you know, in recent months is the necessity of telling the truth. You know, I look at what's gone down in the last few months, and it seems clear to me that, first and foremost, change comes when people stand up, speak unpopular truths and are willing to take real risks in the name of justice. There is no way that the Justice Department would have investigated what was going on in Ferguson, you know, if the young people there hadn't stood up and taken to the streets.\n\nAnd what the Justice Department report demonstrates is that we're not crazy. You know, the young people in Ferguson, the old people in Ferguson, who said, \"We feel like we're living in occupied territory,\" were telling the truth. You know, we have some sense now, based on this report, of why Michael Brown might have been so frustrated and so angry when he was being harassed by the police for jaywalking. You get some sense of what's really going on in these communities. And so, you know, we're not crazy. There is a system of racial and social control in communities of color across America.\n\nAnd if we don't stand up, speak unpopular truths, take to the streets and organize, things aren't going to change. But, you know, what we see now is that we do have the power to make things change. And the question is: Are we going to transition from protest politics to long-term, strategic movement building?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, you mentioned jaywalking. I mean, I was struck in this report by the figures that 94 percent of all the people arrested for jaywalking, you'd think the most inconsequential of misdemeanors or violations, were African-American. And as if the-clearly, African Americans don't jaywalk at a greater percentage than white Americans. It's just astonishing that even in jaywalking you'd see this enormous disparity.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : Absolutely, but you see that disparity right here in New York City, as well. You know, I think it's so important that we don't think of this as a problem in Ferguson that is somehow unique to that community. You know, thanks to \"broken windows\" policing here in New York City, you have statistics that rival the ones that we see in Ferguson. You know, the New York Civil Liberties Union issued a report showing that here in New York City more than 80 percent of those who are issued summons for things like jaywalking, you know, are people of color. And the revenue streams that fund the criminal courts in New York City, just like those in Ferguson, come from poor people paying tickets for minor offenses that are being enforced against them but aren't being enforced in other parts of town.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And we see that it's lethal. I mean, the jaywalking, which is so minor-what exactly was Michael Brown stopped for by Darren Wilson?\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Because he was walking in the middle of the road. And being there-I mean, this was not a very trafficked road; it was a back road to the main roads. And the fact that these two young men were simply walking on the street. Now, how is it-you're an attorney, you clerked for Justice Blackmun-how is it that Darren Wilson didn't get charged with violating civil rights, let alone indicted, but now the Ferguson police, the courts are found to be systematically discriminating against, and those figures are being cited, like stopping an African American for jaywalking?\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : Yes, well, I mean, I think what we have here is a unwillingness, an unwillingness to hold individual officers accountable for the unjustified lethal force that is being used against, you know, African-American men and others. I mean, we've seen, you know, what's happened with Latinos in other parts of the country. This isn't just limited to black men. And we see also this kind of force has been used against women, black women. But, you know, I think what we see here is an unwilling to hold individual officers accountable even in the face of overwhelming evidence that the system as a whole is discriminatory.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Does this report give you any hope, as you talk to your son now? I mean, no, Darren Wilson was not indicted. No, he wasn't found guilty of violating the civil rights of Michael Brown. But now this report is coming out today that says the Ferguson police and the city courts do violate the rights of African Americans.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : No, the report doesn't give me hope. What gives me hope is that people across America are finally waking up. That's what gives me hope. A single report, even a single indictment, isn't going to make a difference unless people become organized and commit themselves to the hard work of movement building on behalf of poor people of all colors. And I see that beginning, and that's what gives me hope.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And yet these kinds of shootings continue. We had the-in Pasco, Washington, Antonio Zambrano-Montes shot by the police this past Sunday.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : Yes.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: In Los Angeles, a homeless man in Los Angeles shot-again, caught on video once again-by police. So, we have these continuing incidents occurring.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : And they will continue. They absolutely will continue, until we move beyond the sporadic protests that occur to serious movement building. And I think that's the challenge. And I think it's also important that we not get too easily satisfied with minor reforms or when, you know, the Justice Department says, \"Well, here's a report,\" or, \"We're going to file one suit.\" No, the kind of change that needs to happen in our police departments and our criminal justice system as a whole is of such a scale that it is not going to happen merely by, you know, the good intentions-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : With a consent decree?\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER : With-right, with a single consent decree or good intentions of some legislators tinkering around the edges. We need transformational change of our criminal justice system, not just, you know, a handful of consent decrees or policy reforms.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So we're going to talk about what that transformational change would look like. We're talking to Michelle Alexander, civil rights advocate, author of the best-selling book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness . She's a law professor at Ohio State University in Columbus. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

So far none of the blazes have been labeled as hate crimes, but investigators say at least three fires were caused by arson. The fires began on June 21, just days after the Charleston massacre, and have occurred in six different states: Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Ohio. We are joined by Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been tracking these most recent fires.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Bree Newsome singing \"Stay Strong: A Love Song to Freedom Fighters.\" Bree Newsome is the 30-year-old African-American woman who scaled the flagpole on the grounds of the Columbia, South Carolina, Capitol and took down the Confederate flag, saying, \"In the name of God, this flag comes down today.\" She'll be our guest on Democracy Now! on Monday. Tomorrow, we'll describe what took place when we were in Columbia just after her arrest, when we saw her being arraigned at the jail. But this is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe're talking about the FBI launching an investigation into fires set at seven different African-American churches in seven days. So far, none of the blazes have been labeled as hate crimes, but investigators say at least three fires were caused by arson. The fires began on June 21st, just days after the Charleston massacre, June 17th, and have occurred in six different states: in Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Ohio.\n\nA black church in South Carolina was the latest to catch fire. The blaze on Tuesday at the Mount Zion African Methodist Church in Greeleyville may have been triggered by lightning. Twenty years ago, the church was burned to the ground by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Meanwhile, in Knoxville, Tennessee, a fire at the Seventh-Day Adventist Church was determined to be arson. A reporter at local station WVLT spoke to church elder Marshall Henley.\n\nKELSEY LEYRER : Two different fires were started at College Hill Seventh-Day Adventist last night, one at a side entrance to the church where churchgoers says it appears someone set fire to bales of hay right outside the doors. The church van was also set on fire. And to make matters worse, the church only got the van about six months ago. It was vital to a lot of the church's community outreach projects. Some of those will now have to be placed on hold because they believe that van is a total loss.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Another fire on June 23rd at the predominantly black God's Power Church of Christ in Macon, Georgia, was also reportedly set on purpose. Then, on June 24th, there was a fire at the Fruitland Presbyterian Church in Gibson County, Tennessee, that was suspected to have been caused by lightning. The same day, there was a three-alarm fire at Briar Creek Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. Local station WBTV spoke to the church's pastor, Mannix Kinsey.\n\nREV . MANNIX KINSEY : When I got here, I was even amazed to see that the flames were so high. And, you know, of course, I'm thinking, \"Oh, my goodness, this church is going to be destroyed.\"\n\nDEDRICK RUSSELL : The estimated damage is more than $250,000. The pastor of three years is grateful brick and mortar was all that was ruined.\n\nREV . MANNIX KINSEY : A life was not lost. You know that the buildings can be repaired, they can be built over.\n\nDEDRICK RUSSELL : While the pastor deals with this fire, he also has to deal with the fact this may be a hate crime.\n\nREV . MANNIX KINSEY : We're still talking about this same issue, and this is 2015. And so, we all have to consider what else do we need to do, you know, to actually be able to work together.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, on June 26, there was another fire at a Glover [Grove] Baptist Church in Warrenville, South Carolina, that was first burned down 20 years ago by the KKK , and one at the Greater Miracle Temple Apostolic Holiness Church in Tallahassee, Florida, that was caused by a tree limb that fell and started an electrical fire. Another fire was in Ohio, where the College Heights Baptist Church burned down Saturday night.\n\nOn Wednesday, NAACP President Cornell William Brooks issued a statement in response to the fires. He referred to the Charleston massacre that preceded them, writing, quote, \"When nine students of scripture lose their lives in a house of worship, we cannot to turn a blind eye to any incident. As we wait for authorities to conduct their investigations, the NAACP and our state conferences across the country will remain vigilant and work with local churches and local law enforcement to ensure that all are taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of every parishioner.\"\n\nAll of this comes as the KKK has announced a rally for later this month at the South Carolina state House in support of the Confederate flag. There are reports South Carolina legislators now have enough votes to push through the flag's removal.\n\nFor more, we go to Montgomery, Alabama, where we're joined by Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been tracking these most recent fires.\n\nRichard, welcome back to Democracy Now!\n\nRICHARD COHEN : Thank you, Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the significance of what's happening throughout the South now.\n\nRICHARD COHEN : Well, look, when it comes to race, the country is on edge, especially the black community. You know, we have a background of the killing of unarmed black men at the hands of the police. You add to this the Charleston massacre and now this string of fires at black churches. You know, it's just a very combustible combination. You know, it's certainly true that perhaps most of these fires are not arsons, and maybe none of the arsons are hate-motivated. But still, you can understand, with emotions so raw, you know, why people react this way. And certainly, you can't dismiss the possibility that at least some of these fires have been set in retaliation for the taking down of the Confederate flags. There's a lot of anger in the white nationalist community over what's been happening lately.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, take the one in Greeleyville, the church burning down, the most recent one in Greeleyville, South Carolina. Governor Haley, Nikki Haley, came out immediately and said it was clearly lightning. She said something like, \"We saw the lightning hit the top of the church.\" But then people within the investigation said, \"How does she know this?\" This was reported on a TV station close to those who were investigating. But that church does have a history. Talk about what happened 20 years ago in Greeleyville.\n\nRICHARD COHEN : Well, you know, there was a group called the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan that was involved in burning the Greeleyville church, as well as the Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon, South Carolina. We actually had the privilege at the Southern Poverty Law Center of representing the Macedonia Baptist Church and got a multimillion-dollar verdict against the Klan for the burning of that church. It put the Klan, you know, kind of out of business. So, you know, you have this kind of history, and I guess Governor Haley is trying to tamp down emotions and maybe spoke too quickly. And I guess it's-it's important to realize that you shouldn't jump to conclusions in either direction too fast.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you think has to be done right now, Richard Cohen?\n\nRICHARD COHEN : Well, look, all of these fires have to be investigated thoroughly. And, you know, I think the forensic experts are very, very good at that. And then I think that we have to continue to look at the racial issues that divide us. You know, we're at an interesting point in our history, an interesting point in time, when suddenly people, especially in the white community, I think, are suddenly more aware of the divisive nature of some of the symbols, like the Confederate flag, like Confederate holidays, and, I think, are more willing to address not just those symbols, but some of the substance that continues to keep our country separate and unequal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Calling for congressional hearings into domestic terrorism?\n\nRICHARD COHEN : Yes. We have called for those hearings before both the Senate and the House, the committees that look at the Department of Homeland Security. You know, since 9/11, we've-you know, our resources in the domestic terrorism fight have skewed perhaps too heavily towards jihadi terrorism, at the expense of the forms of domestic terrorism that we saw exhibited in the Charleston massacre. You know, what we think is, we should allocate our resources in accordance with the nature of the threat. 9/11 will always be the Pearl Harbor of our time, but that doesn't mean all the resources should go in that direction.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In Alabama, the governor, unlike Governor Haley in South Carolina, simply, without talking about it beforehand, took down the flags on the state Capitol, the Confederate flag. Can you talk about the significance of this? You're in Montgomery.\n\nRICHARD COHEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And also, he's supposed to be making another announcement today.\n\nRICHARD COHEN : I'm not sure what his announcement is today, Amy, but I can tell you, we were incredibly happy and applauded the governor for what he did. It was very, very forward-looking. And I think it was really quite an important thing, and probably a difficult thing for him to do politically. Another thing that I want to applaud the governor for is, you know, he disagreed with the Supreme Court same-sex marriage decision, but he immediately came out and said, you know, \"It's the law of the land, and we should follow it.\" And that's not the case with all politicians in Alabama. The chief justice of Alabama, Roy Moore, is still on his soapbox ranting and raving against the same-sex marriage ruling. So I think, you know, Governor Bentley should be applauded for helping the state look forward rather than backward.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, it has been very much kept under wraps, what he's going to announce today, but it might relate to that. Has anti- LGBT violence increased since the same-sex marriage ruling of the Supreme Court?\n\nRICHARD COHEN : Well, I don't know if we've seen any uptick since the same-sex marriage ruling. What we have seen, though, is an apparent uptick in the recent years, because as more-you know, more people in the LGBTQ community feel comfortable coming out, you know, they're more likely to be targeted, because it's more-they're more open. You know, in terms of sheer numbers, hate crimes against black people are the most common. On the other hand, from a percentage standpoint, the LGBT community is the most likely to be victimized by hate crimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Richard Cohen, I want to thank you for being with us, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, speaking to us from Montgomery, Alabama. Tune in tomorrow for our Independence Day special, as James Earl Jones reads Frederick Douglass's 1852 address: \"What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July?\"\n\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS : [read by James Earl Jones] What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days of the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is a constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You'll hear the whole speech on tomorrow's broadcast, as well as our remembrance of the late, great folksinger Pete Seeger.\n\nPETE SEEGER : We shall overcome. We shall overcome. We shall overcome some day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's tomorrow on Democracy Now! Tune in as we remember Pete Seeger and also go down to Columbia, South Carolina, to describe those moments when Bree Newsome took down the flag. I'll be speaking tonight at 7:30 in Chicago .

The NFL's on-field protests began in August 2016 when quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem to protest racism and police brutality. The National Football League announced last month that it will fine teams if players refuse to stand for the national anthem before games. Under the new rules adopted by the league's 32 owners, players will be allowed to stay in the locker room during the anthem. We speak with NFL three-time Pro Bowler and longtime activist Michael Bennett, who has been part of a movement, led by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, protesting police shootings of unarmed black men. Bennett was recently traded to the Super Bowl champions Philadelphia Eagles-the same team President Trump recently disinvited to the White House. He is the author of a new book, \"Things That Make White People Uncomfortable.\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: In Pennsylvania Monday, hundreds of mourners attended the funeral of Antwon Rose, a 17-year-old African-American high school senior shot and killed last week by an East Pittsburgh police officer. Video of the shooting shows the teenager was shot in the back while trying to flee police after a traffic stop. Police have admitted he was unarmed. Rose was set to graduate from high school this year. The killing has sparked several days of protest in Pittsburgh.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : At the funeral, held at Antwon's high school, two of his friends struggled to read a poem Antwon had written about police brutality in 2016, titled \"I Am Not What You Think!\" That same poem was read by a protester at an earlier demonstration.\n\nPROTESTER : I see mothers bury their sons / I want my mom to never feel that pain / I am confused and afraid / I pretend all is fine / I feel like I'm suffocating.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Antwon's parents, Michelle Kenney and Antwon Rose Sr., spoke Sunday with Good Morning America . Kenney spoke about the significance of the poem.\n\nMICHELLE KENNEY : That's not just a poem. That is the life of many, many young African-American males. It was just that my son wrote it down and he lost his life. My son was truly a beautiful soul. Everyone has stood up. And I'm hoping that it changes the world.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: The officer who shot Antwon Rose has been identified as Michael Rosfeld. He had been sworn in to the city's police department just hours before the shooting. According to the Post-Gazette , Rosfeld left his last job at the University of Pittsburgh police after authorities discovered discrepancies between his sworn statement and evidence in an arrest. The woman who filmed Antwon's killing said it appeared that Rosfeld, quote, \"was taking target practice on this young man's back.\"\n\nAccording to The Washington Post 's database of police shootings, Antwon is one of more than 500 people who have been killed this year by police officers. Last year, police shot dead 987 people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Joining us now is NFL three-time Pro Bowler, longtime activist Michael Bennett, who has been part of a movement, led by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, protesting police shootings of unarmed black men. The on-field protests began in August of 2016, when Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality. The protests spread throughout the NFL . Earlier this year, The New Yorker magazine ran a cover illustration showing Martin Luther King Jr. taking a knee in between Michael Bennett and Colin Kaepernick. While Kaepernick has essentially been blacklisted from the NFL , Michael Bennett is still playing and speaking out. He was recently traded to the Super Bowl champions Philadelphia Eagles-the same team President Trump recently disinvited from the White House. This all comes after the NFL owners recently ruled teams will be fined if players kneel during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality, though they can stay in the locker room. Well, Michael Bennett joins us here in studio. He has a new book; it's called Things That Make White People Uncomfortable .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Michael.\n\nMICHAEL BENNETT : Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you for having me here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It's great to have you with us. Can you talk about the moment you decided to take the knee? Bring us back to that day. What was happening? You were with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nMICHAEL BENNETT : Yeah, I think it was just having empathy and compassion for what was going on in America. How do you have a human connection to what's happening to people? How do you put yourself in their shoes? How do you, you know, feel for Michael Brown's parents or Sandra Bland's family or like so many different people who have been, you know, lives have been lost? And I think that's what it really was really about, you know, Flint, Michigan. It was about Native American rights issues. It was about so many issues, whether it was about women's rights or-it was just about so many things that were happening in America, and how do we create a platform to be able to have a voice for so many people who don't have a voice.\n\nIt's so much bigger than just the police brutality. There are so many issues that are happening that people are not aware of. And a lot of people who watch football, they just kind of just think that when you're in that world, none of that exists. So we wanted to make sure that even though we're playing in this league and we're able to do these things on Sunday and we're these athletes who win and where we get injured, we still are people. And we still are connected to the things and the issues that are happening around us. It could be our family. It could be our sisters. It could be our mothers. But at the same time, we want to be able to bring their stories to life.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what were some of the discussions between your fellow players as the protests kept expanding, and then, of course, as for-the league and then President Trump got involved in trying to stamp them out?\n\nMICHAEL BENNETT : I think it was more about, you know, race. I think, in football, a team is built around people from different backgrounds, people of different religion. And, you know, we all agree on how we're going to win this game and how we're going to do what we could do on Sunday, but we all don't agree about police brutality. We all don't agree because all of us aren't in the same situation when it comes to this. For some strange reason, when it comes to sports, we can come together for those things, but the real issues that we should-at hand, we can't come together. And so, we try to make people understand, you know.\n\nAnd for people who are not in those situations, it's hard for them to listen, because they already are making assumptions about how people should feel. And at the end of the day, it's not really about, you know, do we pick a side, is it the victim, or is it the police. It's really just the people, the human aspect of it. And I think that's what we were trying to connect with people. And I think a lot of people were disconnected between what was happening, because, you know, everybody wants to pick a side. Either you're Democrat or you're Republican. Nobody is really thinking about the human aspect of it all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Earlier this month, President Trump abruptly called off the planned visit of your new team, the Philadelphia Eagles, tweeting, \"Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!\" he tweeted. While not a single Eagles player kneeled during the national anthem in the 2017 season, Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins did protest, by raising a fist during the national anthem, in what has become one of the most enduring images of the protests. During a recent news conference, Jenkins silently held up a series of signs to reporters in a team locker room in response to their questions about the cancellation of the team's White House visit. Among the signs Jenkins displayed, \"You're not listening.\" Another said, \"More than 60 percent of people in prison are people of color.\" Another: \"Colin Kaepernick gave $1 million to charity.\" And another: \"In 2018, 439 people shot and killed by police (thus far).\" This is Malcolm Jenkins speaking about his activism.\n\nMALCOLM JENKINS : The biggest thing is-for me, is, you know, I've done a lot of work on criminal justice reform. And the protest, in itself, is not the end-all, be-all. It's not something I'm looking at to actually make a big change. And so that's kind of why I went back and forth if I wanted to do it this year. But the one thing I didn't want to do is stop publicly, you know, expressing my thoughts, and then suddenly the conversation dies out, and you lose that momentum. I think it's important to continue to do the work behind the scenes, but also continue to use the platform that I have to speak up and open eyes of others.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So that's Malcolm Jenkins, your new teammate.\n\nMICHAEL BENNETT : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I'm wondering your thoughts: Would you go to the White House, if you were-well, if you take the team, with Jenkins, to another Super Bowl and win?\n\nMICHAEL BENNETT : I think it's all about dialogue. I think the conversation is: How do we have dialogue about things that are really happening? If Trump is really wanting to listen to find out why we're taking a knee, that would be something that I'd be down to do, because it's like you don't want to be able to always, you know, make an issue and not be able to have that conversation. And I want to be able to be like, \"Hey, this is what's happening. If you're willing to listen and help us make a change, let's go about it. But if it's not, just a photo, picture, then, no.\" But if it's an opportunity to change the way that America is, or change my communities, I'm always going to take those opportunities to express my needs and express the passion of other people. So, if the opportunity is a real one, I don't mind taking the opportunity to do that. I know a lot of people would be like, \"I can't believe you said that.\" But at the end of the day, it's not so much about the perception of what people feel. It's really about: Are we really going to make a change? Are you really willing to change the educational system? Are you willing to do more work on police reform? Are you willing to do something on bail reform? And how can you help us do that? If you can't help us, then I guess we'll move on.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'm wondering about your sense of the reaction of the NFL hierarchy, the-you don't like to call them \"owners,\" as you say, but the bosses of the NFL , how they have responded to the players expressing-some players expressing their concern about these social issues. And also, why do you think the NBA has been so different? I mean, apparently, the athletes in the NBA get to speak out and say whatever they want, and there's no reaction from the NBA brass. But in the NFL , there is this real rigid nature to their response.\n\nMICHAEL BENNETT : I think the employers, I think they-you know, they have to listen. I think people at work are-whenever the workers are saying what they mean and meaning and standing on what they believe in, they have to start listening. I think a lot of the employers, they've never, ever been in the situations of a black male or a Hispanic male, so they don't understand it. They don't have the compassion. And at first they weren't willing to listen. And then, all of a sudden, everybody started to talk about. The building started to feel about it. It became an American conversation. So they had to come in and ask questions. And I think, slowly, but surely, we started to turn and turn those wheels, and they started to want to say, \"OK, what can we do?\"\n\nAnd I think, you know, there's a big misconception that the NBA is more progressive than the [ NFL ]. I think-I feel that the NBA is less progressive, because they have more. They have more guaranteed contracts, so they could take-you know, the risks that they take aren't going to stop their contracts. I think the NFL players take bigger risks, because they don't have guaranteed contracts. They have more to lose when it comes to injury, when it comes to having concussions, so they take bigger risks when it comes to that. And we forced the league to listen to it. The NBA has done-they've talked about things, but there's never been a national conversation. It wasn't a national conversation until the NFL players stood up in what they believed in, whether it was police reform, immigration. We were the players who stood up for what we believed in.\n\nAnd I think there was a big drought between the athletics of the past and the athletics of now. Between the 2000s-I mean, between the 1990s and the 2000s, there weren't really many athletes who were speaking on social issues. You know, I was a generation who missed that. I was a generation who didn't get to see Muhammad Ali, who didn't get to see John Carlos. I didn't get to see those magnificent things that-when people stood up for what they believe in. And then you look at the athletes that were in my generation, none of them stand up for what they believed in. It was either doing the Nike shoe deals, or it was like money became the most important things, and we forgot about our moral compass. And I think my generation of athletes, we've come back onto that moral compass stage, and now we have young kids being aware of the situation. And it really started from the empathy and compassion of the players in the NFL , whether it was Colin Kaepernick, Malcolm Jenkins-the list can go on of a lot of guys who stood up for what they believed in.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to break and come back to our conversation with NFL star Michael Bennett. He has just left the Seahawks, the kneelingest team in the league, and gone to the Philadelphia Eagles. Not one took a knee, but protest in all different ways. Yes, he becomes a Philadelphia Eagle and, at the same time, is out with his book, Things That Make White People Uncomfortable . Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"World Revolution\" by Ziggy Marley, featuring Samuill Kalonji. We went a little long with that, because Michael Bennett, our guest, well, he's very into that song. That was his choice.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

G. Kelley, who recently published the revised and expanded 20th anniversary edition of his book \"Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination,\" with an added foreword by poet Aja Monet. The new edition was inspired by the Black Lives Matter uprisings in 2020 and covers topics from critical race theory to state militarism that Kelley says \"continues to this day.\" Kelley says the book's legacy conveys that \"we don't have the luxury to just fight for reform. We can't survive that way. We've got to fight for revolutionary change.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nIn a speech Tuesday in Pennsylvania promoting his Safer America Plan, President Biden called for an assault weapons ban and for the hiring of 100,000 more law enforcement officers nationwide.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : When it comes to public safety in this nation, the answer is not \"defund the police,\" it's \"fund the police.\" Fund the police.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, on this last day of Black August, we spend the rest of the hour with UCLA professor Robin D. G. Kelley, who's just published the 20th anniversary revised and expanded edition of his book Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination , with a new foreword by poet Aja Monet. In it, Kelley writes about organizations, activists and artists who are turning freedom dreams into a practice, from a noun to verb.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now!\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : Thank you, Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As we do this show today, from the flooding of an American city and the lack of water access in the majority-Black city of Jackson to the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq to the calling for more funding for police and an assault weapons ban, your thoughts?\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : OK, let's begin with where you started - that is, this plan on the part of Biden. We knew this was coming. It was his campaign promise, adding 100,000 more cops. It echoes the Clinton-era crime bill, this call for community policing, which, you know, we can't be fooled. Community policing grows out of \"broken windows\" policing, which involves targeting Black and Brown residents with surveillance, harassment, using predictive technologies for policing. And think about what would have happened had $37 billion went into things that people need to make them safer, like housing, healthcare, environmental protections, jobs.\n\nBut let me just say, one, this is not a glimmer of hope. I'm not making a case - you know, but I'm making a case that despite the Biden people's opposition to defund, there's an element of it that was a response. That is, you know, $15 billion of grants for nonpolice first responders for mental health crises. Let's see how this is going to turn out. I'm not sure. But clearly, movements make a difference. And this is part of the argument of Freedom Dreams , that movements do make a difference, especially when you think beyond the immediate needs to something bigger.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Robin Kelley, can you talk about what are the - what's new in the edition that you put out now in terms of the revisions? Clearly, a lot has happened in 20 years. Your book first came out in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the beginning of the Iraq War. Since then, we've had the Black Spring of 2020, when millions of people all around the world rising up after the killing of George Floyd. But we've also had the rise of what I like to call the diversity, equity and inclusion industry, DEI , the DEI industry, that has sought to co-opt the radical nature of this movement that arose in 2020. Talk about those things and also what you feel is the most important new aspect of the new edition of your book.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : OK. Well, that's - let me start by talking about what - where we were and where we are. You know, I mean, I should say that the inspiration to put out this new edition was spring 2020. I mean, the fact is, the book didn't go out of print; it continued to sort of exist in the ether and was really important among organizers.\n\nBut let's go back. So, on the one hand, back in 2000, 2001, you know, it felt like the Bush-Cheney election derailed a lot of our movements, despite the fact that we witnessed the largest antiwar protests in history, you know? And I was in New York City during 9/11, and I remember the Islamophobia. I remember the real uncritical celebration of cops as first responders. And keep in mind, this is right after, in the wake of the Cincinnati rebellion in April 2001, after the killing of Timothy Thomas. This is in the wake of the Amadou Diallo protests around the acquittal of the cops who killed - again, these two, both cases, unarmed Black men. And, you know, Cincinnati looked like Ferguson. It was like a precursor in many ways. So, we're out here protesting Bush-era militarism. That militarism continues to escalate, despite the claims that there's an end to the war on terror. You know, your last guest talked about this continuation of these wars. And militarism continues to this day. Sometimes it takes on the form of, you know, U.S. support for Israeli occupation of Palestine. It takes on the form of the expansion of troops in Africa, you know, through AFRICOM . So, a lot of what we were fighting for then - or, fighting against, still exists, still persists. So, I think that's important.\n\nThe other side, in thinking about the whole attacks on critical race theory, it's an interesting problem, because what I can say briefly is that the latest wave of intellectual McCarthyism, the sort of attacks on CRT , is not really attacks on critical race theory, it's attacks on liberal multiculturalism. And it's interesting that - you know, it relates to Freedom Dreams in that the backlash is a backlash to a movement, and not necessarily a backlash to, say, President Obama. It's driven by white heteropatriarchal nationalism, which was there in 2000, persists throughout the 21st century, and it uses the racially coded language of anti-wokeness. \"Anti-wokeness,\" DeSantis's use of that term is not an accident. It's supposed to signal something. But it works. It works because it convinces a large segment of the country that the real threat to their lives are nonwhite people, queer people and our history. You know, this is the real existential threat, not privatized healthcare, not climate catastrophe, not crimes of the state, not global recession, not food and housing insecurity, not the threat of war with China, not economic policies that make the rich richer, you know, like this CHIPS bill, so that rich people could buy Black and queer art, as a fun right-wing causes.\n\nSo, you know, in many ways, if there's a basic sort of lesson that Freedom Dreams continues to sort of convey and that the movements that erupted since then have actually taken up and expanded, it is that we don't have the luxury to just fight for reform. We can't survive that way. We've got to fight for revolutionary change. That's the only way we'll survive as a planet. And the only way to do that is to think beyond the immediate needs and concerns and crisis that are right in front of us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have the Detroit activist and philosopher, the late, great Grace Lee Boggs, really at the center of your book, Freedom Dreams , so deeply involved with the Black power, labor, environmental justice and feminist movements. Before her death at the age of 100 in 2015, she was a frequent guest on Democracy Now! I wanted to turn to her in 2010.\n\nGRACE LEE BOGGS : People are beginning to say the only way to survive is by taking care of one another, by recreating our relationships to one another, that we have created a society, over the last period, in particular, where each of us is pursuing self-interest. We have devolved as human beings.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about why Grace Lee Boggs' activism, politics and philosophy is so important to you and so central in Freedom Dreams , Professor Kelley.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : She is the center of the book. She is the inspiration, in many ways, for Freedom Dreams . You know, we go back to like 1992, and she started this debate with me about, you know, you need to read Dr. King, you need to pay attention to people's needs beyond protest. Like, how do you build the society we're trying to establish in time, in the present, as opposed to just continuing to fight for reform? And so, we had this ongoing debate, and she forced me to rethink some things. Even after Freedom Dreams came out, she had more critiques, of course.\n\nAnd so, I end the book with an epilogue that has a very substantial section on what is being built in Detroit right now as a result of the Boggs Center and the work that Grace and Jimmy Boggs did. And so, that's a really important part of the story, saying that freedom dreamers are basically building that society of creating new human beings, new ways of being together that don't fall into the same old trap of, you know, the Marxist seizing state power.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Robin, we have to end, but we're going to do a post-show and post it at democracynow.org. Professor Robin D. G. Kelley, his new book, 20th anniversary edition, Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination .\n\nA very happy birthday to Hany Massoud! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "US police have a history of violence against black people. Will it ever stop?\n\nThe bereaved and brutalized have been calling for justice for years but the Trump administration reversed Obama's tentative steps towards reform\n\nI n Ferguson, Missouri, Mike Brown's body lay lifeless on the street for four hours after he was shot dead by a white officer. Witnesses described him holding his hands up in surrender before he was killed.\n\nIn New York City, Eric Garner told a white officer who placed him in a banned chokehold that he could not breathe before he died. He repeated the phrase 11 times.\n\nIn Cleveland, Ohio, 12-year-old Tamir Rice played on a snowy winter morning with a toy gun before he was shot dead by a white officer.\n\nThat these horrific deaths of unarmed black men and boys all occurred within four months of each other back in 2014 is no aberration . It is a cycle of American state brutality that has repeated itself year upon year, generation upon generation.\n\nIn 2015 it would be Tony Robinson , then Eric Harris , then Walter Scott , then Freddie Gray , then William Chapman , then Samuel DuBose . That some of those names have perhaps already faded from national memory is indicative of the crisis.\n\nIn 2016, I sat with Samaria Rice, mother of young Tamir, at a park bench near the site of her son's death as she lamented : \"When I see any of these murders it's like the government is throwing more salt on an open wound and I'm not having a chance to heal.\"\n\nThen, she was referring to Alton Sterling and Philando Castile , both shot dead by police within a day of each other earlier that month.\n\nNow, in 2020, it is George Floyd, the 46-year-old loving father and staunch community advocate, placed in a knee-to-neck restraint for almost nine minutes by a white officer in Minneapolis. He died in the same metro area as Philando Castile. He uttered the same final pleas as Eric Garner.\n\nThe nationwide unrest that follows Floyd's death is undoubtedly more intense than in 2014; the leadership from the White House immeasurably more reckless, insensitive and life threatening.\n\nAnd yet, here the country is again.\n\nViolence against black men and women at the hands of white authority is foundational to the United States, and continues to influence its policing culture to this day.\n\nPrecursors to modern-day American police departments include violent slave patrols utilized in southern states before the civil war, then the legal enforcement of racist Black Codes, followed by Jim Crow laws. Early municipal departments in growing US cities were overwhelmingly white, and brutalized vulnerable communities routinely. Thousands of lynchings of black Americans by white vigilantes went unpunished by the judicial system. And during the civil rights era and well beyond, peaceful protest has been harshly suppressed by officers sworn to protect and serve.\n\nJust days after I sat with Samaria Rice on that bench in Cleveland, Donald Trump accepted the Republican party's nomination for president a few miles down the road.\n\nTrump presented himself as the \"law and order\" candidate during a dark acceptance speech . The former Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke led the arena in a chilling round of applause for the Baltimore police officer Brian Rice, who that day had been acquitted on charges related to the death of Freddie Gray, whose spine was almost severed during his 2014 arrest. Trump thrust the issue of race and policing firmly into the culture wars he was fomenting.\n\nTrump's response to police violence was a marked departure from the Obama administration's. Since Michael Brown's death, which began a nationwide reckoning and rejuvenated the Black Lives Matter movement, Obama had used his authority to target problematic police departments, including those in Ferguson, Chicago and Baltimore, with justice department investigations.\n\nHe issued an executive order to curtail local departments' procurement of certain military-grade equipment. He commissioned a taskforce on 21st-century policing, which memorably urged American law enforcement to move from a \"warrior\" to a \"guardian\" culture.\n\nAlthough America has a sprawling, decentralized system of policing - the country has roughly 18,000 police departments each with their own use of force policy, hiring practices and oversight mechanisms making universal reform near impossible - there were at least signs of tentative progress.\n\nAnd then Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States.\n\nNot only did he fight a PR war against those who knelt during the national anthem to pay tribute to black lives lost and stand against the structural racism underpinning it all. Now a man who called for the death penalty against five black and brown teenagers wrongfully convicted of a rape in Central Park in 1989 , had the ability, with a stroke of a pen or a nod to his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to undo any of the progress made.\n\nThe administration acted quickly. Within two months of assuming office, Sessions forced a sweeping review of court-enforceable reform packages - known as consent decrees - imposed on numerous problematic police departments. He revoked a directive, issued by the Obama administration, to end the US government's use of private prisons - a marker of the first black president's attempt to end the disproportionate incarceration of black and brown men.\n\nEight months in and Trump freed up local police to once again procure military-grade equipment , and Sessions had effectively cancelled the US government's flagship community police program.\n\nBut beyond the culture wars and quiet policy rollbacks, the most insidious effect of the Trump presidency on the battle for equal justice and fair policing was its partial suffocation of the story itself. Young men continued to die, but in the mania of the Russia inquiry, impeachment and the scandals upon scandal,the movement for black lives received less and less media oxygen.\n\nIn 2018, 21-year-0ld EJ Bradford was shot three times from behind by an officer in Hoover, Alabama . The incident barely made the news.\n\nIn 2019 Willie McCoy, a 20-year-old rapper, was shot at 55 times by officers in Vallejo, California, as he lay sleeping in his car . His death failed to capture prolonged attention.\n\nIn 2020 bloody rioting across Mississippi's prison system led to more than a dozen deaths. Trump said nothing.\n\nLast year, after a five-year struggle for justice for her son Eric Garner, I sat with Gwen Carr outside NYPD headquarters as she suffered the indignities of an administrative trial that ultimately led to the officer who suffocated her son losing his job - the highest punishment he faced.\n\n\"There is no justice at all for Eric,\" she said, sitting in the shade during a scorching New York summer day. \"They murdered him and if there was going to be justice, it would have been at the point when he said, 'I can't breathe.'\"\n\nA few weeks later, after years of investigation, the US justice department, now helmed by William Barr, announced that the federal government would not criminally prosecute the officer involved in Garner's death. The decision was reportedly made by Barr personally. Trump said nothing.\n\nIt is local and state leadership that has shaped any positive steps on police reform in recent years.\n\nThe Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, intervened in the George Floyd case to elevate former officer Derek Chauvin's murder charge. In recent years many departments have enforced restrictions on chokeholds and neck restraints.\n\nEarlier this week, Ferguson, which is 70% African American, elected its first black mayor, Ella Jones. \"It's just my time to do right by the people,\" she said .\n\nBut for many, incremental change is not enough. The words Samaria Rice said in 2016 have resonated with me throughout this period of unrest.\n\n\"We need to dismantle the whole system and really rebuild it again.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 4 June 2020 to correct the age Tamir Rice was when he was shot by a police officer."

      "text": "Outrage in Spain as video shows Madrid police 'violence' on unarmed black men\n\nLeftwing parties call for government action after footage of incident in Lavapiés spread on social media\n\nLeftwing parties in Spain are demanding explanations after a video appeared to show a pair of police officers using violent force on two unarmed black men in a central Madrid neighbourhood.\n\nThe video, shot on Friday in Lavapiés, appears to show one of the men on the ground and immobilised by a police officer who seemingly has him in a chokehold. A second police officer appears to then strike the immobilised man twice with a baton before grabbing and punching another man standing nearby.\n\nAsí hasta cuando? Cuál es la justificación de esta actuación tan violenta? El acoso y la violencia policial en lavapiés no tiene nombre. Espero que @interiorgob @policia @DefensorPuebloE tomen medidas antes de que sea tarde. pic.twitter.com/fcBZZKE7jH\n\nAs video of the encounter swiftly spread across social media, a police source told the Europa Press news agency that the two men had been arrested for undermining authority. The source described the men as being \"hostile\" towards the officers and said one of the officers had been injured. One of those arrested was later found to have drugs on him, the source claimed.\n\nThe video provoked outrage across Spain. The antiracist campaign group SOS Racismo described the images as \"another example of how state security forces act in Lavapiés\". In its social media post it added : \"Those of us who live in this neighbourhood know that these actions are commonplace, and nobody does anything about it.\"\n\nLeftwing politicians called on the interior ministry to take action. \"This police violence is unacceptable,\" Isabel Serra, a spokesperson for the Podemos party, wrote on social media. \"And unfortunately - or because of the complicity of the institutions - it is all too common. It is racism.\"\n\nÍñigo Errejón, a spokesperson for the Sumar leftwing alliance , said he had demanded a written explanation. \"Do not normalise this, do not look the other way, ask for explanations,\" he wrote on X .\n\nIn questions submitted to parliament, Errejón noted that the video appeared to show \"an aggression\" by two police officers, carried out on one man he described as immobilised and another who was not resisting. He added: \"Cruelty can be perceived, which does not seem to respond to a restrained protocol of police action.\"\n\nErrejón called on the interior ministry to clarify whether an investigation had been opened into the officers' behaviour, asking: \"What measures will be taken in response to citizen complaints regarding the existence of police violence against migrants in the Lavapiés neighbourhood?\"\n\nThe ministry said on Monday that its national office for the guarantee of human rights, a body created in 2022 to ensure that state forces protect fundamental rights, was looking into the incident.\n\nSign up to Headlines Europe\n\nA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of people gathered in the plaza of Lavapiés to demonstrate against police violence and institutional racism. \"This is a situation that we live daily,\" said Serigne Mbayé, a former regional politician and now the antiracism secretary for Podemos, in a video posted online from the protest . \"Thanks to a neighbour who was able to record this, the police brutality that happens regularly in this neighbourhood has been seen.\"\n\nMbayé called on the government to do more to tackle racism and force transparency on the police. \"We're telling the government to take action, this cannot go on,\" he said. \"We're in Spain, we're in the 21st century. Everyone has rights.\""

However, a friend who said he was with him said Brisbon was delivering food.\n\nBrisbon \"appeared to be removing something\" from the rear seat, according to the police, so the officer instructed him to show his hands. Brisbon \"placed one or both hands in his waistband area\" before fleeing to a nearby apartment building.\n\nAfter being chased by the officer on foot, the 34-year-old father of four refused to obey instructions to get on the ground, according to police, who said he yelled profanities at the officer and a struggle ensued.\n\n\"During the struggle Brisbon put his left hand in his pocket and the officer grabbed on to the suspect's hand, while repeatedly telling the suspect to keep his hand in his pocket,\" said the police statement. The two men tumbled inside an apartment after a door was opened.\n\n\"The officer believed he felt the handle of a gun while holding the suspects hand in his pocket\", the statement continued. Having become \"unable to maintain his grip on the suspect's hand\", the officer shot Brisbon twice in the torso. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe item in Brisbon's pocket turned out to be a vial containing several oxycodone tablets, according to police. They reported discovering a handgun and a jar apparently containing marijuana inside Brisbon's vehicle following the shooting. Brisbon was found to have a criminal record including a burglary conviction.\n\nThe officer, who has worked for the department for seven years, was not harmed. Police said he was in the area to investigate an alleged burglary but was told by two people that men inside a black Cadillac SUV were engaged in a drug deal.\n\nBrandon Dickerson, who said he was in the car with Brisbon before the shooting and witnessed some of the incident, told the Arizona Republic Brisbon was there to deliver fast food to his children in the apartment building. The newspaper reported that \"on Wednesday evening, strewn french fries still littered the front porch\".\n\nMarci Kratter, an attorney for Brisbon's family, told the newspaper they were considering a wrongful death lawsuit.\n\n\"It was a senseless tragedy,\" she said. \"He was unarmed and not a threat to anyone. We intend to pursue this to the full extent of the law.\""

      "text": "'I hate myself': Dallas officer testifies about night she killed unarmed black man\n\nAmber Guyger, who fatally shot Botham Jean in September last year, says: 'This is not about hate'\n\nA Dallas police officer started to cry and shake Friday as she began to testify about the night she killed a neighbor in his own home , which she has said she mistook for her own unit one floor below.\n\nAmber Guyger broke down while recalling approaching her neighbor Botham Jean's door, leading the judge to call for a brief break so she could compose herself.\n\nGuyger, who is charged with murder in the killing last September, was the first witness that her lawyers called in the high-profile case. She told jurors about how she grew up in a small house in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, how she played in the school band and how she aspired to become a police officer.\n\n\"I just wanted to help people, and that was the one career that I thought I could help people in,\" said Guyger, who was fired from the police force after the shooting.\n\nGuyger's testimony marked the first time the public has heard directly from the 31-year-old since Jean's killing last September.\n\nGuyger, who is white, was off duty but in uniform when she shot Jean, a 26-year-old native of St Lucia who was black and worked as an accountant in Dallas.\n\nThe basic facts of the unusual shooting are not in dispute. Guyger walked up to Jean's apartment - which was on the fourth floor, directly above hers on the third - and found the door unlocked. She was off duty but still dressed in her police uniform after a long shift when she shot Jean with her service weapon. Guyger was later arrested, fired and charged with murder.\n\n\"I hate that I have to live with this every single day of my life and I ask God for forgiveness, and I hate myself every single day,\" Guyger told the packed courtroom.\n\nShe said she wished \"he was the one with the gun\" and had killed her. \"I never wanted to take an innocent person's life. And I'm so sorry. This is not about hate. It's about being scared that night,\" she said.\n\nGuyger's attorneys say she fired in self-defense after mistaking Jean for a burglar. Her attorneys also say the identical physical appearance of the complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants parking on the wrong floor or trying to enter the wrong apartment.\n\nGuyger told the jury that when she put her key in what she thought was her apartment door's lock, the door opened because it hadn't been fully closed.\n\nFearing it was a break-in, she drew her service weapon and stepped inside, she said.\n\nSeeing someone inside, Guyger said she said: \"Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands.\" But she said she couldn't see the person's hands and he began coming toward her at a \"fast-paced\" walk. She said he yelled \"Hey, hey, hey!\" right before she opened fire.\n\nGuyger told the court she intended to kill him when she pulled the trigger, which she said is what she had been trained to do.\n\n\"I was scared he was going to kill me,\" she said under questioning by her lawyers, who called her as their first witness.\n\nWhen prosecutors asked why she didn't back away and radio for help once she suspected a break-in, Guyger said that entering the apartment \"was the only option that went through my head\".\n\nProsecutors have questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place, and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages with her police partner. Prosecutors also say Jean was no threat to Guyger, noting that he was in his living room eating a bowl of ice-cream when she entered his apartment.\n\nIn a frantic 911 call played in court earlier this week, Guyger says \"I thought it was my apartment\" nearly 20 times. The shooting attracted intense national scrutiny for the strange circumstances and because it was one in a chain of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\nThe trial began Monday."

      "text": "Federal officials may use little-known civil rights statute in police shooting cases\n\nDepartment of Justice and FBI have for weeks been examining the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, John Crawford III and now Dontre Hamilton\n\nThe families of at least four unarmed black men killed this year by police are pinning their hopes on possible federal prosecutions under a little-known civil rights statute that has only occasionally been used to indict officers in such cases.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ), the FBI and local US attorneys' offices have for weeks been examining the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and John Crawford III - all of whom were killed by police officers who grand juries later decided not to indict on state criminal charges.\n\nLate on Monday, the DOJ announced it would review a fourth death: that of Dontre Hamilton, who was shot 14 times by a police officer following a confrontation in a park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in April.\n\nThe review was launched after the Milwaukee district attorney announced that Christopher Manney - the police officer who shot Hamilton, and who has since been fired - will not face charges.\n\nIn all four cases, federal officials are considering whether there is sufficient evidence to bring charges under a section of the US code that prohibits public officials from depriving an individual of constitutional rights under \"color of law\".\n\nThe DOJ did not respond to questions about whether there were any additional police shooting cases from 2014 - aside from those relating to the deaths of Brown, Garner, Crawford III and Hamilton - that are currently subject to departmental review or investigation.\n\nHowever, officials are not believed to be looking into the case of Darrien Hunt, a black man who was killed by police in Saratoga Springs, Utah . They are awaiting the outcome of the local investigation into the shooting of Tamir Rice, a black 12-year-old killed by police as he played with a plastic gun in a park in Cleveland.\n\nPolice officers, prison guards, judges and care providers at public health facilities can all be prosecuted under the title 18, section 242 of the US code, more commonly known as the \"color of law\" statute.\n\nThe government does not have to prove any racial bias for a successful prosecution and cases involving the death of a victim can theoretically be punished with life imprisonment or even a death sentence.\n\nHowever experts caution that while the DOJ and FBI bring dozens of \"color of law\" cases to court each year - including some regarding deaths in custody - it is uncommon for prosecutions to be brought in police shooting cases.\n\nOne notable exception was the federal prosecution of five New Orleans police officers over the shooting of unarmed people on Danziger bridge following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, two of whom died. The officers were convicted but later acquitted by a federal judge who ordered a retrial.\n\nPerhaps the best-known federal \"color of law\" prosecution was brought against the Los Angeles police officers acquitted of state criminal charges over the beating Rodney King in 1991.\n\nWilliam Yeomans, a law professor in Washington, DC and a former acting assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department, told the Guardian \"color of law\" prosecutions involving police shootings are harder to prove than other types of deprivation and are therefore \"very rare\".\n\n\"There is always the possibility of a federal prosecution but I think everyone recognises it is not the most likely outcome because the standard is very high,\" he said. \"The government has to show that the officer acted with the specific intent to use more force than was reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\"\n\nYeomans said state prosecutors have \"options that the federal government does not have\". The spectrum of possible indictments in police shooting cases run from an intentional premeditated killing all the way down to the far less serious crime of involuntary manslaughter, where criminal intent does not need to be proven.\n\n\"If those options have already been examined by the state and the state has decided not to proceed, it is very difficult for the federal government to make a case where it has to show that the officer acted with the intent to use more force than was necessary,\" he explained.\n\nThe DOJ said this week it would only \"review\" the evidence in the case of Hamilton, who was shot following an altercation with Manney in Red Arrow Park in April. That could however be expanded into a full investigation at a later date.\n\nAccording to the Journal Sentinel, which reviewed newly released documents in the case, Hamilton had been lying in the park and had already been checked on by two other police officers, who deemed he was doing nothing wrong, before he was approached by Manney.\n\nThe police officer patted Hamilton down and told investigators he felt a cylindrical object in Hamilton's waist band and another hard object in his pocket. The two men began to scuffle and Hamilton wrested away control of Manney's baton, striking him on the neck.\n\nManney told investigators he felt Hamilton was displaying \"super-human strength\". It was shortly afterwards, he said, fearing for his life, that he shot Hamilton 14 times. No weapons were found on Hamilton's body.\n\nThe DOJ, FBI and US attorney's office review is the same tier of inquiry used in the case of John Crawford III, who was fatally shot by police in August after he was seen carrying a BB rifle in a Walmart store in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nFull-scale federal inquiries, in contrast, have been launched into the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, and the fatal encounter Eric Garner had with the New York Police Department in Staten Island in July .\n\nThe federal probe into the Brown case was announced by US attorney general Eric Holder just days after his death, which sparked protests and riots in the suburb of St Louis. For several months, the federal civil rights investigation ran alongside the state criminal investigation.\n\nThe state investigation concluded in November, after a grand jury decided not to bring charges against the officer involved, Darren Wilson , prompting more rioting . But the federal investigation is still ongoing.\n\nThe Brown case was unusual because state and federal investigations do not typically run in parallel. Federal investigations have traditionally been used as a backstop mechanism that is only implemented when state inquiries have run their course.\n\nThe federal inquiry in the Garner case, for example, was only initiated after the grand jury decided not to charge the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, who had been filmed placing Garner in a chokehold .\n\nBoth the Crawford and Hamilton reviews, and the Brown and Garner investigations, could continue for several more months or even years.\n\nThe DOJ investigation into George Zimmerman, the night watchman who shot dead an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in Florida, is being run out of the same civil rights division as the four \"color of law\" cases.\n\nThe Zimmerman case, which is understood to relate to a different federal statute that prohibits the use of force because of racial discrimination, has been ongoing since March 2012."

      "text": "I'm black, my brother's white ... and he's a cop who shot a black man on duty\n\nI never thought that my brother would be one of those police officers. He was supposed to be different because of me\n\nM y white brother loved black people more than I did when we were growing up. As a black interracial child of the south - one who lived in a homogenous white town - I struggled with my own blackness. I struggled even more with loving that blackness. But my brother, Mitch, didn't. He loved me unapologetically. He loved me loudly.\n\nHe also loved screwing with other people's expectations. Whenever we met new people or I joined a social situation he was in, Mitch would make sure I was standing right next to him for introductions and say, \"This is Zach, my brother\" - and then go silent with a smirk.\n\nThese new acquaintances would then scan back and forth with such intensity - black, white, white, black - that our faces became a kind of tennis court, with strangers waiting for someone to fault. Eventually someone would awkwardly laugh and say something like: \"Oh, adopted brother,\" immediately looking relieved to have figured it out. My brother would deny that and push the line further, \"No, like, my brother. We have the same mom. We are blood.\"\n\nThat would lead to someone questioning me intensely, and, each time, my white brother would stand next to me, proud: prouder than me of my own skin. And over the years, as he continued playing this game, I became prouder ... with his help.\n\nAnd then, years later and far away in Chicago, I got the phone call: my brother, now a cop, had shot an unarmed black man back in Tennessee .\n\nHearing about black men dying is never exactly a surprise. Every day, you see the news stories: On the news, black men die while getting Skittles . On the news, black men die in choke-holds . On the news, black men die for playing their music too loud . It seems black men die on the news more than they do almost anything else on the news, even with a black president in office. Every 28 hours , a black man is killed by a police officer in America.\n\nI just never imagined that the police officer in that scenario would ever be my brother. Mitch was supposed to be different than all the rest. He was supposed to be different because of me.\n\nThe first thing I did after I got the phone call was Google my brother's name. I saw a mix of headlines; some outlets were more sympathetic toward the unarmed 22-year-old victim, while other coverage was more favorable to my brother, the cop who \"accidentally\" killed someone. Articles kept using that word - \"accidental\" - over and over, and it felt like aloe on a burn.\n\nWatching the first press conference later that day, the police spokesman talked about how my brother was just doing his job, that he followed protocol and that this was just a tragic accident for everyone involved. After the press conference, one of the local news stations in Nashville aired a more in-depth look at the case and reported that the victim had a family member who had been shot by someone on the same police force years earlier - also, apparently, \"by accident\".\n\nAccident seemed like an odd word to me for this situation. When I hear the word \"accident\", I usually think about spilled milk or the dog urinating on the carpet or even bumper scratch. Accidents were things that you respond to with, \"Whoops, sorry!\" But with this accident, I wondered: to whom could we even say \"sorry\" now that a man lay dead?\n\nWhile I watched, I kept thinking about why these accidents always seemed to happen to black people. And why they were called accidents, when it seemed so clearly to be much more than an accident - when it seemed to be a flaw in a system that called things accidents.\n\nI stared at my computer after my screen went black and prayed that it was an accident. Because calling it that didn't make me feel I had to choose my race over my blood - the strangers who asked me questions over the brother who wanted them to.\n\nI went home to Tennessee a few years later, after the media coverage of the case had calmed down, and sat in one of the chairs in my mother's living room and let the argument happen. My mother, with her smooth milk skin, stared at me with eyes that would not unlock from my own.\n\n\"Do you actually think he shot him because he was black?\" she asked, tearing up.\n\n\"Yes, I do. I really do.\"\n\n\"But how can you say that? Honestly, he is blacker than you!\"\n\nI winced at her backwards compliment, the racism veiled as praise, the description I'd heard since I could write my name.\n\n\"Mom, that is simply not true. He is white. This will never change, no matter what he does. Never. And because I am black, I know that if that man would have been white he would be alive today.\"\n\nMy mom finally unlocked eyes with me and stared down at her glass. I could see that she wanted to agree with me, but couldn't this time, because it was an indictment of her other son. She had probably never imagined having to argue with her black son about her white son shooting and killing an unarmed black man while on duty.\n\nBut that's also when I began to see just how much racism isn't really about a single act or a single person, but rather a much larger system . A system that calls the recurring death of black male bodies \"accidents\".\n\nNo matter how my mom had raised us, no matter how much my brother loved my blackness and was so proud of me for who I was, it still didn't stop another black man from losing his life.\n\nMy white brother isn't a racist - and he didn't intentionally kill that man because he was black - but that's not the point. In his case - in Ferguson and in so many other cases - we see the deaths of unarmed black men as \"accidents\". And until the day we all recognize them as casualties of something much bigger, we will continue to see black men dead on the news.\n\nWe will continue to see brothers killing brothers."

      "text": "Three bullets from behind: why did police kill a black man in a mall?\n\nAfter the killing of EJ Bradford, questions remain: Had police simply killed a bystander? Was Bradford actually shepherding others to safety as gunfire erupted?\n\nThere is nothing to mark the spot where EJ Bradford fell.\n\nIn an unremarkable corner of an unremarkable Alabama shopping mall, just a few miles from Birmingham, the cradle of the civil rights movement, routine has already gone back to normal. It is less than three weeks since the 21 year-old African American was gunned down by a police officer in circumstances that remain shrouded in controversy and conflicted narratives.\n\nThe white tiled flooring outside a footwear store had been covered in blood on the night of Thanksgiving when Bradford was present at the scene of an armed altercation involving at least two other men. But now it shimmers clean under the glaring lights, as Christmas carols drown out the noise of shoppers drifting between stores.\n\nPolice had initially identified Bradford, a high school graduate who had enlisted in the US army, as the shooter in a chaotic episode that left one 18 year-old man critically injured and a 12 year-old girl, not involved in the dispute, with a gunshot wound. But days later police were forced to acknowledge that another suspect had been identified and later arrested. Still, a series of questions remain.\n\nHad police simply killed a bystander? Was Bradford actually a \"good guy with a gun\" , shepherding others to safety as gunfire erupted? Was he shot from behind? And would police body camera footage and surveillance video be released to reveal what really happened that evening?\n\nA few years ago, when the high-profile police killings of a number of black men and boys prompted a national conversation about race and policing, the shooting of EJ Bradford would likely have dominated the national news for weeks. But just as shoppers have returned to their daily business here, so too has the news agenda . While many questions remain unanswered, an investigation by the Guardian, including interviews with friends of Bradford and eyewitnesses who have not spoken publicly before, has shed further light on his last seconds and hours.\n\nThe reporting corroborates some of the account provided by the Bradford family's attorney, indicating he was shot from behind, facing downwards at the time an officer opened fire. But it also reveals that Bradford had known both men involved in the altercation, suggesting it is likely he was not an uninterested bystander to the event.\n\nThe 21 year-old had spent much of Thanksgiving hanging out with his oldest friends. First with Jamari Coney, his friend of five years, with whom he ate lunch, and then with his childhood friend Kriston Peterson with whom he had been catching up on the porch of a friend's home during the rest of the afternoon.\n\n\"When I had last seen him he had a smile on his face, like he always do,\" Peterson said, indicating there was nothing about Bradford's mood that suggested he knew a conflict might occur later in the day.\n\nShortly after, Bradford headed to the Riverchase Galleria in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover with another group. Both Peterson and Coney said Bradford had gone with the intention of catching the Black Friday sales and had been due to link up with another friend, Tra'Vonte Todd, who worked at a local Walmart, later that evening.\n\nAll three friends found out about Bradford's death from Facebook posts that showed his lifeless body sprawled out in a pool of blood just outside a Footaction store on the upper level of the mall.\n\n\"I found out my friend was dead from a picture, because I remember what he had on when I had seen him earlier.\" Peterson said. \"I was devastated.\"\n\nThe precise details of the conflict that occurred at the mall that evening remain unclear and none of Bradford's closest friends were present. Prosecutors now allege it was 20 year-old Erron Brown who shot and injured 18 year-old Brian Wilson. But crucially, it has now been established from both Bradford's friends and a lawyer involved in the case, that Bradford knew both young men involved in the skirmish.\n\nErron Brown's lawyer, Charles Salvagio, told the Guardian there was \"something ongoing\" between his client and Wilson, which could be proven by the existence of text messages between the two that allegedly indicate Wilson had told Brown to meet him at the store before the gunfire began. He said that Bradford and Brown had known each other too, (a claim supported by one of Bradford's friends interviewed by the Guardian) and alleged without citing evidence, that Bradford had been part of the group that invited Brown to the store.\n\nThe mall was packed that evening. Thousands of people from all over the surrounding area had come for the sales. Two eyewitnesses - retail workers at stores metres away from the shooting - said they heard the first of at least two bursts of gunfire ring out around 9.50pm. It sent the mall into chaos as hundreds of people fled.\n\n\"Everyone started screaming. Everybody ran to wherever they could get to,\" said Laura Dial, who runs a custom jewelry store directly beneath the location of the shooting.\n\nAlthough Dial did not see the next burst of shooting, which appears to have happened seconds after, another retail worker who did not want to reveal her name as she was not authorized to talk to media, said she witnessed the moment Bradford was shot. This worker, a manager at a shop opposite the site of the shooting on the upper level, heard the first round of gunfire and rushed to the window to lock the door, as is protocol in an active shooter situation.\n\nBy this point, the witness said, two Hoover police officers who minutes earlier had been patrolling the same area, had sprinted to the scene and stood a few metres away to Bradford's left. Bradford was now outside the Footaction store, standing still and staring down at Wilson who was lying close by after being shot. Bradford's back was \"partially turned\" away from the officers with a firearm in his right hand, which was lowered, held out to his right flank but not pointed at anyone. His family have said the gun was legally purchased and he possessed a license to carry. Attorneys for the Bradford family say he did not discharge the weapon at any point.\n\n\"He just stood there, he continued to have his gun in his right hand,\" the witness said. \"The cops came running up, they approached him, they told him to put his gun down multiple times ... He didn't comply, he didn't do anything.\"\n\nThen one officer, who was crouched, opened fire. It happened within a second or two of the last command to drop the weapon being shouted.\n\n\"It happened really, really fast,\" the witness, who has been interviewed by state investigators three times but not previously spoken to media, said. Both officers were white men, the witness added.\n\nA private autopsy , commissioned by Bradford's family, indicates he was shot three times, once in the head, once in the neck, and once in the back. All the shots entered from behind.\n\nAttorney Benjamin Crump, who represents the family, has also viewed 30 seconds of footage showing the shooting. His recollection of the film suggests that Bradford had \"moved away\" from the officer before he opened fire.\n\nThe witness said Bradford was killed immediately.\n\nThe Hoover police department initially lauded the officer , who has not yet been named, a hero.\n\n\"Thank God we had our officers very close,\" Police Chief Nick Derzis told local media. \"They heard the gunfire, they engaged the subject, and they took out the threat.\" But four days later the department was forced to concede that Bradford was unlikely to be the shooter. Seven days after the shooting Brown was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Wilson. His lawyer says he is not guilty. No one has yet been charged with shooting the 12-year-old girl.\n\nThe mismanagement, just as much as the circumstances of the shooting itself, has drawn the ire of local activists who have staged almost daily protests in the aftermath.\n\nThe NAACP legal defense fund has asked the US Department of Justice to intervene in the investigation, which is currently being run by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency [Alea]. But such a move seems unlikely under the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\n\"This [Trump] administration has all but said we're going to always side with the police no matter what the factual scenario is,\" Crump told the Guardian. \"That's a 180 degree adjustment from the last [Obama] administration.\"\n\n\"Now the president doesn't say anything about [police shootings], the AG doesn't say anything about it and it's almost: out of sight out of mind. Your life don't matter.\"\n\nThe famed civil rights lawyer is well placed to make such an evaluation. Crump represented the families of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice, all young black men and boys killed by law enforcement or security personnel during the Obama years. In many instances the Obama administration not only commented on the individual case, but commissioned a federal investigation into the departments responsible.\n\nTrump has made no comment on the EJ Bradford shooting, or any other officer involved shooting since he became president. The justice department declined to comment for this article.\n\nJust two months before the shooting of Bradford, Trump's former attorney general Jeff Sessions appeared at a policing symposium in Hoover a few miles from the Riverchase Galleria mall. In front of an audience of police, including Chief Derzis, Sessions lambasted reforms implemented by the Obama administration and declared: \"Each one of you can be certain about this: we have your back and you have our thanks.\"\n\nNonetheless, local lawyers suggest the Hoover department is unlikely to be as plagued with racial bias as departments, like Ferguson and Baltimore, that became notorious in the wake of sustained unrest after the killing of unarmed black men.\n\nThe Hoover police department has been sued in federal court just a handful of times in the last 10 years, once after a white officer allegedly used excessive force while arresting a black high-school aged girl after she told him to \"leave her alone\". The second was for the use of excessive force during the arrest of a 71-year-old man who had called the police after a fire in his home.\n\n\"In terms of this [department] being a powder keg waiting for something to happen, no I don't think so,\" said Martin Weinberg, a Hoover based attorney specialising in police use of force cases.\n\nThe department did not respond to a request for comment and would not provide information about the racial or ethnic breakdown of its sworn officers.\n\nAs the Alea investigation into Bradford's death continues to search for witnesses, it seems inevitable that footage of the shooting will not be made public for weeks if not months. And as tensions in Hoover continue to simmer, Bradford's friends and family continue to mourn the smart, generous laid back young man who they say had a promising future ahead of him.\n\nBut even his closest friends accept the shooting may be far from a simple case of right and wrong. \"It's an active shooter in the mall so I can understand [the cop's] side too,\" said Peterson, \"But he [Bradford] was probably shot in the wrong, and [the officer] could have handled the the situation a whole lot better than shooting him from behind.\""

      "text": "Judge sequesters jury in trial of former Dallas officer who shot black neighbour\n\nAmber Guyger claims she mistook Botham Jean for an intruder after mistakenly entering his apartment instead of her own\n\nThe judge in the murder trial of a former Dallas police officer charged with shooting and killing a black neighbor has taken the rare step of sequestering the jury.\n\nFormer officer Amber Guyger, who is white, has told investigators in Texas she mistook Botham Jean, 26, for an intruder after she mistakenly entered his central Dallas apartment one floor above hers.\n\nThe shooting in September last year , one of a series of high-profile killings of unarmed black men and teens by white US police, sparked protests, particularly because prosecutors initially moved to charge Guyger, 31, with manslaughter, a charge that carries a lesser sentence.\n\nIn contrast to high-profile cases like the killings of Michael Brown in Missouri and Philando Castile in Minnesota, Guyger shot Jean, an accountant who was a native of St Lucia, while she was off duty.\n\nBefore opening statements were to begin on Monday afternoon, Tammy Kemp, a state district court judge, sequestered the jury of four men and 12 women for the entirety of the trial, shielding them from outside influence and local news coverage.\n\nJudges have moved away from sequestering juries because jurors find the isolation stressful and it may increase the likelihood of jurors dropping out, raising the chances of a mistrial, legal experts say. Some jurists fear sequestration may cause jurors to rush deliberations.\n\nSequestration is most common when there is heavy media coverage and heightened public interest.\n\nKemp denied a motion to exclude evidence from Guyger's texts and phone calls and a motion for a mistrial from Guyger's attorneys who claimed the Dallas district attorney, John Creuzot, defied a gag order by giving an interview about the case to a local TV station over the weekend.\n\nThe prosecutor Jason Hermus said he planned to display a photo of Jean in the courtroom as prosecutors make their case, to show that he was \"a living, breathing human being prior to this event\".\n\nThe DA's office re-examined the case after the public protests and a grand jury in late November indicted the former police officer on murder charges, with the maximum punishment of life in prison.\n\nGuyger, who had been on the force for over four years, walked into Jean's apartment after returning from a shift and was able to enter because Jean's door was slightly ajar, according to Texas law enforcement officials.\n\nAfter the incident, she was placed on administrative leave and fired days later.\n\nGuyger's defense had pushed for a change of venue, arguing in court last week that media coverage had been so intense their defendant could not get a fair trial. Kemp denied that request."

      "text": "Washington officer who shot unarmed man saved him from fire weeks earlier\n\nOne of the officers who killed an immigrant farmworker in Washington state in a shooting that helped fuel the nationwide debate over police use of force had dragged the man away from his burning rental home just weeks earlier.\n\nAntonio Zambrano-Montes, who in another case had pleaded with police to kill him, was sitting on the ground in January in a meth-induced trance near the fire when officer Adam Wright found him, according to documents obtained by the Associated Press under public records requests.\n\nWeeks later, Wright and two other officers shot Zambrano-Montes after he had been throwing rocks in a busy intersection.\n\nVideo footage that showed the Mexican man running away, then turning around with arms outstretched just as police fired, prompted months of protests. Similar demonstrations have erupted in other US cities over police killings, some of unarmed black men.\n\nThe documents obtained by the AP shed new light on Zambrano-Montes' run-ins with police and his erratic, sometimes dangerous behavior.\n\nWhile Pasco police say their officers generally receive more training than state standards require, records show only a half-dozen had taken an extended course on dealing with people in the throes of drug abuse or mental health crisis, fewer than other departments in the region.\n\nAnd none of the officers who shot Zambrano-Montes had that advanced training, the records show.\n\n\"Any time you see a police officer shoot someone who is known to have mental health issues, it makes you wonder: Who has responsibility for this? Where did the system break down?\" said Sue Rahr, a former sheriff who now heads Washington's Criminal Justice Training Commission.\n\nDespite the farmworker's contacts with police, the documents contain no record he ever wound up in counseling or treatment. In one instance last July, after Zambrano-Montes gouged his forehead with a knife and asked police to kill him, an officer alerted a crisis response unit. It's unclear if anything came of it.\n\n\"They never referred him to any type of treatment whatsoever,\" said George Trejo, a lawyer for the man's family.\n\nMeanwhile, Zambrano-Montes was floundering on the margins.\n\nThe man had been living in the US illegally for a decade, and was estranged from his daughters and wife, who obtained a protection order against him. He had broken his wrists in a fall, had been out of work and despaired over his inability to send money home to his parents, his family said.\n\nIn January 2014, witnesses called police because he was hitting cars with a broom. He threw a mailbox at responding officers and tried to grab an officer's gun. He admitted taking methamphetamines and spent five months in the county jail.\n\nOn 15 July 2014, he cut his forehead and locked himself in a basement. Officers busted in. After a struggle, he said he wanted police to kill him. Medics sedated him before taking him to an emergency room.\n\nOn 22 January, two city workers discovered Zambrano-Montes in his home as it burned. They walked him outside, where Wright soon found him and asked him to move. He didn't respond.\n\n\"Because he was so close to the fire, I grabbed the man and pulled him farther away for safety reasons,\" Wright said. A day later, when he was sober, Zambrano-Montes told him he'd been high on meth and probably started the fire accidentally.\n\nWright had more than 200 hours of training in 2014, including a 40-hour course on domestic violence and protection orders.\n\nBut Wright and officers Adrian Alaniz and Ryan Flanagan did not have the extended crisis intervention training, nor do their training records suggest they had taken courses on de-escalating volatile situations.\n\nCaptain Ken Roske emphasized that the officers were \"extremely well trained and professional\". He said all of the department's 71 officers have taken a basic four-hour crisis intervention course."

(Though DeGeneres and Jones' conversation was mostly focused on police shootings, the homeowner who shot at Walker was not a member of law enforcement.)\n\n\"I think, how is this possible that this keeps happening and nothing - there's just blatant racism,\" DeGeneres said.\n\nJones offered some thoughts about how there's a \"glitch\" in the minds of many people, who perceive the same actions by white people and black people in entirely different ways. He pointed to his own years at Yale University, where many white students used drugs regularly with little or no repercussions.\n\n\"Four blocks away, in the housing projects, kids were doing drugs and they all went to prison,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"Because we have this brain glitch that says, if a white kid does it, eh, maybe they need a little bit of help. If a black kid does it, we've gotta punish them.\"\n\nJones said a major problem with law enforcement is that our culture has a \"default unwritten rule\" that police are always right.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The NYPD Has A Long History Of Killing Unarmed Black Men\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nEditor-in-Chief, Google Insider\n\nEric Garner was a 43-year-old father of six and grandfather of two. The tall, 400-pound man, who was known around his Staten Island neighborhood as a \"gentle giant\" nicknamed \" Big E ,\" was approached Thursday outside a New York City store by a group of NYPD officers who accused him of selling contraband cigarettes. \"I didn't do shit!\" Garner can be seen telling cops in a video of the incident. \"I was just minding my own business.\"\n\n\"Every time you see me, you want to mess with me,\" he added. \"I'm tired of it ... Please just leave me alone!\"\n\nCops say they saw Garner selling cigarettes outside the store. Other witnesses, however, said he'd just finished breaking up a fight. He had no cigarettes on him, nor in his car, his family told the Daily News .\n\nBut the officers didn't leave Garner alone. Instead they tried to arrest him. Visibly upset at what was unfolding, Garner resisted. \"Don't touch me,\" he said.\n\nIt's then that an officer can be seen in the video putting Garner -- who suffered from chronic asthma, sleep apnea and diabetes -- into a tight, illegal chokehold. Garner falls to the ground, where, numerous times, he tells officers he can't breathe.\n\nThen, his body goes limp. (Warning: This video contains content that may be disturbing to some readers. Story continues below.)\n\nOfficials say Garner has a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. In the coming days and weeks, conflicting reports about the circumstances leading to Garner's death will likely surface. But even if Garner had prior charges and even if he resisted arrest on Thursday, he'll never have a chance to defend himself.\n\nThere will be anger. Rallies. Posters and T-shirts featuring Garner's face. Memorials. Statements by politicians. Lawsuits.\n\nIt's a familiar course of events. NYPD officers have a long history of killing unarmed individuals. They're rarely punished for their actions. And the majority of their victims, like Garner, are black men.\n\nEarlier this week marked the 50th anniversary of the death of James Powell, a 15-year-old black student who was shot and killed by a white police officer outside a Harlem apartment building. Powell's death sparked a series of riots across the country in what came to be known as the \"long, hot summer.\"\n\nAs City Councilman Jumaane D. Williams pointed out in a statement following Garner's death, not much has improved since then. \"Garner joins a list that every male of more color in New York City knows they are a candidate for and every mother of more color dreads,\" he said.\n\nBelow are the stories of some of the men (and boys) on that list.\n\nNicholas Heyward Jr.\n\nOn Sept. 27, 1994, 13-year-old Nicholas Heyward Jr. was playing cops and robbers inside the stairwell of a Brooklyn apartment building. Officer Brian George mistook the boy's toy gun for a real gun and shot him in the stomach, killing him. Then-Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, who is now facing a range of potential charges regarding his use of public funds , declined to press charges against George.\n\nAmadou Diallo\n\nDemonstrators join a rally in New York to protest the police officers' acquittal.\n\nOn Feb. 4, 1999, four NYPD officers in the Bronx fired 41 shots at a 22-year-old immigrant from Guinea named Amadou Diallo. The officers thought he had a gun. It turned out to be a wallet. Diallo, who was unarmed and had committed no crime, was hit by 19 bullets and died, setting off large protests across the city. The four officers involved were all white and were all acquitted of any wrongdoing.\n\nMalcolm Ferguson\n\nOn March 1, 2000, just a few days after a jury acquitted the four police officers who killed Amadou Diallo, an undercover cop shot and killed 23-year-old Malcolm Ferguson at his Bronx home. The shooting took place three blocks from the site of Diallo's death, and Ferguson had been arrested the previous week for protesting the officers' acquittal in that case. He had seven prior arrests on his record, mainly for dealing drugs. The incident was deemed an accident, and the officer who killed Ferguson, Louis Rivera, was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nPatrick Moses Dorismond\n\nMourners honor Dorismond at City Hall Park.\n\nPatrick Moses Dorismond, a father of two, was killed by an undercover NYPD officer on March 16, 2000. According to police, Dorismond had become belligerent when the cop, who was with some of his partners, asked him where he could buy some marijuana in the neighborhood. It's unclear who threw the first punch, but a scuffle ensued, and one of the officers, Anthony Vasquez, ultimately shot Dorismond in the chest, killing him. A friend of Dorismond's, who was also involved in the fight, claimed the undercover officers never identified themselves as police. A grand jury declined to indict Vasquez.\n\nOusmane Zongo\n\nMourners carry the casket containing Zongo's body.\n\nOn May 22, 2003, Officer Bryan Conroy, disguised as a postal worker, raided a counterfeit CD/DVD operation at the same warehouse where 43-year-old Ousmane Zongo, an immigrant from Guinea, worked repairing musical instruments. When Zongo encountered the cop, Conroy brandished his weapon and Zongo ran. The chase led to a dead end, where Conroy shot Zongo four times. NYPD officials later admitted that Zongo had nothing to do with the counterfeit operation. Conroy received no jail time. He was sentenced to five years of probation and lost his job with the NYPD.\n\nTim Stansbury\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2004, 19-year-old Tim Stansbury was shot by Officer Richard Neri on the roof of a building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Stansbury, a McDonald's employee who was working toward his high school diploma, died. A grand jury declined to indict Neri, who later admitted to pulling the trigger unintentionally. He was permanently stripped of his gun and given a 30-day suspension.\n\nSean Bell\n\nIn the early morning hours of his wedding day, Nov. 25, 2006, Sean Bell was celebrating his bachelor party with two friends at a Queens strip club, which a group of officers was investigating for alleged prostitution. An argument broke out outside the club between one of Bell's friends and another man, and one of them allegedly said he had a gun. Officer Gescard Isnora (who is also black) reportedly followed Bell and his friends to Bell's car upon hearing this, and approached the front of the car. Bell accelerated, striking Isnora. In response, Isnora and other officers fired 50 shots at Bell and two of his friends. Bell died, his friends were seriously wounded, and three of the cops went to trial for manslaughter. Each was found not guilty, and no gun was recovered from Bell's car.\n\nRamarley Graham\n\nGraham's father leans over his son's casket.\n\nNYPD Officer Richard Haste shot and killed 18-year-old Ramarley Graham in his grandmother's bathroom in the Bronx on Feb. 2, 2012. Haste had allegedly been responding to reports over police radio that Graham had a gun, but all he had on him was a small bag of marijuana. A grand jury decided not to indict Haste for the shooting.\n\nTamon Robinson\n\nOn April 12, 2012, 27-year-old Tamon Robinson ran away from cops after he allegedly stole paving stones from a construction site. (Later, friends said he had permission to take the stones.) During the chase, cops say Robinson ran into their police car. Witnesses, however, say officers intentionally mowed down Robinson, before bouncing him off the hood of the car. Robinson died of his injuries six days later. No charges have been filed against the police involved.\n\nKimani Gray\n\nKimani Gray, 16, was shot and killed by two police officers in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn on March 9, 2013. The officers allege that Gray pulled a gun on them first, but eyewitnesses dispute the account that Gray was armed. Neither has been charged, and one of the officers, Sgt. Mourad Mourad, received a Cop of the Year award from the NYPD this April.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "My Truth About Being A Black Man And A Black Cop\n\nPolice veteran and retired police chief\n\nAs more and more shootings of unarmed black men and women are brought to the public's attention, I understand the distrust that many ― especially people of color ― have against police. As a black man, I've been on the receiving end of profiling and discrimination. As a father to black children, I've had to have \"the talk\" with them about how to conduct themselves in encounters with law enforcement to make sure they leave with their lives. But I'm also a cop, and I know this job is dangerous and difficult and it comes with its share of fair and unfair scrutiny.\n\nI've spent the last 30 years reconciling these unique and conflicting identities. This effort was not without its struggle. I've tried to change the perspectives of people and officers around me, I've denied that I had differing perspectives of my own, I've tried to balance each identity and fit them into a safe - often false - narrative. All of these efforts failed.\n\nThrough these experiences, and those of so many officers and people of color, I've come to realize that the only way to reconcile these perspectives is to accept each experience and the truth they represent, and to allow them to co-exist. So, here are my truths.\n\n\"Real reconciliation can only occur when it starts with the truth, no matter the level of discomfort it may cause. The truth may hurt, but selective ignorance is fatal.\"\n\nI believe the vast majority of police officers do not engage in police brutality, but when tragedies such as the killing of unarmed black people occur, I question why so many of the victims are people who look like me. I've been racially profiled by the police. I've experienced discrimination in both my personal and professional life. I can't help but to wonder if these shootings, regardless of their legality, stem from implicit bias, our society's fear of black men, racism or a combination.\n\nI see my children, especially my 20-year-old son, in the faces of the young men and women of color who have been killed by the police and who have been victims of police brutality. For black parents, teaching our children \"what to do when stopped by the police\" is a mandatory course for young people of color in this nation. I can't deny the reality that I have to protect my children from potentially deadly encounters with people whom I respect and who wear the same uniform that I wear.\n\nAnd while it may be hard for everyday people to understand, I know firsthand the complex, challenging and dangerous nature of being a police officer. As a police chief, I've had to tell a wife that her husband, one of my fellow officers, was shot and killed in the line of duty. I've seen the emotional, physical and mental toll of the job weigh down my fellow officers. It has been an honor working side by side with so many selfless servants dedicated to helping others. I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are brave and honorable public servants. But despite this, racial disparities still exist and there's a growing divide between officers and civilians along racial lines.\n\n\"Yes, we must accept that there are, in fact, some racist police officers. We must also acknowledge that the majority of cops are not racist and they honor the law enforcement profession.\"\n\nIn many ways the varying perspectives I face, and the conflicts they create, are not that different from the diversity of opinions we hear as a nation and the political discourse they have created around black lives and police brutality. In response to these differences, many choose to ignore, deny or try to change differing perspectives and the truths they represent rather than trying to understand varying viewpoints and reconcile our differences.\n\nI tried to do this in my own life, and I've learned we cannot solve the problems we face concerning police and race if we continue to lie to ourselves about the nature of the problem. Real reconciliation can only occur when it starts with the truth, no matter how inconvenient it may be; no matter the level of discomfort it may cause. The truth may hurt, but selective ignorance is fatal.\n\nWe must learn the history of policing in this country and the role police have played in enforcing discriminatory laws. The truth is, significant racial disparities still exist in our policing and criminal justice systems. Many of the systems and practices in policing that exist today were designed in the 1950s and '60s to enforce discriminatory laws and oppress black Americans who are still being and feeling oppressed at this very moment.\n\nDespite the efforts of good officers, the continued use of these draconian operational systems and practices allow structural racism to remain and spread, and it allows racists officers to operate with impunity. And yes, we must accept that there are, in fact, some racist police officers. We must also acknowledge that the vast majority of cops are not racist and they honor the law enforcement profession.\n\nIt is a dangerous job and officers face many challenges. The truth is far too many of our communities are plagued by violence that create legitimate dangers for both the police and people we serve. However, it's important to remember that race is not the cause of this community violence. The true cause is institutional racism, societal inequities in education and housing as well as law and order policies that use incarceration as a strategy for keeping the peace.\n\n\"The shooting of unarmed black men and women, police brutality and racial disparities in the criminal justice system represent a national crisis that requires a national response and presidential leadership.\"\n\nBlaming the police alone for the inequities of the criminal justice system excuses prosecutors, judges, prison systems , health care disparities, lack of access to mental health services , poor education systems , etc. All of these systems contribute to the crime and violence in our neighborhoods and the overreliance on police to solve problems that extend well beyond our capacity.\n\nOnce we accept even these basic truths, it will become easier to work together rather than remain bitterly divided; to demand accountability from the entire justice system rather than just blame the police; and to develop real solutions to our problems instead of superficial responses to the symptoms.\n\nBoth the police and community are accountable for public safety. The police must be held accountable by the community and the community must be willing to hold itself accountable as well.\n\nSuch an effort requires all of us to take responsibility for our past and our future. And it requires an all-of-government response. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently stated these issues are \"a local matter.\" Nothing can be further from the truth. The shooting of unarmed black men and women, police brutality and racial disparities in the criminal justice system represent a national crisis that requires a national response and presidential leadership.\n\nI'm a black man, a black father and a black cop. My struggle has not been to balance these perspectives, but to allow them to co-exist. The first step in reconciling these perspectives is to understand that each of these experiences, while different, are valid. Too often we try to either change, ignore or deny the truth. As Nelson Mandela said, \"only the truth can put the past to rest.\" Once we understand, accept and acknowledge the reality each perspective represents, maybe we can move forward to create a new truth - one in which justice is truly blind and all are treated equal under the law.\n\nRonald Davis is a 30-year police veteran and retired police chief, the former director of the United States Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and the executive director of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "How to Rationalize the Deaths of Unarmed Black Men at the Hands of Police: It's the Narrative, Stupid\n\nSenior Reporter, WGBH News\n\nA sign and pin on the back of a demonstrator during a protest against the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, Aug. 13, 2014 (credit: Reuters)\n\nThe news accounts in recent weeks are tragically similar, from Los Angeles to Staten Island to Ferguson. Unarmed black men killed by police. But four years before anyone knew where Ferguson was located on a map, there was the fatal shooting of Danroy Henry Jr. , known to his friends and family as \"DJ.\"\n\nHenry, a 20-year-old college football player from Easton, Massachusetts, was a junior at Pace University, just north of New York City. Dozens of people whom I interviewed for a radio series described him as \"a good kid.\"\n\nAn image of the Danroy Henry Jr. in the home of his parents, Danroy Henry Sr. and Angella Henry (credit: Phillip Martin/WGBH)\n\nOn Oct. 17, 2010, after a night of celebrating following a homecoming game, Henry was shot to death by police officer Aaron Hess. Hess had responded to a report of a bar brawl in the early morning, which had nothing to do with the young football player and his four friends. The bar, in the village of Thornwood, shut down early that evening.\n\n\"So that's when DJ and I left and went to the car,\" said Henry's best friend, Brendon Cox. All parties agree that Henry's car was idling in a fire lane with his best friend Cox in the passenger seat. A cop told them to move the car, because they were parked in a fire lane. They did. \"We hear a loud tap on the window,\" Cox said.\n\nThey drove a few feet, says Cox, and then Pleasantville officer Aaron Hess suddenly and inexplicably jumped on the hood of the car and started firing wildly through the windshield.\n\n\"DJ's next to me and he says, 'They shot me,'\" Cox said. \"'They shot me. I can't believe they shot me.'\"\n\nHenry was pulled from the car by police and died not long afterwards as he lay unattended in the street. But police said Hess fired as Henry tried to run him over, leaving the officer with little choice but to jump onto the hood, a version of events that's disputed by new evidence in the civil case against Mt. Pleasant and the village of Pleasantville that's winding its way through federal court.\n\nFerguson: Echoes of DJ Henry\n\nFour years later and 1,200 miles away, another police version of events is seeking to explain the circumstances leading to the killing of another black youth, this one in Ferguson. At a press conference on Aug. 10, chief Thomas Jackson provided the explanation that Michael Brown rushed officer Darren Wilson when the policeman tried to pull him over.\n\n\"Within the police car there was a struggle over the officer's weapon,\" Jackson said. \"There was at least one shot fired within the car. After that, the officer came back into the car. He exited his vehicle and there was a shooting that occurred where the officer, in fact, shot the subject.\"\n\nBut like the police shooting of Henry, direct-eyewitness testimony is in variance with the official interpretation of reality. Tiffany Mitchell, who was visiting the neighborhood, told MSNBC what she saw in broad daylight:\n\nThe officer gets out of his vehicle and he pursues him, and as he's following him he's shooting at him, and Micheal's body jerked as though he was hit. And he turns around and he puts his hands up, and the officer continued to walk up on him and shoot him until he goes all the way down to the ground.\n\nA private autopsy commissioned by the family showed that 18-year-old Brown was shot at least six times.\n\nThe Narrative\n\nAs in the case of Henry in Mt. Pleasant, New York, four years earlier, Brown did not have a weapon. Two young unarmed black men shot by police under questionable circumstances. In both cases, what followed was information that trickled out questioning the character of the two black victims.\n\nSo why release questionable information?\n\n\"To justify the death of a person,\" says Lisa Thurau , an attorney who heads Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Strategies for Youth , which trains police nationwide in how to interact with young people, especially in communities of color. She says selective information from police agencies about which officers are implicated in fatal shootings should be closely examined but often isn't. \"And that's just an unfortunate thing that the media falls in step with and decides, 'Yeah, we're going to amplify the negative of the victim and then try to reclaim that victim's innocence, if possible, later on.'\"\n\nIn Henry's case, there were reports that he was intoxicated. But depositions made public in a pending civil trial suggest that he was not. In Brown's case, it was video showing him manhandling and \"robbing\" a store clerk. His supporters described the crime as \"shoplifting.\"\n\nThurau concedes that media could not ignore information about Henry and Brown. But she says reporters should ask, \"Is it relevant?\" and, \"Why is it being disseminated?\"\n\nThe Stereotype\n\nAfter the shootings, did racial stereotypes contribute to negative perceptions of the two black victims?\n\nKeith Maddox , a professor of psychology at Tufts University, says stereotypes combined with bits and pieces of information that may be factual but incomplete -- \"DJ Henry was drunk\" or \"Michael Brown robbed a store\" -- help create rationalizations for questionable police actions. And hearing certain words brings African Americans to mind, and viewing African Americans, says Maddox, leads to generalized racial assumptions:\n\nWhat some of the research has shown is that black skin color -- and you also think about other types of physical characteristics associated with blacks -- tend to be more closely associated with negative concepts, so it would be more closely associated with fear, more closely associated with negative personality traits.\n\nFerguson, and the Henry case four years earlier, may be forcing a national dialogue on policing and race, especially regarding the treatment of young black men, says Thurau.\n\n\"The current frame right now is that African-American youth are dangerous and need to be subdued, and I don't think that all officers believe that, but I do think it's the point of view of many officers,\" she said.\n\nSo how do you change this frame?\n\n\"We're going to have to do a couple of things,\" she said. \"One is training officers how to work with juveniles must be complemented by training officers how to recognize their own bias. Everyone is biased, but an officer is equipped with a weapon that can turn bias into death.\"\n\nSome data seem to back up that assertion.\n\n\"Since the year 2000 there has been an increase in blacks being killed by the cops -- a 39-percent increase,\" said criminologist James Allen Fox of Northeastern University. But Fox says that, at the same time, there has also been a 55-percent increase in the number of whites being killed by police. \"But of course when it happens to a white officer and a black suspect, it does raise questions about racial stereotypes and racial profiling,\" he said.\n\nThese figures have to be parsed carefully, however, because the federal government does not compile statistics on aggregate local police homicides, let alone the killing of unarmed individuals of any race.\n\nBased on a review of numerous cases over the past decade, when police kill black men in particular, under any circumstance, they almost never go to jail. Michael Sussman, the attorney representing the family of Danroy Henry Jr., says the problem starts with the district attorney's office:\n\nWe've had a spate of police shootings in America. I think one of the great lessons of these shootings is that local law enforcement officials, district attorneys offices, are then left -- as in the Staten Island case with Mr. Garner now -- to prosecute police officers, whom they institutionally work with on a daily basis and whom they not only trust but whose credibility they must elevate to do their own jobs. Accordingly, there's an inherent institutional conflict between the role of the district attorney and the prosecutor of numerous crimes and the role of the district attorney in prosecuting police officers who have committed serious crimes.\n\nAngela and Dan Henry. Angela Henry said she works day and night to keep the memory of her son alive through the DJ Henry Dream Fund (credit: Phillip Martin/WGBH)\n\nA Reluctant Embrace of Race\n\nEven though both the Brown and Henry cases have stirred strong racial passions, Henry's parents, Angella and Danroy Henry Sr., said they never wanted to make their son's killing an issue of race.\n\n\"We intentionally took an approach here that was more fact-based and measured,\" Danroy Henry Sr. said. \"We simply wanted to know what really happened. Our most immediate concern is for the truth.\"\n\nAnd in the backyard of their middle-class home, a half-hour south of Boston, Angella Henry reflects on the death of her son. Witnesses say that, like Brown, he was left dying on the ground without receiving immediate medical attention.\n\n\"You know, wrong is wrong, no matter what you put on every day to go to work,\" she said, sighing. \"If you wear a badge, if you wear a doctor's coat, there should be the same accountability. I believe that they should actually have been held to a higher standard because their job is to serve and protect.\" Angella pauses and looks out toward the garden where a sign is planted in the grass that reads, \"Family First.\"\n\n\"It's painful to look back and to think about how much we've been through, and how much we continue to go through, and how much coverup there was, and how little respect there was for our son's life, and it's beyond words. It's beyond description of the pain,\" she says.\n\nA New York grand jury found no evidence to indict Aaron Hess for Henry's death.\n\nSupporters of Henry maintain that Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore purposely blew the case . A spokesman for DiFiore declined to comment. Attorney Sussman, however, says the DA's office's prosecution of cops in homicide cases is inherently contradictory and should be investigated by independent agencies. \"In New York we need a special prosecutor who will have jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute these cases and who is not beholden to local police departments and agencies,\" he says.\n\nThe DJ Henry case is now closed on the state level. But the civil federal court trail could begin as early as next winter. And WGBH has confirmed that the Justice Department is still investigating the fatal shooting of DJ Henry, but at a much slower pace than the high-profile investigation that has begun into the slaying of Michael Brown on a suburban street in Missouri.\n\nWGBH Radio Report: \" Ferguson: The Latest Racially Tinged Case Of Death-By-Police \"\n\nRead the complete series: \" DJ Henry and the Training of Police \"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Recent Slayings of Unarmed Black Men Showcase Culture of Police Violence\n\nDirector, ACLU National Office's Racial Justice Program\n\nHow long can we expect to see new reports and videos of unarmed black men being shot by police in incidents all across the country? Aspects of two of the most recent shootings in Tulsa, Okla. and North Charleston, S.C., suggest some answers to the question, and the answers do not bode well.\n\nThe videotaped shootings of Eric Harris in Oklahoma and Walter Scott in South Carolina both depict the killing of unarmed black men as a result of what appears to be an unjustified and unnecessary use of force. Scott was hit five times in the back while running slowly away from the police officer who ended his life, while the fatal shot to the back of Eric Harris came from a volunteer reserve deputy who had been allowed to carry a badge and gun after he made substantial donations to the Tulsa sheriff. Both cases merit immediate and thorough investigation, and appropriate steps should be taken to prosecute any police officer determined to have engaged in illegal conduct in connection with the deaths of Mr. Scott and Mr. Harris.\n\nBut looking at each incident in its entirety suggests that the problems run far deeper than mere accidents or miscalculations that occur in a split second under extreme stress. Instead, both cases demonstrate a distinct callousness and insensitivity, which suggest that the stage for these killings may have been set long before shots were actually fired.\n\nAfter shooting Walter Scott five times, Officer Michael Slager showed no concern for Scott's distress. Instead, Slager approached the dying man, who lay face down in the grass only to handcuff him, walk calmly away, and then retrieve something that the officer later dropped near his lifeless body. After being shot by Tulsa volunteer deputy Bob Bates, Eric Harris, handcuffed and crying in pain, was told to \"shut the fuck up\" by one of the arresting officers, who, adding insult to injury, responded to the wounded man's statement that he was having trouble breathing with, \"Fuck your breath.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether that officer recognized Harris' statement as an eerie echo of Eric Garner's repeated complaint of \"I can't breath\" before his death from a chokehold at the hands of the NYPD last summer -- a statement later adopted as a rallying cry by those protesting the illegal use of force by police. Whether the officer's crude and insensitive comment was a broader rebuke to the idea that #blacklivesmatter, or just a reaction to the instant circumstances, there can be no doubt that he displayed a fundamental disregard for the humanity of the person who had just been wrongfully shot by his volunteer colleague.\n\nSadly, this gross disregard for black life is not limited to these two shootings, nor is it limited to the Black shooting victims themselves. Instead, the families of the victims, as well as members of the communities from which they come, are often treated disrespectfully and with unnecessary physical force by police. After police shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice while he was playing with a toy gun, officers forcibly tackled Rice's 14-year-old sister, who was still in shock over her brother's shooting, and later threatened to arrest his mother, who was understandably distraught over the news of her son's shooting.\n\nNor should the blame be placed solely with the individual police officers involved in these incidents. In these and many other cases in which officers shot and killed black men, law enforcement agencies have responded by releasing information about the victims' past criminal records, intended to besmirch the characters of those on the receiving end of their brutality -- as if the fact of a victim's prior involvement with the criminal justice system justified the illegal use of force by people sworn to uphold the law. The release of such information and the publication of slanted stories about these crime victims by the law enforcement agencies who may later be responsible for investigating the same crimes not only unfairly taints the victims, but it also reinforces the overt and implicit biases that depict black men as being violent people who deserve whatever violence has been perpetrated against them.\n\nTo their credit, the North Charleston Police Department and mayor both arrested the offending police officer and reached out in sympathy to Mr. Scott's family. Likewise, the Tulsa County district attorney has charged the volunteer deputy who shot Eric Harris with manslaughter, providing hope that some measure of justice will be served. These common sense actions and gestures are the first small steps in addressing a police culture of fear and bias that is perpetuated by the too common failure to hold accountable police who use excessive force against people of color. But if we fail to follow through and eliminate that culture, it will assure that the stories of police violence now filling the media will continue on a loop without end. And with every one of these stories there comes another life ended, another set of family and friends in grief, another community torn apart, and another tragedy that could have been prevented.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Heartbreaking Illustrations Document The Last Words Of Young, Unarmed Black Men\n\nContributor\n\nThe recent shooting of Missouri teenager Michael Brown has revived a national conversation about race and police brutality, about \"walking while black,\" and about the perils of being young and not white in America.\n\nThe community protests that followed have demanded much-needed nationwide soul-searching about who we are and whether those who promise to serve and protect us are fulfilling that promise with much too narrow of a scope.\n\nBecause although it's Brown's name on everyone's lips, he was not the first to fall accidental victim of institutional prejudice, and without a national conversation that results in meaningful change, he will not be the last.\n\nJournalist Shirin Barghi collected the last words of men like Michael Brown -- young, black, killed by authority figures while unarmed -- and turned them into powerful illustrations.\n\n\"I created these images to raise awareness about racist police violence in America and as an expression of solidarity,\" she tweeted. \"I experienced police brutality in my native Iran, and the struggle here to confront that violence resonated with me.\"\n\nThe minimalist images, eight of which appear below, are poignant echoes of the victims' final moments.\n\nOriginally stopped for walking in the street, Michael Brown was shot a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri , two days before he was set to begin classes at Vatterott College.\n\nTrayvon Martin, a high school student, was killed by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman while walking to his father's house.\n\nGroom-to-be Sean Bell, 23, was leaving his bachelor party when police fired 50 bullets at him .

      "text": "9 Absurd Justifications For Police Killings Of Unarmed Black Males\n\nEditorial Fellow, HuffPost\n\nIn recent weeks, protests have spread across America in response to multiple grand juries declining to indict police officers responsible for the deaths of unarmed black men. Those decisions have led to an outpouring of grief, anger and anxiety over a criminal justice system that seems to operate with little accountability, especially where the deaths of people of color are concerned.\n\nIt's not clear exactly why grand juries rarely choose to indict police officers involved in the deaths of unarmed black men. But we do hear the excuses made on their behalf.\n\nHere are some of the explanations and justifications we've been offered:\n\n1. Health complications.\n\nEric Garner's July 17 death at the hands of NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo was captured on film and circulated on the Internet. Garner's last words, \"I can't breathe,\" later became a rallying cry during demonstrations made in his name. Pantaleo, who placed Garner in a chokehold prohibited by the police department, was not indicted for the death. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said shortly after the grand jury's decision that Garner would have survived the fatal chokehold had he not been \"obese.\"\n\n2. Standing in a stairwell.\n\nAkai Gurley, 28, was fatally shot by NYPD Officer Peter Liang in the Louis Pink housing projects in Brooklyn last month. New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton defended the shooting as an \"accidental discharge\" in a \"dark\" stairwell by a cop who had been on the force less than 18 months.\n\n3. Resembling someone's idea of a \"thug.\"\n\nIn August, 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot in Ferguson, Missouri, by Officer Darren Wilson following a daytime altercation in the street. During a recent segment on NewsMaxTV, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee insisted that Brown would still be alive \" if he behaved like something other than a thug ,\" an apparent reference to disputed witness testimony that Brown was reaching for Wilson's gun before he was shot. (Most of the witnesses who testified before the grand jury said that Brown had his hands raised when he was killed.)\n\n4. Wearing a sweatshirt.\n\nTrayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teen whose death in February 2012 led to protests across America, was blamed for his own death for wearing a hooded sweatshirt. Trayvon, 17, was gunned down by George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watch volunteer. Shortly after Trayvon was killed, Fox News host Geraldo Rivera said , \"I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin's death as George Zimmerman was.\" (Zimmerman, it should be noted, was a civilian neighborhood watch officer, not a policeman.)\n\n5. Being the child of someone with a troubled past.\n\nTamir Rice, 12, was gunned down by Cleveland police while holding a toy gun at a public park last month. The Northeast Ohio Media Group then ran a story about Tamir's father, Leonard Warner, and Warner's history of domestic violence -- because, author Brandon Blackwell explained, \"people from across the region have been asking whether Rice grew up around violence.\"\n\nWarner was not present when Tamir was killed. Blackwell's story on Warner offered no background information on Officer Timothy Loehmann, who was deemed unfit for policing two years before he shot Tamir.\n\n6. Taking your medication.\n\nA Phoenix police officer fatally shot 34-year-old Rumain Brisbon earlier this month after mistaking a pill bottle in Brisbon's pocket for the handle of a gun.\n\n7. Asking for help after being in a car accident.\n\nJonathan Ferrell, 24, was shot in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September after surviving a car accident. Ferrell crawled through a window of his car and began banging on the door of a nearby home to get attention. When officers arrived at the scene in response to the homeowner's report of an attempted break-in, they shot Ferrell 10 times as he approached them with empty hands.\n\n8. ( Possibly ) dressing up as a character from a TV series.\n\nThis is what Hunt was wearing when he was killed. Compare to the character from Samurai Champloo. Was he cosplaying? pic.twitter.com/TlFS49OTYJ\n\n- Jamelle Bouie (@jbouie) September 15, 2014\n\nDarrien Hunt, 22, was fatally shot in September when Utah officers responded to a call of someone walking around with a \" samurai-type sword .\" Cops said that Hunt lunged at them with the toy sword, but witnesses claimed to have seen him running from the officers, and an independent autopsy showed that Hunt was shot in the back.\n\n9. Complying with a police officer's command, immediately.\n\nLevar Edward Jones was shot by South Carolina trooper Sean Groubert in September. As Jones stood next to the open door of his vehicle, Groubert asked him to retrieve his wallet. Jones reached into his car to do so. Groubert then demanded that Jones get out of the car, and opened fire as Jones complied. Jones asked: \"Sir, why was I shot? All I did was reach for my license.\" Groubert responded: \"Well, you dove headfirst back into your car.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Police Shootings Are About Class as Well as Race\n\nFounder and president, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition\n\nAfter three days of peaceful demonstrations marking the one year anniversary of Michael Brown's fatal shooting in Ferguson, Mo., yet another African-American man was shot by police there. While the facts are still unclear, the tragedy will surely add to the national protests challenging our racially biased structures of criminal injustice.\n\nA week earlier, a young, unarmed man was shot to death by a police officer in Seneca, South Carolina. Only this young man was not black, but white.\n\nAccording to CNN , Zachary Hammond was fatally shot while in a Hardee's parking lot. He was 19 years old and on a date. The police officer was conducting a drug investigation and claims that he shot Hammond in self-defense when the unarmed teenager drove his car at him.\n\nA small amount of marijuana was found in the front passenger compartment. Police said the target of the investigation was not Hammond but his date. An independent autopsy showed, however, that Hammond was shot in the back, not the front, contradicting the official story.\n\n\"He was a 19-year-old, 121-pound kid killed basically for a joint,\" the family attorney Eric Bland said .\n\nCNN reported that if this had been an African-American victim, it would have received national attention. That is true now, but only because an active movement of demonstrators have made it so. In fact, virtually the only protests to Hammond's death were issued by #BlackLivesMatter activists on social media.\n\nOne year after Michael Brown's fatal shooting in Ferguson, unarmed black men are still seven times more likely than whites to die by police gunfire, according to a new study by the Washington Post .\n\nSo far this year, the Post reports, 24 unarmed black men have been shot and killed by police -- one every nine days. The Post reports that 585 people in total have been shot and killed by police through August 7. (The Guardian database reports that 700 have been killed by police.)\n\nThere is no question that African-American men are at greatest risk. After the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, national protests have forced reform of the police and of mass incarceration policies onto the national agenda. The names of those who died from police violence -- Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Samuel DuBose, Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, Freddy Gray, Sandra Bland and more -- are etched in public memory because demonstrators have demanded justice for them.\n\nThe non-violent protests of demonstrators and the black church have forced community after community to respond. After Ferguson, and with the spread of cameras that have caught the police in lies, the police are no longer completely immune. In 24 states, reform measures -- many focused on requiring body cameras -- have been introduced. These are merely the first stirrings of change. But the killings haven't stopped.\n\nWhile African-Americans are at disproportionate risk from the structural and human biases of our criminal justice system, we should not forget that working and poor people of all races suffer from police excessive use of force. Police kill more whites than blacks.\n\nOf the 700 killings it has recorded, the Guardian reports that 340 were white, 179 black and 101 Hispanic. The Post reports that African-American men were 40 percent of the unarmed deaths, but whites and Hispanics made up the majority.\n\nThe system has a class bias as well as a race bias. An investigation by Alternet's Zaid Jilani revealed that in the first five months of this year, 95 percent of police killings occurred in neighborhoods with median family incomes under $100,000. There were no killings in neighborhoods with median family incomes of $200,000 or above.\n\nNot surprisingly, lower-income whites are more likely to say police abuse of authority is on the rise than middle- or upper-income whites.\n\nExcessive force puts white lives at risk, as well as those of blacks and Hispanics. But the silence of the white community and of the white church is deafening. The victims of police abuse are left to seek justice on their own.\n\nWe need people of conscience in the white community to join with the growing movement grounded in the African-American community to demand reform. Too often, police don't live in the communities they patrol. They are armed to the teeth, but often receive too little training in how police can help build a community rather than simply occupy it.\n\nPeople of all races and all incomes care about safe streets. They want their children protected; their parents able to walk outside with security. This is as true of impoverished African American neighborhoods as it is of upscale suburbs. But one year after Ferguson, it's clear we all have a stake in dramatic reform of the American way of policing, if the police are to be trusted as protectors and not threats.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Danny Ray Thomas Was a Broken Man Who Needed Help. Instead He Was Gunned Down by a Cop in Broad Daylight.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nEveryone should know his name.\n\nEveryone should know the name and story of Danny Ray Thomas, but too few people do. Our national attention span for police brutality and racial violence has plummeted since the election of President Donald Trump. He has a way of completely sucking the wind out of the news cycle and much of mainstream media obliges - obsessing over his every move.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016, we reached a national crescendo - where the important names and stories of injustices, and the cities where they happened, were seen and known by the world. Over 3,500 people were killed by American police during that period, according to the website Killed by Police , which aggregates information about reported killings. In 2014, the nation came to know the stories of Mike Brown and Tamir Rice. In 2015, it was Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland. In 2016, it was Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.\n\nBut what about 2017? Of the 1,193 people killed by American police last year, according to Killed by Police , whose story do you know? When I ask this question of audiences around the country, most people struggle to name one person. Why is that? What happened? The brutality damn sure didn't end.\n\nUntil police slaughtered 22-year-old Stephon Clark - an unarmed, nonviolent black man - in his own backyard in a hail of twenty bullets, could you name a single victim of police violence from 2018?\n\nI'm not judging you. You don't know these names and stories because they just aren't being shared with the same force of previous years. But you need to find a place in your heart and mind to know the story of Danny Ray Thomas.\n\nIt's a story of grief. It's a story of the excessive consequences of mass incarceration. It's a story of mental health. It's a story of the criminalization of drug addiction in black communities. And, as far as I'm concerned, it's a story of a police officer who cared so little about the story, the humanity, the pain, that he executed a broken man in broad daylight. The details I'm going to give you about this case - that Danny Ray Thomas was unarmed, that the cop had other ways to deal with it, and much more - make it hard to see this any other way.\n\nA Houston police officer caries bags of evidence after a local woman allegedly drowned her 7-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, on Aug. 14, 2016, in Houston.\n\nThe crisis of mass incarceration does many things - chief among them is that it tears families apart. On August 12, 2016, Thomas, who was then 32 years old, was serving a three-year prison sentence in Bryan, Texas - over one hundred miles away from his kids in Houston. The man had lived a rough life and struggled with drug addiction. According to local news reports, he was sentenced to three years in prison not for a violent crime, not even for selling drugs, but for possession of PCP .\n\nHe needed rehab, diversion, and counseling. Instead, like hundreds of thousands of African-Americans, he was sent to prison. This isn't how that situation goes down in affluent white communities across this country when parents or children struggle with drug addiction.\n\nOn Friday, August 12, 2016 - while Thomas was serving that outrageous sentence in prison - the unthinkable happened. His two children, 5-year-old Kayiana and her 7-year-old brother Araylon \"Ray Ray\" Thomas, named after his father, were killed. According to local news reports, their mother, 30-year-old Sheborah Thomas, invited the kids one by one into the bathroom and deliberately drowned them. Earlier that day, the kids had performed at a talent show.\n\nAfter Sheborah Thomas allegedly killed the kids, she hid their lifeless bodies under her neighbor's house and left them there for days until she told an acquaintance on Sunday. The acquaintance took her to a police station and flagged down an officer; Sheborah Thomas then confessed to the crime. She was charged with capital murder and is still in jail now, awaiting trial.\n\nImagine now the pain of Danny Ray Thomas, far away from home, locked behind bars for simple drug possession. Imagine getting the news that your babies were drowned to death. When it happened, Jason Clark, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, released a statement on how Thomas received the news: \"As you can imagine, he's pretty upset right now.\"\n\nI don't how I'd wake up and push through life again if anyone killed my babies. But trying to imagine being in prison, and their deaths happening while I was away, is simply unthinkable. Those who knew Thomas, of course, said he struggled mightily in the wake of such a loss. How could he not?\n\nHis sister Marketa Thomas told reporters that she and her brother both struggled with mental illness and supported each other through it all the best way they knew how. \"He had my back through everything. And he promised me he wouldn't leave me, and he didn't leave me,\" she said. \"Somebody took him from me.\"\n\nIndeed, they did.\n\nLast Thursday, in broad daylight, as onlookers filmed and even nervously laughed a little, Thomas appeared to be in the middle of a mental health emergency. Waddling through the street with his pants all the way down at his feet, his body moved, but his mind was somewhere else. He genuinely appeared lost, wandering to and fro aimlessly, walking with intention but going nowhere sensible.\n\nIt was a spectacle. Even if you didn't know that the man wandering around with his pants at his feet had had his heart and soul ripped away, any sensible human being would've known that Thomas was a man in distress. He needed an ambulance. Instead, he got a cop.\n\n(This video contains graphic images that some readers may find disturbing,)\n\n#BREAKING Video obtained by the @HoustonChron shows the death of Danny Ray Thomas after he was shot by a Harris County deputy Thursday. No weapon was recovered at the scene, officials said. #hounews #breakingnews\n\nWatch the full video: https://t.co/wqh4BKPRZo pic.twitter.com/jdoj0gc3hv\n\n- Robert Downen (@RobertDownen_) March 24, 2018\n\nThat cop, Cameron Brewer, worked for the Harris County Sheriff's Office and just happened to be in the area when he saw the disturbance Thomas was causing. Within 30 seconds, Thomas was shot and killed.\n\nDanny Ray Thomas was completely unarmed. From what we can see in the videos of the encounter - only a few seconds of which are off-camera - it doesn't appear that Thomas ever touched or threatened the officer.\n\nWhat's doubly disturbing is that the officer, as we so often hear, had a body camera , according to the Harris County Sheriff, but it was charging in his car. He also had a Taser, but chose not to use it; and he had been trained in how to deescalate a mental health crisis, but appeared to have forgotten that, too.\n\nIf America's nurses were as nervous and easily frightened as our cops, and had the power to shoot people, our national murder rate would skyrocket overnight. Instead, those nurses, who see broken men like Thomas every hour of every single day, find a way to provide treatment without ever firing a single bullet.\n\nUnarmed black men like Danny Ray Thomas and Stephon Clark received absolutely no patience from the officers who eventually shot and killed them, but watch the endless patience cops gave the man in another video posted to Twitter .\n\nHow in the world is the Parkland shooter, armed with an arsenal and having killed 17 people, alive, but Danny Ray Thomas is dead? How in the world is Dylann Roof, having slaughtered nine sweet souls at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, alive, but Stephon Clark couldn't make it out of his own backyard after being suspected of vandalism?\n\nWaddling through those streets with his pants down, Danny Ray Thomas couldn't have outrun a little old lady. He was a nuisance. Whatever crime he committed would've likely received a ticket or citation.\n\nInstead, he got the death penalty. While the local sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, has expressed concern about the shooting by his deputy, concern is not justice. Concern is better than nothing, I suppose, but only slightly. That concern won't bring this man's life back.\n\nJust as cops did with Stephon Clark, Deputy Cameron Brewer served as judge, jury, and executioner for Danny Ray Thomas. He faced no jury of his peers. He had no reasonable opportunity to defend himself. His misery is now over, but this was not suicide by cop. Danny Ray Thomas did not ask for this. He didn't leave this earth on his own terms. As deeply wounded and broken of a man as he was, he had his entire life ahead to try to put the broken pieces back together again.\n\nThat's what life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness means. Danny Ray Thomas was denied all three.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "\"Down Outright Murder\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA Complete Guide to the Shooting of Michael Brown by Darren Wilson\n\nThe nation is on edge, awaiting a grand jury decision in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown - an unarmed African American teen in Ferguson, Missouri - by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson more than three months ago. The decision is expected any day and there is widespread belief, based on weeks of leaks to the media and laws that historically favor police officers in lethal force cases, that Wilson will not be indicted. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has preemptively declared a state of emergency in anticipation of protests.\n\nBrown's killing, the culmination of an incident that the St. Louis Post Dispatch would later report lasted no more than 90 seconds, devastated a family with high hopes for their college-bound son and sparked some of the most significant civil rights demonstrations in a generation - casting a harsh light on the disproportionate number of black men killed by police, on St. Louis County's exploitative and racially discriminatory municipal court system , and on the militarization of law enforcement .\n\nIn the months since Brown was killed, numerous eyewitnesses have come forward to describe what they saw during the teen's final moments, while controversial disclosures to the press have served to describe Wilson's version of the events that day.\n\nThis is everything we know about the shooting.\n\nIt was just past noon on August 9 when Wilson and Brown's paths first crossed in Ferguson's Canfield Green apartment complex. Wilson had just finished responding to a call regarding a sick infant. Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson, 22, were walking in a two-lane residential street when Wilson approached in his sport utility patrol vehicle and told them to get on the sidewalk. The precise details of what happened next have been at the center of months of protest and outrage.\n\nMost agree on the following: There was some sort of physical struggle between Brown and Wilson while Wilson was still in his vehicle; Brown ran from the confrontation; Wilson got out of the vehicle and fatally shot Brown at least six times from a distance; Brown was unarmed; and his bleeding body lay in the hot summer sun for four hours , much of that time uncovered, as the residents of Canfield looked upon his splayed-out corpse in horror.\n\nThe Ferguson Police Department turned the investigation into Brown's killing over to the larger St. Louis County Police Department almost immediately. The morning after Brown was killed, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar held a press conference. With protesters shouting in the background, Blemar told reporters that Brown \"physically assaulted\" an unnamed officer while the officer was in his vehicle. The teen was going for the officer's gun, the police chief said.

There was at least one shot fired within the car,\" Belmar said. While acknowledging that Brown was unarmed, Belmar said \"more than a few\" shell casings were found at the scene of the shooting but did not say how many times the officer fired, nor how many times Brown was hit.\n\n\"It was more than just a couple, but I don't think it was many more than that,\" Belmar said of the shots fired. The shooting, he said, took place roughly 35 feet from the officer's vehicle.\n\nUnder Missouri state law , police officers are granted authority to use deadly force \"in effecting an arrest or in preventing an escape from custody\" if \"he reasonably believes\" it is necessary \"to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes that the person to be arrested has committed or attempted to commit a felony...or may otherwise endanger life or inflict serious physical injury unless arrested without delay.\" As an officer with the Ferguson Police Department, Wilson was also required to follow department guidelines on the use of force .\n\nIn mid-October, The New York Times published an article previewing Wilson's official version of events, as told to the grand jury during his four-hour testimony. The disclosures were, in essence, a repeat of claims Wilson's employer and friends had been making for months: The police officer was going about his duties when he came across a teenager who attacked him through his window and tried to steal his gun. As the story went, during the ordeal Wilson thought he might be killed so, after the teen took off running, Wilson got out of his vehicle and shot him to death.\n\nCiting unnamed \"government officials briefed on the federal civil rights investigation into the\" shooting, the Times reported that two shots, not one, as previously reported, were fired inside Wilson's vehicle and that Brown's blood was splashed across on the interior panel of the SUV, as well as Wilson's gun and uniform. According to the paper, \"Wilson told the authorities that Mr. Brown had punched and scratched him repeatedly, leaving swelling on his face and cuts on his neck.\"\n\nThe fact that Wilson testified was telling. He was not legally required to do so, and in most grand jury cases defendants do not testify because their attorney cannot be present. This move, some suggested, was an indication that Wilson and his legal counsel felt the proceedings would work to his favor.\n\nWilson's decision to testify wasn't the only unorthodox thing about the grand jury proceedings. In addition, St. Louis County's top prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, opted to have the grand jurors decide what charges, if any, to file against Wilson. Those charges could include murder or manslaughter. From the beginning, however, a first-degree murder charge has been considered unlikely, as it would require proving Wilson harbored a malicious intent to kill Brown. A second-degree murder charge, meanwhile, could be overcome if Wilson could successfully argue that he was in fear for his life or the lives of others at the time of the incident, and it was clear early on that Wilson would argue that he feared for his life. Wilson could face lesser charges, like voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, if the jurors find that he was negligent in the shooting.\n\nIn the secretive process of a grand jury, a prosecutor wields considerable power to influence the determination of the jurors on the question of whether or not to indict. Critics argued that by shifting this responsibility to the jurors in the Brown case, presenting them with all of the witnesses and evidence in the investigation and effectively asking the 12 citizens on the panel, including three African-Americans, to make up their own minds, McCulloch was making a half-hearted attempt to secure an indictment while simultaneously insulating himself from any criticism if Wilson walked. McCulloch also turned over the bulk of the work in the case to two veteran prosecutors from his office, further distancing himself from the day-to-day proceedings.\n\nFor weeks, protesters and supporters of the Brown family, as well as elected officials, rallied to have McCulloch removed from the case, arguing that he had a longstanding history, rooted in personal trauma, of protecting police officers in use-of-force cases. McCulloch's father was a police officer killed in the line of duty, 50 years before Brown was gunned down, by a black man who stole his gun. Several of McCulloch's family members, including his mother, brother, uncle, and cousin, have worked for the St. Louis Police Department. McCulloch himself had a long hoped to join the force, but after losing his leg to cancer in high school he decided to become a prosecutor. \"I couldn't become a policeman, so being county prosecutor is the next best thing,\" he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch .\n\nIn 2001, McCulloch oversaw a particularly controversial fatal shooting case in which two unarmed black men, caught up in a small-time drug sting , were shot 21 times in broad daylight by undercover officers at a Jack In the Box drive-through. In presenting the case to the grand jury, McCulloch said the men pulled forward at the officers, prompting them to open fire. The jurors decided not to indict the officers-who both testified-based on the evidence McCulloch presented. \"These guys were bums,\" McCulloch said of the deceased. The case became a flashpoint of racial tension that has been seared in the minds of many members of St. Louis County's African American communities ever since. A subsequent investigation by The St. Louis Post Dispatch found that only three of the 13 officers involved in the sting said the vehicle moved forward; the two officers who shot and a third officer whose testimony McCulloch later described as \"completely wrong.\"\n\nInvestigators inspect Brown's body.\n\nOutside the secretive confines of the grand jury, the accounts of multiple eyewitnesses to the shooting, relayed through the media and typically contradictory to the official police account, played a major role in driving the anger over Brown's killing. As far as evidence goes, eyewitness testimony is far from perfect. According to the Innocence Project , a non-profit that has secured the release of hundreds of wrongfully convicted people over the last two decades, \"eyewitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions nationwide, playing a role in 72% of convictions overturned through DNA testing.\"\n\nFallibility aside, the relative consistency of basic facts in the eyewitness accounts to Brown's killing - combined with a history of racially biased, violent policing in many of St. Louis County's African-American neighborhoods - fueled weeks of outrage. A refusal on the part of local authorities to release key pieces of information to the public made matters worse.\n\nOn August 12, three days after Brown was killed, Johnson, the friend who was with him at the time of his death, gave a detailed description of the shooting to the press. Similar accounts soon followed.\n\nJohnson said that when Wilson rolled up in his patrol vehicle, he told the two to \"get the fuck onto the sidewalk\" and that they responded by saying that they were nearing their destination. According to Johnson, Wilson, who had apparently continued past them, slammed on his brakes and reversed in their direction, pulling up so close that when he attempted to open his driver's side door it slammed into Brown and remained closed. Johnson claimed that there was a \"tug of war\" struggle between Brown and Wilson, with Wilson grabbing at Brown's neck-\"[Brown]did not reach for a weapon at all,\" Johnson said . Johnson said Wilson told Brown \"I'll shoot\" and that a shot went off while Wilson was in the vehicle. Johnson thought Brown might have been hit by the first shot, as blood was beginning to soak through Brown's shirt on his right side.\n\nAccording to Johnson, he and Brown took off running after the first shot. Wilson stepped out of his vehicle. Johnson ducked behind a car and Brown continued on. Johnson said Wilson's second shot struck Brown in the back and that the teen then turned around with his hands up and said, \"I don't have a gun, stop shooting!\" Wilson fired several more shots, Johnson said, and Brown fell to the concrete curled into a fetal position. Johnson's attorney later said his client recalled that Brown's hands were not held high, that one was lower than the other because he seemed to be \"favoring it.\"\n\nOne day after Johnson's first interview, Tiffany Mitchell, 27, came forward to describe what she saw that afternoon on Canfield Drive. In multiple interviews, with local news outlets, MSNBC , and CNN , Mitchell said that she too witnessed a physical struggle between Brown and Wilson through Wilson's window and that a shot went off while Wilson was still inside the vehicle. That shot, she said, was fired while Brown's hands were on the outside of the vehicle, in what she believed was the teen's effort to push himself away from the officer. Mitchell claimed that after the first shot Brown managed to break away and took off running. Wilson got out of his vehicle, she said, and fired more shots. Mitchell said that at one point Brown jerked, as if he may have been shot, and that's when he turned around and faced Wilson.\n\n\"After the shot, the kid just breaks away. The cop follows him, kept shooting, the kid's body jerked as if he was hit. After his body jerked he turns around, puts his hands up, and the cop continues to walk up on him and continues to shoot until he goes all the way down,\" Mitchell told a local TV news outlet.\n\nMitchell was in the Canfield complex to pick up her coworker, Piaget Crenshaw, 19, who also witnessed the shooting. Crenshaw told the Post-Dispatch that Brown's hands were in the air when he attempted to flee from Wilson. From her apartment, Crenshaw shot cell phone video depicting the moments immediately following the shooting. Crenshaw shared her video with CNN. The video showed a dazed Wilson, wearing his blue Ferguson police uniform, pacing around Brown's body. Crenshaw told CNN that she believed she saw Wilson attempting to pull Brown into his vehicle but failed and Brown got away. \"It just seemed to have upset the officer,\" Crenshaw said. She said Wilson then exited his vehicle and was \"chasing after\" Brown. She said multiple shots were fired and said she believed one might have grazed Brown.\n\n\"At the end [Brown] just turned around, after I'm guessing he felt the bullet graze his arm, he turned around then was shot multiple times,\" Crenshaw said.\n\nDarren Wilson was identified as the officer who killed Michael Brown on August 15, three days after Johnson came forward and nearly a full week after the shooting took place. The police had initially said he would be identified earlier, but changed course and decided to keep his name secret for several additional days, pointing to concerns for Wilson's safety. That same day, the police also revealed the existence of surveillance camera footage that purported to show Brown and Johnson stealing a box of cigars from a local convenience store.\n\nSince Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged that Wilson's initial decision to stop Brown and Johnson had nothing to do with the alleged strong-arm robbery, Brown's parents and supporters argued that the release of the video-which the Department of Justice protested -was a blatant attempt at character assassination. Rep. William Lacy Clay of St. Louis said McCulloch's office was attempting to influence the jury.\n\n\"Bob McCulloch tried to taint the jury pool by the stunt he pulled today,\" the congressman told the Post-Dispatch . \"I have no faith in him, but I do trust the FBI and the Justice Department.\"\n\nTwo days later, on the evening of August 17, a private autopsy of Brown's body was made public. The autopsy was performed by Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York, at the request of the Brown family. The examination found that Brown was shot at least six times, including twice in the head and four times in the right arm. All but one of the shots appeared to have happened while Brown was facing Wilson, though one of the wounds to the teen's arm could have occurred while Brown was facing away from Wilson, according to Shawn L. Parcells, who participated in the autopsy. With no gunpowder residue found on Brown's body, the shots appeared to have been fired from a distance. Among the most significant wounds Baden examined was the bullet hole in the top of Brown's head.\n\n\"This one here looks like his head was bent downward,\" he told The New York Times . \"It can be because he's giving up, or because he's charging forward at the officer.\"\n\nThe day after the private autopsy results were revealed, a caller identifying herself as \"Josie\" phoned into The Dana Show , a conservative talk-radio program, and said she was a friend of Wilson's. In a six-minute interview , Josie offered the officer's version of the shooting, which largely foreshadowed the account Wilson ultimately gave to the grand jury.\n\n\"[Brown and Johnson] were walking in the middle of the street,\" Josie began. \"[Wilson] rolled his window down and said, 'Come on guys. Get out of the street.' They refused to and were yelling back, saying we're almost where we're going and there was some cussing involved.\"\n\nJosie said Wilson had pulled ahead of the young men when he received a call over the radio about a strong-arm robbery. According to Josie, Brown and Johnson fit the description broadcast over the radio. \"He goes in reverse back to them, tries to get out of his car, they slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did,\" Josie said.\n\n\"Then he opens his car again and tries to get out and as he stands up Michael just bum rushes him, and just shoves him back into his car, punches him in the face and then of course Darren grabs for his gun and Michael grabs the gun,\" Josie added. \"At one point he's got the gun totally turned against his hip and then he shoves it away and the gun goes off.\"\n\n\"Michael takes off with his friend,\" she said. \"They get to be about 35 feet away and Darren, of course protocol is to pursue. So he stands up and yells, 'Freeze!' Michael and his friend turn around and Michael starts taunting him. 'Oh, what are you going to do about it? You're not gonna shoot me.'\"\n\n\"And then he said all of a sudden [Brown] just started to bum rush him,\" Josie said. \"He just started coming at him full speed so [Wilson] he just started shooting and he just kept coming. So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something because he just kept coming. It was unbelievable. And then so he finally ended up, the final shot was in the forehead and then he fell about 2, 3 feet in front of the officer.\"\n\nCNN quickly picked up on the interview and that afternoon reported that Josie's account was consistent with the version of events Wilson provided to authorities, citing \"direct guidance\" the news outlet had received.\n\nIn late October, Brown's official autopsy was leaked to the Post Dispatch . The 16-page report said that Brown had been shot nine times. Three of the shots entered Brown's head - once in the top of the head, once in the right eye, and once in the \"right central forehead\" - two entered the chest, three entered the right arm, and one entered his right hand, \"near his thumb and palm.\"\n\n\"The official report notes an absence of stippling, powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot fired at relatively short range,\" the paper reported.\n\nAccording to the narrative report of the investigation prepared by the office of the medical examiner, Brown had become \"belligerent\" after Wilson ordered him out of the road. It said that he had pushed Wilson's door shut, and that during a struggle Wilson's weapon became un-holstered. \"The weapon discharged during the struggle,\" the report said. Brown ran, Wilson gave chase, and Brown turned around and ran towards him. Wilson fired \"several times.\"\n\n\"As this is preliminary information it was not known in which order or how many time [sic] the officer fired his weapon during the confrontation,\" the report said.\n\n\"The deceased was cool to the touch,\" the medicolegal investigator reported upon first encountering Brown's body in the street. \"Rigor mortis was slightly felt in his extremities.\" The report added, \"The deceased [sic] mother was on the scene.\"\n\nThe emergence of the autopsy report deeply upset many supporters of the Brown family, with some suggesting that it was a thinly veiled attempt to publicly soften the blow of a non-indictment.\n\nIn the days and weeks that preceded the leaking of the autopsy report, more accounts of the shooting emerged. On the question of whether Brown charged \"full speed\" at Wilson - like some sort of drug-addled madman, as Josie claimed - witnesses repeatedly said that he did not. Some said he was at a stand still, some said he was walking calmly towards the officer, others said he was staggering, fatally wounded, in Wilson's direction.\n\nJames McKnight told The New York Times that Brown's hands were up as soon he turned around to face Wilson. \"I saw him stumble toward the officer, but not rush at him,\" McKnight said . \"The officer was about six or seven feet away from him.\"\n\nMichael T. Brady, 32, told reporters that he began watching the altercation between Brown and Wilson shortly after it started. \"It was something strange,\" Brady said . \"Something was not right. It was some kind of altercation. I can't say whether he was punching the officer or whatever. But something was going on in that window, and it didn't look right.\"\n\nBrady told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he did not hear the initial shot in the vehicle and that the \"tussle\" between Brown and Wilson lasted about ten seconds before Brown and his friend Johnson took off running. Brown, he said, was running down the middle of the street. Wilson stepped out of the car and \"immediately\" started shooting, Brady said, adding that Brown's back was to the officer (because he was inside at the time, Brady said he could not hear anything Wilson may or may not have been yelling). Brady himself then ran outside with his phone.\n\n\"By the time I get outside he's already turned around facing the officer,\" Brady said of Brown. Brady said that Brown was \"balled up\" with his arms clutching his abdomen. Brown appeared to be going down, Brady said, \"and the officer lets out about three or four shots at him.\"\n\n\"He took like one or two steps going towards the officer,\" Brady said. He flatly rejected claims that Brown was charging towards Wilson. \"No,\" Brady told CNN. \"Not at all.\"\n\nIn early September, the Post Dispatch revealed the existence of two more key witnesses in the Brown shooting; a pair of construction contractors who witnessed the killing from approximately 50 feet away. The men did not see how the altercation began, but looked up from their work when they heard a shot. One of the men detailed the ordeal in an interview with paper, saying that Brown had first approached them at approximately 11:00 a.m. and engaged his co-worker in a half-hour conversation in which Brown said he was \"feeling some bad vibes.\"\n\nAccording to the contractor, Brown talked about having a picture of Jesus on his wall and said,\"that the Lord Jesus Christ would help me through that as long as I didn't get all angry at what I was doing.\" A half-hour later, the contractor said, they heard the shot. The contractor said Brown was running and Wilson was following with his gun drawn about 10 to 15 feet behind the teen. He said the officer fired a shot while Brown's back was turned.\n\nThe contractor said Brown stumbled and turned, then said, \"OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.\" Brown and Wilson were about 10 feet apart, he said. With his hands up, \"[Brown]'s kind of walking back toward the cop,\" he said. The contractor said Wilson was backing up while firing and that after the third shot Brown's hands began to fall. The contractor told the paper that from his vantage point he could not tell whether the teen's movement was \"a stumble to the ground\" or a \"OK, I'm going to get you, you're already shooting me.\"\n\n\"I don't know if he was going after him or if he was falling down to die,\" the contractor said. \"It wasn't a bull rush.\"\n\nThe Post - Dispatch report also quoted Canfield resident Phillip Walker, 40, who said Brown was walking towards Wilson with his hands up. \"Not quickly,\" he said. \"He did not rush the officer.\" As the paper noted at the time, \"No witness has ever publicly claimed that Brown charged at Wilson.\"\n\nFour days after the Post - Dispatch story was published, CNN aired cellphone video of two contractors, presumably the same two who talked to the Post - Dispatch , reacting to the shooting. One of the men in the video, shown in a pink shirt, told CNN that he witnessed Brown \"staggering.\" The man said he heard one shot fired, then another 30 seconds later. He is seen in the video throwing his hands in the air, exclaiming, \"He had his fucking hands up.\" The contractor told CNN, \"The cop didn't say get on the ground. He just kept shooting.\" He added that he saw Brown's \"brains come out of his head.\" According to CNN, \"[a]n attorney for the man who filmed the video says it was recorded 40 seconds after the shooting.\" The second man in the video told the news network that he saw Brown running from a police vehicle, that he \"put his hands up\" and that \"the officer was chasing him.\"\n\nIn October, yet another witness spoke to the Post-Dispatch . The man, a Canfield resident who asked to remain anonymous but claimed to have watched the ordeal from start to finish, described testimony that he gave to the grand jury reviewing the Brown shooting. Unlike previous accounts, the man said that Wilson did not fire until Brown turned and faced him. Like Johnson's lawyer said, the eyewitness said Brown did not raise his hands high. As the paper described it, \"Brown never put his hands straight up, but held his elbows straight out from his torso, with palms turned up in a sort of gesture of disbelief.\" The witness said that despite commands to stop, Brown staggered towards Wilson. He added that the final shot was fired with Brown and Wilson 20 to 25 feet apart, contradicting Josie's claim that Wilson fired his last round with a charging Brown just feet away.\n\nThe witness also described an initial scuffle between Brown and Wilson through the window of the police vehicle, adding that he believed he saw Wilson's hat fly off. He said he heard a shot and that Brown went running with Wilson following behind yelling \"Stop!\" (this contradicts the account of one of the two construction workers, who said Wilson was firing without issuing commands). According to the witness, Brown obeyed Wilson's command to stop. The teen mumbled something the witness could not hear then took a step towards Wilson, the witness said.\n\n\"When he stepped foot on that street, the officer told him to stop again, and he fired three shots...When he (Brown) got hit, he staggered like, 'Oh,' and his body moved. Then he looked down...His hands were up like this (he gestures with arms out to the side and palms upward), and he was looking at the officer and was coming toward him trying to keep his feet and stand up. The officer took a few steps back and yelled, 'Stop,' again, and Michael was trying to stay on his feet...He was 20 to 25 feet from officer, and after he started staggering, he (Wilson) let off four more rounds. As he was firing those last rounds, Michael was on his way down. We were thinking, 'Oh my God, oh my God, brother, stop, stop.' He was already on his way down when he fired those last shots.\"\n\nEchoing the feelings of many Canfield residents, the witness told the paper, \"What transpired to us, in my eyesight, was murder. Down outright murder.\"\n\nPhoto: Tiffany Mitchell; Sid Hastings/AP; Tiffany Mitchell/KMOV-TV/AP; Jeff Roberson/AP\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Deconstructed Podcast: Stephon Clark's Fiancée Speaks Out on Police Shooting\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn her first national interview, Salena Manni, fiancée of police shooting victim Stephon Clark, urges action on police violence.\n\nOn the evening of March 18, Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old African-American man, was returning to his home in Sacramento, California, when the police mistook him for a vandalism suspect - and his cell phone for a gun. They fired 20 rounds, eight of which hit and killed him. On episode 3 of \"Deconstructed,\" Clark's fiancée Salena Manni - the mother of his two children - speaks out on Clark's death. In her first national interview, she calls on President Donald Trump to take action on police violence. \"We urge you, Mr. President,\" she says, \"to help us get justice for our family, and justice for all families that have lost any loved ones by police brutality.\" And she responds to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who last week called Clark's death a \"local matter.\" \"It's not a local matter,\" Manni tells Hasan. \"This is happening all over America. So it's bigger than that.\" And professor Ibram X. Kendi of American University joins Mehdi to discuss how America's history of racist ideas creates the law enforcement environment we see today.\n\nSalena Manni: I do believe that he was taken from us to bring change. This was all a part of God's plan, and we will get change.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMehdi Hasan: I'm Mehdi Hasan. Welcome to Deconstructed, a new podcast from The Intercept. I've been writing columns and op-eds, producing and presenting TV shows for nearly two decades now. But I'll tell you what - doing a podcast for the first time in my life is such a unique opportunity; it gives me such a unique platform. And it's so good to be with you all each week to chew the political fat, get past the media spin, deconstruct the headlines and make sure you hear from people who really need to be heard from.\n\nThis week, the week we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, this week I'll speak not just to a brilliant young author and academic who breaks down racism in the most eloquent, yet bluntest of terms, but also to the fiancée of the latest high-profile and fatal victim of two seemingly trigger-happy police officers: Stephon Clark.\n\nSM: And then, I get another phone call from his grandma saying, \"They murdered him, they murdered him and they killed him. They killed Little Poppa,\" and then she hung up.\n\nMH: one of the hardest interviews I've ever had to do and that conversation with Salena Manni on Deconstructed is coming up in full in a moment.\n\nIt's week three: Let's talk black lives in America, and why they still don't seem to matter.\n\nPresident William \"Bill\" Clinton: We've had all the turmoil in New York City over this Diallo case, and I don't want, as I said before, I don't pretend for a moment to second-guess the jury. I didn't sit there and listen to the evidence. But I know most people in America of all races believe that if it had been a young white man in a young, all-white neighborhood, it probably wouldn't have happened.\n\nMH: My first exposure, to my first memory of a story involving a U.S. police officer killing an innocent young black man, as a young British college student, was the gunning down of Amadou Diallo in New York in 1999. I remember watching a Michael Moore special on that case.\n\nAmadou Diallo was a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea in West Africa, who came to New York in 1996 and became a street vendor. While returning home one night in Harlem, he was mistaken by four New York Police Department officers for a rape suspect. And when he pulled out his wallet, they thought it was a gun. They fired 41 bullets at him - 41 bullets - 19 of which hit him and killed him. All four of those officers were charged with second-degree murder; all four of those officers were acquitted of second-degree murder. One of them was even later promoted.\n\nAnd I couldn't help but think of Amadou Diallo when I heard the horrific, tragic and recent story of Stephon Clark, which I want to talk about on today's show.\n\nNewscaster: When two Sacramento police officers confronted Stephon Clark in his grandparents' backyard, they fired 12 shots.\n\nMH: Stephon was shot and killed last month by two police officers from the Sacramento Police Department in California who were looking for a guy breaking car windows in his neighborhood. They saw Stephon in his grandmother's yard, mistook his iPhone for a gun, and fired 20 bullets at him - eight of which hit him and killed him.\n\nAmadou Diallo had a wallet; Stephon Clark had a cell phone. Amadou Diallo was 23; Stephon Clark was 22. He was engaged and the father to two small boys.\n\nImam Zaid Shakir: Today we are gathered to memorialize and subsequently burry Stephon Clark. But yesterday was Amadou Diallo, and Sean Bell, and Trayvon Martin, and Walter Scott, Gary King, Oscar Grant, Alan Blueford, Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Eric Garner. The community is rightfully pained, is rightfully angry, is rightfully frustrated, to borrow from the poet, because we build our coffins much too often, and we're tired of seeing our people die.\n\nMH: That was the Californian Imam Zaid Shakir speaking at a memorial for Stephon, who was Muslim, and reminding us that the black community is rightfully pained, rightfully angry, rightfully frustrated - not just about the constant killings, but the constant lies.\n\nAt first, the police in Sacramento said Stephon had a toolbar in his hand. He didn't. They said he was rushing towards them, and yet, a private autopsy commissioned by the family found eight of the twenty bullets hit Stephon, six of them hit him in the back. In the back!\n\nBenjamin Crump: The findings of his autopsy contradict many of the narratives that the Sacramento police put forward.\n\nMH: Now, I'm no ballistics expert, but how do you get shot in the back if you're rushing towards your shooter?\n\nThere's a big investigation, a big inquiry expected into all of this, but right now it looks like the police shot dead a man who was not just unarmed, but running away from them.\n\nAnd even if he was guilty of breaking car windows, and there's not a shred of evidence to suggest he was, that's not even a crime that deserves the death penalty. The reality is, as Bill Clinton said nearly two decades ago about Amadou Diallo, that Stephon Clark would probably be alive today were he a white guy, living in a nice white neighborhood. We all kind of know that. And it's so tragic, so frustrating that so little has changed in the nearly twenty years since Amadou Diallo was gunned down.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, the Clintons weren't great on race. Remember the whole super-predator stuff? But even Bill spoke out at the time about the racism involved in that shooting. And, yet today, you have a white nationalist president sitting in the Oval Office, who unlike Bill Clinton, unlike Barack Obama has nothing to say about racism or the innocent victims, the innocent black of victims of police violence, like Stephon Clark.\n\nListen to White House spinner-in-chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders, when she was asked about this story the other day.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Certainly a terrible incident. This is something that is a local matter, and that's something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities in this point in time.\n\nMH: Local matter? Local matter? Are you kidding me? This is a president who is obsessed with almost every murder that takes place in Chicago. How is that not a local matter? Who obsesses over every crime committed by an undocumented migrant in a sanctuary city. How is that not a local matter?\n\nIn fact, this is a president who not only stays conveniently silent when it comes to anti-black violence by the police, but actually endorses and encourages police brutality.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: I said, \"Please don't be too nice. Like, when you guys put somebody in the car, and you're protecting their head, you know? The way you put their hand - like, don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head?\" I said, \"You could take the hand away, OK?\" [Audience laughs and cheers.]\n\nMH: And this is a man, remember, who can't stand the idea of black people peacefully protesting the killing of other black people at the hands of the police.\n\nDJT: Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \"Get that son of a bitch off the field, right now! Out! He's fired. He's fired!\" [Audience cheers and applauds.]\n\nMH: But, of course, he doesn't like people protesting racism because Donald Trump has always believed that white people are the real victims of racism. I kid you not - this is him speaking nearly 30 years ago, back in 1999 on NBC:\n\nDJT: A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market. I've said on occasion, even about myself, if I was starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black because I really do believe they have an actual advantage today.\n\nMH: See, in this president's warped worldview, and in the warped worldview of so many of his followers and fans, it's white people - not black people - white people who are the oppressed and persecuted ones. That's partly why it's so hard to get millions of white Americans, especially, but not exclusively, conservative white Americans to take institutionalized racism, systemic discrimination, police brutality against black people seriously, to get them to make it a political and moral priority that needs resolving now. So how do we get them to do that? How do we get through to those people who have buried their heads in the sand, even as black parents bury their young kids in the ground?\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: In a moment, I'm going to talk to a real expert on race relations and racism in America, the acclaimed author and academic Ibram X. Kendi.\n\nBut before that discussion with him, I'm going to speak with Salena Manni, fiancée to the late Stephon Clark, and mother to their two boys: Aiden, age three, and Cairo, age just one.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: Salena Manni, thanks for joining me on Deconstructed. I am so, so sorry for your loss and what you've gone through. I can't imagine what you must be going through now. Can I just start by asking you to tell our listeners about Stephon, about him? What was he like?\n\nSM: He was really loving and caring. He always wanted to be around me, the kids he wanted, he just wanted to be around love. I mean, he would do anything for you. Like, you wouldn't even have to ask him to do anything for you, and he would just do it out of the kindness of his heart.\n\nMH: And you two were together, I think, five years, you were together?\n\nSM: About five years. Yes.\n\nMH: And you were going to get married?\n\nSM: Yes. Eventually.\n\nMH: And what's your memory of that night? Where were you when you heard that horrific news, when you were told what had happened to Stephon?\n\nSM: I was home in bed with my kids, and I got a phone call from his grandma, telling me that she heard gunshots in the back, in her backyard. And she was calling to make sure that me and the kids and Poppa were OK. And Poppa is Stephon.\n\nAnd I had told her that me and the kids were OK, and that Stephon wasn't with us that day. And then I get another phone call from his grandma about, maybe like ten, fifteen minutes later, saying, \"They murdered him, they murdered him and they killed him. They killed Little Poppa.\" And then she hung up.\n\nAnd then it kind of hit me a little bit, because he was answering and I didn't know where he was. I still didn't want to believe it, and then, finally, when I called his brother, he said, \"Yeah it was him.\" That he was standing in front of the scene. And then that's when it, like, really hit me. And I finally realized that, you know, he was gone.\n\nMH: And he had two young sons, you have two boys, Cairo and Aiden. You have to bring them up on your own, for now, without their dad?\n\nSM: Yeah. It's definitely hard when they ask for him every day, and they were so used to being around him every day, and now he's just gone. Like every day they're wondering, \"Where is my dad?\" You know? \"Where is my dad? Are we going to go see Daddy today?\" And I don't want it to hurt them in a way, you know? Without me being able to explain it to them and letting them understand, you know, because whatever's out on the media, too, is not who their dad is. I want to be able to explain to them who their dad really was, and that he actually loved them and was there for them, and that he actually wanted to be there in their lives. He wanted to be the best father he could be. So...\n\nMH: Did Stephon himself, as a young black man, you knew him for many years, did he ever talk about being distrustful of the police, being afraid of the police? Had you ever had those conversations with him?\n\nSM: Oh yeah, he's definitely - I've definitely had those conversations with him. He would be afraid for being a black man in America, because he wouldn't know, like, if he were to get stopped or anything, he wouldn't know what was going to happen to him. He was definitely afraid.\n\nMH: How do you think Sacramento Police Department have handled this whole issue? I mean they he said he had a toolbar in his hand; he didn't. They said he charged the officers, but the autopsy from his family that was commissioned from you guys seems to show he was shot in the back. What do you think the response of the Sacramento Police Department has been like?\n\nSM: Well, in my regards, I want to let them know, when they shoot someone, it affects more than the person that they kill. Here, me, my children, my family and Stephon's family, we're all suffering the shooting of an unarmed man. It's caused unrest within our family, unrest within the community. And we seek justice for my love. That's all we want.\n\nMH: Do you think the police lied to you and your family into the world in the aftermath of what happened?\n\nSM: I do.\n\nMH: And there's going to be an inquiry, an investigation. Do you have confidence that there will be justice done in your fiancé's case?\n\nSM: I do. I do believe that he was taken from us to bring change. This was all a part of God's plan, and we will get change.\n\nMH: You talk about change. There have been a lot of protests and vigils for several days now in Sacramento, I know you've attended a lot of them. What is the main purpose of those protests and vigils?\n\nSM: To get justice. To change the legal systems. To change all the laws that they have within the police department, sheriff's department. We just need change, you know? We need to make sure that innocent people are not getting killed for no reason.\n\nMH: The White House says this is a local matter. The White House was asked about Stephon's killing the other day in a press conference. And they said it's a local matter, it's not for the president to comment on. Do you wish the president of the United States had said something so far about this?\n\nSM: I do. I wish he would've, you know, made it bigger than, like he said, it was a local matter, because it's not a local matter. This is happening all over America. So it's bigger than that. And he should've, you know, said something - and he should have had - he should have been able to say something more than that, because it's not just happening here.\n\nIt is a national issue, and I want to let the president know, like, we urge you, Mr. President, to help us get justice for our family and justice for all families that have lost any loved ones by police brutality. There's, there's just so much more to it that he could be speaking about, and we ask for his help.\n\nMH: And just on Stephon: What do you most remember about him, about your fiancé? What was the most, your most cherished memory of him?\n\nSM: We were just always together as a family. We'd always do everything together as a family - whether we'd be home, just together, watching movies, eating dinner, playing the games - whatever we were doing. We were just always together as a family. And that's what he'd always wanted: He always wanted family. He always wanted love. And we wanted to make sure our kids had that love, as well.\n\nI grew up with both parents. He grew up with only his mother, so he wanted to make sure his kids had both the love that he never had, and I wanted to give my kids everything better than I had. So we made sure, we made sure our love was strong for our kids. Our bond was strong for our kids. We were, we were just happy as a whole. As long as we were together as a family, there was nothing that can break us. We were inseparable.\n\nMH: Salena, it's so sad to hear you talk about this. I can't imagine what you're going through, and I can only give you condolences from me and everyone listening. We're so sorry for your loss and we pray for Stephon, and for you guys.\n\nSM: Thank you, I really appreciate it.\n\nMH: Thank you so much.\n\nSM: We all really appreciate it.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: You know, you hear stories like that. You listen to people speaking about their pain in that way, and the injustice that's being done, and your heart breaks, and you get mad. You get angry. It doesn't matter what color or race or ethnicity you are. You can't deny the pain; you can't deny that unfairness, that injustice.\n\nAnd normally that would motivate a lot of us to take action, to not tolerate the situation we find ourselves in, in terms of police violence and police shootings. But the problem is that in America today there's so much misinformation, so many myths that are put out, that are used to deflect, to distract, to divert from the core injustice of anti-black violence, of seemingly never-ending police killings. And I want to deal with a couple of those myths.\n\nNumber one: You often hear people say, \"Well, this isn't a race issue. Yes, unarmed black men are killed by the police. But so are unarmed white men. It's not just black people being gunned down by the police. It's not a race issue.\"\n\nBut that's complete BS. The fact is that black Americans are much more likely to be shot and killed by the police than white Americans. That's just a fact, a statistical fact. In 2012, 31 percent of the people killed by the police were black, even though only 13 percent of the people in the U.S. are black. In fact, black drivers are more likely to be stopped, searched and arrested than white drivers. Black defendants are more likely to get a longer sentence for committing the same federal crime as white defendants. Black people are more likely to be sent to prison for a crime they didn't commit than white people. The law enforcement, the criminal justice systems in this country are riddled with racism from top to bottom.\n\nThe second argument - \"argument\" - that is put out there on the issue of Black Lives Matter and police brutality is that: \"Police killings of black men aren't the real issue, black-on-black killings are the real issue. That's how most black men lose their lives.\" In \"black-on-black killings.\n\nThe truth is that there's no such thing as a black-on-black killing. There isn't! It's a completely made-up term, because if there was such a thing as black-on-black killings, there would also be such a thing as white-on-white killings. After all, yes, according to FBI data, in 2016, 90 percent of black victims of homicide were killed by other black people. But you know what? Eighty-three-and-a-half percent of white victims of homicide in that same year were killed by other white people. But when was the last time you heard white-on-white killings being discussed on Fox News or on the op-ed pages of The Wall Street Journal? It's a distraction, black-on-black killings. It's a deflection from what is essentially state-sponsored violence against young black men. That is what these police shootings, these police killings are, and why they need to be so urgently tackled.\n\nI want to talk about some of these double standards, these challenges, in more detail, with someone I consider to be one of America's leading new voices on race relations, and specifically on anti-black racism, Ibram X. Kendi, who is a professor at the American University here in Washington, D.C., and author of \"Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America,\" which won the 2016 National Book Award for nonfiction, and according to one reviewer will \"forever change the way we think about race.\"\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: Ibram X. Kendi, thank you so much for joining me on Deconstructed. And we often hear this phrase that a lot of the police violence meted out towards black people in black communities is structural. Explain to our listeners what that actually means.\n\nIbram X. Kendi: Well, first and foremost, I think police have the power to get away with violence, because police officers are typically investigated by other police officers and they also are allowed to put forth a defense of: \"Well, I felt - I feared for my life.\" And so police regulations allow them to shoot to kill, whenever they fear for their lives. So they are allowed to continue to get away with it because of those structural policies.\n\nMH: How much do you think Americans as a whole need to come to terms with the history of racist ideas and people in this country? One of the figures you focus on in your book, \"Stamped from the Beginning,\" is Thomas Jefferson - Founding Father, president, slave-owner. His statue, his memorial isn't far from where I'm sitting right now.\n\nWhat do you think Americans need to know about Jefferson, for example, which would help them understand how to save black lives today?\n\nIXK: To me, knowing the history of Jefferson, it was not surprising that white supremacists who are pushing for what they call a \"white ethno-state\" marched most popularly in Charlottesville, which is, of course, the iconic home of Jefferson, and marched through the University of Virginia which was built by Jefferson.\n\nBecause Jefferson in the 19th century was the most prominent advocate of a white ethno-state. He was a pusher of what was known as colonization, in which Americans, particularly racial moderates, were imagining that the best way to solve the race problem was to get rid of black people.\n\nYou have people who worship Thomas Jefferson, and disavow white supremacists when they both advocated a white ethno-state, and then you have a president United States, who simultaneously, his policies are creating or seeking to maintain a white ethno-state, policies of mass incarcerating and mass deporting and mass killing.\n\nMH: We hear the phrase white supremacy bandied around a lot these days, and some white liberals, not just conservatives, but white liberals as well have gotten annoyed with it and say it should be reserved for outright racists, for the Ku Klux Klan, and not for the Republican Party or the police force. What do you say to them?\n\nIXK: I say to them: How do you define white supremacy? Because if white supremacy means that white people are supreme, then white people are supreme, or least their ideas, are supreme within the policing forces that are killing black and brown bodies with impunity. They, their bodies, are supreme in the U.S. Senate, their bodies have historically been supreme in the White House, in the governorships, on the Supreme Courts, in the halls of executive power and corporations, in the people determining curriculums.\n\nAnd so I would ask them: How do they define white supremacy if they're not defining it as  'white people are supreme'?\n\nMH: You wrote recently in The New York Times that, \"the denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism.\" And I completely agree with that. But what is the way you persuade people, especially white people, who feel uncomfortable about, you know, talking about white supremacy and talking about a history of racism, how do you get them to get past the denial? Is there a strategy? Is there a particular approach that you take in your conversations?\n\nIXK: Well, I think one of the things that white people do not realize, particularly white middle-income and working and impoverished white people do not realize, is that in many ways historically racist ideas and policies have actually not been in their self-interest. They've been led to believe that it's in their self-interest.\n\nYou know, we're taught about the ways in which black bodies have been mass incarcerated, you know, as a result of these tough-on-crime policies. But white people are not taught how those very same tough-on-crime politicians were steering money away from their public schools, their public universities, social programs that benefited their families, for incarceration and the military, which simultaneously led to these growing disparities between white middle-income and white upper-income people. And so we call this economic inequality, and people like Bernie Sanders have brought attention to this, but this is, of course, harming white people writ large.\n\nMH: You mention Senator Sanders. Right now, the left in America is having a big debate about whether it's race or class that's the real challenge going forward. It's something I touched on with Bernie Sanders in a recent interview on this podcast. Do you think the left in the U.S. has got that balance right in terms of the attention paid to race versus class?\n\nIXK: Well, I think we should pay attention to both, and I don't understand why it always has to be either/or scenarios. In truly having a fundamental understanding about class divides, you'll also have a fundamental understanding about racial divides. So I try not to divide them.\n\nMH: One of the things I was talking about earlier in the show is some of the myths and misinformation that's put out when it comes to the debate over racism, over police killings. You always hear this nonsense about black-on-black killings, which is a completely made-up concept. You have all this kind of nonstop propaganda all the time. When you write about this stuff, and talk about this stuff, and travel around the country lecturing on this stuff, what's the most frustrating thing you hear that really winds you up when you talk about this subject, that really can irritates you?\n\nIXK: Wow. It's - I think the concept of \"not racist,\" which is a category, even an identity that almost every racist American in history has actually wrapped themselves in. So I think Americans like to imagine that they're racist and \"not racist.\" And typically, the category of \"not racist\" emerges when somebody is charged with racism.\n\nMH: Oh, yeah.\n\nIXK: \"Oh, my friend, my colleague is not racist.\" But there is no such thing as a \"not racism,\" categorically. Either you believe in racial equality as an anti-racist, or you believe in racial hierarchy as a racist. There is no 'not-racism'. There's only two philosophical and historical categories, and that's racism and anti-racism.\n\nMH: That's a very fascinating point. Let me ask you this, before we finish: Are you an optimist or a pessimist when it comes to racism and race relations and overcoming bigotry in the United States of America? Right now, a lot of us are very pessimistic when we look out and see who's in the White House, what's going on across America, when you look at what happened to Stephon Clark in Sacramento. It's hard to be anything other than pessimistic.\n\nIXK: Well, I think it is easier to be pessimistic based on everything that we have witnessed. At the same time, I know, philosophically, that you have to believe change is possible in order to bring it about. I think the greatest activists and change agents in history have been philosophically optimistic. And it was that optimism that motivated them consistently, especially during difficult Trumpian moments, to imagine that there was a possibility, you know, of an anti-racist place or an anti-racist nation or world.\n\nAnd so I'm an optimist, not necessarily because I'm not aware of everything that's going on, but I'm an optimist because I believe in order to truly bring about change, in order to truly been an effective change agent, you have to believe change is possible.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: Deconstructed is a production of First Look Media and The Intercept and is distributed by Panoply.\n\nOur producer is Zach Young.

      "text": "Hillary Clinton Still Haunted by Discredited Rhetoric on \"Superpredators\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHillary Clinton is relying on support from black voters in South Carolina, but at a fundraiser in Charleston, she found herself confronted by a young black activist demanding an apology.\n\nHillary Clinton is relying on support from black voters to help her carry South Carolina in the Democratic primary on Saturday, but at a fundraiser in Charleston on Wednesday night, she found herself confronted by a young black activist demanding an apology.\n\nAs video of the protest shows, the activist, Ashley Williams , interrupted Clinton's remarks about criminal justice at the private event by unfurling a banner with the phrase \"we have to bring them to heel.\" Those words - language that has been taken as an offensive and racist characterization of young black teens as unruly animals - were used by the former first lady at a campaign rally for Bill Clinton in New Hampshire in January 1996.\n\nWilliams demanded that Clinton apologize for those words and for using racially charged language suggesting that the nation was threatened by a generation of young \"superpredators.\"\n\nAfter Clinton took note of the banner, Williams said, \"I'm not a superpredator, Hillary Clinton. Will you apologize to black people for mass incarceration?\"\n\nAs the small, mainly white crowd of donors hissed, and a man tried to get the activist to put her banner away, Clinton responded by referring to a speech she gave last April in which she deplored the killing of unarmed black men and boys by police officers and called for an \"end to the era of mass incarceration.\" Williams, however, pressed her demand for an apology, saying, \"You called black people predators.\"\n\nAs Williams was led away, Clinton claimed that this was the first time she had been asked to explain her 1996 comments, which have been widely shared online in recent months. \"You know what, nobody's ever asked me before, you're the first person that's ever asked me, and I'm happy to address it,\" she said.\n\nBut just seconds later, as the activist was bundled out the door, Clinton brushed off the exchange, saying, \"OK, back to the issues.\"\n\nVideo of the exchange, posted on a YouTube channel called #NotASuperpredator and featured on the Huffington Post , was viewed more than 100,000 times by Thursday afternoon, prompting the Clinton campaign to tell reporters that her words had been taken out of context, and referred not to at-risk, black teens, but to drug gangs exploiting kids.\n\nC-Span video of her speech on January 28, 1996, reveals that Clinton was indeed talking about the need to tackle gangs, but it is not hard to understand why activists like Williams might agree with Michelle Alexander, the author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness , who called her language \" racially coded rhetoric \" in a widely read article in The Nation .\n\nTouting the success of the 1994 crime bill signed into law by her husband, Clinton said in the speech that in addition to putting more police officers on the streets:\n\nWe also have to have an organized effort against gangs, just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids who are called superpredators. No conscience. No empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heel. And the president has asked the FBI to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere. In addition to that, he has appointed a new drug czar.\n\nIn those remarks, Clinton appeared to endorse the subsequently discredited theory that American cities were threatened by a swelling wave of violent crime from a new generation of young \"superpredators.\"\n\nThat theory, as a New York Times video report shows, was eventually described as wrongheaded and destructive even by the political scientist most associated with the term, John J. DiIulio Jr. - but not before it helped justify a wave of harsh sentencing guidelines for juveniles across the country.\n\nLooking back at the superpredator panic of the 1990s two years ago in the Times , Clyde Haberman explained that it was based on flawed demographic research:\n\nWhat happened with the superpredator jeremiads is that they proved to be nonsense. They were based on a notion that there would be hordes upon hordes of depraved teenagers resorting to unspeakable brutality, not tethered by conscience. No one in the mid-1990s promoted this theory with greater zeal, or with broader acceptance, than John J. DiIulio Jr., then a political scientist at Princeton. Chaos was upon us, Mr. DiIulio proclaimed back then in scholarly articles and television interviews. The demographics, he said, were inexorable. Politicians from both major parties, though more so on the right, picked up the cry. Many news organizations pounced on these sensational predictions and ran with them like a punt returner finding daylight.\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the apocalypse. Instead of exploding, violence by children sharply declined .\n\nOn Thursday, Clinton told Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post that, on reflection, she does now regret her choice of language. \"In that speech, I was talking about the impact violent crime and vicious drug cartels were having on communities across the country and the particular danger they posed to children and families,\" she said in a statement. \"Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today.\"\n\nAs our colleague Liliana Segura reported last year, the impact of the criminal justice legislation enacted during Bill Clinton's time in office is still being felt today by current and former juvenile inmates and their families.\n\nXavier McElrath-Bey, who grew up amid extreme poverty, abuse, and neglect, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison at the age of 13 for a gang-related murder on Chicago's South Side, told a conference in Dallas that children like him had been pathologized as intrinsically bad. \"We've come from a generation that they were saying were 'superpredators,'\" he said. \"They said that we were incorrigible, that we were beyond repair. They stated that we were godless, fatherless, heartless monsters. These were professors and researchers who fed the media the hype of an impending flood of juvenile crime that never actually occurred.\"\n\nLate Thursday, the activist who confronted Clinton posted a statement on Twitter rejecting the candidate's apology as insufficient.\n\nIn a video interview with USUncut , Williams told Nathan Wellman and Winnie Wong, a co-founder of People For Bernie, \"I wanted her to apologize to black people and other people of color who have been affected by mass incarceration in a very real material way. And I also wanted her to take responsibility for the ways in which she was complicit in those things.\"\n\nWilliams added that her doubts about Clinton were also motivated by \"inappropriate comments\" about President Obama \"being a black person running for President,\" during their battle for the 2008 Democratic nomination.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "After a Black Cop Was Convicted of Killing a White Woman, Minnesota Activists Say Focus Should Be Police Reform\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMohamed Noor's conviction marks the first guilty verdict for a fatal shooting by an on-duty cop in Minnesota in decades.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, outside the Hennepin County government building in downtown Minneapolis, a few dozen community activists gathered in the cold to process the rare and polarizing conviction of Mohamed Noor, a Somali American and former police officer. A day earlier, a Hennepin County jury found 33-year-old Noor guilty of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called the police to report a possible sexual assault in her neighborhood in the summer of 2017. Noor shot and killed her, and at trial, he claimed self-defense.\n\nThe case has galvanized local activists, some of whom embraced the verdict and others who say that, in a criminal justice system where cops are rarely held accountable for on-duty killings, Noor was unfairly targeted because he is a black man who killed a white woman.\n\nAt the rally, Leslie Redmond, the president of the Minneapolis branch of the NAACP, said the case was a \"scapegoat\" against a man of color to fool residents into thinking \"the police force is in tact.\" Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and local racial justice leader, said Noor's conviction reveals how the court system treats white people differently compared to everyone else.\n\nFamily members of other police shooting victims gave speeches, including Kimberly Handy-Jones, a mother who lost her 29-year-old son to St. Paul police in 2017, and Don Amorosi who lost his 16-year-old son to Carver County deputies last summer. Activists held up signs for other local victims of police shootings, like Tycel Nelson , a 17-year-old shot and killed in Minneapolis in 1990, and Philip Quinn, a 30-year-old shot and killed by a St. Paul police officer in 2015.\n\nNoor's conviction marks the first guilty verdict for a fatal shooting by an on-duty cop in Minnesota in decades - something that brings both relief to advocates who seek greater accountability for police shootings but also anguish, as residents wrestle with the racial realities of the conviction. Meanwhile, in recent police killings of unarmed black men in the Twin Cities, white cops involved were either not charged at all or acquitted of charges . According to data compiled by the Star Tribune , Noor's case marks the first conviction out of 179 police-involved deaths in Minnesota since 2000.\n\nA few dozen community activists gathered outside the Hennepin County government building in Minneapolis, Minn., to process the conviction of Mohamed Noor, on May 1, 2019.\n\n\"There would have been no trial if Noor's victim was African American or Native American, and I think the vast majority of people in our movement believe that,\" said Jess Sundin, an activist with the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice4Jamar ; the group is named after 24-year-old Jamar Clark, a black man shot to death by Minneapolis police in 2015 and whose killers faced no criminal charges . \"There also would have also been no conviction if it was a white police officer.\"\n\nThe July 2017 killing led to a number of shuffles within the police department. Following Damond's death, then-Minneapolis mayor Betsy Hodges requested the city's police chief step down, leading to the appointment of Medaria Arradondo, the city's first African American police chief. Noor was fired shortly after being charged in March 2018.\n\nIn the wake of the verdict, a broad swath of activists are seeking to build on their multi-year efforts to reform the police and use Damond's case as a way to highlight racial disparities in the criminal justice system. There has been global interest in the case because Damond was Australian, and the activists are leveraging that attention to make their concerns and demands known to a wider audience.\n\nA group of Damond's neighbors, who started organizing under the banner of Justice4Justine shortly after her death, planned the rally with the backing of local groups, including the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice4Jamar, Black Lives Matter Minnesota, and Communities United Against Police Brutality.\n\nTodd Schuman, an activist with Justice4Justine, told The Intercept they planned the rally because \"we're not afraid to say that in the dozens of other examples where white officers shot black victims, there wasn't anything close to the level of investigative rigor, anywhere close to the level of media coverage, or a result in a conviction.\" Schuman emphasized that his group is \"not afraid to name that disparity, and we want to create a space where families of police violence victims who did not receive justice have their opportunity to share their perspective.\"\n\nNoor's guilty verdict has had reverberations throughout Minnesota, galvanizing not only the activists who held the Wednesday rally, but also prompting reactions from elected officials and the local Somali community.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, whose legislative district includes Minneapolis, released a statement on Wednesday morning calling Noor's guilty verdict \"an important step towards justice and a victory for all who oppose police brutality.\" Omar also said it cannot be lost that Noor's verdict comes in the wake of other acquittals for officers who took the lives of people of color, and called for \"the same level of accountability and justice\" for all officer-involved killings. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement that the city must come together, and that Minneapolis stands with both the Somali community and the local police. \"Wherever a person's beliefs may part ways with today's decision, we should find comfort in knowing that not one person in Minneapolis hoped for what transpired that July night,\" he said.\n\nOther members of the local Somali community said Noor was wrongfully convicted. Community leader Omar Jamal told local news outlet WCCO that many Somali people had called him to say they feel Noor was innocent. Noor's cousin, Goth Ali, told the Star Tribune that the decision was \"shocking\" and that he thought Noor \"didn't get a fair trial.\"\n\nThe Somali American Police Association, or SAPA, released a statement saying it \"believes the institutional prejudices against people of color, including officers of color, have heavily influenced the verdict of this case.\" The \"aggressive manner\" taken by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, the group said, \"reveals that there were other motives at play other than serving justice.\" SAPA, which expressed condolences to Damond's family, said it fears the \"differential treatment\" given to minority officers will \"have a devastating effect on police morale and make the recruitment of minority officers all the more difficult.\"\n\nThe incident is reminiscent in some respects to the 2014 killing of 28-year-old Akai Gurley, a black man shot by a Chinese American police officer while in a Brooklyn public housing complex. Gurley's death came just four months after Eric Garner, another black New Yorker, was killed after being placed in a chokehold by a white police officer. In Gurley's case, NYPD cop Peter Liang was indicted in 2015, a rarity for police-involved killings, and in 2016, a jury found him guilty of manslaughter - another extremely rare outcome. The charges sparked some of the largest Asian American protests in decades, as Liang's supporters accused prosecutors of scapegoating Liang due to his race. (Two months after Liang's conviction, a judge reduced the charges , sentencing him to just five years of probation and 800 hours of community service.)\n\nReached for comment, Minneapolis Police Union President Lt. Bob Kroll said his union \"respects the legal process and the findings of the jury.\" He said this has been an \"extremely unfortunate situation for all involved\" and that his union sends condolences to Ruszczyk's family, and that \"our thoughts are with former Officer Noor.\" At the rally on Wednesday evening, activists said Kroll threw Noor under the bus by firing him and only nominally speaking up in support of him; they argued the union would have more vigorously defended a white officer. Justice4Justine criticized the police union's statement on the verdict as \"empty and vapid.\"\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department did not return request for comment, but Arradondo, the chief of police, released a statement on Tuesday to say he \"respect[s] the verdict rendered\" and will \"ensure that the MPD learns from this case and we will be in spaces to listen, learn and do all we can to help our communities in healing.\" Through collaboration and partnerships, he added, \"I am hopeful that we will strengthen our community wellness and safety.\"\n\nFormer police officer Mohamed Noor is surrounded by news media as he exits the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, Minn., on April 26, 2019. Photo: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images When Justice4Justine first formed, neighbors focused primarily on supporting Justine's grieving fiancé, Don Damond, and the Ruszczyk family, who are based in Australia. Over time, according to Schuman, the group began shifting their energies toward police reform and police violence more broadly.\n\nFormer police officer Mohamed Noor is surrounded by news media as he exits the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, Minn., on April 26, 2019.\n\n\"We have a lot of mixed feelings,\" Schuman said of the verdict. \"We said from almost day one that for us, this is more than just one trial and one verdict, and while we wanted a conviction, in this case, the real justice that we're looking for is a comprehensive reform of the police. Our commitment is to a justice system where what Justine got is what everyone gets.\"\n\nOne of the concrete policy changes racial justice organizations in the Twin Cities have pushed for is ending so-called \"warrior-style\" police trainings, which activists describe as a fear-based approach that encourages cops to believe they are always under threat. Last May, about four dozen people staged a protest outside the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to call for the mall to stop sponsoring the trainings and for local police departments to stop using them.\n\nLast month, in a victory for activists, Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, announced that the city's police officers will no longer be allowed to use the warrior-style training. \"Chief Medaria Arradondo's police department rests on trust, accountability, and professional service,\" the mayor said in his recent State of the City address. \"Whereas fear-based, warrior-style trainings like 'killology' are in direct conflict with everything that our chief and I stand for in our police department. Fear-based trainings violate the values at the very heart of community policing.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSundin of the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice4Jamar told The Intercept that her group remains focused on prosecution for Jamar's killers, hoping to see the case reopened. Sundin said her group is also focused on getting community control over the police through an elected board of community representatives. \"Our experience has been that the mayor and the city council-both those presently in office and those before-have been unwilling to fire abusive police officers, and we want that to change,\" she said. \"We think the community has every right to decide who policies our communities and how.\" Community control would go beyond just disciplining officers when something goes wrong, Sundin explained, and would also include \"writing the rule book\" for police officers and negotiating contracts.\n\nWhen asked to reflect on how things have evolved since 2015, Sundin said she thinks there is a greater recognition of police brutality among residents of the Twin Cities and a deeper understanding from the media to not \"parrot the police's story without looking into it first.\"\n\nSundin also says the Minneapolis police chief being asked to resign following Damond's death marked a significant development, because a police chief \"had never before been held accountable for the police killings that happen under their watch.\" Arradondo replaced Janeé Harteau, who stepped down in July 2017.\n\nThe last difference, Sundin said, is that she thinks there's a much greater awareness surrounding the \"shoddy investigation work\" conducted by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a state agency that helps law enforcement agencies prevent and solve crimes. In December 2017, a video surfaced of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman telling a group of union members that the BCA was doing a poor job of collecting evidence that could lead to charges against Noor. While Freeman later apologized for his remarks and said he didn't know he was being recorded, he also extended the time for the BCA investigation, something Sundin says has never happened before.\n\n\"Every family we've ever talked to has had the experience of the BCA botching investigations, but in Justine's case, it came to light because Mr. Freeman was caught on tape criticizing the BCA for its bad investigatory work,\" Sundin said. During the trial, which was held in April, prosecutors also criticized the BCA for its initial handling of the investigation, citing things like waiting three days to interview the only witness and refusing to investigate the source of the screaming that prompted Damond to call the police in the first place. On Wednesday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that his office was looking into the allegations surrounding the BCA's investigation.\n\nChuck Laszewski, a spokesperson for Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, told The Intercept his office is not taking individual interviews on the case until Noor is sentenced on June 7. At a press conference after the trial, though, when Freeman was asked about the allegations that he worked harder to charge a black officer who killed a white woman, Freeman denied that he would have behaved differently in the case of a black person shot by a white cop. \"Race has never been a factor in making any decision and never will be,\" Freeman said. \"We have charged white cops with crimes, and we will again.\"\n\nWAIT!

The 43-year-old African American man had been approached by New York City police officers on suspicion that he'd been selling loose cigarettes. After a few words were exchanged, the officers attempted an arrest. When Garner pulled away, the officers tackled him. One white officer put the father of six in a chokehold. As he lay face down on the ground under a pile of grown men, Garner pleaded for air. \"I can't breathe,\" he warned a total of 11 times before losing consciousness.\n\nAn hour later, he was dead. The medical examiner ruled it a homicide and the autopsy implicated the police. When a video of the incident hit social media, it set off a firestorm. The killing became a watershed moment in the fight for racial justice and Garner's final words a rallying cry. The impact was felt all across the country, including in the small Indiana city of South Bend, where 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg was serving his first term as mayor. The moment would test the young politician and leave some in his community feeling as though he'd come up short.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nToday, even after his rise in the polls in some early primary states , Buttigieg boasts negligible support among black Democrats, a key demographic in the race for the Democratic nomination. At the same time, his presidential campaign has put his record in South Bend - particularly on race relations - under a microscope. His response to the reverberations of the Garner killing in South Bend, where he tried to chart a middle ground between calls for racial justice and denial of the problem, is another example of what critics say is his failure to understand - and tackle - systemic racism. Buttigieg's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOn December 13, 2014, just five months after Garner's death, during its televised warmup for its game against Michigan, the Notre Dame women's basketball team wore black T-shirts with the words \"I Can't Breathe\" emblazoned across the front in big white letters.\n\nThe ensuing, predictable controversy made it into the national news cycle . Following the game, Jason Barthel, a white police officer from the city of Mishawaka, began selling slogan tees of his own from his store, South Bend Uniform, which frequently did business with the city of South Bend, including a sale for $800 days before the basketball game. The shirts prominently featured a police badge over a thin blue line with the words \"Breathe Easy\" across the top and \"Don't Break the Law\" on the bottom.\n\nThe shirts sparked outrage within the community and on social media. In a post on its Facebook page, South Bend Uniform tried to defuse some of the anger, explaining that \"Breathe Easy\" was actually \"referring to knowing the police are there for you.\"\n\n\"We are all one people and this is by no means is a slam on Eric Garner or his family, God rest his soul,\" the post read. \"Lets [sic] all band together as AMERICANS regardless of our feelings and know we can and will be better!\"\n\nBarthel, meanwhile, told the media that he had wanted to inject the police perspective into the conversation that was sparked by the Notre Dame women's team.\n\n\"We're here to protect the public, and we want you to breathe easy knowing that the police are here to be with you and for you and protect you,\" he told CBS affiliate WSBT22.\n\nRelated Pete Buttigieg Pledged to Make Diversity a Priority, but His Mayoral Leadership Is Mostly White\n\nIn other interviews, however, he was more explicit about the shirt's meaning and implications.\n\n\"When you break the law, unfortunately, there's going to be consequences, and some of them aren't going to be pretty,\" Barthel explained to the South Bend Tribune. \"Unfortunately, that's the reality.\"\n\nThree members of South Bend's city council - including the body's only two serving African American men - issued a statement with the president of the South Bend branch of the NAACP. The release condemned the shirts and requested that local vendors discontinue sales. It also had an ask for Buttigieg.\n\n\"In the past, the City of South Bend has done business with one of these local vendors,\" it read, referring to South Bend Uniform. \"It is our hope that Mayor Buttigieg and Mayor Wood of Mishawaka will join us in unifying our communities and not support this dangerous message.\"\n\nThe first-term mayor, however, did not weigh in immediately, allowing the controversy to grow. When he did speak out during a local news interview, it was not the response the statement's writers had hoped for.\n\nButtigieg asserted that the two sides of the controversy were really not that divided after all. \"They're being portrayed like they're on two different sides, but they're not even talking about the same thing,\" he explained. \"We're talking about two different things. And one of those is the way that race is playing a role in our criminal justice system. And the other is about the safety of police officers who go out there every day and risk their lives. And I fear that we're being led down this path that you have to choose between being pro-minority/pro-equal rights and pro-police.\"\n\nThe mayor's remarks on the controversy did not reassure his constituents who had wanted to see Buttigieg distance himself from Barthel's message.\n\n\"He refused to touch it,\" said councilmember-elect Henry Davis Jr., who was one of the drafters of the 2014 statement and launched an unsuccessful primary challenge against the mayor the following year . \"And when he touched it, he agreed with both sides.\" His 2015 run for mayor, he said, was partly motivated by Buttigieg's reaction to the shirts.\n\n\"I just really thought that he was very insensitive,\" he continued. \"I was looking for somebody to have a heart. We knew that the guy had just died from being choked to death. It was on video and it was clear on what happened with the police.\"\n\nDavis, who was re-elected to the city council this year, noted that the incident is a part of the mayor's larger, problematic record on issues affecting the black community. He pointed out that during Buttigieg's tenure, two unarmed black men have died at the hands of law enforcement.\n\n\"That's too much,\" he said.\n\nDemonstrators protest the shooting death of Eric Logan outside of the South Bend police station following his funeral on June 29, 2019, in South Bend, Ind.\n\nIndeed, in 2012, shortly after Buttigieg entered office, Michael Deshawn Anderson died in police custody , prompting a wrongful death lawsuit, which Anderson's family eventually dropped. In June of this year, 54-year-old Eric Logan was fatally shot by white officer Sgt. Ryan O'Neill, whose body camera was turned off at the time and who had an alleged history of making racist comments. The killing received national attention this summer in light of Buttigieg's presidential run and even prompted the mayor to cancel campaign events to return home for a town hall where he was confronted by an outraged community.\n\nHe's also come under scrutiny for his firing of South Bend's first black police chief after it was revealed that he had improperly taped senior white officers making racist statements about him and other black officers. Buttigieg has since admitted that firing the police chief, Darryl Boykins, was a mistake, but he's thus far refused to release the tapes. And while Boykins was fired, the white officers who were on the tapes faced no disciplinary action.\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail, the mayor's campaign appeared to chalk up Buttigieg's low levels of support among black voters to homophobia within the black community. The rollout of his Frederick Douglass Plan for Black America, meant to tackle systemic racism, was equally problematic, as the campaign claimed to have endorsements from 400 black South Carolinians, but subsequent investigation by The Intercept revealed that nearly half of the names were of white people. Moreover, some of the claimed endorsers had not actually signed on.\n\nCity Councilmember Oliver Davis, who also signed the 2014 statement, publicly rebuked Buttigieg late last month when he endorsed Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Speaking about the young mayor's difficulty reaching black voters, Davis told Politico , \"For us, this has been a consistent issue that has not gone away.\"\n\nIn his 2015 \"State of the City\" address , even as Buttigieg attempted to assuage concerns about the race-related controversies plaguing his administration, he used the phrase \"all lives matter,\" widely understood as a rebuke of the Black Lives Matter movement. The blunder resulted in fierce pushback from progressives when the speech resurfaced earlier this year. Buttigieg said he stopped using the phrase after he understood its implications.\n\nStories like these have not helped Buttigieg win over black voters. In the aftermath of the Logan shooting, an exasperated Buttigieg was caught on tape telling a black woman who'd asked how he expected black folks to support him, \"I'm not asking for your vote.\"\n\n\"You ain't getting it either,\" the woman responded.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Bonus Intercepted Podcast: The Laundering of American Empire\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn an extended Intercepted interview, NYU professor Nikhil Singh challenges us all to examine both the forest and the trees of American Empire.\n\nThe Trump presidency is itself a provocation. Trump is a billionaire, a reality TV star, a congenital liar who is seemingly addicted to a social media app which he uses to live-tweet his responses to a morning television show. The public is often bombarded with the phenomenon of his inner thoughts being pushed to mobile devices, not only by Twitter, but by pretty much every news outlet on the planet. And with good reason. He controls an arsenal of nuclear weapons, authorizes covert action, and has vast surveillance capacities at his fingertips. Trump also brought with him to Washington a team of radical ideologues and outsiders - people like Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and Sebastian Gorka. His attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has a long history of racism, including - according to his former associates - using the N-word and \"joking\" about joining the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nTrump has given encouragement to white supremacists and neo-Nazis, at times through his public statements and, at others, by what he doesn't say. And Trump is the master of the dog whistle. See, for example, Trump saying there are good people on both sides in the aftermath of the horrible white supremacist violence in Charlotte. Or how Trump and his acolytes constantly talk about violence in Chicago as a substitute for the racist perspective they only want thinly veiled. He calls black athletes \"sons of bitches,\" says the mass shooter in Las Vegas was \"probably smart\" and constantly portrays undocumented immigrants as a collective group of gang members, rapists, and murderers.\n\nThere is no doubt that the way Trump talks and tweets, the people he has chosen to surround himself with, and the policies he has announced or implemented are all evidence that this is a dangerous administration. But how dangerous relative to past U.S. presidents? If you talk to many Democrats on Capitol Hill, Trump is the most dangerous president in U.S. history. He has also given rise to a new alliance of discredited, hawkish neocons and MSNBC hosts and analysts. Former directors of the CIA, NSA, and DNI have all clamored to condemn him and assure the public that these heroic spy agencies are protecting the country from the madman inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nBut is he the most dangerous president ever? Is he really so outside the norm of the policies of his predecessors? The short answer, when it comes to substance and policy, is: not yet. Harry Truman dropped not one, but two nuclear bombs. Multiple presidents continued the war on Vietnam, killing tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers and more than a million Vietnamese. Have we forgotten the secret bombings of Cambodia and Laos, the CIA Phoenix Program, and the widespread use of Agent Orange? The dirty wars in Central America? The global assassination operations?\n\nGeorge W. Bush and Dick Cheney implemented a global torture network, began shipping people snatched from across the globe to Guantánamo prison, invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, and conducted mass surveillance operations against Americans. The list of horrible presidents who caused unimaginable death and destruction across the globe is vast. None of this absolves Trump one bit. But it is important to keep perspective rooted in fact and history.\n\nThere is a particular risk in erasing the line between horrible things Trump does with horrible things the U.S. has done for a long time and acting like it is all Trump. It's a complicated conversation, but it is one we should have. It means exploring the roots of white supremacy in the U.S., the way American wars are constantly put through a laundering process to make them seem noble and brave, the way \"real American\" has been defined and continues to be defined in our society. For eight years, we had the first black president in U.S. history and now we have a reality TV host who spends a great deal of time tweeting and watching TV. So what is unique to Trump and what is embedded in the politics of empire in the U.S.?\n\nProfessor Nikhil Pal Singh has spent years studying trends in U.S. policies throughout history, domestically and internationally. He is professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History at New York University. His latest book is \"Race and America's Long War.\" He is unafraid to take on the golden calves of \"American exceptionalism\" and challenges us all to examine both the forest and the trees of American Empire. We aired an excerpt of our interview with professor Singh on the latest episode of Intercepted. What follows is the entire interview and transcript.\n\nJeremy Scahill: Professor Nikhil Singh, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nNikhil Singh: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: I want to start off by talking about one of the big themes in your latest book, the link between war-making and what you call race-making. Explain that.\n\nNS: You know, I start the book with an epigraph from one of my favorite thinkers, who's not that well known, a civil rights activist named Jack O'Dell. He said that, \"the great through lines of American history run from the slave plantation to the ghetto, and the frontier to the Pentagon.\" So, he's really thinking about frontier war-making as a kind of formative national experience and then an internal security project that's focused on a kind of anti-insurrectionary project aimed at slave revolts, essentially, but against a population that is seen as potentially threatening, that's internal to the Republic.\n\nSo, both of those are projects that are defined in terms of state violence and war-making, that are fundamentally about alien populations: one, on the border, one in the interior. And so, thinking of those as through lines, thinking of those as kind of origin stories for the formation of the United States that have a kind of a longue durée, it's something that I'm interested in and I'm kind of tracing in various ways throughout the book.\n\nJS: What do you mean by the phrase race-making?\n\nNS: Race-making, I mean the creation of populations, groups whose alienage or whose difference becomes understood as constitutive of a relationship between them and another group. Right?\n\nSo, by calling it race-making, I'm trying to highlight the fabrication of racial difference, to not see it as something that is somehow inherent out there in the world, but something that has to be produced by constituting divisions among people, often people who actually live together in the same social space. It's something that happens through the passage of laws, it happens through the restriction of movement, it happens through the allocation of resources, but in a really fundamental way, it happens through the distributions of violence. And that's really what I'm arguing in the book.\n\nJS: There's a sentence or two that I want to read from the book and ask you to expand on it. You write: \"The commonsense view that overt, racially targeted, state-sanctioned violence is now unacceptable and a social problem leads to assessments that deem such violence, for example police shootings of unarmed black men and women, as arising from justified fear, accident or individual error, rather than a structured and structuring public mechanism and investment.\"\n\nNS: So commenting on that, I'm thinking about how we're addressing a situation where we now have an increasing consciousness partly due to movements around Black Lives Matter, that there is a widespread phenomenon of police killing of civilians, often unarmed civilians and that it is disproportionately African-Americans who are the victims of this violence. Although not just African-Americans obviously, and there's, if you really look at numbers for Native American populations, you find those are disproportionate as well. So, you can see, breaking down police killings across racial lines, there are all of these disproportions.\n\nBut the overall numbers are also staggering, for an industrial democracy, let's say.\n\nSo, in the United States, now, though - this is a little tough to parse because of Trump - but we tend to operate within an understanding of publicly sanctioned racism as something that's been receding. That it's normatively unacceptable.\n\nJS: We had a black president.\n\nNS: We had a black president. We believe in inclusion. We believe in tolerance. And above all, we believe that our justice system operates fairly, which obviously extends to the police.\n\nJS: Look, there's so many black and Latino Chicago police officers! That's, that's the response from the police unions in Chicago to these very questions.\n\nNS: You've also had the diversification of these institutions, on, along racial lines, exactly.\n\nSo, how do you square these two stories? How do you square the excessive force and violence of the police, on aggregate, the racial disproportionality of that story, with the kind of public story that wants to tell us that we are a constantly improving society organized around the rule of law, justice and inclusion?\n\nYou square that story by essentially saying that these are events that happened in error, they happened by accident, they happen because a policeman was afraid, justifiably so. And that's when the narrative starts to creep into something else and you start to see how this sort of demonology of the black criminal or the dangerous subject kind of comes into the defense or the rationalization, right?\n\nSo that's where I think what gets rationalized away as something that has no real systemic reason, right? Has no structural reason, sort of begins to be made visible is something that actually is structured. Right? It is structured into our understanding of criminality, it is - of race, that is structured into our understanding or structures our understanding of the criminal, of the threatening, of the other in a way that is part and parcel of why there is this level of violence.\n\nJS: Hasn't that notion that you're describing, of fear as a justification, hasn't that always been used? I mean, if you look at so many of the lynchings that occurred in the United States and killing of young black men through means other than lynching them, it's - they were whistling at a white woman or we're sure that they were probably going to try to rape the white woman. I mean it's almost like, what I'm reading is that it's kind of a more sophisticated deployment of the same justification for murdering people.\n\nNS: Yeah. I think American violence is almost always understood in defensive terms. Maybe, at some level, it's understood in retributive terms, that it's a sort of a justifiable punishment. But it's understood as having a rationale and logic that is, that we can explain to ourselves in a way that amplifies our sense of our virtue.\n\nJS: What do you make of the, now it's been going on for a while but it seems to be coming to somewhat of a head, the discussion about gay men and women serving in the United States military and the question of whether the military is going to allow for government funded gender reassignment surgery? What's your view of that, because I sort of look at it and I think: Well is it a good thing that there's this idea that we have a rainbow-colored military that's going to be slaughtering people across the world?\n\nNS: Yeah, it's something I think about a lot and it's something I think about a lot in the book which is that the military and the national security state, especially since, say, World War II, has been this kind of engine of inclusion. It has been at the forefront. I mean it was at the forefront of racial integration - of course, under social pressure, it didn't just happen automatically, and now we see the extension of that into questions around women in combat or gays and lesbians or trans people in the military, and the various ways the military is going to continue to be or not, because it's still contested, an agent of diversification.\n\nAnd this is a tricky thing for us to work through because now that story of diversification and inclusion is enlisted in the project of empire. The project of empire clearly once had a very naked, kind of racist face. You know, it was about the white man's burden, it was about benighted peoples, it was about, you know, the inferior lesser breeds and so forth in the kind of language of the say, the British Empire, or the American Empire before World War II.\n\nBut after World War II, you really see how this notion of a kind of racially inclusive or multicultural imperial machine begins to develop.\n\nAnd I'll never forget that moment, and I write about it in the book, right before the Iraq War, where the liberal Canadian politician and historian Michael Ignatieff said the reason the United States Empire is justified, if we even want to call it an Empire, because it is not built on conquest and the white man's burden. And then you have these moments where, where rotting out the kind of multicultural face of the American military becomes a kind of confirmation.\n\nAnd I'll never forget this moment, early in the Iraq War, watching a Frontline episode. It was almost like one of those episodes from an American war movie where you see the kind of multicultural platoon out on patrol, it's like a Latino guy, an African-American guy, a white guy, and there are some Iraqis in handcuffs by the side of the road. They had stolen some milk or something. And then a car, and the car was the, the car was their means, their livelihood. I think they were basically delivery people, or taxi drivers.\n\nAnd these three guys were interrogating, and then, all of a sudden, they say, \"Well, because you did this, we're going to have to exact a kind of punishment.\" And they basically take their armored vehicle and crush these guys' car. Right?\n\nAnd it's this kind of moment of sort of, they don't kill them, but they steal their livelihood, they enact collective punishment, all in the image of their own righteousness.\n\nAnd it's such, it's so clearly this moment of horror for a viewer like me, where these guys in their own country, their country is under occupation, they're trying to eke out a living, and here they are like, facing retribution from this military machine with a multicultural face.\n\nAnd it has really kind of become an alibi, right? It's become an alibi for the empire, which still operates in its other face, right, with the notion that it is policing and disciplining an inferior people. Right?\n\nSo even if the multicultural and inclusive face has sort of emerged as a kind of form of justification or a legitimation for the American military, there is still always this other side that constructs the enemy as somehow benighted, inferior, congenitally sort of constituted as a threatening population. And that is part of the underside, the history of race-making, to go back to the earlier point, I want to foreground as a kind of insistent part of the rationale and logic of how the United States fights in the world.\n\nJS: One of the themes that seems to kind of run through your book is this notion that the U.S. is an empire, and you, sort of, reluctantly agree to use that term in the book. But the way that you talk about the language that's used in official American history to talk about war and American wars, I think it would be interesting to kind of give some examples of how various U.S. wars have been described and talked about and what is drilled into the heads of kids in this country when it comes to war.\n\nNS: It's a funny, again, it's another one of these funny paradoxes, which is to say that the language of war is ubiquitous, right? We've had wars on drugs, wars on poverty, wars on crime, a Cold War that lasted for 40 years, a War on Terror that now we're told is going to last for another 40 years. So, the language of war is ubiquitous.\n\nBut on the other hand, the United States hasn't declared a war anywhere in the world, really, formally, since World War II. So, there have been police actions, there have been various kinds of military authorizations.\n\nJS: Global contingency operations was Obama's favorite term.\n\nNS: Right. Exactly. Yeah. So, these sort of euphemisms for something that is not war, even though the popular discourse is all about war.\n\nAnd then sort of think about the kind of earlier history, a continuous history of fighting Indian wars that were not understood or recognized as wars, they were really, again, seen as contingency operations, they were seen as the operations of kind of quasi-authorized settlers. You know, they were clearing operations, they were really kind of an ongoing counterinsurgency project.\n\nJS: Well, and one of the most murderous ethnic cleansing campaigns, to use a term that the Clinton, people really loved to deploy, that is what happened here. That is what happened here.\n\nNS: Right. That is what happened here.\n\nJS: People from elsewhere got off their boats, onto the shores and almost instantly started a mass extermination, ethnic-cleansing campaign of anyone that wasn't a European, \"settler.\"\n\nNS: Exactly, exactly. And then the context of at least initially having to confront indigenous people as a real counterforce, having temporary agreements that were then constantly broken. And once the balance of forces shifted, any acts of violence by Indians in defense of their land or defense of their kind of customary rights was increasingly described as crime. Right? So, you have the kind of translation of sort of the language of co-equal combatants who have certain kinds of rights into a kind of asymmetrical language in which one party has the right of war and the other party is essentially seen as the party of a sort of asocial violence that needs to be disciplined, exterminated, sequestered, what have you.\n\nAnd so, there's a reason why that history becomes so prominent again in the War on Terror because it's almost the same kind of language. And I remember, early in the war, there was this whole debate about the sort of the civilized thing to do was to describe al Qaeda as a criminal operation, as opposed to think of this in the language of war.\n\nBut in fact, all parties on the U.S. side agreed what needed to be done. You know? In some ways, this was a - this semantic distinction between whether they're enemy combatants or whether they're criminals doesn't really matter, because both kinds of languages sort of deny them any kind of standing as, as actual parties to a war. Right?\n\nSo, in a strange kind of way we've inflated the language of war and then we've hidden the idea that war is our modus operandi in the world.\n\nJS: Well, and it's incredible - in this country, there's a media culture, particularly on cable news channels but also on the pages in the papers of record, that dictates that you have to accept two primary factors in order to talk in a reasonable or responsible way about war.\n\nThe one hand, you have that the U.S. motive is always based on some benign interest - that it's a humanitarian intervention or it's to stop a despot or a dictator from threatening world stability or it's that a particular country is pursuing a weapons of mass destruction program. And then the other factor that I've noticed that needs to be present is you have to agree, if it's not already natural to you, to a self-induced sort of amnesia about how we ended up where we are, like in Syria today, in Iraq today, in Iran, in Somalia, all these countries - Pakistan - around the world that the United States has played an active role in creating the conditions we see today. It's like you erase all of that and only talk about the narrow question that officials in the U.S. pose: Is it right or wrong to try to stop country x from pursuing weapons of mass destruction? It's like a massive version of the ticking time bomb scenario that everyone wants to have, when it's like, Jack Bauer is gonna save us from al Qaeda by ripping someone's fingernails off. I mean, in a way, that is a byproduct of this bigger American mentality of amnesia, and then always assume beneficence on the part of the empire.\n\nNS: Absolutely. I mean you're sort of pointing to two things: Again, wars are defensive, American wars are defensive, and they're in the general interest. Right? So, they're not motivated by a particular American desire for power, for resources, they're not connected to any sort of past history of involvement or engagement that may have produced enmities or conflicts or destabilization, they're always about creating security and creating the rule of law. Right?\n\nSo the acts of destabilization that have gone into producing the conditions of insecurity that than are sort of understood to be the motivation for the intervention are completely erased. And then the continued destabilization that is constituted by the intervention becomes the kind of stuff of like debate, and sort of hand wringing until the next time that an intervention is planned and demanded.\n\nRight, so, it is a rinse-and-repeat cycle, right, that we're in. And it really does kind of go back to this much earlier history, I think.\n\nJS: In your study, have you ever come across a U.S. war that you believe was actually defensive in nature?\n\nNS: That's a really, really good question, and a hard question. I would actually have to say no.\n\nEven World War II was, in many ways, built upon threat inflation; it was built upon arguments that were later proved to be false about the ways in which the United States was actually threatened. And when you think about the rationale for World War II, when Roosevelt says, we can't be an island in a sea of tyranny in the world, essentially - I mean the thinking that's going into the intervention in World War II is that we're going to become the world ordering power after this war, and that our security is now going to be bound up with being involved in every part of the world.\n\nAnd I think it's Dean Acheson who says to Truman a few years later, there is no concept of security that is local anymore for the United States. And that's a new thing, right? That's a new idea. But that is an idea that is not actually about a national defense. It's actually about something else.\n\nJS: And you also, I mean, arguably, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the United Says, \"Oh, that's when we officially got into the war.\" But I always push back - when people try to start a debate or a discussion about World War II and the U.S. role, it's often that they want to start with the invasion of Poland by Hitler and the Nazi forces, rather than going back a decade, and looking at how powerful elites in the United States, financial institutions, supported the rise of Hitler.\n\nIf you look at the way the New York Times reported on Adolf Hitler, it was clear that the United States did not view him as some sort of massive threat. In fact, the United States turned away refugees that were fleeing, not unlike some of the discussions that we see today about Syrian refugees. But that's like an untouchable subject - you can't talk about U.S. support for fascism, both through its own activities or inaction, in the case of the rise of Franco in Spain, when the United States said, \"We're neutral on this.\" Because neutrality meant, you're backing General Franco. Right?\n\nNS: Exactly. I mean, I think to any way challenge the notion that the U.S. is a benign, world-ordering power is to break from a kind of a logical sort of monolith. I mean it's not even just a consensus, it's the really the equivalent of what we used to condemn as Soviet ideology. Right? It's a kind of axiomatic -\n\nJS: I mean, I sort of consider, they're like flat-Earthers. You know what I mean? It's sort of like, \"What do you mean the U.S. wasn't the most beneficent savior in the world, that stopped all of us from living under the Nazis.\"\n\nNS: The Nazi yoke. Exactly.\n\nJS: And also, I mean it's such an incendiary topic to raise in this country. When you go to almost any public event, whether it's a graduation at a high school or a middle school, a sporting event, someone is going to invoke the heroic nature of the World War II record of the United States. And it happens, Republicans, Democrats, across the board, everywhere! It's like our society is dripping in it.\n\nAnd as I read your book, I was thinking: It's such a great pushback to this notion that being born an American means you are born into the greatest nation that's ever lived, the country that saves the world. I mean it really is like a nonstarter if you disagree with that in the mainstream of American discourse.\n\nNS: Absolutely. And it's one of the reasons why in this book and in some of my previous work, I really go back to the black radical tradition in thinking about World War II, in particular, and I use this quote from Langston Hughes where he talks about, \"we hate Hitler as much as anybody, but we also want to defeat what he calls our native fascisms.\n\nAnd for African-Americans, that notion that World War II would require a double victory: A victory against fascism abroad and also against racism at home, became a very sharp critique. Right? It was a refusal to prioritize something like kind of national security citizenship at the expense of the fight for justice at home, for one thing. And it was also a refusal of the idea that the United States was somehow, again, like a coherent moral entity as opposed to actually a deeply divided imperial society internal to itself, one riven by these kinds of histories of racial violence, and sequester, and separation, and dispossession that actually were not distinct historically or conceptually from the kinds of acts that the Nazis themselves were engaged in.\n\nAnd, in fact, national socialists throughout the 1930s are reading about American Jim Crow law to like, figure out how to write the Nuremberg Laws. I mean they see the United States as an example.\n\nWhen they cross the frontier into Eastern Europe, they're talking about Eastern European Slavs as the equivalent of redskins. There's a kind of way - I mean, not that we want to elevate the Nazi example as some kind of touchstone, but there's a way in which in the history of the world in the history of racialized colonialism in the world, the United States has always been a major player. And so, the idea that history is suddenly wiped away by the fact that the United States fought against fascism in World War II is really a laundering of a much longer history. And it's a much longer history that is actually not going to go away.\n\nSo it's kind of like: How do we square these things? This is not about saying that the United States is the source of all the world's evil or anything like that. Right? Or even that the world isn't a complicated and dangerous place in which you might actually have to think about the use of force.\n\nI mean we could have that conversation, right Jeremy? I mean we could have, if we were going to have a serious conversation about how to think ethically about American power in the world.\n\nJS: This is part of the point I'm getting at, we can have that conversation about World War II -\n\nNS: Right, exactly.\n\nJS: - if you don't start the history of World War II at '39. You know, because it's always like, you'll be in a debate, and this has happened to me on television before, where someone will say to me, \"Right now, on the spot, yes or no, should we have stopped Hitler?\"\n\nNS: Right.\n\nJS: And I'll say, \"I reject the entire framing of that question, because it asks me to engage in an act of incredible erasure of everything pre-dating the invasion of Poland.\" And, but I feel like that's always the case: Is there a such entity, as al Qaeda, that does want to kill Americans, Westerners, et cetera? Yeah, there is.\n\nI would love to have the conversation about how do we take away the motive or the justifications that these people use to their own base to justify their acts of violence. But it requires a real reckoning with American history. And that's what's not allowed.\n\nNS: Well that was the amazing thing after 9/11, and it's hard to believe sometimes that 9/11 is like, 17 years ago, you know, because it still - it like, created a total miasma, right?\n\nJS: Well, and think of how many people, how many young people grew up - 9/11 is their entire reality.\n\nNS: Their entire reality.\n\nJS: That's the entire frame of what's going on in the world -\n\nNS: Right, right.\n\nJS: - is shaped by 9/11 and nonstop war.\n\nNS: That's right. And remember the one thing that was disallowed, right from the beginning of 9/11, you could not make an argument that there was motive. You could not make an argument that the people who committed that act might have had some even kernel of rational grievance that motivated it. It could only be the act of what became called terror. Right?\n\nJS: Well, and just to put a finer a point on what you're saying.\n\nNS: Yeah.\n\nJS: If you look at the targets that were chosen, I mean, the Pentagon, clearly a military target. The plane in Pennsylvania that went down was either heading toward the White House or the Capitol and then you hit the World Trade Center, right in the heart of financial power in the United States. Now, it's dangerous to even go down this line of talking about it, but I think the point you're making is we have to remove any sense that people who are the others are motivated by a set of their own grievances that we may have played a role in creating. Rather, we can only look at it for the crime that was committed. Civilians were killed, end of story.\n\nNS: That's right. That's right. And the only answer that we can engage in, in response to that, is our own kind of traumatizing violence. Right? So, 9/11 was a kind of traumatizing violence for Americans, to be sure and that was it by design. But the response to that can only be a kind of traumatizing violence and as opposed to some approach that might actually be reparative.\n\nAnd there may be the need for coercion. There may sometimes be the need - I will admit this into the frame of the conversation, but only if we can actually have the conversation. You know? It's really, really hard to have the conversation.\n\nAnd of course, what we have done now for the last 17 years is to commit a kind of traumatizing violence all over the world. And to, if anything, strengthen the very possibility of long-range terrorist networks with motive and grievance that we were ostensibly setting out to eliminate.\n\nSo, on its face it's a failure, right? In its own terms it's a failure. But we're left with a situation where we're asked to basically believe that the only response now is to continue down the same road. Right? Not to actually try to pull back and think about what it might mean to think differently about the kinds of relationships we're in with people in different parts of the world.\n\nJS: You write a good deal about Obama's presidency in this book, and you have addressed that in a much more extensive way in previous work. But on the issue of Obama and how he talked about the killing of civilians, I'm sure you recall when Obama finally publicly came out and expressed some sense of regret over the killing of people in drone strikes, and it was when white Westerners, including an American citizen, were killed in strikes that Obama said were mistakes. But the overall way that Obama and his team talked about the issue of civilians being killed was always one of moral superiority: We don't intend to kill civilians; when we bomb a hospital, we didn't mean to do that; when we bomb a wedding party we didn't mean to do that. See, that's the difference between us and al Qaeda: We didn't mean to do it and they do mean to do it.\n\nNS: Right. Right.\n\nJS: Which, by the way, that's bullshit. The United States has intentionally killed civilians.\n\nNS: Of course.\n\nJS: And they've said, \"OK, a terrorist is in this building, we want him dead, there happens to be 30 other people in there, boom, they die today.\" That's cold, crass war-mongering right there and it's war crimes.\n\nBut Obama really spent a lot of his moral capital with the base trying to convince people that the benign nature of American war-making makes us morally superior to those who fly planes into buildings or shell a school.\n\nNS: Definitely and I think this is an old debate - again, even going back to like the Vietnam War and the sort of origins of American counterinsurgency. You know, the idea that we act with a minimum of violence, that we, through our very careful, deliberative, kind of rule-bound process, we come to the sort of absolute minimal threshold of necessary force and that is what makes us morally superior. So, it's both about the following of a rule and it's about the minimization.\n\nAnd I always find it extraordinary because, of course, you're right. Oftentimes the calculation is probabilistic. It's like: There might be one terrorist. So, if we do this and take them out and there are other casualties, it is collateral damage. It's not intentional, but it is entirely foreseeable.\n\nSo, what does it mean to say that we commit mayhem that is not intentional but entirely foreseeable? How does that make us somehow morally less culpable? And thinking about it from the other side, from the eyes of people who are the victims of American power, of course there's no distinction.\n\nAnd therefore, when you turn around and try to look at American power through those eyes, what do you see? You don't see the operations of rule and the minimization of violence, you see the operations of a power that sees itself as able to act with impunity and to commit a kind of atrocity that has no sort of limitation to it that is understandable within the terms of those who are on the other side of it or on the receiving end of it. Right?\n\nJS: You know we, a couple of years ago, we obtained these secret documents detailing how certain aspects of the assassination program, or drone program, whatever you want to call it, worked under Obama.\n\nAnd one of the, I think, most important revelations to come from that is the kind of mathematical equation that has been used, particularly under the Obama administration, to almost always produce the number zero, when it comes the question of how many civilians are killed.\n\nAnd it's this idea that when people are killed in drone strikes, and we don't know their identities, they are preemptively determined or categorized as enemies killed in action. And only if they are posthumously proven to be a \"innocent civilian\" is that every revisited. So it's not so much that they know that they aren't killing civilians or they're trying to minimize it, it's that you or I or a human rights group or a journalist would have to go and prove that the nine people that you didn't know the identities of in that drone strike, that you killed, were actually civilians, and you only killed one person that you label terrorist, even though it has no legal definition. To me, the sophistication of Obama's legitimizing or seeking to legitimize these kinds of operations, is going to be with us for generations to come.\n\nNS: Yeah.\n\nJS: Because he sold a lot of liberals in his base on this idea that had come up with this magical, safer, cleaner way of waging war, and that it's morally justifiable in a world where there's already too much war.\n\nNS: Well, I think you're absolutely right, and you guys have done amazing work around this and it's really, really valuable for all of us.\n\nYou know the other thing that I would add to what you're saying though is that there's an interesting kind of flipside to Obama's careful, kind of prophylactic imagination around the use of American violence, and that is that it sort of draws the ire of the Right. So, Trump comes in and basically says, you know: We're going to take the gloves off because this hasn't worked and now we're going to sort of free the commanders in the field to use maximum discretion and we've already seen what's happening with that.\n\nJS: Discretion sounds like almost like they're being - I mean, I know what the words means, but he's widened the rules of engagement so they can kill more civilians if they feel like it's necessary.\n\nNS: Right, right. Basically: Take the gloves off, do what you need to do and don't worry so much about it. So, and that's seen as the sort of adventurous spirit, the spirit that's really going to lead to victory.\n\nSo, you oscillate between these sort of poles, right? These poles of: We're following the rules and we're being careful and we're killing just enough of them to keep everyone safe, and then, when that doesn't work, now we're going to take the gloves off. Nobody really thinks about trying anything different. Right?\n\nAnd you're right. Not only is this going to be with us for a long time, but as we excavate the sort of history of violence in the future, we're going to find out things that we didn't know before about the consequences and the casualties. You know, I'm thinking of like Nick Turse's work on, \"A May Lai a Month\" in Vietnam, that there are shrines all over your rural Vietnam where massacres occurred, and, where people -\n\nJS: That book is called \"Kill Anything That Moves\" and it's amazing.\n\nNS: Right. It's a fantastic book. And this is not a well-known history, and the use of body counts in the Vietnam War, I mean the scale was bigger, so let's not make it identical, but it was a similar kind of obfuscating exercise. You know? It was always the enemy who was killed.\n\nJS: I want to ask you briefly about the way that Native American imagery, identity is used. Obviously, it's used in sports, the football team in Washington and other pro sports teams. But it's so pervasive in the U.S. military that you have the Apache attack helicopters and the use of imagery of hatchets and -\n\nNS: Tomahawks.\n\nJS: Tomahawks, the cruise missile is called the Tomahawk, and my colleague Matthew Cole did this series here that you cite in your book on the \"Crimes of SEAL Team Six,\" and the phrase \"bloody the hatchet\" and you cite that article in your book. And there's a broader discussion in your work on the use of this nomenclature.\n\nTalk about the way that Native American culture and imagery has been co-opted or snatched by the military?\n\nNS: It's such an important topic and I think it needs a vaster exploration and it's about the imagery but it's also about the kind of conceptual role that, that the Indian wars play or that the, or that the iconography or the mythos of the Indian wars play, which is to say that sometimes you're fighting a savage foe and when you fight a savage foe, you need to loosen the restraints under which you fight, you need to learn to fight like a savage.\n\nAnd that notion, you know, of savage war is one of the deepest kind of organizing ideas of the American democratic experiment. In fact, it is in some ways a democratization of war itself because it's about licensing individuals to engage, in some sense, as authorized representatives of the state on the frontier in certain kinds of ways. I think it sometimes informs the way that police think about the ways in which they operate, that they're sort of the line between civilization and the sort of chaos on the outside, on the frontier.\n\nYou know, so the idea that imagery then gets sort of brought in to the sort of highly technical kind of kind of weapon systems and other things to name them in the U.S. military is fascinating, right?\n\nJS: Also, Bin Laden, was Objective Geronimo.\n\nNS: Bin Laden was Geronimo. But the other thing that I talk about a little bit in the book is the ways in which this actually comes into the language of really like high academia and high thinking about, about just war and so forth.\n\nSo, just two quick examples - right after 9/11, the sort of dean of diplomatic historians, John Gaddis, wrote a little book called \"Security, Surprise, and the American Experience\" where he basically says, well, you know, we used to pursue rule-bound order, but there's this other tradition in American history which is about the frontier, and when the Bush administration launched the Iraq war it was really that tradition that was important. Because now it's not national frontiers, but it's the global frontiers of civilized society that are threatened by terrorists and non-state enemies who are like the non-state enemies of the past: the Indians, the pirates, and other kinds of marauders.\n\nSo, he actually isn't just drawing even just an analogy. He's really saying that this kind of war in the past was justified in the name of civilization, and this war now is justified in the name of civilization. And so, it's really extraordinary, and it goes to your earlier point about how we erase history. Like the Indian wars were about civilization, that's primarily what they were about, as opposed to a being about land, hunger, and a struggle over territory and resources, in which violence became the mechanism and ethnic cleansing and erasure of one party became the mechanism for the triumph of the other. Is that really how we think about the world now? Is that really the kind of world we want to be imagining ourselves living in?\n\nAnd you know Michael Walzer, who's a liberal, who wrote a very famous book about just war theory after Vietnam, he makes the point at one point in the book where he says, well, you know, one of the times you can fight a just war is when you know that there's somebody out there who wants to kill you. And then he his mind immediately goes to what he calls the Wild West of American fiction, you know? And I'm kind of scratching my head. I'm like, why is the Wild West of American fiction the sort of framework that we would want to use when we're thinking about how we would deploy power in the world?\n\nAnd Walzer is explicitly at that moment in his book writing about Israeli incursions into the West Bank. Right? Which is really the settler project of our time. Right? I mean there's, we have an active settler project that's been going on since the 1967 annexations, which is one of the greatest sore points around the world today and it's a project that the United States has put its full kind of faith and credit behind.\n\nJS: Let's talk for a second: How would all of these settler wars in the United States have been live-tweeted by Democrats and Republicans. Here, I'll start off with a thought I had as you were talking, that: \"Today savage Indians attacked a stabilizing force sent in to modernize and bring services to the state of Wyoming.\"\n\nNS: [Laughs.] That's good. That's good.\n\nJS: Your turn.\n\nNS: OK. Let me try. \"Today, regrettably a settler party doing a land survey to try to create better water resources and to build a pipeline to deliver -\" I'm terrible at this, Jeremy.\n\nJS: We don't even need to do that one! Scratch. That'll be the Easter egg at the end of the episode.\n\nNS: Sorry.\n\nJS: It was just something that I was thinking about, like, wow, it would be fucking crazy to think about how these dingbats would be tweeting about this stuff. Like, I mean it would be, it really would I think glorify the people moving west, not to mention the early stages on the East Coast, but as they move west, that this was, this is all for the benefit of humanity and the savages are attacking the people trying to help the world.\n\nNS: Yeah, it's true. You know, the difference between the liberals and the conservatives would be this: the conservatives would say, the Conservatives would always say, you know, \"our people came under attack by savages and we had to kill them, we have to wipe them out because, you know, it's us or them.\" And the liberals would say, \"Maybe we did something wrong. Maybe there's some kind of way in which we could do a better job in this exchange.\"\n\nJS: Isn't that how we got reservations?\n\nNS: Yeah, basically.\n\nJS: I mean isn't the idea, \"We'll give you some territory here.\"\n\nNS: We'll give you something.\n\nJS: Yeah, and you can have your own laws to an extent.\n\nNS: And \"it's lamentable what's happened,\" the other things that liberals will say. Like they'll say, you know, \"OK, it's all played out this way and it's lamentable.\" Like, John Jay writes a letter to Jefferson saying, this is very early in New York State frontier, and he says, our settlers are killing too many people, and the native people don't like the avidity with which we are claiming their land. But, what can we really do? There's nothing much we can do, because these are our people. You know and they are not. Right?\n\nSo, it's kind of like, there's a bit of a mea culpa like, let's throw up our hands. It's like the way in which people, a lot of people will treat killing by the police, you know? What can we really do? You know, these are our guys, you know? And they're doing the best they can under difficult conditions.\n\nSure they make mistakes sometimes. But they're under a lot of pressure out there protecting us from civilization, protecting us from savagery, right?\n\nJS: Mhmm.\n\nNS: So, that's the kind of liberal response, and \"let's have some body cameras, let's have a little more accountability.\" But no liberal is out there calling for strong civilian oversight of the police. You know, no one's calling for taking away, in a really substantive way, police discretion right around their use of force and violence. Right?\n\nJS: Right, I mean it's more often aimed at that the police force needs to more accurately reflect the racial or religious makeup of communities. And I wonder how you push back against or respond when people say, \"Look, yes, those extreme things, Professor Singh, that you're about, they happen, everyone knows that they happen. Are we perfect right now? No, we're not perfect. But we just had two terms of a black president. We came very close to having a woman as president, she got three million more votes in the popular election than Donald Trump. Police forces across the country are aggressively recruiting and hiring people of color, people who speak multiple languages. Yes, there still is racism, but look at all of the progress that we've made and how can you argue that America remains a racist country when a black man was president for eight years?\"\n\nNS: Well that's not a hard case to make, because I think that if you - one of the stories, one of the arcs in the book that I'm trying to follow is the arc of mass incarceration or hyper-incarceration, which has led to 1 million African-American people in prison over 30 years.\n\nJS: They commit a lot of crimes.\n\nNS: That's what Steve Bannon would say, you know. And that's what others would say.\n\nJS: They need better fathers.\n\nNS: Exactly. And Obama said similar things, right? So, the idea that we would produce the world's largest penal society, you know, larger than the Soviet Gulag Archipelago, is somehow something that gets back down in its fundamental explanation to basically the deficiency of like, the slave-descended population. Right? Even for some liberals.\n\nBut I take a totally different view which is that mass incarceration is the product of an organized abandonment of black people that relates to a much longer history of confinement, of separation, of lack of access to jobs and infrastructure and other kinds of benefits, and basically -\n\nNS: And economic independence as well.\n\nJS: I mean, yes, you're on to something that I think we don't talk about enough.\n\nNS: So, these kinds of questions of the failure to resolve, the failure to redress and again to repair a long internalized history of racial violence that really comes out of slavery, and Jim Crow, and segregation, and ghettoization - and now mass incarceration - is something that for me, prima facie, is the sort of evidence for a continuous kind of internally racist history in the United States for which the election of a black president was not significant in changing.\n\nI mean, I think Obama made some overtures, you know the reduction of some sentences for drug crimes, the critique and rolling back at the federal level of certain kinds of mandatory minimums.\n\nYou know, Eric Holder, the attorney general, began to make some kind of modest reforms around the edges, because I think there is recognition now that the carceral state is a failure, the carceral state has done its damage. Right?\n\nJS: In the book, this is one of the passages on Obama. You said, \"Obama quietly lowered the volume on the bellicose rhetoric and lightened the military footprint of the long war, he moved the mass deportation of undocumented migrants back into the shadows and inaugurated modest reforms of the drug wars and the mandatory sentencing guidelines that have been key to expanding the criminal punishment complex.\" Nonetheless, you write, \"Obama strengthened the interrelationship between the inner and outer wars, as well as their legal and institutional basis, by expanding the use of unmanned armed drones and targeted assassinations. Obama also added a new and terrifying dimension.\"\n\nNS: Yeah, Obama - I was one of the people who when Obama was elected actually had some hopes. I think the United States electing an African-American to be president is a sign of some popular resonance, of an inclusive and anti-racist, kind of, let's call it public feeling.\n\nI'm not going to make a blanket statement, America is a racist country. It's not really about a country being racist. It's about various kinds of social forces, and structures. And we have to be able to examine and analyze that. And obviously in this country, these questions have also been contested: slavery was contested, Jim Crow was contested. When specialized segregation and ghettoization was contested, the result was quite inconclusive, it didn't result in any kind of genuine desegregation, and if anything, it set the carceral train in motion.\n\nBut there are strong constituents, constituencies in this country who would like to produce a more robust kind of social solidarity across racial lines.\n\nJS: Well, and you say, \"the labors of egalitarian and social transformation will fail if they do not frontally address the forms of human sacrifice and sundering of human commonality affected by state-sanctioned violence.\"\n\nNS: That's right. I put the onus for the continuation of racist public policy and the structuring mechanisms that divide the population along racial lines in the domain of state power, and in the purview or field of action of state elites.\n\nThat doesn't mean that ordinary people don't act in racist ways that have consequence, but I think ordinary people also act in non-racist or anti-racist ways that can have consequences. It's actually about how we organize public feeling and public policy in a way that directs us towards a widening conception of social solidarity and the kinds of policies that we would need to sustain that. Right?\n\nAnd that's really in some ways where Obama kind of falls short, right? Because he represented that kind of hope and aspiration. I think his election genuinely did. But in choosing to govern in the name of caution and continuity with what came before, and choosing not to seriously have a public reckoning with the record of torture by the Bush administration, to not more frontally go after the kind of predatory lending that led to the crisis, the financial crisis, that was also very racialized, was really to choose to enact what I call in the book a kind of laundering operation.\n\nYou know? And a lot of times, this is what liberals do for reactionaries, they kind of clean up the mess. But without actually doing the kind of turning towards a different orientation. And sometimes I think we need we need more, we don't just need more struggle from our side, but we need to actually lay down some markers of our own.\n\nBecause if Obama had gone after the Bush administration torturers, maybe he wouldn't have succeeded. You know? Maybe we wouldn't have gotten justice. But we would have had a kind of marker that we could have looked to and sort of said, \"Look, we tried to hold some people to account here.\"\n\nAnd the thing is, the right understands this very well. The right understands that sometimes laying down a marker, even, when it doesn't get what it wants, sets the terms for the next battle that it's going to fight.\n\nJS: Obama's birth certificate.\n\nNS: Exactly!\n\nJS: I think of that, I mean they knew they weren't going to get anywhere with that and it was a huge part of the ascent of Trump.\n\nNS: A huge part of the ascent of Trump. Meanwhile, Obama's deporting people en masse, strengthening the deportation machinery, giving speeches, really, that are completely consistent with the language of criminalizing immigration violations. Why should immigration violations be in the domain of the criminal? I mean, these are basically, for the most part, people who are trying to make a living in the United States, many for almost a generation. Right? This could be talked about in a completely different way. Why do we adopt the right's language that anyone here without papers is somehow a criminal? Why would that be the case?\n\nAnd now Trump, of course, accentuates the kind of occasional horrific criminal violation by someone who is out of status and uses that to recursively characterize entire populations. Right? In order to sharpen this idea of the divide between the native-born and the foreign-born.\n\nI mean the DHS now is even contemplating policies that are going to put green card holders and people who are naturalized citizens under a kind of extra burden of surveillance and pressure, as if we - and I wasn't born in this country - by virtue of our non-native status are sort of here at the beneficence of the sovereign, you know?\n\nJS: [Laughs.]\n\nNS: It's a really a scary time, and I think people are kind of shocked. You know? And some of the shock is good, and some of the outrage, and the anger and the fight-back.\n\nBut the idea that we somehow just flipped a switch and got Trump in this weird way that doesn't try to think about a longer story that takes us through some of the failure of reckoning of the Obama years, and, of course, the sort of the pathway that the Iraq war put the country on, and even before the Iraq war, the pathway that the Clinton-era mass incarceration project put us on, you know, I think makes it really difficult for us to make sense of what's happening right now and to make sense of the forces that Trump has been able to mobilize.\n\nJS: What do you think is the both the short-term and long-term impact of having such overt racist rhetoric attached to racist policy in the United States? Or to have someone like Trump who seems to just thrive on the idea in his own head that he is the anti-PC guy, but really, completely legitimizing, if not at times celebrating, acts of outright violent racism from the presidential podium, whether it's Twitter or a press conference.\n\nNS: Right. I honestly don't know the answer, Jeremy. I'm not like, one of the sort of \"the apocalypse is coming,\" you know? I mean: the apocalypse may be coming, which is, you know, the environmental apocalypse. There are all kinds of things -\n\nJS: Well, I keep saying to people, Trump's nowhere near murdering as many people as Bush and Cheney yet.\n\nNS: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nJS: But he's as scary in his own way.\n\nNS: Exactly. And you don't know with him when the shoe is going to finally drop, right? Whether it's in North Korea or somewhere else. There is a sort of a feeling of anxiety that people have that's legitimate. That I have. But I think that again, the anxiety has been something that's being stoked in us for at least two decades, you know, that Americans live with the expectation of violence. And we live with the expectation that our state will commit violence on a, sometimes, perhaps even on a scale that is horrifying to us as Americans, right? We live with that as, sort of, a constant.\n\nWhether that will come to pass under Trump, whether it's more likely under Trump - I think Obama did make it feel a little bit less likely, in certain ways, even though I think part of that sleight of hand was, again, really about the rhetorical cover or not drawing as much attention to it, whereas Trump always wants to put it in the foreground.\n\nBut in terms of the consequences of what Trump's doing: I mean Trump is dangerous in the sense that I think he is animating a kind of a notion of American citizenship, and native-born status and racial status as somehow either the equivalent of an entitlement to rule others, or is something that has been dispossessed and therefore we need to reclaim it. You know, and I think that's a scary gambit. Right?\n\nBecause I think we were, in some ways, under Obama and before, even under Bush and Clinton - because remember, W. Bush, he wanted the grand immigration bargain. You know, he wanted a more multicultural inclusive Republican Party. I mean he had a very inclusive administration, waging war overseas, to go back to the earlier points we were discussing.\n\nI think there was a sense that, OK, the white supremacy project, you know which was such a huge part of American history, is no longer really viable. But I think Trump's trying to make it viable again.\n\nJS: Well, you know, we did an interview not too long ago with the Nigerian musician Seun Kuti, whose father was Fela, he's the youngest son of Fela, and we were talking about Trump and he said something that was on its surface quite simple, but also as resonated with me which is that, all of this talk about Trump being more dangerous than anyone else is bullshit. \"He's just unmasking who you guys have always been.\" Like he is sort of speaking plainly in a way about -I mean he pretty accurately, I think, represents Andrew Jackson's worldview on a number of key issues.\n\nAnd in your book, you seem to the bookend your discussion of war-craft and race-craft with Trump, and that Trump moment. Talk about that influence though that, both he and Bannon have cited of Andrew Jackson, and he made these Navajo code talkers that came to the White House sit under a portrait of Andrew Jackson, but maybe talk about the way that you deal with Trump in the book and the Andrew Jackson question.\n\nNS: Well I think, Jackson really tied together the idea of, America as a white man's democracy in which material accumulation through dispossession, the dispossession of native lands, and American state violence, and American civilization and prosperity were kind of yoked together.\n\nAnd even liberal historians celebrated Jackson in the sort of '40s and '50s, people like Arthur Schlesinger, you know as kind of great democratizers. That really was Bannon's vision. I mean Bannon's kind of [an] odious figure but it's at certain moments he would talk in ways of well native-born Latinos and African-Americans are going to have a place at this table, too. You know, so even Bannon could expand into a sort of inclusive language but it was all about a national possessiveness. And that possessiveness was clearly understood as being linked to somebody else's dispossession and if you didn't have the stomach to dispossess somebody through force, if necessary, you weren't really acting as a proper American.\n\nAnd that really is a pretty stark break from the language of Wilsonian internationalism, where we're sort of creating a rule-bound world where everybody thrives and there's enough to go around. Right? It's a really stark break and I think it's interesting.\n\nNow, is that who Americans always have been? To some extent, for sure. You know, but like I've said before, there are these competing currents.\n\nJS: As we wrap up, I wanted to get your thoughts on this trend of paramilitarization of law enforcement or police, whatever you want to call the generic term. And you cite in the in the book the work of Alfred McCoy, who we've had on this show and has done a lot of work on the ground and in exposing the real history of the relationship between the United States and the Philippines in the U.S.-Philippine war. And he used the phrase that it was a \"laboratory of police modernity.\"\n\nAnd at The Intercept we do a lot of reporting on the surveillance state, not just the paramilitarization of the troops in the street, but also the use of technologies that were created for the military or spy agencies, like StingRays now coming home and being used to patrol the streets, looking for \"street crime.\"\n\nHow do you see the lessons from what McCoy called the \"laboratory of police modernity\" and the surveillance state now as it manifests itself in communities around the United States?\n\nNS: I think that we're evolving towards a nation in which the people are seen as being in protective custody, of a certain kind, right? The numbers of incarcerated people we talk about is always something like around 2 million, and then when we think of the numbers of people on parole or probation we get into like 7 or 8 million and then we think of the people who are related to the people who are on parole, probation or incarcerated and we get into, the numbers of 15 or 20 million. And then you think of the numbers of people who have been charged with a felony or arrested, and suddenly we're talking about, you know, 70, 80 million American adults who have had some kind of primary relationship to the policing apparatus of the state, who are in some ways marked as potentially criminal.\n\nAnd the ways criminal violation is now used as a tool of information, as a tool of stigma, as a tool of surveillance, as a tool to potentially revoke someone's rights at a later point, particularly people who have various kinds of uncertainties in their immigration status. But you could imagine it being used or rolled out further than that, it really is a tremendous technology of control and it's a technology of control, as McCoy's shows, that was elaborated very profoundly in the long counterinsurgency war the United States fought in the Philippines and it was the first time you really saw the use of demographic information, photographic information, extensive informants systems, basically tracking the population, imagining the population as a potentially subversive population in which you had to begin to know how to sort people.\n\nAnd, at the very same time as you see that happen in the Philippines, you see the origins of crime statistics in the United States which are especially targeting African-Americans internally. And I don't exactly write about this in the book but Kahlil Muhammad has written a book on the history of what it's called \"The Condemnation of Blackness,\" fantastic book, part of [which] deals with the origins of crime statistics in the United States. These, these technologies which have been racially targeted and elaborated within colonial context are actually now being more generally applied to the population as a whole. Right?\n\nAnd that's one of the great ironies of the, say, the post-colonial era or the era of the American empire and globalization is, and even the era of civil rights, or the era of formally inclusive democracy, is that what actually happens during these periods is not a general advance of rights - but a kind of a rhetorical advance of rights. And tools that were once used against formally right-less populations, now being elaborated and used more widely in relationship to everybody else. You know and I think that actually requires much more discussion than we probably have time for, but it's something of the danger that we just under now. And so when people talk about the threat to democracy represented by the authoritarian Trump, you know, I would say let's think over a longer period of the sort of erosion of our, of a kind of a robust democracy by these kinds of corporate powers and governmental powers that have really irrigated what were once thought to be the kind of sovereign rights of citizens.\n\nJS: Well, we would love to have you back to continue that discussion, Professor Nikhil Singh, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nNS: Thank you so much, Jeremy.

      "text": "The Nightmare President\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMany communities, from undocumented immigrants to Muslims, suddenly face grave concerns for their rights and security.\n\nDonald Trump shocked everyone but his own supporters Tuesday as his racist, xenophobic, authoritarian, climate-science-denying, misogynistic, \"grab-them-by-the-pussy\" candidacy somehow carried him to victory.\n\nLarger than expected turnout among rural and working-class white voters led Trump to outperform polling expectations in almost every battleground state, winning Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which, according to the Associated Press, put him over the required 270 electoral votes early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe one-time leader of the racist \"birther\" movement entered the race calling Mexicans \"rapists\" and repeatedly refusing to condemn white supremacists, and issued policy proposals that seemed unbound by the limits of executive power or basic human decency.\n\nTrump promised to \"bomb the shit\" out of Middle Eastern countries, kill terrorist's innocent families, do \"a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\" and suggested that dipping bullets in pigs' blood may be sound counterterrorism policy.\n\nTrump had a long history of misogyny and belittling women, but after a decade-old tape surfaced of Trump saying he could \"grab [women] by the pussy,\" and \"if you're a star, they let you do it,\" many were horrified, and numerous women came forward with stories of being victimized by Trump. Forecasts predicted Clinton would win in a near landslide.\n\nTrump's election is a particular nightmare-come-alive for American Muslims, his campaign already having incited hundreds of anti-Muslim hate crimes and started a new wave of anti-Muslim bullying in schools. Trump's promises to spy on mosques and ban Muslims from entering the country have electrified his base, and served as consistent applause lines throughout his campaign. Trump's circle of advisors, surrogates, and political allies include people who brag about spying on mosques and call for \"sharia tests\" of all American Muslims, under penalty of deportation. General Michael Flynn, a top national security adviser to Donald Trump and possible Defense Secretary , has tweeted that \"fear of muslims is rational.\"\n\nWide open questions remain as to how Trump would staff his administration, or govern. Trump has flip flopped on hundreds of policy positions , and despite his promise to break the control of Washington by political insiders, his transition team is full of corporate lobbyists and Republican power brokers.\n\nTwo places he's been consistent: His convictions to build a wall on the southern border, and to stand by police when they kill unarmed black men.\n\nPolitical scientists, pollsters and pundits will likely debate for many years how media elites could have been so wrong in predicting an overwhelming Clinton victory. But in the short term, many communities, from undocumented immigrants to Muslims, suddenly face grave concerns for their rights and security.\n\nTop Photo: Republican president-elect Donald Trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016, in New York.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Black Students in Milwaukee Are Demanding Changes to Racist Discipline in Public Schools\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOfficials have until June to come up with a fairer school discipline code. Students seeking to end the school-to-prison pipeline want a say in the reforms.\n\nJoya Headley was in seventh grade when metal detectors were suddenly installed at the entrance of her middle school, on Milwaukee's north side. Students weren't told why, but the development was consistent with the message the city had been sending them throughout their short lives.\n\nMilwaukee has been called \"the worst place to raise a black child\" in America - and there's a somber list of statistics to back up that claim. Wisconsin has the highest black infant mortality rate in the country, and Milwaukee's black babies die at twice the rate of white babies. Three quarters of Milwaukee's black children grow up in economically insecure households, and black children make up 67 percent of those removed from the custody of their parents. Their futures don't promise much better: In 2017, Milwaukee allocated nearly 47 percent of its general fund expenditures to policing - a larger fraction than many other big cities - and the city's 53206 zip code, which is 95 percent black, has held the grim record for the highest incarceration of black men in the country.\n\nTo Headley, who is black and lives in nearby 53205, watching her school take on the appearance of a prison was upsetting but unsurprising. \"It made the environment feel unsafe,\" she told The Intercept. \"I guess many people argue that the metal detectors are there to make us safe; however, it doesn't. It makes us more concerned on how safe our school really is, more concerned on why we can't just walk into the building. Why do we have to be checked all the time?\"\n\nHeadley's experience is shared by more than 12,000 Milwaukee students who have to walk through metal detectors to get to class every morning in 12 of the city's public schools. But if the airport-style machines have become symbolic of a sweeping criminalization of mostly black students in public schools across the country, in Milwaukee they are among the milder manifestations of the school-to-prison pipeline. A report released Tuesday by the Center for Popular Democracy and the Milwaukee youth group Leaders Igniting Transformation paints a much more troubling picture.\n\nAccording to the report, in the 2016-2017 school year, Milwaukee Public Schools suspended 10,267 students, including one of every three ninth-graders. The Milwaukee Police Department has 12 dedicated officers assigned to public schools and another six deployed on the streets to take truant students into custody. That's in addition to 269 school safety assistants, the city's version of school resource officers. That deployment costs Milwaukee taxpayers more than $15 million a year, but it comes at an even greater social cost. During the last school year, police were called to city schools 2,895 times. Police or school security restrained or secluded students 1,139 times. And more than 3,000 students faced citations for missing school, requiring them to show up for court dates but making no dent in the city's truancy rates.\n\n\"Milwaukee's reliance on punitive approaches to discipline is ineffective, costly, and most troublingly, racially biased,\" the report concludes. \"Milwaukee Public Schools' suspensions and expulsion rates - which disproportionately affect students of color - directly undermine impacted students' fundamental right to education.\"\n\nIndeed, as Milwaukee schools criminalize youth behavior, black students fare the worst. Milwaukee's black high school students are suspended at double the national rate - and though black students make up only 55 percent of the city's student population, they accounted for nearly 85 percent of referrals to law enforcement in the 2013-2014 school year, according to the report. (Students with disabilities, who make up 20 percent of the student population, accounted for 91 percent of those restrained or put in seclusion in schools.)\n\nThe suspension and expulsion of black students reached rates so disproportionate that in 2014, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights launched an investigation into the city's schools. The review ended in January with federal officials concluding that the schools lacked consistency in their application of discipline. Investigators found \"over one hundred incidents at the district's schools where black students were expelled, while similarly situated white students were suspended for similar conduct.\" Following the investigation, MPS reached an agreement with federal officials, committing to sweeping reforms and an end to racially biased school discipline. MPS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSchool officials have until June to come up with a fairer school discipline code. And students like Headley, who is now a junior at Milwaukee School of Languages, want a say in that process.\n\nProtesters yell outside the Bradley Center on Dec. 23, 2014, in Milwaukee, Wis, protesting the announcement that no charges were filed against former police office Christopher Manney in the fatal shooting of Dontre Hamilton.\n\nLike many in her generation, Headley was catapulted into social activism by a seemingly unending series of police killings of unarmed black men and women. For Headley, the turning point came with the 2014 police killing of Dontre Hamilton at a local Milwaukee park. \"It kind of opened my eyes and motivated me to actually do something,\" she said. \"I just kind of became more aware of the way black people are treated in my city and the country.\"\n\nHeadley channeled that motivation into school activism two years ago, after several city schools tested positive for high levels of lead in the water. \"It kind of made me feel like, OK, I want to make a change in my city, it has to start with the schools,\" Headley said. At the same time, she saw classmates get into trouble after they were suspended, and others disappear after getting caught up in the criminal justice system. A friend at another school was suspended following an incident with a security guard, who roughly stopped him while he was on his way to class because he didn't have a pass. \"They suspended him. For trying to go to class,\" said Headley. \"A security guard stopped him from going to class.\"\n\nAs the DOE investigation kicked off a long-overdue school reform process, Headley and others saw an opportunity to channel their broad call for an end to the school-to-prison pipeline into policy demands. With Leaders Igniting Transformation, or LIT, they launched a campaign demanding that city officials \"divest\" from police officers, metal detectors, truancy citations, and suspensions and expulsions, and redirect that investment toward an \"inclusive\" school code, restorative justice processes, and more resources for social workers, guidance counselors, and a youth jobs program. With an online petition, the students pushed the school board to call six public hearings about the new school policy. The first session is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\n\"The fact that you have a group of young black kids willing to step up and say, We're not going to take it anymore, is really powerful,\" said Dakota Hall, LIT's executive director. \"The fact that they're taking control of their own destiny and demanding that their values are met in public policies is uplifting.\"\n\nSchool buses parked in a lot outside Miller Park on May 27, 2010, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nStudents found an ally in the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association, the local teachers union, which is fighting 5 percent cuts across the city's schools as the department tries to close a $30 million budget deficit for the next school year. Teachers' salaries have stagnated in Milwaukee, while those of police have soared by nearly 100 percent since 2011 - an irony not lost on those pushing for an end to the criminalization of youth.\n\nAmy Mizialko, a union leader, called budget choices a matter of \"values and priorities.\"\n\n\"There's been a program of austerity across this nation, specifically in black and brown communities and urban cities, purposefully aiming to break the public sphere and the public safety net,\" said Mizialko, who has been a special education teacher in Milwaukee for 26 years. \"The Wisconsin legislature just recently voted to allocate $350 million for prisons - at the same time that they're telling public school students that they have to sit in classrooms of 45 children, that they have to use textbooks that are 15 years old.\"\n\n\"What's happening is not a Wisconsin story, it's a national story,\" she added, citing recent teachers strikes in West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. \"We don't want police in schools. We want our schools funded.\"\n\nHeadley says the budget cuts - including a proposal to cut school buses - are making even less politically engaged students question school officials' sense. \"A lot of students now know that with the budget cuts, they're not going to be able to get to school, yet somehow the money is going to security guards,\" she said.\n\nLast month, a day after students across the country walked out of classes demanding action on gun violence in the aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker announced, and then quickly signed, a $100 million \" school safety program \" further strengthening relationships between schools and law enforcement.\n\nThat's exactly the opposite of what those calling for an end to the school-to-prison pipeline want to see.\n\n\"Black students are being invested in, but the investment that's being made is in criminalizing them, rather than supporting them,\" said Dmitri Holtzman, director of education justice campaigns with the Center for Popular Democracy. \"And the same can be said of teachers; they are not invested in, but at the drop of a hat, states will be able to find money to increase funding for weapons or police officers.\"\n\n\"Although there's benefit to the new energy and attention to school safety that's been raised at the national level following the Florida shooting, the concern is that as we've seen before when school safety becomes an issue, the response often is to add more police, more metal detectors, more SROs,\" he added, referring to student resource officers. \"And the students in Milwaukee and other places can tell you that's already the situation that they're in, and in fact, the school safety debate is now actually potentially going to be even more dangerous for them.\"\n\nBut officials' response to the Parkland shooting is also a reminder for black and brown youth of the indifference with which their demands and activism - as opposed to those of their white peers - are often met.\n\n\"It's kind of heartbreaking,\" said Headley, who added that she supports the student movement sparked by the Parkland shooting and recently spoke at a March for Our Lives event held at the Milwaukee park where Dontre Hamilton was killed.\n\n\"When black and brown youth showcase what they're going through, nobody cares, but then when white students do, everyone cares?\" she added. \"It really shows racial disparity in America. The whole Black Lives Matter movement, all these police shootings, when people address that, it's a temporary hashtag and it goes away. But when white students address their issues, they go on 'Ellen,' they go on Time magazine, national marches, national walkouts.\"\n\nStill, Milwaukee's students are not waiting for national endorsements to demand safety for their schools, too. This is the generation that came of age seeing Trayvon Martin get killed and get no justice, Hall said. They are coming up with their own visions of what justice and safety look like.\n\n\"They're very aware that their life does not mean a lot to a lot of people,\" Hall added. \"As much as post-Parkland it's been talked about how this is going to be the gun reform generation, I think for students of color, this is the Trayvon, Sandra Bland, Mike Brown generation that is not going to accept the devaluing of black and brown lives.\"\n\nTop photo: Members of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office secure Sherman Park after a 6 p.m. curfew was enacted after a second night of clashes between protesters and police on Aug. 15, 2016, in Milwaukee, Wis.\n\nWAIT!

Plus, music from Dallas hip-hop artist Bobby Sessions.\n\nThe world laughed at U.S. President Donald Trump at the United Nations, but the imperial declarations he issued are no laughing matter. Trump may come off as a buffoon, but his global agenda is consistent with the bipartisan empire machine that runs the United States. This week on Intercepted: Famed dissident Noam Chomsky breaks down the Trump presidency; the defeat of the U.S. in Afghanistan; what he believes is a just position on Syria's civil war; and the agenda of Vladimir Putin and Russia. He also discusses the impact of big social media companies and explains why a life of resisting and fighting is worth it. Jeremy Scahill analyzes Trump's U.N. speech and gives context to the seldom-discussed bipartisan support for much of Trump's global agenda. Dallas hip-hop artist Bobby Sessions talks about police killings and this political moment. We also hear music from his new EP, \"RVLTN (Chapter 1): The Divided States of AmeriKKKa.\"\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nMartha MacCallum: Today the controversy surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh reaches an all-time high. The judge got a call from the president himself.\n\nDonald J. Trump: The wettest we've ever seen from the standpoint of water.\n\nMartha MacCallum: He is about to describe what this whole thing has been like.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh: In America we have fairness. I want a fair process. America is about fairness. I want a fair process.\n\nMitch McConnell: A smear campaign - pure and simple.\n\nWe're going to plow right through it and do our job.\n\nBK: Fair process means hearing from both sides. Have a fair process. A fair process. I just want a fair process. I just want a fair process where I can be heard.\n\nLindsey Graham: What am I supposed to do? Go ahead and ruin this guy's life based on an accusation.\n\nBK: I am looking for a fair process. All I'm asking for is fairness. All I'm asking for is a fair process.\n\nOrrin Hatch: I think she's mistaken. I just think she's mistaken something.\n\nBK: Again, just asking for a fair process. Again, I'm just asking for a fair process. Fair process. Let me be heard. Fair process hear from both sides.\n\nDJT: She said well might not be him and there were gaps and she said she was totally inebriated and she was all messed up and she doesn't know if it was him, but it might have been him. Oh gee, let's not make him a Supreme Court judge. This is a con game being played by the Democrats.\n\nMartha MacCallum: Through all these years that are in question, you were a virgin?\n\nBK: That's correct. I'm not going anywhere.\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\nJS: I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode 67 of Intercepted.\n\nDJT: In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country. America's - so true. [Laughter.] Didn't expect that reaction, but that's OK.\n\nJS: There is one level where I believe the presidency of Donald Trump has actually brought a positive development to the discourse in our society - the discourse around the world. He has united many nations in openly laughing at the hubris and bravado of the United States. Yeah, I know, that they were specifically laughing at Donald Trump at the UN. But I also thought it was pretty funny. But as I've said over and over, Trump is a product of the American political system. When you strip down or strip away the buffoonery, and the arrogance, and the lies, and you look at the U.S. position in the world on foreign policy, Trump is basically in line with the political strategy of the empire politicians, of the elite.\n\nThe world has long watched in horror as the United States has pursued its imperial march. Trump has made it OK to openly mock it. And while Trump does, indeed, lie about anything and everything, he simultaneously engages in the big lies. The big lies that unite Democrats and Republicans.\n\nDJT: That is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination. I honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs, and traditions. The United States will not tell you how to live, or work, or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.\n\nJS: You see right there, this is a big lie. It's a lie that has been told throughout the history of the United States. The U.S. has never honored the right of nations to pursue their own customs and beliefs. The U.S. invades countries, sanctions them, bombs them, overthrows governments, interferes in elections, assassinates people across the globe. This nation was founded on violating the sovereignty of indigenous people and then forcing enslaved Africans to build its infrastructure. These are the lies that bind Trump to his predecessors. These are the permanent lies of the ruling elite of this country.\n\nDJT: We have secured record funding for our military, $700 billion this year and $716 billion next year. Our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before.\n\nJS: This is a horrifying declaration. It's an abomination. It's an abomination that it's true. But is it because of the dangerous, deviousness of Trump? Did Donald Trump undemocratically seize public monies to build his unaccountable war machine? Let's look at the vote tally on this whopping military bill: More than 2/3 of House Democrats voted for it and 85% of Democrats in the Senate voted to give Trump this massive military budget. And to drive home the passion for militarism and empire, this bill was ceremoniously titled the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act. How is this justifiable to these Democrats who tell us every day about the unique danger that Donald Trump poses? The same could be asked of all those powerful Democrats who voted to give Trump widespread surveillance powers and capabilities. Now what they'll tell you is: The military needs it; that we're supporting the troops; the CIA and NSA, they need it - they are keeping the homeland safe. You know what, that's bullshit. This is all about the politics of empire, imperialism, and in some ways crowd control.\n\nHere we have yet another example - Trump bragging about pulling out of the UN human rights council because he was enraged that nations actually voted to condemn Israel or that they refuse to be a mouthpiece for Washington.\n\nDJT: So the United States took the only responsible course, we withdrew from the human rights council and we will not return until real reform is enacted. For similar reasons, the United States will provide no support and recognition to the International Criminal Court. As far as America is concerned the ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy, and no authority. The ICC claims near-universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country, violating all principles of justice, fairness, and due process. We will never surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable global bureaucracy. America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.\n\nJS: All of this sounds like crazy, unhinged nationalism, authoritarianism, laws for thee but not for me. And that is what it is. Trump is brazenly attacking the notion that international law applies to the United States. But this wasn't Trump's idea and it wasn't John Bolton's idea. This was a bipartisan position going back decades. In fact, in 2002, when the U.S. Senate voted on a bill that would authorize the U.S. military to invade the Netherlands if any U.S. personnel were arrested on war crimes charges, it passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. As we said in an earlier episode of this show, it was known as the Hague Invasion Act. You know who voted for it? Joe Biden did. Hillary Clinton did. Chuck Schumer did. Dianne Feinstein did.\n\nIn fact, 44 Democratic senators voted for a bill that would literally authorize the U.S. military to invade another NATO country to stop a war crimes prosecution of U.S. personnel. Yes, Trump's declaration about international law is disgusting, but let's be honest: In that vote, just 26 Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in voting yes. And the Democrats controlled the Senate at the time. And this was a bill sponsored by lifelong racist and bigot, Senator Jesse Helms. And the Democrats supported it. This isn't Donald Trump extremism. This is the politics of empire and so-called American exceptionalism.\n\nI am deeply concerned that we are really losing our minds in this country with so many people falling victim to this notion that the U.S. was somehow this bastion of justice, and freedom, and democracy in the world until the orange-hued monster took power. It's just not true. And when the dust settles on this moment in history, this narrative is going to ricochet into the future. Trump's presidency will be like a ship that, if sunk, would place all the blame for the rot of this empire onboard with it. We say a lot on this show that history matters, context matters, facts matter. And they do. But it does a disservice to those who believe in justice, and truth, and peace to pretend like Trump is somehow a great anathema. In some ways, he is. But not when it comes to the politics of empire. It's important that we work hard to make those distinctions, no matter how widespread and group-thinky the flashy story is about Trump ruining America's greatness. If we want to change this country, confront its injustices, we have to always return to history and context to understand how we got here.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: Today on the show, we have a special guest for an extended conversation on a wide range of issues, from the war in Afghanistan to North Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the election, big tech companies and the role they play in our lives, propaganda, and beyond. Our guest is the legendary American dissident and scholar, Noam Chomsky. I'm sure that pretty much every single one of our listeners is familiar with Chomsky, but you will almost never see him on major TV networks in the United States. Globally, yes. Chomsky is on TV all the time around the world. But here in his home country, nope. And if I am not mistaken, he has never been on NBC, ABC, CBS, or Fox. He did a few interviews over the years on PBS, on the Charlie Rose show. And I believe he was on CNN for a couple of minutes once. Such is the fate of dissidents in the home of the brave. Here is one of the few times that Noam Chomsky was actually allowed on U.S. TV. It was way back on April 3, 1969, where Chomsky debated the famed conservative William F. Buckley. The show was broadcast under the title \"Vietnam and the Intellectuals,\" and it was part of Buckley's show, \"Firing Line.\"\n\nNoam Chomsky (1969): What seems to me a very, in a sense, terrifying aspect of our society and other societies is the equanimity and the detachment with which sane, reasonable, sensible people can observe such events. I think that's more terrifying than the occasional Hitler, or LeMay, or other that crops up. These people would not be able to operate were it not for the this apathy and equanimity and; therefore, I think that it's in some sense the sane, and reasonable, and tolerant people who should share a very serious burden of guilt that they very easily throw on the shoulders of others who seem more extreme and more violent.\n\nWilliam F. Buckley: Oh, I agree but, but -\n\nJS: Noam Chomsky is one of the most popular and influential political thinkers in the world, yet in the United States you will only find him on independent, alternative media outlets. Look at all of the pundits and well, criminals who are constantly on TV today. The people with long public career in mass killing or mass lying. This is part of the problem. It's a big part of the problem in this country. How different would this country be, would the world be, if Noam Chomsky and other principled dissidents were regularly featured on major news broadcasts?\n\nChomsky is currently a laureate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. He is professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for more than half a century. Chomsky's recent books include, \"Global Discontents: Conversations on the Rising Threats to Democracy\" and \"Requiem for the American Dream: The 10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth & Power.\" He is also the co-author, with the late Ed Herman, of the classic book, \"Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media.\n\nJS: Noam Chomsky, welcome Intercepted.\n\nNC: Very glad to be with you.\n\nJS: If you watch, and I know you are not a fan of television news, but if you watch particularly MSNBC or CNN right now or you read the major newspapers in the United States, you can come away with the impression that Donald Trump and his administration, his presidency, represent this grand departure from the way things are done in the United States historically.\n\nHow much of a departure is the Trump presidency from the bipartisan Washington empire consensus - the way that the U.S. has been governed throughout its history?\n\nNC: There are some differences and many continuities. On the domestic scene, Trump is, very effectively, managing both of his constituencies.\n\nThere's an authentic constituency of corporate power and private wealth and they're being served magnificently by the executive orders, legislative programs that are being pushed through which represent the more savage wing of the traditional Republican policies - catering to private interests, private wealth, and dismissing the rest as irrelevant and easily disposed of.\n\nAt the same time, he's managing to maintain the voting constituency by pretending, very effectively, to be the one person in the world who stands up for them against the hated elites. And this is quite an impressive con job. How long he can carry it off? I don't know. On the international scene, it's actually more interesting.\n\nHe's being lambasted for taking positions which, in my view, are pretty reasonable. So, for example, in the case of Korea: The two Koreas, last April 27th came out with a historic declaration, in which they laid out fairly explicit plans for moving towards reconciliation, integration, and denuclearization of the peninsula.\n\nNewscaster: Kim Jong-un made history today becoming the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War began in 1950. He promised a new beginning as he met with South Korea's Moon Jae-in in the demilitarized zone between the two countries. The meeting marks the first summit between the Koreas in more than a decade.\n\nNC: They pretty much pleaded with outsiders, that means the United States to permit them to proceed, as they put it, on their own accord. And so far Trump has not interfered with this very much, calling off temporarily at least the military exercises, which has he correctly said are highly provocative. He's been lambasted for that, but it's exactly the right position I think. Right now, the president Moon is in North Korea if they can make positive moves on their own accord as they've requested that should be beneficial.\n\nIn the case of Russia, it's more complexes. His policies have, in fact, been two-fold his administration has continued the policies of building up military forces on the Russian border, carrying out military maneuvers, increasing the tensions in extremely dangerous parts of the world.\n\nOn the other hand, he has also taken somewhat conciliatory steps towards reducing tensions. And for that again, he's been lambasted. Though, I think it's the right thing to do. On other issue matters, he's torn up important international agreements, the most significant was the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\nDJT: I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S. nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime. We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction.\n\nNC: That's in isolation from the entire world, in this case. And that's very serious and the most serious of all, by far overshadowing everything else, is his pulling out of the Paris negotiations.\n\nDJT: The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. Leaving American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production. Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.\n\nNC: Leaves the United States as the only country in the world which is refusing officially to take even small steps towards dealing with the true existential crisis, and that's combined with the domestic programs of rapidly increasing the use of the most dangerous fossil fuels, cutting back regulations on economy for automobiles, eliminating safety protections for workers, and so on. All of that is just a race to disaster and that's by far the most serious of the initiatives to undermine what's loosely called the international order.\n\nRaising questions about NATO, for example, is quite a reasonable thing to do. One might certainly ask why NATO even exists after the collapse of the Soviet Union - not that there weren't questioned before, there were - but the official story was that NATO was in place to defend the West against the Russian hordes, which, putting aside the validity of that claim, that was the official stand\n\nNewsreel: The Russian cynical blockade of Berlin had brought Europe to the brink of War. It was at last clear that only a strong alliance could deter them from further adventures. On 4, April 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed by Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Canada, and the United States. This union of 12 Nations became known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or more simply: NATO.\n\nNC: After the Soviet Union collapsed, a fair question arose as to why NATO should survive. And what it did was, in fact, expand. Expanded all the way to the Russian border, initially under the first Bush, then extensively under Clinton, then by 2008 even offering to have Ukraine join NATO, that's an attack on Russian geostrategic interests that no Russian leader could easily accept. All of this increases threats, tensions quite unnecessarily, at the same time NATO changed its official mission to say what they call \"safeguard control\" of the international energy system, pipelines, and sea lanes, and though it's unmentioned to serve as essentially an intervention force for the United States. We have a good indication of how the world saw that international order. The Gallup polling agency takes international polls of international opinion every year - in 2013, for the first time, they asked an interesting question.\n\nThey asked the question, which country is the greatest threat to World Peace. The United States was in first place. No other country was even close - far behind in second place was Pakistan that was doubtless inflated by the Indian vote. The countries that are called the greatest threat to World Peace here the United States like Iran were barely even mentioned. Interestingly, Gallop never asked that polling question again, and it was - the answer was not reported in the mainstream press.\n\nJS: You bring up the issue of NATO and, of course, right now in the United States when Vladimir Putin is discussed, there is a lot of resurrection of, kind of, Cold War imagery. There are books being published with backward \"Rs\" on them, which isn't even in Cyrillic, it's not even actually the letter \"R,\" but there's this sort of portrayal of Putin as, sort of, the Bolsheviks rising and this idea that Russia is seeking to take over the United States, and Russia is responsible for Donald Trump being president because they quote-unquote hacked our election. What is true and what is hyperbole/propaganda/exaggeration about Russia and Putin, specifically, taking into account the U.S. posture toward Ukraine, NATO, but also the issue of electoral interference?\n\nNC: What is true is that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990,1991, there was a period under Yeltsin in which the United States pretty much dominated what was happening in Russia and the region around Russia. NATO was expanded. The Russian economy totally collapsed under the imposed harsh market reforms. There was a radical collapse of the economy, sharp increase in the mortality rate. Russia was really devastated. When Putin came in--he's not a nice guy. I would not like to have dinner with him, but you can understand his policies. His policies were to try to restore some role for Russia at least in its own region of the world, which we might recall happened to be the traditional invasion routes through which Russia was attacked virtually destroyed several times in the last century.\n\nSo, this is not a small question. And yes, Putin is trying to restore some degree of Russian power in the world, some degree of Russian authority. One extension of that and, in fact, the only one is the Russian position in Syria. All of this encroaches on the global domination of the United States and secondarily, its allies, which is, kind of, taken to be the norm. The norm is, \"we rule everything,\" and if someone else tries to control their own area that's disruptive of the international system. Which, from a certain point of view, it is.\n\nIf you take a look at Russian power as compared with the United States, it's derisory. Just one indication: Trump's increase in defense budget practically reaches the entire Russian military budget. So, the idea of Russia taking over the world is ludicrous. What it means is that they are trying, often in ways that merit condemnation, but nevertheless, trying to restore some degree of Russian influence in the region surrounding Russia plus Syria, their one Mediterranean base. And to try to establish a place for Russia in the world system, far weaker than the United States, weaker than China. In fact, one of Russia's International problems is to keep from being overwhelmed by Chinese power. That's the kind of disruption of the international order that is attributed to Russia.\n\nJS: You raise this issue of Russia in Syria. Of course, the United States, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, the list of countries involved actively in the just generically, let's call it the Syrian War, right now. You do have a debate on the left in the United States about what a just position looks like toward the conflict in Syria. And, of course, you have isolationists, or Libertarians, or anti-imperialists who take the position of, \"There should be total hands-off Syria that this is a civil war.\" I think the honest among us would say that of course, Bashar al-Assad is a war criminal. He is a mass murderer, but he is in a conflict with a lot of mass murderers and a lot of war criminals.\n\nWhat Noam Chomsky do you believe is a just position to take on the war in Syria? Is it that people should defend Bashar al-Assad with the idea that it's the least bad option, or that this is a matter that should be handled by the Syrians, or is there any international involvement that you think makes any sense, or could be justified under both moral principles and legal principles?\n\nNC: Well, the first point to bear in mind, which you already mentioned is that Assad is a horrible war criminal. The bulk of the atrocities, which are enormous, are his responsibility. There's no justifying Assad. On the other hand, the fact of the matter is that he is essentially pretty much in control of Syria now, thanks largely to Russian partially Iranian support.\n\nThe Russians actually entered Syria extensively after the CIA had provided the rebel forces, which are mostly run by jihadi elements, provided them with advanced antitank missiles which were stymieing the Syrian Army at which point the Russians came in with air power and overwhelmed the opposition. The current situation is that Assad has pretty much won the war. Like it or not. There was in the early stages a Democratic secular, quite respectable opposition, but they were very quickly overwhelmed by the jihadi elements, supported from the outside - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United States, and others. There's a pending humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, the province where the jihadis have been - the place to which they've been expelled or fled. If there's a Syrian Russian attack on that it could be a total humanitarian catastrophe. There is some indication that the Russians and the Turks may have been provided a safe area to which maybe some civilians can flee but that looks like a monstrosity developing. If there's a way of countering that attack, it should be pursued by diplomatic means.\n\nThe other crucial question is the status of the Kurdish areas - Rojava. In my opinion, it makes sense for the United States to maintain a presence which would deter an attack on the Kurdish areas. They have the one part of Syria which is succeeded in sustaining a functioning society with many decent elements. And the idea that they should be subjected to an attack by their bitter enemies the Turks, or by the murderous Assad regime I think is anything should be done to try to prevent that.\n\nJS: Let me ask you about that point because you are one of the leading people in the world that is consistently reminding the world that the United States has always adopted a posture of certain Kurds are good Kurds certain Kurds are bad Kurds and the United States has poured money and weapons into the coffers of for instance the Turkish military explicitly to be used for an ongoing attempt at genocide against the Kurds. So, I'm curious how you reconcile that with a position that the United States would, in essence, be the protector of the Kurds in the context of the Syrian War.\n\nNC: The United States, like other great powers, does not pursue humanitarian objectives. It pursues objectives determined by power considerations, and they lead to different positions with regard to the Kurds or others at different times.\n\nSo, for example, in the 1970s there was a time when the United States supported Kurds against Saddam Hussein. Shortly after a deal was made in which they sacrificed the Kurds to Saddam Hussein. That led to Henry Kissinger's famous comment that we shouldn't confuse foreign policy with missionary activity.\n\nIt's entirely true that especially in the 1990s Clinton was pouring arms into Turkey for the purpose of carrying out massive, murderous, destructive attacks against the Kurdish population of Turkey in the Southeast - enormously destructive. That does not change the fact that now the United States could, with a relatively small presence, deter attacks against the Kurds in Syria, which could destroy the one part of Syria that is actually functioning at a decent fashion. We don't expect consistency in humanitarian terms from a great power because those are not the guiding principles.\n\nJS: Regarding Afghanistan, were now 17 plus years in Afghanistan in the context of 9/11, shouldn't we be talking about Afghanistan as A, Obviously a war that the United States should have never started, and secondarily, that the United States has actually been militarily and politically defeated in Afghanistan?\n\nNC: Well my own view as you may recall back at the time was that the use of military force in Afghanistan was inappropriate and illegitimate. There were diplomatic options - they could have been pursued but the United States wanted to use force. I think the perhaps the most accurate description of what the United States did was by Abdul Haq - one of the most respected and honored of the Afghan anti-Taliban activists who in fact was killed in Afghanistan - who strongly opposed the U.S. bombing as most of the Afghan dissidents did, and argued that the United States was bombing just because it wanted to show its muscle and intimidate everyone else and it was undermining the efforts of the anti-Taliban Afghan resistance to solve the problem on their own.\n\nNewscaster: Working their way through the rush hour that morning two men were about to offer the U.S. government the chance to topple the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, to expel Al-Qaeda from its terrorist bases, and to capture Osama bin Laden. This plan had been put together by Abdul Haq one of Afghanistan's most respected leaders and was the culmination of Haq's lifetime struggle to save his country.\n\nNC: I think his analysis was correct. We've now gone through 17 years of failed attempts to impose a U.S. dominated system. There is an Afghan peace movement. It's not enormous, but it's significant. It's been there for several years. We should be doing what we can to support it, to lead them to find a solution internal to Afghanistan, reconciling to the extent possible the conflicting warring factions, there ethnically divided, divided in other terms.\n\nIt's an extraordinary problem. The most we can do is to try to facilitate efforts among the Afghans. I don't think there's much that the United States can hope to do beyond that, and the idea of imposing a military solution looks out of the question.\n\nJS: Do you believe it's accurate to say that the United States has been militarily defeated in Afghanistan?\n\nNC: Well, certainly it has not achieved any of its objectives after a huge expenditure. So, give it whatever name you like. I mean, a great power like the United States never really gets defeated. It may not achieve its maximal objectives.\n\nSo, for example, let's take Vietnam. It's almost universally described as a U.S. defeat. But if you look back at the original planning this goes back to the early 50s, for why the United States became involved in Vietnam turns out it wasn't a complete defeat. The U.S. did not achieve its maximal objectives of turning Vietnam into something like the Philippines, but it did achieve its major objective of preventing an independent South Vietnam from becoming a model that might be followed by others towards a successful independent development. Perhaps eroding the whole Southeast Asia East Asia order, which is what the planners were concerned with in the early 1950s. And that was in fact stopped. Power like the United States is unlikely to face anything like a real defeat, a failure perhaps.\n\nJS: I wanted to also make sure to ask you about this ongoing slaughter in Yemen. Recently CNN and some of the other networks have started showing images of U.S. missile parts from munitions that for instance killed an entire bus full of school children recently.\n\nNewscaster: This video of shrapnel was filmed in the aftermath of the attack and sent to CNN by a contact and saddle a cameraman working for CNN subsequently filmed these images for us. Munitions experts tell CNN this was a U.S. made Mark MK 82 bomb weighing in at 500 pounds. The first five digits there are the cage number, the commercial and government entity number. This number here denotes Lockheed Martin one of the top U.S. defense contractors.\n\nJS: But there was a dearth of that kind of reporting when Obama was waging what started as a secret deniable bombing campaign. He kicked it off in December of 2009 with a cluster bomb attack that killed three dozen women and children in the village of al-Majala in Yemen. And then regularly was hitting Yemen with drone strikes, but it also is often portrayed as kind of Trump supporting the Saudis, when in reality the U.S. first bombed Yemen in November of 2002. This has been going on for a quite a long time. What is the U.S. motivation for this mass slaughter in Yemen right now that is primarily being carried out by Saudi war planes that were given to the Saudis by the United States? And, of course, the U.S. is doing all the intelligence assistance, the refueling and the providing of munitions. But what is the U.S. agenda in Yemen as you can see?\n\nNC: The U.S., and you're quite right in tracing this back to Obama, in fact, even earlier. The United States wants to ensure that Yemen will be incorporated within the system of reactionary Arab states that the U.S. dominates and largely controls that's Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, which is a quite a significant military power by the standards of the region and quite vicious and brutal. The Houthi presumably get some degree of Iranian support. To regard that as the Iran as the major threat in the region is ridiculous. The U.S. and secondarily Britain have been arming and developing, supporting the military forces and actions of Saudi Arabia and the UAE with the consequences that you describe. It's becoming one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world, the attack on the port, the Hodeida port\n\nNewscaster: Coalition forces are closing in and the fighting around the airport has blocked a key exit out of the city making it harder to transport much-needed food aid from Hodeida, the country's largest port, to the rest of the country. 8.4 million Yemenis are already at risk of starvation. The war has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nNC: We can trace this back much farther if you like. So back in the early 1960s, there was a there was a war - a proxy war - going on in Yemen between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. At that point, Egypt was the center of secular Arab nationalism under Nasser and regarded as the main enemy by the United States. Saudi Arabia was the center of radical Islam and very much like the British before us, the United States tended systematically to support radical Islamism against secular nationalism. That war was raging right through the 60s. It was a significant war. Israel settled that problem for the United States and Saudi Arabia by smashing secular Arab nationalism in 1967. And that, in fact, is the major turning point in U.S. Israeli relations. Israel performed a great service to the United States and its Saudi Arabian ally and the radical Islamism that centered there by eliminating the secular nationalist alternative. And since then U.S. relations with Israel have been kind of unique, even historically but certainly in the modern world. And this is now another continuation of it with different cast of characters slightly. But Yemen has been regarded as it's the poorest of Arab states the most miserable in many ways, torn by all sorts of internal conflicts. And the U.S. continues to be committed to trying to ensure that its close allies, the radical Islamist states - Saudi Arabia, UAE - maintain control against any adversary. Egypt at that time, Iran, which is a very minor participant in fact, not like Egypt which had a major army there, very minor participant in this case.\n\nJS: I'm sure that you paid attention to the reporting around national security adviser John Bolton's speech at the Federalist Society in which he launched this blistering attack on the international criminal court, the ICC.\n\nAnd, of course, John Bolton has always been against international law and its application to the United States. But Bolton did point something out in that speech that I think is important for people to understand and it's accurate. Bolton described how in 2002 the U.S. Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, passed legislation that was known in human rights circles as the Hague Invasion Act.\n\nJohn Bolton: This law which enjoyed broad bipartisan support authorizes the president to use all means necessary and appropriate, including force, to shield our service members and the armed forces of our allies from ICC prosecution. It also prohibits several forms of cooperation between the United States and the court.\n\nJS: And such radical right-wingers as Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden, and many powerful Democratic senators, they actually voted for that legislation. And yet when Bolton does his attack on the ICC. It was portrayed as \"Oh, my God, look at how these Trump people are so outside of the norm.\" But the reality, isn't it true, is that this has been the bipartisan power consensus from the very beginning? That no international law should actually apply to the United States and both Republicans and Democrats including the Democrat's nominee in 2016 believe that the United States would have a right to militarily intervene to prevent a war crimes prosecution of any of its personnel.\n\nNC: You're absolutely correct. In Europe, as you say, it's called the Netherlands Invasion Act - authorizes the president to use military force as they put it to rescue any American who might be brought to trial anywhere. So you're quite correct. It's unfair to blame this position on Trump and Bolton it goes way back and it goes much farther back than that.\n\nSo, for example, let's go back to 1984, the United States in 1984 was, by the World Court, was ordered to terminate what was called unlawful use of force, which means international terrorism against the state of Nicaragua and to pay very substantial reparations.\n\nNewscaster: Docking the world court on the questioned drew barbs too on the house floor.\n\nHouse: Mr. Speaker many of us have known for some time that the Reagan Administration Central America policies couldn't stand the light of day but now the administration is admitting as much by refusing to accept the jurisdiction of the international court of justice over the CIA's mining of Nicaraguan ports, the Administration has demonstrated that it knows that its policies can't withstand an inquiry by an impartial objective international body.\n\nNC: The U.S. rejected the authorization of the world court and did so with the strong support of liberal America. So, the New York Times, for example, had an editorial condemning the court as what it called a hostel forum and therefore illegitimate.\n\nIt was a hostile forum because it condemned the United States. Three years earlier, the New York Times had lauded the World Court as a marvelous forum because it supported the United States in a claim against Iran, but now it was a hostile forum and therefore illegitimate. So, the U.S. had no need to pay any attention to its orders.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. even went so far as to veto a Security Council resolution basically calling on states to observe international law - didn't mention the United States but was obvious with the intent was. All of this with the support of liberal opinion across the board. Now at that time, the United States was not alone in defying the World Court.\n\nI think, Libya and Albania had also rejected World Court decisions, but they later accepted them. So, the United States is far as I'm aware, is now in splendid isolation and having rejected decision to the world court that's entirely consistent with the 2002 legislation authorizing the executive to use military force to block any act against Americans by the International Criminal Court, if that's even conceivable.\n\nJS: Well just parenthetically and I don't want to get into this but I do think it's worth just mentioning it: that when victims of the U.S. torture program - the so-called extraordinary rendition program, or people that were taken to Guantanamo or to black sites - filed lawsuits in the United States against Donald Rumsfeld, President George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, or other officials for the torture that they endured, or the kidnapping that they endured, the justice department intervened in those cases using something called the Westfall Act, which actually has to do with U.S. labor law, and even Attorney General Eric Holder under Obama filed briefs in these lawsuits against Bush-era accused war criminals saying that even if they had committed genocide, that it was within the official scope of their duties. And therefore, they were removed as defendants in those cases and replaced by the U.S. government which has sovereign immunity and, therefore they were dismissed.\n\nSo, it's not just on a level of international war or conflict. It's also on an individual level with U.S. officials, the position of the justice department, including under Obama was that even if Donald Rumsfeld was involved with genocide, it would have been within the official scope of his duties and therefore he cannot be held individually responsible for it.\n\nNC: Yeah, that's a kind of a counterpart to the fact that the U.S. did add a reservation to the genocide convention when it signed it, finally, saying we're immune. Incidentally, on the torture program, there's more to be said. There's good studies of this by Alfred McCoy - outstanding historian who did some of the major work, among other things, on the history of torture -\n\nJS: He's a great friend of this show, and has been on several times. He also was my professor when I was briefly an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin.\n\nNC: OK, so I don't have to laud him to you. Done excellent work.\n\nBut, on torture, he pointed out that when the United States signed the international torture convention, I think it was 1984 or so, the Senate rewrote the convention to exclude the modes of torture that were carried out by the CIA, and that was then instituted into law under Clinton. So you could argue that much of the torture carried out under the Bush Administration was actually not in violation of U.S. law as McCoy also points out, the significant difference between the Guantanamo/Bagram/Abu Ghraib torture and earlier periods, was that in earlier periods, the U.S. supervised the torture and trained the torturers in Latin America, Southeast Asia, but for this time, the U.S. personnel were actually involved, directly, in the torture instead of supervising it, and training the torturers. So that's a slight change but from a moral point of view, not a very significant one.\n\nJS: I do want to make sure to get your sense of what's happening right now regarding the United States and Venezuela. Of course, you had Nicolas Maduro supposedly surviving a drone strike. Also, these generals, mutinous generals it appears meeting with the Trump Administration to plot a coup, coordinate? It's unclear exactly what's happening, but it does seem as though the United States is trying to, once again, foment either a coup or a removal of Nicolas Maduro, Hugo Chavez's successor.\n\nNC: My sense of this is that the United States would support a coup, but not that it's really trying to instigate it. After all, in the year 2002, there was a military coup in Venezuela, which briefly overthrew the government eliminated Parliament, Supreme Court, it was reversed by a popular uprising. But during the time of the coup, the United States openly and quite publicly supported the military coup as did the liberal press. There was a time back in the 1960s, 1970s when the U.S. was, in fact, in a position to implement, and strongly support military coups right throughout the continent this traces back to the decision by John F Kennedy in 1962 to change the mission of the Latin American military from what was called \"hemispheric defense\" - that was a holdover from World War II anachronistic - from \"hemispheric defense\" to \"internal security.\" And in the Latin American context \"internal security\" means war by the military and paramilitaries against the civilian population.\n\nNow in 1962 the U.S. was in a position to change, to shift, the mission of the Latin American military and, in fact, essentially to prepare what became the first major military coup, 1964 in Brazil, then others, one country after another - Chile, Uruguay, finally Argentina, the worst of them, strongly supported by Kissinger and Reagan than onto Central America - but the U.S. just doesn't have that power anymore.\n\nOne thing that's happened in recent years is that Latin America has, to a certain extent, extricated itself from imperial, meaning recently U.S. control, this shows in many ways like largely expelling the IMF which for Latin America is a branch of the Treasury Department, eliminating the formal U.S. military bases.\n\nSo, the U.S. is doubtless involved and it will continue to support the traditional policies, but not with the degree of power it once had. In the case of Venezuela, if there were to be a military coup, I don't doubt that the U.S. would support it may be the with some clicking of tongues about how it's not a nice thing but short of that I think the U.S. Is likely to continue with subversion and sabotage and support for the right-wing elements. On the other hand, it should be pointed out that Venezuela is a major disaster at this point. Partly for external reasons, but considerably for internal reasons.\n\nJS: This year's 30 years since you and the great late Ed Herman published \"Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,\" and I wanted to get your thoughts on the role that huge social media companies play in our society, given that they are replacing a lot of news organizations, or the way that people - changing the way people consume information Google, Facebook, Twitter, ttc. There's a lot of talk about this there's hearings on Capitol Hill. There's a lot of pleading with the billionaires to kick certain people off of social media, remove their accounts.\n\nWhat about the way that these entities the - Facebook's, Google's, Twitter's of the world have changed us as people, and our society, and the way we process, disseminate, absorb information?\n\nNC: Well your words process, and disseminate and absorb are correct. But not produce. The source of information remains the major media, the correspondence on the ground - who often do excellent and courageous and very valuable work. Facebook and the rest may filter information that they get from those sources and present it in ways which much of the public finds it is easier to digest. I don't think that's a healthy development, but it is happening. And that means essentially, dividing much of the population of much discussion of this into cocoons, into bubbles, into which they receive the information conducive to their own interests and commitments.\n\nIf you read a major newspaper say the New York Times you get a certain range of opinion. It's narrow. It's basically centrist to far right, but at least it's a range of opinion. Those who are more addicted to social media tend to turn directly to what supports their own views not to hear other things, that's not a good thing. Google Facebook and the rest, those are commercial institutions. Their constituency is basically advertisers and they would like to establish the kinds of controls over their consumers that will be beneficial to their business model that enabled them to get advertising. That has very serious distorting effects. And we know that they provide massive information to the corporate system, which they use in their own efforts to try to shape and control behavior and opinion. All of this is a dangerous development that the power of these private corporations to direct people, in particular, directions and so on, that's a serious problem which requires considerable thought and attention.\n\nJS: In all of the decades of debating these issues, and campaigning for human rights, and against U.S. wars: Have things changed? And is it worth it to spend a lifetime doing what you've done? For young people that are listening.\n\nNC: I think if we look over the years, we can see that there have been considerable achievements in changing public attitudes with regard to aggression, human rights, civil rights, and so on. I don't take credit for that - plenty of people are involved, plenty of activists, many of them young but the changes are very significant.\n\nLet's go back to the 1960s. In the 1960s the Kennedy escalated the war in 1961 and 62. Now that's when Kennedy authorized the U.S. Air Force to begin directly bombing rural South Vietnam, authorized Napalm, chemical warfare to destroy crops and livestock, organized mass programs to drive much of the peasantry into what amounted to concentration camps, strategic hamlets, huge escalation. What was the public reaction? Zero.\n\nI, at the time, if I wanted to give a talk about it, I'd talk in somebody's living room, or something like that. That was no protest. In fact, for years, it was difficult, or even impossible, to have public meetings. In Boston, which is a liberal city, public meetings were violently broken up with the support of the press, churches were attacked, and so on.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't until about 1967 that a large-scale opposition to the war developed, and by that time South Vietnam had been practically destroyed and the war had expanded the rest of Indochina. Well, finally there was a public reaction.\n\n[Protest chants.]\n\nNC: In, 198, the Reagan Administration came in and attempted to duplicate what Kennedy had done in the early 60s. Almost step by step. They intended to essentially invade Central America, white paper, blaming the international communists, huge propaganda campaign, and so on. It was almost instantly aborted by popular opposition.\n\nThere was such massive popular opposition from popular groups, from the churches, and others, that they had to back off. What happened was awful enough, but it wasn't Vietnam. They had to turn to bringing in other states like Taiwan, Israel, the Argentine neo-Nazis to try to carry out the atrocities. U.S. couldn't do it directly. That's very significant.\n\nLet's go on to 2003 when the U.S. invaded Iraq. The worst crime of this century. That's the first war in the history of imperialism in which the war was massively protested before it was officially launched. That's never happened before.\n\nProtest chants: No war! No war!\n\nNC: Now, it's commonly said that the opposition failed, but I don't agree.\n\nThat restricted the kinds of military actions that the U.S. was able to carry out. Again horrible enough, but nothing like Vietnam. Well, all of these are indications of - and there are many others - of shifts of popular attitudes towards aggression, intervention, human rights violations, and so on, which make a difference. They haven't gone far enough, but there's a considerable improvement.\n\nJS: Well, Noam Chomsky. Thank you very much for being so generous with your time. We really appreciate you being with us on Intercepted.\n\nNC: Good. Glad to be with you.\n\nJS: Noam Chomsky is one of the leading dissidents in the United States. He is currently a laureate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: There is a fierce battle underway for a U.S. Senate seat, in Texas between the incumbent and Zodiac Killer, Ted Cruz, [laughs] major right-winger tea party figure, and Beto O'Rourke who is a member of Congress that's been getting a lot of attention now. And they recently held a debate where Ted Cruz actually blasted Beto O'Rourke for calling for justice in the case of an African-American man who was killed in his own home by a Dallas police officer.\n\nTed Cruz: Now the officer, as I understand it, has contended that it was a tragic mistake. It was a case where she thought she was in her own apartment. She thought he was an intruder. right now today, I don't know what happened that evening. Congressman O'Rourke doesn't know what happened that evening, but he immediately called for firing the officer. I think that's a mistake. Look we have a criminal justice system, a criminal justice system that will determine what happened that night.\n\nJS: Cruz then followed up that ridiculous despicable attack on Beto O'Rourke's position by tweeting a video of Beto O'Rourke addressing a black church. And well, here's what better O'Rourke had to say there.\n\nBeto O'Rourke: How can it be, in this day and age, in this very year, in this community.\n\nThat a young man, African-American, in his own apartment, is shot and killed by a police officer? And when we all want justice, and the fact, and the information to make an informed decision - what is released to the public? That he had a small amount of marijuana in his kitchen. How can that be just in this country?\n\nHow can we continue to lose the lives of unarmed black men in the United States of America at the hands of white police officers?\n\nJS: What Beto O'Rourke just said there, I think most normal, sane people in this country would agree with. But somehow Ted Cruz put this out there thinking, \"Oh, this is an attack. This is a hit on Beto O'Rourke.\" And you know, the sad thing is that for the very kinds of people that Ted Cruz is targeting, the kinds of people that support Trump's political agenda and Cruz's political agenda: It probably will work.\n\nThe fact that Beto O'Rourke was in a black church, the fact that he was saying this about the killing of unarmed African Americans including in their own home, the calls for accountability for police officers who engage in this kind of conduct. And in, Texas, 67 people have been shot and killed by police officers this year alone. That is according to data collected by the Washington Post. Now add to that number one more person: Botham Shem Jean, an unarmed black man who, as I said, was killed in his own apartment by off-duty Dallas police officer Amber Guyger.\n\nGuyger claims that she mistook Jean's apartment for her own, and she fired her gun at him after he did not follow her commands - mind you, Jean was in his own apartment, sitting on his own couch, watching football on his own TV. Guyger does live in the same apartment complex - one floor below - but whatever the actual story is, it's a common one in Dallas and across this country: Police brutality, police killing against men and women of color is an everyday possibility, whether you're walking while black, driving while black - and now it seems - even sitting in your own home while black.\n\nAs these crimes become more visible, more and more people are using their platforms to speak out. Bobby Sessions, an up and coming Hip Hop artist from Dallas, TX, is one of them. His latest record, \"Revolution: The Divided States of AmeriKKKa,\" is a ruthless examination of the reality of police violence and racial inequality in this country.\n\nBut not only has Bobby Sessions put his convictions on the mic, but he's done the work in real life, too. He recently participating with the organization, A Million Hoodies at Tuskegee University where he worked with Samira Rice - the mother of Tamir Rice - and others to help find solutions to the injustices facing communities of color. Here is Bobby Sessions.\n\nBobby Sessions: I'm Bobby Sessions, the legend from Dallas, Texas. I'm an artist signed to High Standardz and Def Jam records.\n\n[\"Politics\" by Bobby Sessions]\n\nPleasant Grove is in Southeast Dallas and in an area called Buckner Terrace, an all black neighborhood. It was home. That was my start for 12 years. And then we moved to a suburb in Dallas County. My parents saw that the school district that I was in wasn't providing the best education possible for me and my little brother, so they worked really hard and got us to Rowlett. And it was traumatic, honestly, because of the culture shock, a predominantly white neighborhood on like on a golf course in there's nobody that looks like me or understands my culture. The first rappers I remember hearing was Tupac and Will Smith - the oddest first impressions ever.\n\n[\"Holler If Ya' Hear Me\" by 2pac.]\n\nStart to study. Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube, and Biggie Smalls, and Eminem, and Jay-Z - and my love for hip-hop runs pretty deep.\n\n[\"Holler If Ya' Hear Me\" by 2pac.]\n\nI graduated from high school early and then I got admitted into the University of North Texas. At this time, I never had the self-image of a rapper. I used to freestyle my whole life and I would write. I was in like creative writing honors classes and stuff like that in high school, but I used to write more short stories and poetry. When I went to UNT, every Tuesday they had something called Poetic Justice and it was poets, rappers, singers, instrumentalists, they would stand in a huddle at this gazebo and display their talent.\n\nPoetic Justice: Imma ask ya'll one more time. What's the number one rule here at Poetic Justice? Respect the mic!\n\nBS: I go and recite some poetry. And the place went crazy. [Clapping.]\n\nAnd at the end, they would have a freestyle cipher and I'm watching the reaction at the guys are getting from wrapping in the cipher and I still have the competitive switch up and I felt like I was better than those guys, so I went home. I wrote a rap. I came back the next Tuesday, which was November 16, 2010, and I recited a rap and people went crazy and I knew that was gonna be my career from that day moving forward.\n\n[\"Politics\" by Bobby Sessions.]\n\nMy academics was good my first semester in college, but I knew that I had to pick one. I was going to be OK at music and OK at school for me. I felt like I had to pick one to be great at to master. And I knew that next semester I needed to drop out so I didn't go to none of my classes. I started recording about 30 minutes away from Denton in a city in Dallas called Garland, Texas and I just started pursuing the dream like, and I felt I was so good that I was gonna get a record deal right after dropping out of school.\n\nAnd I found out that life doesn't work that way. It was just a super rude awakening. So I started bouncing from like job to job. I rolled back into school at one point, I was a full-time student. I was doing music full-time and I was working two jobs, and I was just average at everything. And after doing that I finally got some stability as an adult, but I'm still not happy because moving boxes it's not what I'm was destined to do. I felt that in my being I'm supposed to rap and put words together.\n\nSo, December 31st, 2014. I left my 9 to 5 job with fifty dollars in my bank account to pursue music full-time again. And it worked out this time.\n\n[\"Black Neighborhood\" by Bobby Sessions.]\n\nJanuary 2nd two days later, the article came out from the local newspaper called the Dallas Observer and it said five Dallas rappers to watch for in 2015, and Mark Cuban retweeted it on Twitter, or whatever, and I was like, \"See this is a sign from the universe everything's gonna work out.\" And I was just riding, like, the energy of that and then I put out a song called \"Black America.\"\n\n[\"Black America\" by Bobby Sessions.]\n\n2014-2015 was a crazy year for us as a country watching police brutality on film. It's finally like documented. There's proof of it, people getting killed on Facebook live, like all these number of different things. My cousin had got killed by law enforcement back in 2012.\n\nI was working at Walmart at the time. I was on Twitter during a work break and I saw that it was a riot in South Dallas and that some guy got shot and killed by the police and I just saw like a lot of people talking about it, but I never saw the name or anything like that.\n\nAnd this was earlier in the day.\n\nNewscaster: Hundreds of protesters - they're taking to the streets. This after an officer shot and killed a suspect that was reportedly unarmed.\n\nBS: And then around eight o'clock at night, I got a text from my mom. I think she said like \"you free?\" Or something like that and I knew something bad had happened.\n\nSo I went into the bathroom and called her and she was like, \"it's some bad news\" and like I said started connecting the dots and then she told me that my cousin got killed and I was like in South Dallas? She was like, yeah, like was there a riot? She's like, yeah -\n\nNewscaster: According to police the victim James Harper was shot after leading police on a chase. The officer claims he was fearing for his life when he shot Harper dead, but the victim's families and hundreds of protesters aren't buying it.\n\nBS: That's the weirdest thing to find out on Twitter. You see things like this happen all the time on Twitter, on social media, on the news, but since it's not what your family, we've been, kind of, desensitized - like it's just an everyday thing. It's normal now.\n\nHe got killed in July 2012. The last time I saw him was Christmas the year before. He was at my parents' house and we're all eating and just having good family time, and then you find out that he's gone. And that the officer felt like he was reaching in his pocket for a weapon, and then after he's already dead, you go in his pockets and there's nothing there.\n\nIt was disturbing news, to say the least, and I feel like, again, I have a responsibility to keep his name alive because most of the time, when tragedies like this happen, there's nobody in the family that has a platform to speak out about it and it get heard. So, I wanted to make sure that I'm using my platform properly.\n\n[\"Like Me\" by Bobby Sessions.]\n\nIn the song \"like me\" I'm drawing a correlation between police brutality and slave patrol. Like the first cops in the South, we're literally slave Patrol, which is why black people get offended today when we go on the news and we see these stories reported as isolated incidents.\n\nThis has been consistent behavior for a long time.\n\n[\"Like Me\" by Bobby Sessions.]\n\nBS: I foresee it being a time where me, and people that look like me when we see a police officer. We feel safe and we feel protected like they're there to serve and protect. For most of us, it feels like they're here to controlling and harass and I think having uncomfortable conversations with each other holding each other accountable. And we need some justice for these murders. We can't go shoot and kill somebody and get away with it. And there's some code to protect us like it needs to work both sides the police officers that's your job and the people that are focused on serving and protecting the community those are the people that need to have those jobs and I'm willing to have those conversations with them and hear from them what better ways I can be to help them do their job, but we got to be honest about what's happening. We can't turn away from people getting murdered and think that because you have a difficult job that's okay. That's never okay, and it's been happening for too long and it needs to stop and I feel like our generation is going to make sure that it stops.\n\nJS: That was Bobby Sessions speaking to producer Jack D'Isidoro.

Gordon Parks\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Rudy Giuliani blamed the deaths of unarmed black men on teachers unions last week, he relied on the same logic that Rod Paige, former secretary of education, employed a decade ago when he labeled the National Education Association a \" terrorist organization .\" These arguments may seem laughable to many on the Left, but they emerge from ideological assumptions openly articulated by neoliberal education reformers.\n\nGiuliani argues the real problem communities of color face is not police militarization or brutality, but rather poverty and \"black-on-black\" crime, which requires a greater police presence, and results in the disproportionate arrests of blacks. The solution to poverty - and therefore crime? Education.\n\n\"Maybe all these left-wing politicians who want to blame police, maybe there's some blame here that has to go to the teachers union, for refusing to have schools where teachers are paid for performance, for fighting charter schools, for fighting vouchers so that we can drastically and dramatically improve education,\" says Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani's statement echoes the World Bank report \" Great Teachers ,\" which explains that while the current \"deceleration\" in the Latin American and Caribbean economies is due to external factors, like slower growth in China, we can't wait for capitalism to ameliorate poverty and its other terrible social consequences. Instead we have to turn to education so we can build \"human capital.\"\n\nTo do that, the reasoning goes, we must improve teacher quality, pay teachers for \"performance,\" and change who goes into teaching. The obstacle? Teachers unions. \"The deepest challenge in raising teacher quality is not fiscal or technical, but political, because teachers' unions in every country in Latin America are large and politically active stakeholders.\" Teachers unions are therefore the enemy of economic progress, and governments must persuade parents and the rest of civil society to turn against them.\n\nGiuliani was not the only pundit to link teachers unions and police brutality. One blogger even claimed that teachers unions cause as much brutality to minority youth as police. So let's be clear about how police and teachers differ.\n\nPolice, the courts, and the prison system make up the \"right hand of the state,\" as French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu put it . Education, public health, and social service workers personify the \"left hand of the state.\" While it can act as an instrument of social control, the \"left hand of the state\" has emancipatory potential. In contrast, the \"right hand of the state\" is repressive, containing no potentially untapped liberatory elements. We can't conflate the two, if we want to understand the state with any nuance.\n\nAdvocates of the education reform agenda being pushed by wealthy elites represent their project as the \" new civil rights movement .\" They have enlisted support from mainstream civil rights groups and perhaps most prominently Reverend Al Sharpton. In contrast we see an authentic civil rights movement mushrooming before our eyes. Young people have already been protesting deportations, school closings, and cuts to education funding, but now tens of thousands of youth, most of them black, are taking to the streets, often in acts of civil disobedience, to express their rage at the vicious slayings of unarmed black males.\n\nWe should assume that the powerful elites trying to dismantle public education and destroy teaching as a profession, globally, will use all of their resources to turn this authentic civil rights movement against unions. We see their strategy already in blog posts claiming, inaccurately, that unions and teachers are silent about racial justice.\n\nSocial justice teachers in local \" Teacher Activist Groups \" and organizations opposed to prison-like school conditions such as New York City's Teachers Unite have joined with parents and students to push back against racism in schools. Teachers unions have haltingly followed their lead.\n\nWhile I welcome American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten's press release condemning the killing of Michael Brown and her arrest in a subsequent demonstration, there's a legacy of mistrust between communities of color and teachers unions that is not going to be erased by the solitary acts of union officials or their public statements. And when officials do make such statements, they have to be clear about just what public education is up against.\n\nFor example, Weingarten responded to Giuliani's comment by asking in a tweet , \"Did #rudygiuliani really blame school teachers - not economics nor racism nor excessive force 4 #garner's death. Has he lost it?\" Yet in ascribing Giuliani's argument to craziness, Weingarten lost the opportunity to educate teachers and the public about the ideological battle being waged against teachers, their unions, and public education.\n\nHealing the breach between teachers unions and communities of color means first admitting there is one. That means teachers unions have to acknowledge the complicity of the education establishment in allowing segregated, unequal schooling.\n\nIt means finding ways to have constructive discussions with parents, students, and community activists who are angry and hurt about schools - and teachers - that seem not to value black kids.\n\nMaking unions more like a social movement is a tall order, but we have some great people to teach us how to do it: the youth who have organized for racial justice and an end to police brutality.\n\nLois Weiner , a member of the New Politics editorial board, is the author of The Future of Our Schools.

Acrylic and marker on wood, framed, 63.5 x 77.5 cm. Collection of Nina Clemente, New York.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nConsider the following facts as you wend your way through the Guggenheim Museum and its uppermost gallery, where you will presently find a painting called The Death of Michael Stewart (1983), Jean-Michael Basquiat's gut-punching tribute to a slain artist, and the centerpiece for an exhibition that could hardly be more timely. Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people. In 2014, fewer than one in three black people killed by police in the United States were suspected of a violent crime and allegedly armed. As American pediatrician Dr Benjamin Spock once observed, \"Most middle-class whites have no idea what it feels like to be subjected to police who are routinely suspicious, rude, belligerent, and brutal.\"\n\nSuch brutality is the focal point for \" Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story ,\" an exhibition curated by Chaédria LaBouvier that commences from a painting created by Jean-Michel Basquiat in honor of a young, black artist - Michael Stewart - who met his tragic end when he was supposedly caught by the New York City Transit Police tagging a wall in an East Village subway station during the early morning hours of September 15, 1983. Exactly what transpired that night remains unsettled to this day, but what is known is that the twenty-five-year-old Stewart was handcuffed, beaten, and strangulated by a choke hold with a nightstick - likely causing a massive brain hemorrhage, whereby he fell into a coma and never regained consciousness, dying two weeks later.\n\nOther artists, among them Andy Warhol and Keith Haring, responded to Stewart's death with commemorative works of their own, which are featured in the exhibition. Also included is a yellow flyer created by David Wojnarowicz - portraying the officers with vicious, skeletal faces - to announce a September 26, 1983, rally in Union Square in protest of Stewart's \"near-murder,\" when the young man was still languishing in a coma, \"suspended between life and death.\" In fact, Basquiat must have seen Wojnarowicz's poster (which was taped \"all over\" downtown, as another artist recalls), and apparently it served as a direct source for the composition of Basquiat's painting.\n\nThe Death of Michael Stewart (informally known as Defacement ) was originally painted directly onto the drywall of Haring's Cable Building studio; it was later cut out of the wall and placed within an ornate gilded frame that Haring hung immediately above his bed. There the painting remained until Haring's death from AIDS-related illness in February 1990.\n\nTwo positively ravenous officers - with pink flesh and blue uniforms - wield their nightsticks above a solitary, black, and haloed figure fixed motionlessly between them. In the upper register of the painting, above the trio of figures, is the word \"¿DEFACEMENTO?\" - a word that, during the 1980s, was often used as a term for graffiti. In the context of the painting, the artist draws our attention to the reality that what was truly being defaced was not a piece of property but a life: it is the police officers, teeth bared and thirsty for blood, who are committing the act of defacement, of disfigurement. Basquiat's art was constantly in dialogue with the history of Western painting; and in this case, his work may in fact be seen as revisiting and restaging a classic theme - namely, the flagellation of Christ.\n\nThe exhibition includes several other works by Basquiat, dealing with closely related subjects that occupied him throughout his relatively short but intense and extraordinarily prolific career. Irony of a Negro Policeman (1981), La Hara (1981), and Untitled (Sheriff) (1981), all take up the themes of white power, authority and law enforcement - generally portraying the police as frightening and monstrous.\n\nLa Hara is an especially mesmerizing work, the title of which (repeated four times in the upper-left portion) refers to a Nuyorican/Boricuan slang term for a police officer - derived from \"O'Hara,\" since at one time a large contingent of New York City law enforcement was Irish. The officer in this work is downright scary: with a ghostly white complexion, bloodshot eyes, and crooked, menacing teeth, set within a jaw that is open wide enough for the figure to be talking to us - all of which serves to convey a kind of seething rage, ready to explode in violence at the slightest provocation.\n\nAs with many of his figures, Basquiat has painted this officer with his rib cage exposed, and in certain areas we can see right through him to the fire-engine-red background. In other words, what we have is a skeletal figure whose bleached white bones invoke a kind of living dead: not simply a monster but an abomination.\n\nCharles the First (1982) and CPRKR (1982), both references to jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker, are among the paintings of Basquiat to champion and glorify the father of bebop - granting him, in fact, the stature of a king.\n\nThese two works, different as they are from Defacement , nevertheless share with it certain themes. At a basic level, all three works are concerned with death, and precisely the death of the young, black, male artist. CPRKR is a kind of grave marker for Parker, who was dead at thirty-five: a minimalist work consisting almost entirely of the initials in the title, references to the place (\"THE STANHOPE HOTEL\") and the year of Charlie Parker's death (\"NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE\"), along with a cross. At the bottom of the work, Basquiat has printed the name \"CHARLES THE FIRST.\"\n\nCharles the First abounds with references to the life and work of the great musician; but two features are particularly notable in the present context: at the painting's top left corner is the word \"HALOES\" - indicating that, in Basquiat's scheme of things, Parker is also a kind of saint, one of a number of characteristics he shares with the Stewart of Defacement .\n\nAt the bottom of the painting, Basquiat issues the warning \"MOST YOUNG KINGS GET THEIR HEADS CUT OFF\" - which, at the very least, reminds us that, for Basquiat, a premature death is the price that the black artist pays for genius. Basquiat himself died in 1988 at the age of twenty-seven from a heroin overdose.\n\nThe Guggenheim's glance back to 1983 and the death of Michael Stewart accomplishes what art exhibitions should, but all too rarely do - it grants us perspective on our present moment; a way of confronting the reality that we are currently living and navigating.\n\nWe all know the names of unarmed black men who recently had their lives cut short - Trayvon Martin (killed in 2012), Eric Garner (killed in 2014, by an illegal choke hold like the one that killed Stewart), twelve-year-old Tamir Rice (shot dead in 2014 by white police officer Timothy Loehmann), eighteen-year-old Michael Brown (also shot dead by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson), Philando Castile (killed in 2016 by a police officer) - and the list goes on.\n\nThe show does not allow us to forget that this violence has a long, painful history in America. Basquiat's \" 'Defacement': The Untold Story\" does what exhibitions should do: it tells us a story we don't want to hear but need to hear.\n\nSam Ben-Meir is a professor of philosophy and world religions at Mercy College in New York City.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe police killing of two black men - Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St Paul, Minneapolis - last week horrified people around the world and brought protesters into the streets in large numbers across the country to proclaim that Black Lives Matter.\n\nYet just as quickly, in Dallas, a man who shot and killed police officers as Black Lives Matter supporters were demonstrating - killing five officers and wounding several more before being killed himself by police - provided the means for the media and law enforcement to shift the spotlight away from the epidemic of police violence and blame those who have risen up to protest.\n\nMicah Xavier Johnson, an African-American veteran, opened fire on police during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Dallas on July 7. There was zero evidence, even in the immediate confusion surrounding the attack, that Johnson was connected to the protest.\n\nBut authorities immediately used the opportunity to smear the movement, suggesting that the attack was part of a coordinated plot, and a willing media went along.\n\nPolitical leaders and media commentators immediately lumped protest against racist police harassment and violence together with Johnson's shootings - and called on the Black Lives Matter movement to accept some kind of responsibility for Johnson's rampage.\n\nTypical was the New York Times , which warned that\n\nBlack Lives Matter now faces perhaps the biggest crisis in its short history. It is both scrambling to distance itself from an African-American sniper in Dallas who set out to murder white police officers and trying to rebut a chorus of detractors who blame the movement for inspiring his deadly attack.\n\nOf course, neither the Times nor anyone else in a position of power makes the same call for law enforcement to accept collective responsibility for the police murders that take place several times a day across the country. In those cases, we're told, it's just \"one bad apple.\"\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo had the gall to ask Valerie Castile, mother of Philando Castile, about her reaction to the shootings in Dallas - before bothering to ask a single question about the loss of her son or the gut-wrenching aftermath captured on video.\n\nThe grieving mother set Cuomo straight:\n\nMe? I don't know anything about what happened in Dallas. My son died just the other day, and I haven't had sleep in almost 48 hours. So no, I haven't been watching any television, so I can't answer that . . .\n\nNo one has reached out to me as far as anything concerning [Philando]. As a matter of fact, since my son has been killed-murdered, executed by the state of Minnesota's police officers-I have not yet to see his body.\n\nThe video footage of the deaths of Sterling and Castile - Sterling as he laid subdued on the pavement, and Castile in his car as his fiancé and her four-year-old daughter looked on - brought home once again the daily reality of racist police violence.\n\nTheir deaths - one day and one thousand miles apart, but immediately joined in the minds of people around the world because they were captured on video - spurred a new round of protests.\n\nMost were called on short notice, often by new or inexperienced activists, following their instinct to want to speak out against police terror. Demonstrators came out into the streets in cities across the country - from Portland, Oregon, where thousands gathered in the city's downtown, to Portland, Maine, where hundreds rallied in front of police headquarters.\n\nIn Oakland, California - where scandals around sexual abuse and racism recently led to the firing of three police chiefs in a matter of just over a week - more than two thousand rallied and marched to \"shut it down\" on the evening of July 7, in the largest show of strength by the Black Lives Matter movement against police violence in many months. At one point, a group of protesters took over Interstate 880, with hundreds of people forming a human wall to block traffic.\n\nIn Chicago, on July 9, hundreds turned out for separate demonstrations where, after marching through the Taste of Chicago festival and staging a die-in, protesters began taking over intersections.\n\nIn Portland, Oregon, the protest drew several thousand to send a message against the murders in Louisiana and Minnesota. (Demonstrators were forced to flee for safety at one point when a local right-wing figure named Michael Strickland - who has a history of attempting to provoke socialists and leftists - pulled a gun on anti-racist protesters.\n\nThere were thousands in the streets in New York City - including first-time protesters like sixteen-year-old Lotoya Francis, who told Time magazine, \"This is the new civil rights movement, and I wanted to be a part of it. . . We're way more angry this time around.\"\n\nDespite the media narrative that the Black Lives Matter movement is threatening the peace, demonstrators found supporters among onlookers everywhere they marched. Chicagoan Greg Tully, who was stopped as protesters took over Michigan Avenue in the city's downtown, got out of his car to watch them. \"I can wait,\" Tully said . \"I think this is more important than one person getting somewhere on time. They're fighting for recognition.\"\n\nIn St Paul, hundreds turned out to the governor's mansion, occupying the street outside for days running. A banner hangs on the gates proclaiming \"Justice for Philando.\" On the evening of July 9, protests took over Interstate 94 and clashed with officers in riot gear.\n\nPredictably, police blamed \"outside agitators\" for the bitter protests. In Louisiana, a police spokesman said in a statement , \"It appears the protest at Baton Rouge Police Headquarters have become more violent as out-of-town protesters are arriving.\"\n\nBut according to Darren Bowers, whose girlfriend Ariel Bates was one of those arrested, the police antagonized the crowd. \"She told me that they jumped all on her, and her cousin on the grass,\" Bowers told the Chicago Tribune . \"They weren't on the street or anything. People are peacefully protesting. Why are they in riot gear?\"\n\nThe police were able to go on the offensive in Baton Rouge and around the country because of Micah Johnson's killing spree in Dallas - which was twisted into an act of violence connected to Black Lives Matter.\n\nDallas police initially claimed as many as four shooters were involved. They arrested three people, before quietly releasing them. As Steven Rosenfeld wrote for Alternet , \"[T]he message and framing . . . was the stereotype of a cabal of heavily armed Black snipers launching a domestic version of a race war.\"\n\nOnly later did officials acknowledge that there was just one suspected shooter, Johnson, who apparently told police that he wanted \"to kill white people . . . especially cops.\" He was killed by a Dallas SWAT team, which used a bomb-carrying robot to kill him.\n\nIt was barely questioned in the media, but the remote-control killing of Johnson represents a frightening escalation of the militarization of police. What if the police had used robot bombs against the other three supposed shooters - who turned out to be entirely innocent?\n\n\"The fact that the police have a weapon like this, and other weapons like drones and tanks, is an example of the militarization of the police and law enforcement - and goes in the wrong direction,\" former National Lawyers Guild President Marjorie Cohn told Common Dreams .\n\nMeanwhile, the media said little about the fact that Johnson was a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan. In the era of the \"war on terror,\" the violence of US empire has often come home. But the victims are usually the families of former soldiers and the veterans themselves, who sometimes find themselves at the breaking point.\n\nLikewise, the proven facts of racist police harassment and violence were twisted beyond recognition. A despicable Washington Post article reported that Philando Castile had been pulled over by police at least fifty-two times in recent years - and had the nerve to ask: \"Was it racial profiling?\"\n\n\"He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show,\" the Post article stated. \"Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged? The answer may never be known.\"\n\nReally? Never known? Millions of people in America know the answer. Philando Castile was a victim of racism, just like Alton Sterling, just like Freddie Gray, and Tamir Rice, and Sandra Bland, and Ramarley Graham, and Laquan McDonald, and so many others in cities and towns across the US.\n\nThe killing of five police officers in Dallas doesn't change that. As Diamond Reynolds, Philando Castile's fiancé, told Cuomo, showing incredible restraint: \"This is bigger than Philando, this is bigger than Trayvon Martin, this is bigger than Sandra Bland, this is bigger than all of us. So today, I just want justice for everyone.\"\n\nIn fact, according to the Washington Post 's own running tally , 518 people have been killed by police in the US so far this year.\n\nAs sixteen-year-old protester Brian Buchanan told Time as he marched against police brutality in New York City last week, \"The shooting in Dallas is a tragedy, but so is coming out of your own house and not feeling safe to walk down the street.\"\n\nBuchanan's words speak for everyone who has stood up against the racist violence of police. But on the other side, the calls for \"justice\" are only for police - and a smear campaign is in the making to label the Black Lives Matter movement as racist against whites.\n\nFor example, the right-wing Drudge Report announced in a banner headline that \"Black Lives Kill.\" The New York Post echoed that sentiment with a front-page headline that read \"Civil War.\"\n\nFormer New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani labeled the Black Lives Matter movement \"inherently racist\" and \"anti-American\" in an appearance on CBS's Face the Nation . Giuliani attempted to downplay racist police brutality by claiming that the real problem in America is \"black-on-black violence.\" \"The real danger to black children, Giuliani said, trotting out a made-up statistic, \"ninety-nine out of one hundred times, is other black kids who are going to kill them.\"\n\nWorse was former US Representative Joe Walsh, a Tea Partier and right-wing radio host who took to social media to threaten violence against not only the Black Lives Matter movement, but Barack Obama. \"This is now war,\" Walsh wrote. \"Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you.\"\n\nIf Walsh was a person of color, and the president he threatened was white, he would be in jail by now. But then again, he wouldn't be speaking for \"real America\" - by which Walsh meant racist America.\n\nAfter the killings of police in Dallas and the furious backlash that has ensued, we need protest more than ever to push back against the ideological onslaught that seeks to silence those who demand justice for Philando Castile and Alton Sterling - in order to amplify talk about the \"brave\" cops who supposedly put their lives on the line .\n\nIn reality, the occupation of police officer doesn't even crack the top ten list of most dangerous jobs in America. According to FBI statistics , 2015 was one of the safest years on record to be a cop - tying 2008 for the second-lowest death rate for police on record.\n\nThe call echoing through the media that \"Blue Lives Matter\" is designed to make black lives matter less. As Natasha Lennard wrote at Rolling Stone :\n\nIn the same week when thousands of us took to the streets to once again insist that Black Lives Matter, events in Dallas will force a number of false equivalences to be drawn. First among them is that if we say Black Lives Matter, we must say in the same breath Blue Lives Matter.\n\nI won't say Blue Lives Matter, because it does not need to be said. We know this because the death of five officers this week provoked an immediate response from the president, as did the assassination of two NYPD officers in 2014. That's what mattering looks like. While the president's remarks earlier in the week on the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were moving, dozens of unarmed Black men killed by cops go without presidential comment. For instance, U.S. police killed more than 100 unarmed Black men last year alone. The fact that there are too many such killings for Obama to speak to individually? That's what not mattering looks like in a society.\n\nPundits and politicians who conveniently ignore the deaths of Sterling and Castile and so many other victims of police brutality - or, worse, suggest that some of those victims somehow had it coming - should be denounced in the loudest terms.\n\nCastile, Sterling, and the hundreds of others killed by police this year aren't dead because they didn't comply quickly enough or resisted or gave the cops an attitude. Their deaths are attributable to a system in which police repression goes hand in hand with systematic racism and discrimination.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks, those opposed to racism and police brutality will have to work even harder to build the movement - and push back against the slanders of those who want to claim that we, not they, are promoting violence.\n\nOriginally published at Socialist Worker .\n\nNicole Colson is a contributor to Socialist Worker .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Gordon Parks\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Rudy Giuliani blamed the deaths of unarmed black men on teachers unions last week, he relied on the same logic that Rod Paige, former secretary of education, employed a decade ago when he labeled the National Education Association a \" terrorist organization .\" These arguments may seem laughable to many on the Left, but they emerge from ideological assumptions openly articulated by neoliberal education reformers.\n\nGiuliani argues the real problem communities of color face is not police militarization or brutality, but rather poverty and \"black-on-black\" crime, which requires a greater police presence, and results in the disproportionate arrests of blacks. The solution to poverty - and therefore crime? Education.\n\n\"Maybe all these left-wing politicians who want to blame police, maybe there's some blame here that has to go to the teachers union, for refusing to have schools where teachers are paid for performance, for fighting charter schools, for fighting vouchers so that we can drastically and dramatically improve education,\" says Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani's statement echoes the World Bank report \" Great Teachers ,\" which explains that while the current \"deceleration\" in the Latin American and Caribbean economies is due to external factors, like slower growth in China, we can't wait for capitalism to ameliorate poverty and its other terrible social consequences. Instead we have to turn to education so we can build \"human capital.\"\n\nTo do that, the reasoning goes, we must improve teacher quality, pay teachers for \"performance,\" and change who goes into teaching. The obstacle? Teachers unions. \"The deepest challenge in raising teacher quality is not fiscal or technical, but political, because teachers' unions in every country in Latin America are large and politically active stakeholders.\" Teachers unions are therefore the enemy of economic progress, and governments must persuade parents and the rest of civil society to turn against them.\n\nGiuliani was not the only pundit to link teachers unions and police brutality. One blogger even claimed that teachers unions cause as much brutality to minority youth as police. So let's be clear about how police and teachers differ.\n\nPolice, the courts, and the prison system make up the \"right hand of the state,\" as French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu put it . Education, public health, and social service workers personify the \"left hand of the state.\" While it can act as an instrument of social control, the \"left hand of the state\" has emancipatory potential. In contrast, the \"right hand of the state\" is repressive, containing no potentially untapped liberatory elements. We can't conflate the two, if we want to understand the state with any nuance.\n\nAdvocates of the education reform agenda being pushed by wealthy elites represent their project as the \" new civil rights movement .\" They have enlisted support from mainstream civil rights groups and perhaps most prominently Reverend Al Sharpton. In contrast we see an authentic civil rights movement mushrooming before our eyes. Young people have already been protesting deportations, school closings, and cuts to education funding, but now tens of thousands of youth, most of them black, are taking to the streets, often in acts of civil disobedience, to express their rage at the vicious slayings of unarmed black males.\n\nWe should assume that the powerful elites trying to dismantle public education and destroy teaching as a profession, globally, will use all of their resources to turn this authentic civil rights movement against unions. We see their strategy already in blog posts claiming, inaccurately, that unions and teachers are silent about racial justice.\n\nSocial justice teachers in local \" Teacher Activist Groups \" and organizations opposed to prison-like school conditions such as New York City's Teachers Unite have joined with parents and students to push back against racism in schools. Teachers unions have haltingly followed their lead.\n\nWhile I welcome American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten's press release condemning the killing of Michael Brown and her arrest in a subsequent demonstration, there's a legacy of mistrust between communities of color and teachers unions that is not going to be erased by the solitary acts of union officials or their public statements. And when officials do make such statements, they have to be clear about just what public education is up against.\n\nFor example, Weingarten responded to Giuliani's comment by asking in a tweet , \"Did #rudygiuliani really blame school teachers - not economics nor racism nor excessive force 4 #garner's death. Has he lost it?\" Yet in ascribing Giuliani's argument to craziness, Weingarten lost the opportunity to educate teachers and the public about the ideological battle being waged against teachers, their unions, and public education.\n\nHealing the breach between teachers unions and communities of color means first admitting there is one. That means teachers unions have to acknowledge the complicity of the education establishment in allowing segregated, unequal schooling.\n\nIt means finding ways to have constructive discussions with parents, students, and community activists who are angry and hurt about schools - and teachers - that seem not to value black kids.\n\nMaking unions more like a social movement is a tall order, but we have some great people to teach us how to do it: the youth who have organized for racial justice and an end to police brutality.\n\nLois Weiner , a member of the New Politics editorial board, is the author of The Future of Our Schools.

Acrylic and marker on wood, framed, 63.5 x 77.5 cm. Collection of Nina Clemente, New York.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nConsider the following facts as you wend your way through the Guggenheim Museum and its uppermost gallery, where you will presently find a painting called The Death of Michael Stewart (1983), Jean-Michael Basquiat's gut-punching tribute to a slain artist, and the centerpiece for an exhibition that could hardly be more timely. Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people. In 2014, fewer than one in three black people killed by police in the United States were suspected of a violent crime and allegedly armed. As American pediatrician Dr Benjamin Spock once observed, \"Most middle-class whites have no idea what it feels like to be subjected to police who are routinely suspicious, rude, belligerent, and brutal.\"\n\nSuch brutality is the focal point for \" Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story ,\" an exhibition curated by Chaédria LaBouvier that commences from a painting created by Jean-Michel Basquiat in honor of a young, black artist - Michael Stewart - who met his tragic end when he was supposedly caught by the New York City Transit Police tagging a wall in an East Village subway station during the early morning hours of September 15, 1983. Exactly what transpired that night remains unsettled to this day, but what is known is that the twenty-five-year-old Stewart was handcuffed, beaten, and strangulated by a choke hold with a nightstick - likely causing a massive brain hemorrhage, whereby he fell into a coma and never regained consciousness, dying two weeks later.\n\nOther artists, among them Andy Warhol and Keith Haring, responded to Stewart's death with commemorative works of their own, which are featured in the exhibition. Also included is a yellow flyer created by David Wojnarowicz - portraying the officers with vicious, skeletal faces - to announce a September 26, 1983, rally in Union Square in protest of Stewart's \"near-murder,\" when the young man was still languishing in a coma, \"suspended between life and death.\" In fact, Basquiat must have seen Wojnarowicz's poster (which was taped \"all over\" downtown, as another artist recalls), and apparently it served as a direct source for the composition of Basquiat's painting.\n\nThe Death of Michael Stewart (informally known as Defacement ) was originally painted directly onto the drywall of Haring's Cable Building studio; it was later cut out of the wall and placed within an ornate gilded frame that Haring hung immediately above his bed. There the painting remained until Haring's death from AIDS-related illness in February 1990.\n\nTwo positively ravenous officers - with pink flesh and blue uniforms - wield their nightsticks above a solitary, black, and haloed figure fixed motionlessly between them. In the upper register of the painting, above the trio of figures, is the word \"¿DEFACEMENTO?\" - a word that, during the 1980s, was often used as a term for graffiti. In the context of the painting, the artist draws our attention to the reality that what was truly being defaced was not a piece of property but a life: it is the police officers, teeth bared and thirsty for blood, who are committing the act of defacement, of disfigurement. Basquiat's art was constantly in dialogue with the history of Western painting; and in this case, his work may in fact be seen as revisiting and restaging a classic theme - namely, the flagellation of Christ.\n\nThe exhibition includes several other works by Basquiat, dealing with closely related subjects that occupied him throughout his relatively short but intense and extraordinarily prolific career. Irony of a Negro Policeman (1981), La Hara (1981), and Untitled (Sheriff) (1981), all take up the themes of white power, authority and law enforcement - generally portraying the police as frightening and monstrous.\n\nLa Hara is an especially mesmerizing work, the title of which (repeated four times in the upper-left portion) refers to a Nuyorican/Boricuan slang term for a police officer - derived from \"O'Hara,\" since at one time a large contingent of New York City law enforcement was Irish. The officer in this work is downright scary: with a ghostly white complexion, bloodshot eyes, and crooked, menacing teeth, set within a jaw that is open wide enough for the figure to be talking to us - all of which serves to convey a kind of seething rage, ready to explode in violence at the slightest provocation.\n\nAs with many of his figures, Basquiat has painted this officer with his rib cage exposed, and in certain areas we can see right through him to the fire-engine-red background. In other words, what we have is a skeletal figure whose bleached white bones invoke a kind of living dead: not simply a monster but an abomination.\n\nCharles the First (1982) and CPRKR (1982), both references to jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker, are among the paintings of Basquiat to champion and glorify the father of bebop - granting him, in fact, the stature of a king.\n\nThese two works, different as they are from Defacement , nevertheless share with it certain themes. At a basic level, all three works are concerned with death, and precisely the death of the young, black, male artist. CPRKR is a kind of grave marker for Parker, who was dead at thirty-five: a minimalist work consisting almost entirely of the initials in the title, references to the place (\"THE STANHOPE HOTEL\") and the year of Charlie Parker's death (\"NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE\"), along with a cross.

Acrylic and marker on wood, framed, 63.5 x 77.5 cm. Collection of Nina Clemente, New York.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nConsider the following facts as you wend your way through the Guggenheim Museum and its uppermost gallery, where you will presently find a painting called The Death of Michael Stewart (1983), Jean-Michael Basquiat's gut-punching tribute to a slain artist, and the centerpiece for an exhibition that could hardly be more timely. Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people. In 2014, fewer than one in three black people killed by police in the United States were suspected of a violent crime and allegedly armed. As American pediatrician Dr Benjamin Spock once observed, \"Most middle-class whites have no idea what it feels like to be subjected to police who are routinely suspicious, rude, belligerent, and brutal.\"\n\nSuch brutality is the focal point for \" Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story ,\" an exhibition curated by Chaédria LaBouvier that commences from a painting created by Jean-Michel Basquiat in honor of a young, black artist - Michael Stewart - who met his tragic end when he was supposedly caught by the New York City Transit Police tagging a wall in an East Village subway station during the early morning hours of September 15, 1983. Exactly what transpired that night remains unsettled to this day, but what is known is that the twenty-five-year-old Stewart was handcuffed, beaten, and strangulated by a choke hold with a nightstick - likely causing a massive brain hemorrhage, whereby he fell into a coma and never regained consciousness, dying two weeks later.\n\nOther artists, among them Andy Warhol and Keith Haring, responded to Stewart's death with commemorative works of their own, which are featured in the exhibition. Also included is a yellow flyer created by David Wojnarowicz - portraying the officers with vicious, skeletal faces - to announce a September 26, 1983, rally in Union Square in protest of Stewart's \"near-murder,\" when the young man was still languishing in a coma, \"suspended between life and death.\" In fact, Basquiat must have seen Wojnarowicz's poster (which was taped \"all over\" downtown, as another artist recalls), and apparently it served as a direct source for the composition of Basquiat's painting.\n\nThe Death of Michael Stewart (informally known as Defacement ) was originally painted directly onto the drywall of Haring's Cable Building studio; it was later cut out of the wall and placed within an ornate gilded frame that Haring hung immediately above his bed. There the painting remained until Haring's death from AIDS-related illness in February 1990.\n\nTwo positively ravenous officers - with pink flesh and blue uniforms - wield their nightsticks above a solitary, black, and haloed figure fixed motionlessly between them. In the upper register of the painting, above the trio of figures, is the word \"¿DEFACEMENTO?\" - a word that, during the 1980s, was often used as a term for graffiti. In the context of the painting, the artist draws our attention to the reality that what was truly being defaced was not a piece of property but a life: it is the police officers, teeth bared and thirsty for blood, who are committing the act of defacement, of disfigurement. Basquiat's art was constantly in dialogue with the history of Western painting; and in this case, his work may in fact be seen as revisiting and restaging a classic theme - namely, the flagellation of Christ.\n\nThe exhibition includes several other works by Basquiat, dealing with closely related subjects that occupied him throughout his relatively short but intense and extraordinarily prolific career. Irony of a Negro Policeman (1981), La Hara (1981), and Untitled (Sheriff) (1981), all take up the themes of white power, authority and law enforcement - generally portraying the police as frightening and monstrous.\n\nLa Hara is an especially mesmerizing work, the title of which (repeated four times in the upper-left portion) refers to a Nuyorican/Boricuan slang term for a police officer - derived from \"O'Hara,\" since at one time a large contingent of New York City law enforcement was Irish. The officer in this work is downright scary: with a ghostly white complexion, bloodshot eyes, and crooked, menacing teeth, set within a jaw that is open wide enough for the figure to be talking to us - all of which serves to convey a kind of seething rage, ready to explode in violence at the slightest provocation.\n\nAs with many of his figures, Basquiat has painted this officer with his rib cage exposed, and in certain areas we can see right through him to the fire-engine-red background. In other words, what we have is a skeletal figure whose bleached white bones invoke a kind of living dead: not simply a monster but an abomination.\n\nCharles the First (1982) and CPRKR (1982), both references to jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker, are among the paintings of Basquiat to champion and glorify the father of bebop - granting him, in fact, the stature of a king.\n\nThese two works, different as they are from Defacement , nevertheless share with it certain themes. At a basic level, all three works are concerned with death, and precisely the death of the young, black, male artist. CPRKR is a kind of grave marker for Parker, who was dead at thirty-five: a minimalist work consisting almost entirely of the initials in the title, references to the place (\"THE STANHOPE HOTEL\") and the year of Charlie Parker's death (\"NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE\"), along with a cross. At the bottom of the work, Basquiat has printed the name \"CHARLES THE FIRST.\"\n\nCharles the First abounds with references to the life and work of the great musician; but two features are particularly notable in the present context: at the painting's top left corner is the word \"HALOES\" - indicating that, in Basquiat's scheme of things, Parker is also a kind of saint, one of a number of characteristics he shares with the Stewart of Defacement .\n\nAt the bottom of the painting, Basquiat issues the warning \"MOST YOUNG KINGS GET THEIR HEADS CUT OFF\" - which, at the very least, reminds us that, for Basquiat, a premature death is the price that the black artist pays for genius.

Keith Ellison's reelection bid for the state's attorney general is playing out in that shadow.\n\nRepresetative Keith Ellison (D-MN) speaks at a news conference, urging Congress to protect programs such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. (Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDo you trust Keith Ellison to keep you and your family safe? According to Jim Schultz, the Republican nominee for attorney general in Minnesota, this is the single defining question of the race to lead the state's attorney general's office for the next four years.\n\nOne ad claims that Ellison is \"extreme\" and has \"let violence spread like cancer.\" Schultz has focused so intensively on crime, his messaging has verged on the surreal. \"It's a sad day in Minnesota when I hear from countless parents who are too concerned for their children's safety to let them go trick-or-treating in their own neighborhoods,\" Schultz tweeted on the morning of Halloween. \"We are losing the state we know and love.\"\n\nSchultz is not running an original campaign playbook. Republicans have attacked Democrats over crime in congressional races throughout the country, and local elections in overwhelmingly Democratic cities like Los Angeles and Portland have been similarly dominated by concerns about crime, homelessness, and public safety. The potency of those attacks was made clear in San Francisco earlier this year, where voters recalled progressive district attorney Chesa Boudin despite zero evidence to suggest that Boudin's reformist policies were responsible for any sort of surge in the city's crime rate.\n\nBoudin paid the price for voters' frustration with the visible effects of overlapping crises in housing and public health. But he at least was the district attorney in San Francisco, responsible for prosecuting crime. Ellison is not a district attorney. He's an attorney general, whose job is largely not to prosecute violent crime, but to protect the civil and consumer rights of Minnesotans. Schultz's campaign is predicated on dramatically reorganizing the office away from its consumer protection function and investing resources into criminal prosecutions - even though it's not clear that a state attorney general has any legal authority to usurp criminal prosecutions from local authorities.\n\n\"The way that Jim Schultz describes it, it sounds like he's running for chief of police,\" Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St Thomas and former prosecutor, said. \"And even if it was a county attorney, someone whose primary job is prosecution, that person isn't charge isn't in charge of the police either.\"\n\nThe attorney general in Minnesota can typically only prosecute criminal cases in two situations: when invited to do so by a county attorney or asked to do so by the governor. Ellison, in his first term, was called in very memorably by Governor Tim Walz to prosecute former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.\n\nWhere Ellison's supporters say he's thrived as attorney general is in a very different arena: using his office as a weapon to prosecute corporate malfeasance. In his first term, Ellison has sued fossil fuel companies including ExxonMobil and Koch Industries for misleading the public about the effects of climate change; sued Fleet Farm for knowingly selling firearms to straw buyers; sued one of the state's largest and most notorious landlords over the conditions of their housing units; and sued JUUL and its investor Altria for misleading the public about the effects of its products and reached settlements with opioid manufacturers that have netted the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Ellison has also created a unit in the attorney general's office to fight wage theft.\n\n\"He's been remarkably effective,\" Perry Moriearty, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, said. \"He's surrounded himself [with] staff that are really, really good. And I'm a defense lawyer - I don't love every prosecution out there.\"\n\nEllison's office is a far cry from the one he inherited from his predecessor Lori Swanson, who, according to reporting from the Intercept , pressured government employees to do political work on her behalf and was reluctant to attend political events in the Twin Cities for fear of being seen as too progressive.\n\nIt also stands in stark contrast to what Schultz, a corporate hedge fund lawyer who has never prosecuted a case or served in public office, is offering. Schultz has accused Ellison of making it \"his office's mission to drive Main Street businesses into the ground and out of state\" and said that he would not use the resources of the attorney general's office to file suits against major corporations. He's also an opponent of abortion rights who previously served on the board of a far-right antiabortion organization, a live issue given that Ellison has promised to fight for the rights of people from surrounding states to come to Minnesota to receive abortion care.\n\nIt's little wonder that many of the corporations Ellison has targeted for endangering the safety of the public are spending significant sums of money to replace him. Koch Industries, ExxonMobil, and the American Petroleum Institute have all dumped contributions into the coffers of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), as have JUUL and Altria, Pfizer, Philip Morris, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\n\"To have an elected official who is truly fighting for working people feels too rare,\" Andrew Ulasich, an organizer with Faith in Minnesota, said. \"And I think [Ellison] is facing a reaction from corporate power for doing that.\"\n\nOf course, Schultz's advertisements and those funded by RAGA don't attack Ellison as overly hostile toward \"Main Street\" businesses like ExxonMobil and JUUL. They're attacking him on crime. The remarkable thing is that Ellison's most prominent achievement in his four years on the job was rescuing the prosecution of Chauvin and, ultimately, winning a precedent-setting conviction. Chauvin was the first white Minnesota police officer ever convicted of murdering a black person.\n\nEllison also brought a first-degree manslaughter charge against former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter for the killing of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop last year; Potter was also convicted. If anything, the fundamental disagreement between Ellison and Schultz is about what kinds of criminal behavior are most in need of prosecuting: Ellison has gone after corporations and criminal police officers, Schultz has proposed prosecuting \"carjacking gangs.\"\n\nSchultz has been complimentary of the prosecution of Chauvin, which he called \"appropriate,\" but has also claimed without clear evidence that Ellison himself somehow had little to do with it. \"You sat in the back of the courtroom, you took some notes, and you opened the door from time to time,\" Schultz said at a debate in late October. \"That was your role in the George Floyd prosecution, Keith.\"\n\n\"Jim, how would you know?\" Ellison asked. \"How would you possibly know?\"\n\nWere this a different elected official with the same record, it might be a very different race. Scott Jensen, the Republican nominee for governor, has repeatedly attacked Walz over his public safety record but has trailed in most polls. But Ellison is one of the country's most visible elected officials, a black Muslim serving in a state that had never elected a black person to a partisan statewide office until he won his first term as attorney general four years ago, and he is living in a city that for a number of Minnesotans has become a codeword for chaos and disorder.\n\nHe also, no matter his job description, hasn't shrunk from the fight for true public safety. Last year, Ellison, whose son is a progressive member of the Minneapolis City Council, linked up with Ilhan Omar and became the only statewide elected official to endorse a measure to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety. It was a politically risky decision, but one wholly consistent with Ellison's politics and background as a Minneapolis criminal defense attorney, community activist, and US representative well-versed in the department's gruesome record of racism and violence against marginalized communities.\n\n\"I live three miles from where George Floyd was murdered, and I think it's incredibly hard to be this proximate to that type of human suffering that evokes decades and centuries of what are effectively lynchings of unarmed black men, and not say, 'Something drastic has to change,'\" Moriearty said.\n\nWhat happened next, in a climate of media-driven fear and police backlash , was predictable: the public safety amendment lost by twelve points and a number of its proponents have paid an ongoing price. Omar's summer, in particular, may have been a harbinger of things to come: while her fellow Squad members easily won renomination in their respective primaries, Omar only narrowly fended off a challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels - a conservative Democrat whose support for the Minneapolis Police Department was so robust he co-filed a lawsuit against the city in 2020 in an attempt to force it to hire more officers.\n\nEllison's campaign and its allies have focused on informing voters about the work he's done to hold corporations accountable as attorney general. But in a state that is still living in the long shadow of the murder of George Floyd, the uprising it sparked, and the backlash that followed, Ellison's fate may be tied to what Ulasich called an \"ongoing referendum\" on policing.\n\n\"I really do think that part of the big support for Jim Schultz right now is a response to that, and it's coming up in the debates, he won't let it go, and a lot of people are saying it too . . . 'Keith is a defunder,'\" said Hannah Merrill, Ulasich's colleague with Faith in Minnesota.\n\nIt's hardly mattered that Minnesota's homicide rate remains well below the national average and that gun crime in Minneapolis has actually declined significantly in the lead-up to the election, and it's hardly mattered that Ellison doesn't have any direct link to the crime rate anyway. The police in Minneapolis have not been defunded.\n\nBut \"Part of the politics of the moment right now is that people are driven by fear rather than hope,\" Osler said. \"And I think Ellison is better at hope.\"\n\nAbe Asher is a journalist whose reporting on politics, social movements, and the climate has been published in the Nation , VICE News , the Portland Mercury , and other outlets.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

And that's why, according to a compelling new series, the FBI had its fingerprints all over Malcolm X's murder.\n\nMalcolm X meeting Martin Luther King, Jr, on March 26, 1964. Library of Congress\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe only time Malcolm X met Martin Luther King, Jr - in the US Capitol Building in March 1964 - he told King, \"Now you're going to get investigated.\" By then, King had fought for and gained a place in America's conscience; Malcolm had just fallen out with his teacher and the Nation of Islam, and he hoped to forge a united front of black liberation groups that included a rapprochement with King. The meeting took place a year before Malcolm's death, during a time of intense travel and speeches, landmark civil rights legislation, and rampant government surveillance of both figures.\n\nBut while Malcolm joked about it to King, the degree to which various agencies were spying on the Nation of Islam's most famous apostate escaped even him. In his final months, Malcolm softened his antagonism to King's nonviolent approach, while speaking openly to friends of near-constant death threats. A series out this winter on Netflix suggests that the role US law enforcement officials played in Malcolm's murder has been understated - and gets closer than ever before to laying the blame at the feet of the US government itself.\n\nOriginally shown at Fusion, Who Killed Malcolm X? features Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, a journalist, father, and Malcolm admirer who, over six episodes, guides the viewer through his decades-long investigation to reveal that two of the three men convicted for Malcolm's murder were innocent. He goes on to show that the FBI knew this but did not submit evidence to exonerate the men. During a key episode, he meditates on why. Taking his questions to Nation of Islam veterans and Pulitzer Prize-winning and in-house FBI historians, Muhammad finally establishes that this oversight could not have been accidental. As a protagonist and guide through the annals of Malcolm X revisionism, Muhammad is so convincing that Malcolm's murder case has been reopened .\n\nMalcolm's murder turned fifty-five this year. Timed with the anniversary, the series includes among its experts the scholar Peniel Joseph, whose The Sword and the Shield , a side-by-side biography of Malcolm and Martin Luther King, Jr, came out in early April. While the Netflix series emphasizes the important relationship with Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad, Joseph provides context around that other important relationship - with King - that should have been allowed to ripen further. Though it was frequently antagonistic, the relationship bore features of an unspoken collaboration that made each figure a better analyst of history and a more effective activist.\n\nIt also kept FBI director J. Edgar Hoover up at night. He worried about a charismatic figure who might \"unify and electrify the black nationalist movement,\" let alone two black radicals working together.\n\nAbdur-Rahman Muhammad is a journalist and a proud working man who leads tours of lower Manhattan. On camera, he looks like a business-casual-clad bureaucrat with an affable face, a wry smile, and a warm, steady voice. As a teen, he was targeted by police for being out with a white girlfriend. Police insulted him, took him on a ride around the city, mocked and threatened him. It made him distrustful of police and an admirer of Malcolm X. \"I became a black militant activist . . . who wasn't going to take this shit anymore.\"\n\nHe never believed the official story when Malcolm was killed. Much later, he started to dig. Soon his files were rich, and his work was featured in A Life of Reinvention , a 2011 biography of Malcolm by the late Manning Marable. \"No one alive has done more to solve Malcolm's killing than Abdur-Raman,\" says Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Garrow.\n\nThe official story of Malcolm X's killing is that he and his teacher, the spiritual leader of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad, sometimes known as the Messenger, had a falling out. The inciting incident was a remark Malcolm made after the Kennedy assassination. Muhammad had asked him not to weigh in or criticize the slain president, and he grew increasingly wary of Malcolm's political punditry. At the end of a speech a week after the assassination, however, someone in the audience asked Malcolm's opinion. Given the state of violence the United States presided over at home and around the world, he famously said that the assassination was like \"chickens coming home to roost.\" Recognizing Kennedy's popularity, Elijah Muhammad suspended, or \"muzzled,\" Malcolm for ninety days. Nation of Islam (NOI) members started to take sides. The feud escalated with Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm engaged in a war of words, including threats from the Messenger often coded in religious imagery.\n\nOn February 21, 1965, Malcolm was shot at close range at New York City's Audubon Ballroom, in front of his wife, Betty Shabazz, and his children. Although multiple assailants fired at him, the wounds from a sawed-off shotgun (used by a man in a long coat who had appeared from the front row) were ruled to be the cause of death. Another man with a gun, Talmadge Hayer, from the Newark, New Jersey, mosque known to NOI followers as Mosque No. 25, was apprehended at the crime scene; after he was shot in the leg and caught in a melee, police pulled him from the crowd, and he eventually confessed to being one of the coconspirators.\n\nTwo other men, Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson, were arrested. Both maintained their innocence. Police had no physical evidence against them, but their weaker cases were bundled together with Hayer's, and they were convicted, with all three given twenty years to life. Through a series of files debunking the thin case against Johnson and Butler, Abdur-Raman Muhammad alleges these men were telling the truth; two were innocent, and only Hayer, who confessed, was guilty.\n\nThe popular story of Malcolm X's murder, Abdur-Raman Muhammad asserts in the first episode of Who Killed Malcolm X?, is untrue. Muhammad's revisionist version starts with J. Edgar Hoover, the professional suppressor of left-wing radicals. Hoover was terrified of a \"Black Messiah,\" and once insisted that\n\nthere must be a goal of preventing a coalition of militant black nationalist groups, prevent[ing] the rise of a [figure who] can unify and electrify the black nationalist movement, along with preventing militant black nationalist groups and leaders from gaining respectability, by discrediting them to the community.\n\nAn internal FBI memo, to the same end, asked what was being done to \"stop Malcolm X.\"\n\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) knew about the threats on Malcolm's life. But it didn't have a security detail checking for weapons at the door of the Audubon Ballroom the night Malcolm would speak. No uniformed police officers came inside the venue to guard the famed leader during his talk. Instead, the NYPD stationed cops on the roof and on the sidewalk in front of the building.\n\nThe lackadaisical attitude didn't end there. When police arrived to investigate the scene, they reportedly sauntered through the ballroom, as if on a Sunday stroll. After Hayer's capture, eyewitness accounts corroborated that there were five gunmen, one of whom, according to the series, may have slipped away in the melee. Somehow, after they captured Hayer and then Johnson and Butler, the police arbitrarily reduced the number of suspects from five to three - a decision they never explained. Aside from taking a few photographs of bullet holes in the podium and in the chest and chin of Malcolm himself, police barely secured the room or its evidence; that night, they allowed the owners to hold a dance.\n\nAfter the rift over Malcolm's Kennedy comments, Malcolm had written apologetically to his teacher but received no answer. The series asserts that the FBI had been exploiting this schism in the months leading up to the killing. They fed stories to the media about the rift, and they may have used informants to spread rumors about each figure's animosity toward the other.\n\nThe sheer number of informants known to have penetrated the Nation of Islam created paranoia - one of the explicit goals of the FBI's COINTELPRO, or Counterintelligence Program, which spied on progressives and dissident groups, pitting them against each other. John Ali, the national secretary based in the organization's Chicago mansion, has been frequently accused of having been an informant, as well as helping stoke hatred between the two former collaborators. He responds to the filmmakers' questions about these accusations with odd phrases like, \"I could have,\" while insisting the bureau didn't accept him as an informant.\n\nSome interviews feature the affable Abdur-Raman Muhammad asking witnesses questions, nodding along, raising his brow before a follow-up. After casually befriending witnesses who tell him they saw it as a closed case, he asks, \"But how could justice be done if two innocent black men served time?\" Series director Rachel Dretzin conducts another kind of interview. Both interviewers are virtuosic at drawing out their subjects, but Dretzin's interviews are filmed more like police interrogations, the camera on the subject directly, while Muhammad's feel like eavesdropping on a conversation. Her interview of Cory Booker, who has an eerie and incidental tie to the presumptive killer through a campaign video, is gripping.\n\nWhen files must be examined, Muhammad either skims them with another historian or archivist, or he points to key sentences that then loom onscreen. We learn that Johnson was arrested as the trigger man, for instance, despite not matching the description of the real killer in an FBI file.\n\nEpisode one ends with Abdur-Rahaman Muhammad finding a file describing the shotgun shooter as stocky, dark-skinned, and coming from the Newark mosque - none of which characterized Johnson, who was light-skinned and from Malcolm's Harlem mosque. Why did police miss this?\n\nFrom there, the series turns into a meditation on FBI surveillance and COINTELPRO. Garrow tells viewers how thoroughly the bureau infiltrated the Nation of Islam, citing \"multiple high-ranking paid human informants in the leadership . . . Could it have been,\" he asks in a bookish drawl, \"that FBI paid informants were involved in Malcolm X's murder? Almost certainly.\"\n\nThe Nation of Islam's need for revenge, the series posits, may have been the cover for members who joined as informants, or who - thanks to money offered after they joined - turned dirty while rising into the leadership. Soon we see that the need for revenge itself may have been manipulated. Who egged on whom?\n\nWhile the FBI surveilled Malcolm, the NYPD sent the Bureau of Special Services and Investigations - known as BOSSI, or the Red Squad - to his rallies and to record his calls. BOSSI was effectively a police unit made over as a spy ring. One of its agents boasts how he knew Malcolm's habits so well that they switched on their wiretap on the second ring, when Malcolm would always pick up, so he wouldn't hear the click. Tony Bouza, one of the more wryly unapologetic BOSSI officers in the series confesses, \"I don't think he understood that we were tapping his wire and listening to the tapes . . . Did we intrude into privacy? Yes. But I was alright with it.\" If Malcolm spoke before a broader audience, then FBI agents (all white) could attend. If not, they found black men in the streets, and met them in movie theaters to arrange the surveillance or to trade information.\n\nA series like this - or Erroll Morris's Wormwood (2018, also on Netflix) - forces you to admit that paranoia, as a mode, isn't so quaint or paranoid , after all. So it was for Malcolm, who began addressing crowds beginning with \"Mister Moderator, friends . . . uh, enemies . . .\" While the audience looked around at each other and laughed uneasily, Malcolm would continue, \" Everyone is here.\" In The Sword and the Shield , Joseph quotes Malcolm admitting that, when \"speaking publicly, I'd guess which were FBI faces in the audience or other types of agents.\"\n\nA 1962 FBI memo shows that the FBI knew about Elijah Muhammad's multiple extramarital affairs, often with underage girls, including several with whom he conceived children. Agents schemed to send \"anonymous letters to [his wife] Clara Muhammad.\" This was stirred into the cauldron to poison the two men's relationship. To encounter his teacher's rampant hypocrisy would have offended the happily married father of four, especially as he bristled at the muzzle against his own outspokenness.\n\nOne event during the Kennedy administration offers a window into the growing conflict. In 1962, Malcolm's friend, a Nation of Islam member named Ronald Stokes, was shot and killed by Los Angeles police officers. The incident marked the only time his wife, Betty Shabazz, recalls seeing Malcolm cry. Footage from a speech Malcolm made in the aftermath of the killing shows the activist with blown-up photographs of the scene, one featuring the back of Stokes's head with a bullet hole in it. An FBI memo describes his full-throated denunciation, which compared the LAPD's actions to gestapo-like tactics:\n\nSubject's opening statement was that \". . . Seven innocent unarmed black men were shot down in cold blood by Police Chief WILLIAM J. PARKER'S Los Angeles City Police.\" The . . . subject referred to the incident as \"one of the most ferocious, inhuman atrocities ever inflicted in a so-called 'democratic' and 'civilized' society\" and subject referred to Stokes' murder as \"a brutal and cold-blooded murder by PARKER'S well-armed storm troopers.\"\n\nWhen Muhammad cautioned Malcolm to de-escalate, Malcolm reportedly felt shame that the Nation of Islam wouldn't stand up to defend its own members. Part of why Muhammad wanted to keep Malcolm from going too far, however, was because the NOI had lucrative commercial interests in Los Angeles. These funded its ministerial work and enriched Elijah Muhammad and his family, and a war with the LAPD would jeopardize business.\n\nThe series is good on this and other details. But Joseph gives broader context about the questions around Malcolm's political outspokenness and Muhammad's affairs. Malcolm had always been outspoken politically, and it helped boost the organization's members, spurring publicity and filling seats. For that, Muhammad would have been grateful. Malcolm was often booked to speak with Elijah Muhammad - the genius orator and acolyte warming up, as it were, for the Messenger himself as the main event. But Muhammad had a lung condition; as the 1960s progressed, Muhammad missed events due to illness.\n\nIn his many appearances before the media or a live audience, Malcolm was often tasked with explaining how the Nation of Islam's policy of separatism was distinct from segregation. Pundits expected to discredit Malcolm and the Nation by likening this separatism to reverse racism. But it had little to do with accepting segregation as it was, Malcolm explained. Segregation was the control of black people, he said, while the Nation's separatism \"was the voluntary promotion of self-determination for a black community in search of its own place in the world.\" To Malcolm, King's gospel of nonviolence was bargaining from a position of weakness, akin to asking white people's permission for freedom rather than taking it. Malcolm saw King's bids for integration as \"admitting [King's] inferiority, because he is also admitting that he wants to become part of a 'superior society.'\"\n\nWell before his comments on Kennedy, but especially after his falling out with the Nation, Malcolm circled around the idea of a broader coalition. He interspersed invitations to work alongside King with a steady barrage of critiques of nonviolence as ineffectual. Perhaps this was why King tended to decline, or not answer, Malcolm's invitations - as with his 1961 Harlem Freedom Rally. Nevertheless, the two leaders engaged in a fascinating, indirect conversation, which Joseph draws out well in a tandem biography that feels, remarkably, like full biographies of each. A virtuoso at articulating the undercurrents of black power, including in his equally meticulous biography of Stokely Carmichael ( Stokely: A Life , 2014), Joseph adroitly places the two leaders in contrast to each other as in a contrapuntal duet. This duet demonstrates the awful silence we would feel with just one of their voices missing, as was exemplified by Malcolm's death three years before King's, let alone both, after 1968.\n\nThe most fascinating part of their joint performance was how Malcolm was constantly using his rhetoric to amplify the terms in which King could work, and vice versa. If one fought for black citizenship, and the other for black dignity, their disagreement over nonviolence was a disagreement merely over tactics, Malcolm said in a period of softening toward King. In their socially distant partnership, something small might echo from one to the other. First Malcolm, as around the 1962 Stokes killing, and then King (as in Birmingham) might take turns calling police methods Gestapo-like. Malcolm obviously followed King's movements and speeches (and vice versa; King sometimes responded to Malcolm's speech the very same day).\n\nMalcolm would at times even debate King through a proxy, like Bayard Rustin, one of the lead organizers of the March on Washington. The two would joust ruthlessly on stage, but they enjoyed themselves so much that they soon agreed to take their routine on the road. Their first debate, at Howard University, impressed students, like the young Carmichael, and faculty alike. Rustin accused the Muslims of having \"no political, social or economic program,\" but Malcolm's\n\ntalk of racial pride, political self-determination and black solidarity motivated a generation of young activists to imbibe large quantities of black history, to investigate the significance of African decolonization, and reimagine the meaning of African American identity within Western culture.\n\nMuch of their mutual curiosity, or at least Malcolm's, circled around Kennedy. (Picture Malcolm watching King, watching Kennedy, watching King.) When commissioner of public safety Bull Connor was beating up civil rights activists in Birmingham, Alabama, siccing dogs on small children and their mothers and blasting them with fire hoses, Malcolm grew incensed. But aside from complaining privately that the pictures of such police brutality \"made [him] sick,\" Kennedy himself did nothing. This \"earned him the permanent enmity of Malcolm X, who criticized the president for authorizing force only when white property and lives, rather than that of black women and children, hung in the balance.\"\n\nAs for King and Kennedy, King had been waiting for a meeting for the first seven months of Kennedy's term, and whether King saw it or not, Malcolm's criticism of Kennedy gave King cover for his own. Malcolm also knew that the original vision for the March on Washington - which A. Philip Randolph first imagined decades earlier, in the 1940s - was more radical, focused on shutting down the capital. Malcolm complained that when the president saw that he couldn't stop it, he joined it. Once it had Kennedy's blessing, Malcolm felt it became too timid, focused less on stopping traffic, stopping work, and flexing black power, concerning itself instead with providing places to urinate and faint.\n\nBefore a gathering of newspaper editors, Kennedy denigrated Muslims as a den for extremists. \"Instead of attacking the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens' Council,\" said Malcolm, \"Kennedy attacked Islam, a religion.\" And did Malcolm also blame Kennedy for the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba , who was killed just days before Kennedy's inauguration? Or for the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, in April of Kennedy's first term? Regardless, Malcolm's quip about Kennedy and violence had more behind it than the random act of cruelty it was portrayed as.\n\nAccording to the docuseries, John Ali, Elijah Muhammad's secretary, called Chicago and reported Malcolm to the Messenger after he made the chicken roosting comment. Newspapers and TV networks distorted the quip - made in ironic indignation over the United States' hypocrisy - framing it as if Malcolm had expressed joy over Kennedy's death. Malcolm worked hard to make peace with Muhammad, but his letters of humility and regret to Muhammad were intercepted by the Messenger's children (heirs to his empire) or others who would have been threatened by Malcolm. He was suspended.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the press continued to refer to Malcolm as Muhammad's \"heir apparent.\" This annoyed Malcolm, as he knew it would only heighten the animosity of the actual heirs. Worried about the loss of his livelihood through an organization he had built and expanded like no one else, Malcolm spent the winter correcting interviewers, saying he was never the heir apparent, emphasizing that he was suspended over his own actions and that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad had taught him everything he knew. It was a moment of real humility for the firebrand activist and preacher, with a touch of survival instinct.\n\nTwo months into the rift, the FBI visited Malcolm at his home. He welcomed them in. In an exploratory interview, they offered to pay him to inform on the Nation of Islam. They spoke, in tentative tones, of records he may have access to. They were there to test the psychology of Malcolm during the rift, a rift these agents had quietly curated. Denying he had such access, Malcolm secretly recorded the two agents, one of whom was named Fulton, who speaks to Dretzin but refuses to show his face on camera.\n\n\"Money brings out the information,\" Fulton told Malcolm, instantly realizing he'd erred. \"You insult my intelligence,\" Malcolm objected. \"In fact, you insult your own [that] you wouldn't know in advance what I'm going to say.\" He emphasized that he was no Quisling or fink, that \"no government agency should ever expect information from me.\" One of the agents described Malcolm during the visit as \"nice and courteous, but not too cooperative.\"\n\nTo cool him down, Malcolm's cohort took him to Miami, where NOI member Sam Saxon introduced Malcolm to Cassius Clay. The two quickly became friends. Malcolm converted Clay, who was on the verge of becoming heavyweight champion in his fight against Sonny Liston. Malcolm hoped that by recruiting the boxing star, he would help restore to black Americans a \"racial pride\" - part of Malcolm's program of black dignity. Still looking to return to the fold, Malcolm also hoped to offer the champion as a peace offering to Elijah Muhammad.\n\nBut Muhammad outmaneuvered Malcolm. After Clay's championship win, Muhammad held a public reception, praised Clay, and gave him his Muslim name, Muhammad Ali. Joseph tells the filmmakers that Malcolm wasn't as good at power politics as Muhammad. \"Elijah Muhammad was playing chess, and Malcolm was playing checkers.\"\n\nCelebrated New York literary socialite George Plimpton caught Malcolm for an interview in Miami. At the time Plimpton was writing about Ali for Sports Illustrated (and for his subsequent book Shadow Box ). Depicting Malcolm as hopeful that in five days \"he was going to be unmuzzled,\" Plimpton blames Malcolm's subsequent death on the rift between the two, and he goes on to lightly ridicule most of Malcolm's indignation over brutal historical injustices. Plimpton highlights contradictions and features Malcolm popping peppermints into his mouth, and finally implies that an undercurrent of antisemitism tainted the Muslims' work. But after the fight, Malcolm knew he wouldn't be reinstated. BOSSI member Tony Gouza delighted in this: \"I thought it great. I thought it wonderful. Elijah Muhammad was divesting himself of his greatest asset and weakening his organization. It's like a baseball team depriving itself of its greatest slugger. How much better does it get than that?\"\n\nOn March 8, with no peace brokered with the Messenger, Malcolm announced the permanent split. It was also the final year of Malcolm's life, and he was active and hounded. He launched his own fledgling Nation of Islam (which he called Muslim Mosque, Inc.) and reinvented himself as a roving ambassador - some called him the president - of black America. Touring Africa and the Middle East, he also founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). The OAAU linked a minority group in the United States with a great worldwide constituency.\n\nMalcolm had made a kind of tactical shift, reframing civil rights as global human rights in his search for a broader moral and historical constituency, which brought nationalist and anti-colonialist movements in Africa into solidarity with American liberation movements. From the United States' standpoint, this was an attempt to embarrass the US globally by holding up its actual treatment of black Americans against its image of itself as the seat of freedom.\n\nBetween the launch of his new organizations, Malcolm and the Nation of Islam began a battle over his small Queens house. Muhammad tried to evict him, and the case went to court. Malcolm had spent twelve years of his life expanding the membership of the Nation of Islam, and was justified in feeling that, given his effective organizing work, he was indispensable in building it. To squabble in court over his family's modest place of shelter, while Elijah Muhammad resided in mansions in Chicago and Phoenix, further embittered Malcolm. How Malcolm learned of his teacher's affairs, and whether the FBI played a role, the documentary doesn't explicitly say. But footage shows him seething outside the courthouse after losing the fight over his home, denouncing Muhammad for having \"eight children by six teenage girls who were his private secretaries.\"\n\nTo many Muslims, such as James Shabazz, minister at the group's Newark Mosque No. 25, this was an unforgivable betrayal of the man who guided Malcolm to straighten out his life after prison and gave him a vocation. A CBS TV interviewer asked Shabazz, featured in archival footage, if he wouldn't \"put it past\" some of his followers who might want to \"get\" Malcolm. (Talk about leading the witness.) \"I wouldn't put it past a Christian,\" Shabazz responded, \"to punch somebody out for talking about Jesus.\"\n\nOther members of the mosque said, \"it never even entered my mind that Malcolm was right\" and that it felt \"like a man turning on his father.\" Footage shows Malcolm, on the verge of homelessness, escalating the feud further, saying \"Elijah Muhammad has gone insane, absolutely out of his mind. Besides, you can't be seventy years old and surround yourself by a bunch of sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen-year-old girls and keep your right mind. You can't do it.\" The crowd laughs. Malcolm believed Elijah Muhammad was behind the threats against him, telling an interviewer, \"Elijah Muhammad has given the order to his followers to see that I am crippled or killed.\"\n\nAnd being that Elijah Muhammad was the most wiretapped target of the FBI's COINTELPRO, used illegally during this time to spy on civilians, Abdur-Rahman Muhammad searches in the government record for a coded or explicit order to have Malcolm killed. \"Elijah stated that with these hypocrites, when you find them, cut their heads off,\" reads one FBI memo from 1964, from a wiretap of Muhammad's Phoenix home. As a Muslim himself, he decodes this for Garrow, explaining that the phrase \"cut their heads off\" refers to the teachings of the NOI founder, Wallace Fard Muhammad, who said that whoever takes the heads off four devils will go to Mecca. A subsequent reference to Moses in another memo could be another coded death threat against Malcolm. \"It's very clear what he's calling for. He wouldn't have to say it.\"\n\nThe Fruit of Islam was Elijah Muhammad's security force. But they could be seen, too, as his enforcers, about whom authorities worried since they could be converted into a paramilitary force. Historian Zak A. Kondo explains that they might say, \"We want you to bless him,\" but it might mean taking him into the park and beating him up. The leadership of the Nation of Islam were \"basically saying things that gave people the notion that [they] wanted Malcolm X dead.\" One of the Nation's newspapers featured a cartoon of Malcolm's disembodied head rolling down the street, his horns growing with each bounce. A whisper campaign intensified, suggestions like, \"Man, if you knew what Malcolm was saying about the leader, you would kill him yourself.\" Talmadge Hayer, the only confessed killer convicted of his murder, felt that he had to correct Malcolm's slander, but he stated that he did not need a direct order. Norman Butler - later known as Muhammad A. Aziz - remembers Elijah Muhammad's son, known to many simply as \"Junior,\" telling an audience, \"'You should cut out [Malcolm's] tongue, and I'll stamp it APPROVED, and send it to my father,' words to that effect.\" But he took this to be \"hype talk.\"\n\nAfter he was found guilty of killing Malcolm, Butler hired William Kunstler, who publicized on television Hayer's signed affidavit. The document's purpose was to exonerate the innocent Butler and Johnson. In the affidavit, Hayer names four men from the Newark mosque who conspired with him. In details about how the crime was planned and executed, Hayer writes that it was \"William\" who \"had the shotgun\" - the weapon that had killed Malcolm. \"If you want to answer the question of who killed Malcolm,\" summarizes Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, \"it was the man who fired the shotgun. According to Hayer, that man's name was William X.\" When the courts denied Kunstler's request to reopen the case, Kunstler petitioned Congress, but to no avail. In his affidavit, Hayer described William X as twenty-seven years old, of stocky build, around 5'10\", with a dark complexion and short, cropped hair. A member of both the Newark mosque and the Fruit of Islam, his last name was Bradley.\n\nIn the fifth of the series's six episodes, Muhammad declares that if Bradley is the killer, he wants to confront him face to face. But first he needs to find his adopted Muslim name. In an informal discussion, he gets lucky. Someone tells him offhand: Al-Mustafa Shabazz. He travels to Newark and meets a clutch of Newark old timers who tell him not to stir up ghosts. Turns out Shabazz's involvement was an open secret. The rumor itself, plus the fact that he was never convicted, leads to inchoate suspicions of impunity, that central undermining condition of American corruption. That same impunity led Shabazz on, under the name Bradley, to wield a long and violent rap sheet: terrorist threats, sexual assault, armed robbery.\n\n\"Leave him alone, leave him alone, leave him alone,\" says one community member. \"Because he's probably being protected by the state.\" Many in Newark knew who Shabazz was and what he is said to have done in 1965. In fact, he was so well enmeshed in the Newark community that he was featured in Cory Booker's 2010 mayoral reelection campaign video.\n\nThe video opens with Booker telling Newark voters that \"Violent crime in our city was getting worse. But together, Newark, we took action, adding 300 police to our streets.\" Then Bradley, aka Shabazz, shakes hands with a cop in the video. The directors freeze it and zoom in on the burly, grinning Shabazz. \"This is the first time that the world has seen the face of the man who took the life of Malcolm X,\" declares Abdur-Raman Muhammad. Booker's campaign voiceover continues, \"We are making Newark safer and stronger. And together, Newark, we are taking back our city.\"\n\nIn the next scene, Dretzin is in Booker's office. There are many awkward interviews in the docuseries; they make for addictive viewing. This is easily the most awkward and most addictive of all.\n\nDretzin: Are you familiar with . . . William Bradley, or Al-Mustafa Shabazz?\n\nBooker: In Newark, from Newark?\n\nDretzin: Yeah.\n\nBooker: Yeah.\n\nDretzin: Do you know that he . . .\n\nBooker: [gleaming eyes wondering where this is going]\n\nDretzin: . . . appeared in your reelection campaign video of 2010?\n\nBooker: [looks down and to the left]\n\nDretzin: . . . And that he is one of the people who allegedly murdered Malcolm X?\n\nBooker: [eyes going very wide, head tilting up, slight smirk] That connection I was not aware of. No.\n\nDretzin: You weren't aware of that?\n\nBooker: You are breaking news, to me. He's one of the people that is alleged by whom?\n\n[Dretzin tells him that Hayer named him.]\n\nBooker: I was not aware of that.\n\nDretzin asks Booker if he wants to see the video. Booker (whose face says no) asks, \"Do you have it with you right now?\" The laptop lands on Booker's lap; his eyes are bright with anger, his mouth is smiling - his scheduler's head is going to roll. The video plays, and Dretzin indicates Shabazz. \"Yeah,\" says Booker, \"I know him well. I know him well.\" Soon, they go back and forth, Booker saying vaguely that we should get to the truth. When Dretzin uses the word \"assassin,\" or \"potential assassin,\" Booker flinches, moves out of the shot, and adds, \"Please keep saying 'potential.'\"\n\nIn the final episode, Muhammad wonders aloud why the FBI's narrative around the killing differed from the official case. If both Hayer and Butler insist Butler was innocent, why was he allowed to languish in prison for two decades? Muhammad's research on Al-Mustafa Shabazz/Bradley finds that multiple descriptions, including his status as a lieutenant in the Newark Mosque, match the eyewitness descriptions the FBI had on file. Then he examines an FBI internal memo warning that Shabazz/Bradley's fitting the description of the trigger man \"should not be furnished to the NYCPD without first receiving Bureau authority.\" Strange. Norman 3X Johnson, a light-skinned man from a different mosque, had already been arrested as the trigger man. \"Why wouldn't the FBI immediately notify the New York City Police Department?\" Muhammad asks. Yet another file provides a possible answer. It said that \"a lieutenant from Newark may have been involved in the slaying of Malcolm [X],\" and that the New York Police Department \"had . . . not . . . been advised of the identity of this [lieutenant] for use in the [Malcolm X] case.\"\n\nWhile a jury considered the innocence or guilt of these two men, men who didn't match the FBI's description of the person with the shotgun or others at the Audubon Ballroom that afternoon, for whom there was no physical evidence, the FBI just watched. Once these innocent men were convicted, it appears, they closed their own file concluding that it was Bradley. They did so without offering to correct the case and made sure anyone attempting to correct the record would notify them first. After two decades in prison, Johnson died in 2009 without ever clearing his name. \"It just makes you wonder,\" says Muhammad, \"could Bradley have been an informant working for the FBI?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad prepares to confront him, hoping to \"look the man eye to eye, man to man [and ask him,] 'How could you do that, how could you do that, how could you do that to our people?'\" But he learns during production that Bradley has died. With this news, he admits to feeling depressed.\n\nPerhaps to rechannel the series's energy, the final segment does the most to personalize Muhammad. We meet his son, watch him recite poetry, and then point to the Marable biography his father's important work appears in. We learn from Muhammad in voiceover that much of his scholarship has \"come out of my own pocket.\" If the state doesn't care about the truth of who killed Malcolm X, so that Americans don't know fifty-five years later, this produces a chilling effect on the media. But stories like this, time and again, are too hot to report, the real story unsayable, protected like Shabazz and other collaborating men.\n\nThe final episode also does the most to personalize Butler. Bearded, acerbic, afraid to hope for much, he tells the interviewers that, thanks to his two decades in prison, \"I don't know my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren or my great-great-grandchildren.\" Caught between narratives, that of an ex-con who is expected to repent and look optimistically forward and that of a framed man, he can engage only in \"filler talk\" with his children, and he feels like \"a father in name only.\" The segment shows him looking up his family members on Facebook, saying, \"I think this is my granddaughter.\"\n\nMuhammad, sitting next to him on a bench outside, promises to file a wrongful conviction report for him. Butler, now Aziz, is hesitant to reignite his hope. His hesitancy - to hope - is moving. The subtext is the crisis of masculinity, which one hears in the first episode, when Muhammad talks about being persecuted by police for dating who he wants, and then being drawn to Malcolm's \"manhood.\" (The series's focus on men, to the near exclusion of black women scholars, has been criticized .) Malcolm's own quest for black dignity, and black self-determination, was of course violated and disfigured by his death as a warning to these men and to their families.\n\nThe week before Malcolm was to give his fateful talk at the Audubon Ballroom, on Valentine's Day, his house was firebombed. While he was able to evacuate his wife and children before the house was consumed by flames, it took nearly an hour for police to arrive. \"I stood in my underwear in my driveway with a gun for 45 minutes,\" he complained. In need of money, without clothes or insurance, and effectively homeless, he continued his busy schedule of paid speaking appearances. The night before his Audubon speech, he stayed at the Statler-Hilton across the street from Penn Station. His security team, led by his personal bodyguard, Eugene Roberts, would have kept his location under tight wraps. Twelve years earlier, military scientist Frank Olson plunged to his death from the thirteenth floor of the Statler, in a killing ruled to have been a suicide (Netflix's Wormwood , however, reveals it was probably a CIA murder). At 3 a.m., Malcolm's hotel room phone rang. When he picked up: silence. Were his whereabouts known to those behind the death threats? Everyone else on the roster to speak with him that day called in with last-minute cancellations.\n\nWhen he was shot, his bodyguard, Roberts, smashed a chair over the back of one of the assailants, probably Bradley, and leapt onto the stage and gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The series cuts to Gouza frowning, calling Malcolm a \"thug,\" suggesting it was inappropriate for Roberts to try to help Malcolm live. Why? Because Roberts was also a paid NYPD informant, working undercover for BOSSI. The goal had been to penetrate Malcolm's security detail and make himself useful to the activist. He was chosen partly because he had no family ties to NYPD. For Roberts to leap onstage and perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was in violation of police-spy protocol, the Breslin stand-in Gouza suggests. Yet nevertheless, for several minutes, Roberts kept breathing air into Malcolm's lungs, trying to save him, until he realized Malcolm had no pulse and couldn't be saved.\n\nWhile Malcolm's widow continued to try to save his life, police were busy with the one person they caught who actually was involved in the conspiracy to murder Malcolm X: Hayer. Though they had stood down when they should have been guarding the entrance - and the speaker - they couldn't have avoided nabbing Hayer, even if they had wanted to, because of the brawl underway after admirers of Malcolm saw Hayer with a gun. But while police wrestled with those attacking Hayer, footage shows a ringer for Al-Mustafa Shabazz, Malcolm's presumptive killer, skirting the melee.\n\nAt least nine informants crowded into the Audubon Ballroom that Sunday afternoon. Did Malcolm play his game that day, trying to guess which ones were the informants? \"I don't think he understood that his closest associate,\" Bouza tells the audience drily, \"was working for us.\"\n\nAn extraordinary record of its subject matter, Who Killed Malcolm X? features a grueling clip of Betty Shabazz being interviewed after her husband's murder. It is the most powerful segment of archival footage in the series, and it feels voyeuristic and exploitative, even five and a half decades later. She is dazed, freshly traumatized, looking down. Off camera, in milder tones, a battery of journalists, all men, fire a barrage of leading questions at her. The questions are restatements of Malcolm X's alleged feelings of racial superiority, some with an insinuation that he brought this violence on himself. They are uttered gently, almost whispered, but with violent, baiting undertones. Unmoved to respond, Shabazz appears unwilling even to gesture at an answer. Did she remember her husband, who had rejected police protection after the firebombing, saying,\n\nThe policemen in this country are the ones who are responsible for the brutality, the policemen themselves have become guilty of violating the rights of the people . . . So what are the people to do? Call upon the same ones who are victimizing them to protect them? No, they have to protect themselves.\n\nShe blinks, her mouth parts briefly. One of the newsmen asks if she was about to answer, but she stays quiet a little longer.\n\nPicture that February meeting with Malcolm, after his main source of income, his ministerial work with the Nation of Islam, is lost, and the FBI knocks on his door. Where is Betty when her husband welcomes them into their house, and they invite him to snitch? Now picture that same meeting taking place with one of Elijah Muhammad's surrogates, one of those in line to inherit what Malcolm helped the Messenger build. Picture that surrogate admitting that his curiosity is piqued, conceding that by helping keep Malcolm out of the Nation of Islam, both their missions, the FBI's and his own, will be served. Within Elijah Muhammad's inner circle of just half of a dozen people, the series reports, sat another FBI informant.\n\nNow picture Eugene Roberts, who goes secretly into the precinct only when absolutely necessary (like the morning after Malcolm's murder), being handed a file about Elijah Muhammad's extramarital affairs. Doesn't he hand it to Malcolm? Isn't that his job? Malcolm starts to ask questions, to interview these women and girls, just as the Messenger is telling him not to be too hard on the LAPD after they murdered his friend Ronald Stokes. Does this complicate the idea that it was merely \"the rift\" that grew up naturally between them, which led to Malcolm's murder? The winds of the surveillance state, of COINTELPRO and the CIA's tandem Operation CHAOS, blew more toxic material, more poison into rifts like these - to deny these men respectability, dignity. \"If the NYPD had an agent in the Audubon that day, close enough to give him mouth-to-mouth,\" Abdur-Raman Muhammad concludes, it \"makes me wonder who else law enforcement had on the inside that nobody knows about.\"\n\nAs the barrage of hostile questions continues, the newly widowed Betty Shabazz continues to look down in silence, until something flashes, like she has suddenly remembered something. Looking up, at first softly, she utters her first phrase in this new phase of her life, her life preserving a legacy and carrying it forward: \"I think he accomplished more than can be realized at this moment.\"\n\nJoel Whitney is the author of Finks: How the CIA Tricked the World's Best Writers .

Keith Ellison's reelection bid for the state's attorney general is playing out in that shadow.\n\nRepresetative Keith Ellison (D-MN) speaks at a news conference, urging Congress to protect programs such as Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. (Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDo you trust Keith Ellison to keep you and your family safe? According to Jim Schultz, the Republican nominee for attorney general in Minnesota, this is the single defining question of the race to lead the state's attorney general's office for the next four years.\n\nOne ad claims that Ellison is \"extreme\" and has \"let violence spread like cancer.\" Schultz has focused so intensively on crime, his messaging has verged on the surreal. \"It's a sad day in Minnesota when I hear from countless parents who are too concerned for their children's safety to let them go trick-or-treating in their own neighborhoods,\" Schultz tweeted on the morning of Halloween. \"We are losing the state we know and love.\"\n\nSchultz is not running an original campaign playbook. Republicans have attacked Democrats over crime in congressional races throughout the country, and local elections in overwhelmingly Democratic cities like Los Angeles and Portland have been similarly dominated by concerns about crime, homelessness, and public safety. The potency of those attacks was made clear in San Francisco earlier this year, where voters recalled progressive district attorney Chesa Boudin despite zero evidence to suggest that Boudin's reformist policies were responsible for any sort of surge in the city's crime rate.\n\nBoudin paid the price for voters' frustration with the visible effects of overlapping crises in housing and public health. But he at least was the district attorney in San Francisco, responsible for prosecuting crime. Ellison is not a district attorney. He's an attorney general, whose job is largely not to prosecute violent crime, but to protect the civil and consumer rights of Minnesotans. Schultz's campaign is predicated on dramatically reorganizing the office away from its consumer protection function and investing resources into criminal prosecutions - even though it's not clear that a state attorney general has any legal authority to usurp criminal prosecutions from local authorities.\n\n\"The way that Jim Schultz describes it, it sounds like he's running for chief of police,\" Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St Thomas and former prosecutor, said. \"And even if it was a county attorney, someone whose primary job is prosecution, that person isn't charge isn't in charge of the police either.\"\n\nThe attorney general in Minnesota can typically only prosecute criminal cases in two situations: when invited to do so by a county attorney or asked to do so by the governor. Ellison, in his first term, was called in very memorably by Governor Tim Walz to prosecute former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.\n\nWhere Ellison's supporters say he's thrived as attorney general is in a very different arena: using his office as a weapon to prosecute corporate malfeasance. In his first term, Ellison has sued fossil fuel companies including ExxonMobil and Koch Industries for misleading the public about the effects of climate change; sued Fleet Farm for knowingly selling firearms to straw buyers; sued one of the state's largest and most notorious landlords over the conditions of their housing units; and sued JUUL and its investor Altria for misleading the public about the effects of its products and reached settlements with opioid manufacturers that have netted the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Ellison has also created a unit in the attorney general's office to fight wage theft.\n\n\"He's been remarkably effective,\" Perry Moriearty, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, said. \"He's surrounded himself [with] staff that are really, really good. And I'm a defense lawyer - I don't love every prosecution out there.\"\n\nEllison's office is a far cry from the one he inherited from his predecessor Lori Swanson, who, according to reporting from the Intercept , pressured government employees to do political work on her behalf and was reluctant to attend political events in the Twin Cities for fear of being seen as too progressive.\n\nIt also stands in stark contrast to what Schultz, a corporate hedge fund lawyer who has never prosecuted a case or served in public office, is offering. Schultz has accused Ellison of making it \"his office's mission to drive Main Street businesses into the ground and out of state\" and said that he would not use the resources of the attorney general's office to file suits against major corporations. He's also an opponent of abortion rights who previously served on the board of a far-right antiabortion organization, a live issue given that Ellison has promised to fight for the rights of people from surrounding states to come to Minnesota to receive abortion care.\n\nIt's little wonder that many of the corporations Ellison has targeted for endangering the safety of the public are spending significant sums of money to replace him. Koch Industries, ExxonMobil, and the American Petroleum Institute have all dumped contributions into the coffers of the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), as have JUUL and Altria, Pfizer, Philip Morris, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\n\"To have an elected official who is truly fighting for working people feels too rare,\" Andrew Ulasich, an organizer with Faith in Minnesota, said. \"And I think [Ellison] is facing a reaction from corporate power for doing that.\"\n\nOf course, Schultz's advertisements and those funded by RAGA don't attack Ellison as overly hostile toward \"Main Street\" businesses like ExxonMobil and JUUL. They're attacking him on crime. The remarkable thing is that Ellison's most prominent achievement in his four years on the job was rescuing the prosecution of Chauvin and, ultimately, winning a precedent-setting conviction. Chauvin was the first white Minnesota police officer ever convicted of murdering a black person.\n\nEllison also brought a first-degree manslaughter charge against former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter for the killing of Daunte Wright during a traffic stop last year; Potter was also convicted. If anything, the fundamental disagreement between Ellison and Schultz is about what kinds of criminal behavior are most in need of prosecuting: Ellison has gone after corporations and criminal police officers, Schultz has proposed prosecuting \"carjacking gangs.\"\n\nSchultz has been complimentary of the prosecution of Chauvin, which he called \"appropriate,\" but has also claimed without clear evidence that Ellison himself somehow had little to do with it. \"You sat in the back of the courtroom, you took some notes, and you opened the door from time to time,\" Schultz said at a debate in late October. \"That was your role in the George Floyd prosecution, Keith.\"\n\n\"Jim, how would you know?\" Ellison asked. \"How would you possibly know?\"\n\nWere this a different elected official with the same record, it might be a very different race. Scott Jensen, the Republican nominee for governor, has repeatedly attacked Walz over his public safety record but has trailed in most polls. But Ellison is one of the country's most visible elected officials, a black Muslim serving in a state that had never elected a black person to a partisan statewide office until he won his first term as attorney general four years ago, and he is living in a city that for a number of Minnesotans has become a codeword for chaos and disorder.\n\nHe also, no matter his job description, hasn't shrunk from the fight for true public safety. Last year, Ellison, whose son is a progressive member of the Minneapolis City Council, linked up with Ilhan Omar and became the only statewide elected official to endorse a measure to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety. It was a politically risky decision, but one wholly consistent with Ellison's politics and background as a Minneapolis criminal defense attorney, community activist, and US representative well-versed in the department's gruesome record of racism and violence against marginalized communities.\n\n\"I live three miles from where George Floyd was murdered, and I think it's incredibly hard to be this proximate to that type of human suffering that evokes decades and centuries of what are effectively lynchings of unarmed black men, and not say, 'Something drastic has to change,'\" Moriearty said.\n\nWhat happened next, in a climate of media-driven fear and police backlash , was predictable: the public safety amendment lost by twelve points and a number of its proponents have paid an ongoing price. Omar's summer, in particular, may have been a harbinger of things to come: while her fellow Squad members easily won renomination in their respective primaries, Omar only narrowly fended off a challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels - a conservative Democrat whose support for the Minneapolis Police Department was so robust he co-filed a lawsuit against the city in 2020 in an attempt to force it to hire more officers.\n\nEllison's campaign and its allies have focused on informing voters about the work he's done to hold corporations accountable as attorney general. But in a state that is still living in the long shadow of the murder of George Floyd, the uprising it sparked, and the backlash that followed, Ellison's fate may be tied to what Ulasich called an \"ongoing referendum\" on policing.\n\n\"I really do think that part of the big support for Jim Schultz right now is a response to that, and it's coming up in the debates, he won't let it go, and a lot of people are saying it too . . . 'Keith is a defunder,'\" said Hannah Merrill, Ulasich's colleague with Faith in Minnesota.\n\nIt's hardly mattered that Minnesota's homicide rate remains well below the national average and that gun crime in Minneapolis has actually declined significantly in the lead-up to the election, and it's hardly mattered that Ellison doesn't have any direct link to the crime rate anyway. The police in Minneapolis have not been defunded.\n\nBut \"Part of the politics of the moment right now is that people are driven by fear rather than hope,\" Osler said. \"And I think Ellison is better at hope.\"\n\nAbe Asher is a journalist whose reporting on politics, social movements, and the climate has been published in the Nation , VICE News , the Portland Mercury , and other outlets.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "4 Unarmed Black Men Have Been Killed By Police in the Last Month\n\nPolice confront protestors in Ferguson AP\n\nFerguson, Missouri, has been consumed with protests since Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, was shot to death by police on Saturday. Brown was not the only African-American man killed by police in recent weeks under disputed circumstances. Consider these three other recent incidents:\n\nEric Garner, Staten Island, New York / July 17: Eric Garner, a 43-year-old asthmatic father of six, was confronted by New York City police officers for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes. When he resisted being cuffed, an officer appeared to put him in a chokehold-a tactic banned by the department since 1993. A video of the arrest, first obtained by the New York Daily News , shows Garner gasping,\"I can't breathe!\" while officers relentlessly smother him:\n\nThe city medical examiner later ruled Garner's death a homicide, saying neck compression from the chokehold killed him. But the officers involved in the arrest may not face charges if the homicide is found to be justifiable. Staten Island district attorney Daniel Donovan i s investigating the case .\n\nJohn Crawford, Beavercreek, Ohio / August 5: Two police officers responded to a 911 call about a man waving a gun at customers inside a Walmart store. According the Beavercreek police department, 22-year-old John Crawford disregarded officers' orders to disarm before being fatally shot in the chest. Crawford's gun turned out to be a .177 calibre BB rifle that he'd picked up from a store shelf. Walmart surveillance camera footage was turned over to the police but hasn't been released to the public or Crawford's family. \"Why did John Crawford, a Walmart customer, get shot and killed carrying a BB gun in a store that sells BB guns?\" asked Michael Wright, the family's attorney, during a joint press conference with the NAACP. \"All the family demands is answers.\" The Ohio Attorney General's Office is investigating the case.\n\nEzell Ford, Los Angeles, California / August 11: When police conducted an \"investigative stop\" of 25-year-old Ezell Ford on a Los Angeles sidewalk, he \"wheeled around and basically tackled the lead officer,\" then went after his weapon, an LAPD spokesperson told the LA Times . But in an i nterview with KTLA News , a woman who identified herself as Ford's mother said he was lying on the ground, complying with the officers' orders, when he was shot in the back. On Sunday afternoon, a handful of people protested the shooting outside LAPD's headquarters. The LA County District Attorney and the department's Force Investigation Unit are looking into the shooting.\n\nSo how often are unarmed African-American men getting shot by the police? The short answer is that nobody really knows, but it's clear that blacks are often disproportionately targeted by law enforcement. In Missouri, for example, African Americans were 66 percent more likely than whites to be stopped by police in 2013, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch . A similar disparity exists in many other states and cities .\n\nUPDATE (8/14/14): Another case has come to light in California:\n\nDante Parker, Victorville, California / August 12: A Victorville resident told police that a robbery suspect had fled on a bicycle. The police detained Dante Parker, a 36-year-old pressman at the Daily Press newspaper, apparently because they found him nearby on a bike. Though Parker had no criminal record (other than a DUI), a scuffle ensued and Parker was tased repeatedly when he resisted arrest, according to witnesses . He began breathing heavily and was taken to a hospital, where he died. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is conducting an investigation.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Exactly How Often Do Police Shoot Unarmed Black Men?\n\nJeff Roberson/AP\n\nThe killing of Michael Brown by police in Ferguson, Missouri, was no anomaly: As we reported yesterday, Brown is one of at least four unarmed black men who died at the hands of police in the last month alone . There are many more cases from years past. As Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Missouri chapter put it in a statement of condolence to Brown's family, \"Unarmed African-American men are shot and killed by police at an alarming rate. This pattern must stop.\"\n\nBut quantifying that pattern is difficult. Federal databases that track police use of force or arrest-related deaths paint only a partial picture. Police department data is scattered and fragmented. No agency appears to track the number of police shootings or killings of unarmed victims in a systematic, comprehensive way.\n\nHere's some of what we do know:\n\nPrevious attempts to analyze racial bias in police shootings have arrived at similar conclusions. In 2007, ColorLines and the Chicago Reporter investigated fatal police shootings in 10 major cities, and found that there were a disproportionately high number of African Americans among police shooting victims in every one, particularly in New York, San Diego, and Las Vegas.\n\n\"We need not look for individual racists to say that we have a culture of policing that is really rubbing salt into longstanding racial wounds,\" NAACP president Cornell Williams Brooks told Mother Jones. It's a culture in which people suspected of minor crimes are met with \"overwhelmingly major, often lethal, use of force,\" he says. In Oakland, California, the NAACP reported that out of 45 officer-involved shootings in the city between 2004 and 2008, 37 of those shot were black. None were white. One-third of the shootings resulted in fatalities. Although weapons were not found in 40 percent of cases, the NAACP found, no officers were charged. (These numbers don't include 22-year-old Oscar Grant, who was shot and killed by a transit authority officer at the Fruitvale BART station on New Year's Day of 2009.) The New York City Police Department has reported similar trends in its firearms discharge report , which shows that more black people have been shot by NYPD officers between 2000 and 2011 than have Hispanics or whites. When you look at the racial breakdown of New Yorkers, black people are disproportionately represented among those targeted as criminal shooting suspects, firearms arrestees, and those fired upon or struck by police gunfire.\n\n\"We need not look for individual racists to say that we have a culture of policing that is really rubbing salt into longstanding racial wounds,\" NAACP president Cornell Williams Brooks told Mother Jones.

Delores Jones-Brown, a law professor and director of the Center on Race, Crime, and Statistics at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, has identified dozens of black men and women who have died at the hands of police going back as far as 1994. She notes that while these incidents happen regularly, it often takes a high-profile case, such as Brown's, to bring other recent incidents to national attention.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the patterns that we've been seeing recently are consistent: The police don't show as much care when they are handling incidents that involve young black men and women, and so they do shoot and kill,\" says Jones-Brown, a former assistant prosecutor in Monmouth County, New Jersey. \"And then for whatever reason, juries and prosecutor's offices are much less likely to indict or convict.\"\n\nBetween 2003 and 2009, the DOJ reported that 4,813 people died while in the process of arrest or in the custody of law enforcement . These include people who died before an officer physically placed him or her under custody or arrest. This data, known as arrest-related deaths, doesn't reveal a significant discrepancy between whites, blacks, or hispanics. It also doesn't specify how many victims were unarmed. According to the FBI, which has tracked justifiable homicides up to 2012, 410 felons died at the hands of a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. *\n\nBut black people are more likely than whites or Hispanics to experience a police officer's threat or use of force , according to the Department of Justice's Police Public Contact Survey in 2008 , the latest year for which data is available. Of those who felt that police had used or threatened them with force that year, about 74 percent felt those actions were excessive. In another DOJ survey of police behavior during traffic and street stops in 2011, blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to believe that the reason for the stop was legitimate.\n\nThe Justice Department has investigated possible systemic abuse of power by police in at least 16 cities.\n\nPolice shootings of unarmed black people aren't limited to poor or predominantly black communities. Jones-Brown points to examples where police officers have shot unarmed black men and women in Hollywood , Riverside (California) , and Prince Georges County-a Maryland suburb known as the most affluent US county with an African-American majority. \"Part of the problem is that black people realize that you don't have to be poor, you don't have to be in your own community...and this can happen to you,\" she says. These killings occur against black people of varying socioeconomic backgrounds: \"Actors, professional football players, college students, high school grads. They happen to black cops, too.\"\n\nYet, the lack of comprehensive data means that we can't know if there's been an upsurge in such cases, says Samuel Walker , a criminal justice scholar at the University of Nebraska in Omaha and author of The Color of Justice: Race, Ethnicity, and Crime in America . \"It's impossible to make any definitive statement on whether there were more incidents in the last 5 to 10 years than in the past,\" he says. \"We just don't have that kind of data.\" But what is certain, Walker says, is that the fatal shooting in Ferguson \"was just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nUPDATE (8/15/14): USA Today reported that on average there were 96 cases of a white police officer killing a black person each year between 2006 and 2012, based on justifiable homicides reported to the FBI by local police. As I reported above, the FBI's justifiable homicides database paints only a partial picture-accounting for cases in which an officer killed a felon. It does not necessarily include cases involving victims like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and others who were unarmed when confronted by police. The data in this post has been updated with 2012 numbers, and the map has been updated to reflect that certain cases have been closed .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Here Are 13 Killings by Police Captured on Video in the Past Year\n\nFrom Ferguson last summer to Baltimore this spring, police killings of unarmed black men under questionable circumstances have sparked outrage, civil unrest, and a heated national debate about policing in the United States. As Mother Jones and others have reported, there isn't sufficient data available for determining how many people are shot to death or otherwise killed by police each year, or how the issue might be trending. But more such incidents appear to be getting captured on video than ever before, due in part to the ubiquity of cellphone cameras. The footage-not only from cellphones, but also surveillance cameras, dashboard cameras in police cars, and police-worn body cameras -has caused a tectonic shift in public awareness.\n\nBelow are 13 videos of fatal police encounters recorded between March 16, 2014, and April 4, 2015. Most of the suspects killed were black. A majority of the suspects were unarmed. In three cases, the suspects killed reportedly had serious mental-health problems-which may have been known to the police in at least two of those cases at the time of the shootings.\n\nMother Jones has contacted law enforcement officials about the status of these 13 cases: Investigations are ongoing in eight of them. In one case, now six months old, the two officers involved still haven't been questioned by investigators . Officers in the five other cases have been absolved of wrongdoing via local or state proceedings. (One of those five cases is currently under review by the US Department of Justice.) Three of the 24 officers total who were involved in the 13 cases are currently facing criminal charges.\n\nSuspect killed: James Boyd Race: White When: March 16, 2014 Where: Albuquerque, New Mexico Footage from: Police-worn body camera\n\nWhat happened: James Boyd, a homeless man who reportedly suffered from mental illnesses for years, was shot by Albuquerque police officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez after a standoff over Boyd's hillside encampment in March 2014. Randi McGinn, the special prosecutor appointed to take over the case in April 2015, told Mother Jones that she is likely to pursue homicide charges, originally brought by the district attorney , and will make a determination in the next few weeks.\n\nSuspect killed: Richard Ramirez Race: White/Hispanic When: April 14, 2014 Where: Billings, Montana Footage from: Police dashboard camera\n\nWhat happened: Richard Ramirez was in the back of a car that was pulled over by officer Grant Morrison. Morrison later testified that, after he ordered the passengers to put up their hands, Ramirez repeatedly dropped his left hand. Morrison stated that he thought Ramirez-who'd been identified as a suspect in an armed robbery the prior night-was reaching for a gun, so he shot him three times. Ramirez was unarmed. (In February 2013, Morrison shot and killed another man while on duty, and was cleared of any wrongdoing.) In January 2015, a coroner's jury ruled the action a justifiable homicide.\n\nSuspect killed: Jason Harrison Race: Black When: June 14, 2014 Where: Dallas Footage from: Police-worn body camera\n\nWhat happened: Harrison's mother called police saying that her son was off his medication and acting out, and requested help to get him to a hospital. When Dallas police officers John Rogers and Andrew Hutchins arrived at the front door, Harrison's mother stepped out, letting the officers know that her son was bipolar and schizophrenic. When Harrison came to the door, the officers told him to drop a screwdriver he was holding, and shot him when he failed to comply. According to the Dallas Morning News , the officers' attorney said that they feared for their lives, because killing someone using a screwdriver would be \"pretty easy. It'll only take one blow.\" In April 2015, a grand jury decided not to indict the officers.\n\nSuspect killed: Eric Garner Race: Black When: July 17, 2014 Where: Staten Island, New York Footage from: Bystander's cellphone\n\nWhat happened: In July 2014, police approached Eric Garner on a Staten Island street after Garner had broken up a fight, and then started questioning him about selling loose cigarettes. NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo wrapped his arm around Garner's neck from behind in a takedown maneuver and held Garner on the ground as Garner repeatedly said, \"I can't breathe.\" Garner was later pronounced dead at the hospital. In December 2014, a grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo .\n\nSuspect killed: John Crawford III Race: Black Where: August 5, 2014 Where: Beavercreek, Ohio Footage from: Walmart surveillance camera\n\nWhat happened: Crawford, 22, was walking around in a Walmart holding a BB gun that had been for sale on the store's shelves. Responding to a 911 call about a man waving a gun, Beavercreek officer Sean Williams and Sergeant David Darkow arrived at the Walmart. The officers later told investigators that Williams opened fire after Crawford failed to comply with their orders to drop the gun. A grand jury decided in September 2014 not to indict the officers. The US Department of Justice launched a review of the case last September, which is ongoing, a DOJ spokesperson confirmed to Mother Jones .\n\nSuspect killed: Dillon Taylor Race: White When: August 11, 2014 Where: Salt Lake City Footage from: Police-worn body camera\n\nWhat happened: Dillon Taylor, his brother, and his cousin were outside a convenience store and allegedly matched the description from a 911 call about three men, including one brandishing a gun. Officer Bron Cruz confronted the trio and began following Taylor, who initially walked away with his back toward Cruz. Taylor then turned around and kept walking backward, and had both hands in his waistband, according to Cruz. Cruz said he thought Taylor had a gun, and he repeatedly yelled at Taylor to get his hands out, before firing two shots. Taylor was unarmed. In September 2014, the Salt Lake City District Attorney determined the shooting was justified.\n\nSuspect killed: Kajieme Powell Race: Black When: August 19, 2014 Where: St. Louis Footage from: Bystander's cellphone\n\nWhat happened: A bystander's cellphone video shows Powell, 25, walking around outside a corner grocery store after allegedly stealing energy drinks and pastries. As he paced back and forth, a police car pulled onto the sidewalk just up the street and two police officers got out. Powell, who was brandishing a knife, began to approach the officers (whose names have not been released), telling them to shoot him. After a pause, he took another step toward the officers and they opened fire. St. Louis Metro police chief Sam Dotson later stated that Powell \"came at the officers\" while gripping the knife. In February, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department did not request charges when it handed off its investigation to the circuit attorney's office, whose probe is ongoing, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nSuspect killed: Tamir Rice Race: Black When: November 22, 2014 Where: Cleveland Footage from: Surveillance camera\n\nWhat happened: Rice, 12, was playing in a local park when someone called 911 and reported that a person, \"probably a juvenile,\" was waving a gun around that was \"probably fake.\" Police officers Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback pulled up to Rice in their patrol car and Loehmann got out and shot Rice almost instantly. No charges have been filed in the case. As Mother Jones first reported last week, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department, which took control of the case in January, has yet to interview the two officers in its ongoing investigation.\n\nSuspect killed: Jerame Reid Race: Black When: December 30, 2014 Where: Bridgeton, New Jersey Footage from: Dashboard camera\n\nWhat happened: Reid was a passenger in a car that was pulled over for allegedly running a stop sign. Officers Braheme Days and Roger Worley approached the car, and despite verbal warnings from the officers, Reid opened his door and reportedly got out of the car with his hands up, after saying \"I ain't doing nothing. I'm not reaching for nothing, bro,\" according to the Associated Press . Both Days and Worley shot him. The officers were placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, and Reid's family has filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against the city of Bridgeton. (Days is also facing a separate lawsuit for alleged rape.)\n\nSuspect killed: Antonio Zambrano-Montes Race: Hispanic When: February 10, 2015 Where: Pasco, Washington Footage from: Bystander's cellphone\n\nWhat happened: After responding to a call of a man throwing rocks in a grocery store parking lot, three Pasco police officers tried to arrest Zambrano. They pursued him on foot, shooting at him as he ran, and they fired at close range as he turned around to face them. In the video, his hands appear to have been empty. Officers Ryan Flanagan, Adam Wright, and Adrian Alaniz were placed on paid leave, and an investigation is ongoing .\n\nSuspect killed: Charly Keunang Race : Black When: March 1, 2015 Where: Los Angeles Footage from: Bystander's cellphone\n\nWhat happened: Six police officers were responding to a 911 call about an alleged robbery and assault on LA's Skid Row, in which Keunang was reportedly a suspect. During a struggle with police, Keunang, who reportedly suffered from mental health problems, allegedly reached for an officer's gun, prompting several officers to open fire. The three officers who fired their guns-Sergeant Chand Syed, and Officers Francisco Martinez and Daniel Torres-have been reassigned to administrative duty and an internal police department investigation is ongoing , the LAPD confirmed to Mother Jones. Keunang's family has filed a $20 million civil claim against the city.\n\nSuspect killed: Phillip White Race : Black When: March 31, 2015 Where: Vineland, New Jersey Footage from: Bystander's cellphone\n\nWhat happened: Responding to a call of a man acting erratically, police handcuffed and restrained the 32-year-old White. According to investigators, White became unresponsive and received CPR in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, where he eventually died. Police called it an \"in-custody non-shooting death,\" but witnesses on the scene said the officers beat White and that a police dog bit him in the face. An investigation by the Cumberland County prosecutor's office is ongoing . The officers in the case, Louis Platania and Rich Janasiak, are both on administrative leave, according to news reports.\n\nSuspect killed: Walter Scott Race : Black When: April 4, 2015 Where: North Charleston, South Carolina Footage from: Police dashboard camera and bystander's cellphone\n\nWhat happened: Dashboard camera footage showed Scott running away from his vehicle after North Charleston police officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over for a broken brake light . In the following minutes, recorded on a bystander's cellphone, Slager caught up to Scott in an open field, and after a short struggle, Scott, who was unarmed, broke free and began to run away. Slager then shot Scott multiple times from behind. Slager was fired from his job and faces a felony murder charge.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Unarmed Black Children Are Not Being Gunned Down By Cops\n\nDemonstrators gather in April to protest the fatal police shooting of Crown Heights native Saheed Vassell on Utica Avenue and Montgomery Street. Taidgh Barron/ZUMA\n\nAtrios declares Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post one of America's Worst Humans today. The link goes to the Splinter's Katherine Krueger, who explains:\n\nGather 'round before I have a fucking stroke.\n\nKessler's \"analysis\" column was responding to a reader who asked about a viral [Beto] O'Rourke clip, during which the congressman, who is running against Ted Cruz, says: \"Black men, unarmed, black teenagers, unarmed, and black children, unarmed, are being killed at a frightening level right now, including by members of law enforcement without accountability and without justice.\"\n\nBut Glenn, tell me, are we really killing so many unarmed black kids?...Perhaps most egregiously, Kessler cast aside the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old who was murdered by a police officer while holding a toy gun....So, the \"frightening\" part is NOT that police officers are gunning down literal children in our streets. In fact-*shoving glasses up nose, sniveling wildly*-that's actually statistically quite rare, you see!! As if the very idea that police are killing anyone, particularly children, in our streets AT ALL is not \"frightening\" enough. This column is what happens when you're straining so hard to uphold some misplaced standard of \"objectivity\" and are so horned up about delineating fact from fiction that you lose any sense of moral clarity\n\nKessler's moral clarity is perfectly fine. The question from his reader was about whether police are killing unarmed black kids at \"frightening levels.\" He concludes that they aren't, and he's right. Here's a recent paper that examines the number of all unarmed suspects killed by police in 2014 (the year Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson) and 2015:\n\nAnother component of the national debate is that police are wantonly killing unarmed suspects, especially if they are black. We find no support for this claim in our data.... Less than 1 percent of the victims of police killing in our data were unarmed. In other words, police killings of unarmed suspects-especially unarmed black men-garner massive media coverage (and not without reason), but they are far less common than the prevailing narrative suggests.\n\n\"Less than 1 percent.\" How much less than 1 percent? The authors seem oddly reticent to provide a number, but it slips out a few paragraphs later:\n\nNext, we turn to the important question of whether there are racial disparities in officer killings of unarmed or less threatening suspects. However, as noted earlier, the extremely low number of killings of unarmed suspects undercuts this claim from the start. Indeed, there are so few killings of unarmed suspects that those killings (n = 4) cannot be statistically scrutinized.\n\nAccording to this paper, there were two (2) police killings of unarmed suspects each year. That's all suspects-all races and all ages. Kessler, by contrast, uses an independent Washington Post database that contains more detail on age and race, and concludes that during the period 2015-2018 there was at most one shooting of an unarmed black child (it depends on whether you consider 12-year-old Tamir Rice \"armed\" because he had a toy gun). Among older children during the same years, police killed three unarmed black teens and six unarmed teens who were white or Hispanic. Altogether, Kessler counts roughly one unarmed child and two unarmed teens of all races who were killed by police each year.\n\n(Things change when we get to adults, but the number depends a lot on how you defined \"armed\": Do you count only guns as arms, or do you also count knives, bats, etc? Kessler doesn't count knives and other weapons and therefore concludes that 90 unarmed black adults were killed over the course of four years. The other study counts anything potentially lethal as \"armed,\" and thus finds only a total of four killings of unarmed adults over the course of two years.)\n\nThere is nothing wrong with any of this. Are unarmed children being gunned down by police at harrowing levels? Obviously not, if this data is correct. Are unarmed suspects in general being gunned down at massive levels? It turns out that this depends on whether you count someone wielding a knife as \"unarmed.\"\n\nI have my issues with fact checkers, but this one is perfectly fine. Nonetheless, Kessler obviously knows he's going to get his ass handed to him merely for addressing this question with anything other than the usual bromides:\n\nThere's little question the black community faces extraordinary levels of violence. But whether O'Rouke's statement qualifies as Pinocchio or Geppetto-worthy depends on how you hear it. There have been virtually no shootings of unarmed children by police in the past five years. But hundreds of black children have been homicide victims. Given the varying interpretations of O'Rouke's statement, we won't offer a rating. But readers are welcome to provide their own judgment below.\n\nGo ahead, @ me.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Here's Why Beto O'Rourke Voted for an Anti-Black Lives Matter Bill\n\nEric Gay/AP\n\nLast September, when he was a surprisingly strong challenger to Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Beto O'Rourke brought black churchgoers to their feet when he discussed Botham Jean, a black man who was killed by a white police officer in his own home. \"How can we continue to lose the lives of unarmed black men in the United States of America at the hands of white police officers?\" O'Rourke asked . \"That is not justice. That is not us. That can-and must-change.\"\n\nOnly a month before, at a town hall in Houston, a voter asked O'Rourke if he thought NFL players kneeling was disrespectful. \"Nonviolently, peacefully, while the eyes of this country are watching these games,\" he replied , \"they take a knee to bring our attention and focus to this problem to ensure that we fix it.\" Although some conservatives criticized him for siding with the NFL players, others praised him for standing with Black Lives Matter. And on a tour of the jail in Harris County, a Texas county that leads the nation in death penalty sentences, O'Rourke told the Houston Chronicle in August that he opposed capital punishment.\n\nBut O'Rourke's rhetoric as a candidate for Senate appears to be different from at least one of his actions when he was the Democratic representative from El Paso in the House. In 2017, O'Rourke voted for a bill that would let prosecutors apply the death penalty for defendants who murder law enforcement officers-a controversial measure that was often seen as the Republican response to police brutality protests. In 2012, the BLM movement began when George Zimmerman killed unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, and it gained momentum after a spate of black deaths at the hands of police officers in 2014 and 2015. Conservative lawmakers and police unions began to counter the messages of police brutality with \"blue lives matter\" rhetoric. Several states even introduced bills to criminalize protesting and enhance punishments for killing a police officer, and in Congress the Thin Blue Line Act was introduced by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.).\n\nThe Thin Blue Line Act , says Kanya Bennett, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, \"sends the signal that the Congress has the backs of law enforcement over the backs of other constituents, primarily constituents of color.\" The measure is popular with Republicans, who have the widespread support of law enforcement and police unions. Similar bills were introduced in the House and Senate in 2015.\n\nThe bill also garnered support from Donald Trump, who made the death penalty for cop killers a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign. In 2015, he said that if elected, he would sign an executive order mandating the federal death penalty for cop killers. He did not elaborate on the legal questions that would certainly arise should he implement such an order.\n\nThe measure passed the House with votes from dozens of Democrats. \"By and large, [O'Rourke is] a Democratic centrist; he's not part of the party's left wing,\" Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University, says. But O'Rourke's campaign rhetoric in 2018 suggested a candidate with liberal views on criminal justice reform; for example, he advocated ending cash bail and legalizing marijuana nationwide.\n\nO'Rourke's communications director did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter his strong though unsuccessful campaign in Texas, there also has been wide speculation that O'Rourke may join a crowded Democratic field running for president in 2020. His following includes a diverse coalition of young people and even moderate Republicans . A December 2018 CNN poll placed him behind Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden in popularity. But how will voters square the politician bringing black churchgoers to their feet with the one who supported a controversial measure that many characterized as racist? \"At a time when our country needs to rebuild relations between law enforcement and communities, particularly communities of color, the Thin Blue Line Act creates even more divisions,\" the ACLU said in a letter opposing the bill.\n\n\"Police unions push bills like Thin Blue to distract from the national discourse around police violence and black lives,\" Bennett says. Every state already has laws that intensifies the punishment if a murder victim is a police officer. In O'Rourke's home state of Texas, several inmates on death row have been convicted of murdering police officers . When the measure was finally introduced in Congress, the Thin Blue Line bill was largely symbolic since it mostly duplicated existing state laws. \"There is no shortage of protections for law enforcement when crimes are committed against them,\" says Bennett.\n\nAt the same time, popular support for the death penalty has been on the decline , and lethal injection drugs have become more difficult to find. As a result, the rate of executions has declined dramatically over the last two decades. The federal government, which has 61 inmates on its death row, has only executed three people since 1988 , when the federal death penalty was reinstated; the last inmate to be executed by the federal government was Louis Jones Jr. in 2003.\n\nBut even if support for the death penalty is waning nationally, in Texas, politicians tread carefully when talking about law enforcement as to not be accused of being anti-police. \" O'Rourke's vote on that bill is, in some ways, a hedge against criticism,\" Joshua Blank, the manager of polling and research at the Texas Politics Project, says. O'Rourke will be able to say that he can openly talk about police brutality, \"but he's not an extremist.\"\n\nThis approach may work in Texas or even during a general election, but a vote for the Thin Blue Line Act could be a problem for O'Rourke in a Democratic primary. When running against Cruz, O'Rourke didn't have to worry about attacks from his left, Jones explains. \"[It's] the type of vote that would hurt him in the Democratic Party. There will be a host of Democrats running to Beto's left looking to destroy his image of being a progressive.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "In a New Video, Joey Bada$$ Takes on Police Shootings of Unarmed Black Men\n\nSome might describe the Brooklyn rapper Jo-Vaughn Virginie Scott, a.k.a. Joey Bada$$ , as up-and-coming, but it seems he's already arrived. Even if his debut album , B4.DA.$$, was released just three weeks ago, the 20-year-old has already co-founded a successful hip-hop collective called Pro Era (which you may recognize from the t-shirt Malia Obama was wearing in her leaked Instagram selfie ), performed for thousands on stages all over the world , and racked up millions of views on S oundCloud and YouTube .\n\nThe new album was released to critical acclaim, garnering favorable comparisons to the iconic rapper Nas, who also gained fame and respect as a teenager. That's partly by design: Bada$$ credits Nas as a source of inspiration, and, like Nas, he's using his beats and metaphors to highlight social ills. \"I think music is the most powerful tool when it comes to spreading messages and getting words across,\" he told me over the phone. \"It plays a really big part.\"\n\nHis latest single, \"Like Me,\" which Bada$$ premiered last month on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon , gives his take on the recent string of shootings of unarmed black men by police, and on some of the baggage that comes with being born black in America. \"My way of protesting is through my music,\" he says. \"With this newfound stature I have this voice where if I say something, a lot of people listen to it.\"\n\nBada$$ says the new video (premiered above) channels his state of mind: We see him caught up in a situation over a girl. He's accosted by a man with a gun, and even though he's unarmed, he becomes a police target. \"In the video, the hot-headed guy, he gets killed by the police with a gun in his hand. And me, the cool guy, who is away from all the violence, I still end up being mixed in the loop-just being a victim because of my surroundings or where I'm from.\" You'll also catch some references to Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown.\n\nYet the song and video both end with an element of hope. Bada$$ had wanted to leave people pondering. \"I pray that there is hope,\" he explains. \"But even the fact that I have to dream like that is what's disturbing. My message is that it can happen to any one of us.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Real Talk on Cops and Race From the Head of the FBI\n\nIn a rare and candid speech on Thursday, FBI director James Comey urged police officers to begin engaging in honest conversations about broken race relations in America, saying it was time for officers to stop resorting to \"lazy mental shortcuts\" that have too often lead to the mistreatment of minorities.\n\n\"Those of us in law enforcement must re-double our efforts to resist bias and prejudice,\" Comey said in an address to Georgetown University. \"We must better understand the people we serve and protect-by trying to know, deep in our gut, what it feels like to be a law-abiding young black man walking on the street and encountering law enforcement. We must understand how that young man may see us.\"\n\nThe speech follows the high-profile police killings of two unarmed black men, Michael Brown and Eric Garner , and the widespread anger expressed over the lack of grand jury indictments against the officers in both deaths. The fatal shootings sparked massive protests across the country, with demonstrators demanding for police reform.\n\nOn Thursday, Comey referred to both Brown and Garner, along with the two NYPD officers who were shot execution-style in their patrol car in December. Calling their deaths a \"crossroads,\" Comey said it was time for law enforcement agencies to acknowledge that a large portion of police history \"is not pretty\" and rife with instances of persisting, unconscious prejudices.\n\nComey's rationale aligns with psychological studies indicating that even in the absence of overt racist views, individuals-particularly police officers-often act with bias, especially in instance where a split-second decision is required.\n\n\"If we can't help our latent biases, we can help our behavior in response to those instinctive reactions, which is why we work to design systems and processes that overcome that very human part of us all,\" he said. \"Although the research may be unsettling, what we do next is what matters most.\"\n\nRead the full speech below (emphasis ours):\n\nThank you, President DeGioia. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for inviting me to Georgetown University. I am honored to be here. I wanted to meet with you today, as President DeGioia said, to share my thoughts on the relationship between law enforcement and the diverse communities we serve and protect. Like a lot of things in life, that relationship is complicated. Relationships often are.\n\nBeautiful Healy Hall-part of, and all around where we sit now-was named after this great university's 29th President, Patrick Francis Healy. Healy was born into slavery, in Georgia, in 1834. His father was an Irish immigrant plantation owner and his mother, a slave. Under the laws of that time, Healy and his siblings were considered to be slaves. Healy is believed to be the first African-American to earn a Ph.D., the first to enter the Jesuit order, and the first to be president of Georgetown University or any predominantly white university.\n\nGiven Georgetown's remarkable history, and that of President Healy, this struck me as an appropriate place to talk about the difficult relationship between law enforcement and the communities we are sworn to serve and protect.\n\nWith the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, the death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, the ongoing protests throughout the country, and the assassinations of NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, we are at a crossroads. As a society, we can choose to live our everyday lives, raising our families and going to work, hoping that someone, somewhere, will do something to ease the tension-to smooth over the conflict. We can roll up our car windows, turn up the radio and drive around these problems, or we can choose to have an open and honest discussion about what our relationship is today-what it should be, what it could be, and what it needs to be-if we took more time to better understand one another.\n\nCurrent Issues Facing Law Enforcement\n\nUnfortunately, in places like Ferguson and New York City, and in some communities across this nation, there is a disconnect between police agencies and many citizens-predominantly in communities of color.\n\nSerious debates are taking place about how law enforcement personnel relate to the communities they serve, about the appropriate use of force, and about real and perceived biases, both within and outside of law enforcement. These are important debates. Every American should feel free to express an informed opinion-to protest peacefully, to convey frustration and even anger in a constructive way. That's what makes our democracy great. Those conversations-as bumpy and uncomfortable as they can be-help us understand different perspectives, and better serve our communities. Of course, these are only conversations in the true sense of that word if we are willing not only to talk, but to listen, too.\n\nI worry that this incredibly important and incredibly difficult conversation about race and policing has become focused entirely on the nature and character of law enforcement officers, when it should also be about something much harder to discuss. Debating the nature of policing is very important, but I worry that it has become an excuse, at times, to avoid doing something harder.\n\nThe Hard Truths\n\nLet me start by sharing some of my own hard truths:\n\nFirst, all of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge that much of our history is not pretty. At many points in American history, law enforcement enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups. It was unfair to the Healy siblings and to countless others like them. It was unfair to too many people.\n\nI am descended from Irish immigrants. A century ago, the Irish knew well how American society-and law enforcement-viewed them: as drunks, ruffians, and criminals. Law enforcement's biased view of the Irish lives on in the nickname we still use for the vehicles we use to transport groups of prisoners. It is, after all, the \"paddy wagon.\"\n\nThe Irish had tough times, but little compares to the experience on our soil of black Americans. That experience should be part of every American's consciousness, and law enforcement's role in that experience-including in recent times-must be remembered. It is our cultural inheritance.\n\nThere is a reason that I require all new agents and analysts to study the FBI's interaction with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and to visit his memorial in Washington as part of their training. And there is a reason I keep on my desk a copy of Attorney General Robert Kennedy's approval of J. Edgar Hoover's request to wiretap Dr. King. It is a single page. The entire application is five sentences long, it is without fact or substance, and is predicated on the naked assertion that there is \"communist influence in the racial situation.\" The reason I do those things is to ensure that we remember our mistakes and that we learn from them.\n\nOne reason we cannot forget our law enforcement legacy is that the people we serve and protect cannot forget it, either. So we must talk about our history. It is a hard truth that lives on.\n\nA second hard truth: Much research points to the widespread existence of unconscious bias. Many people in our white-majority culture have unconscious racial biases and react differently to a white face than a black face. In fact, we all, white and black, carry various biases around with us. I am reminded of the song from the Broadway hit, Avenue Q: \"Everyone's a Little Bit Racist.\" Part of it goes like this:\n\nLook around and you will find No one's really color blind. Maybe it's a fact We all should face Everyone makes judgments Based on race.\n\nYou should be grateful I did not try to sing that.\n\nBut if we can't help our latent biases, we can help our behavior in response to those instinctive reactions, which is why we work to design systems and processes that overcome that very human part of us all. Although the research may be unsettling, it is what we do next that matters most.\n\nBut racial bias isn't epidemic in law enforcement any more than it is epidemic in academia or the arts. In fact, I believe law enforcement overwhelmingly attracts people who want to do good for a living-people who risk their lives because they want to help other people. They don't sign up to be cops in New York or Chicago or L.A. to help white people or black people or Hispanic people or Asian people. They sign up because they want to help all people. And they do some of the hardest, most dangerous policing to protect people of color.\n\nBut that leads me to my third hard truth: something happens to people in law enforcement. Many of us develop different flavors of cynicism that we work hard to resist because they can be lazy mental shortcuts. For example, criminal suspects routinely lie about their guilt, and nearly everybody we charge is guilty. That makes it easy for some folks in law enforcement to assume that everybody is lying and that no suspect, regardless of their race, could be innocent. Easy, but wrong.\n\nLikewise, police officers on patrol in our nation's cities often work in environments where a hugely disproportionate percentage of street crime is committed by young men of color. Something happens to people of good will working in that environment. After years of police work, officers often can't help but be influenced by the cynicism they feel.\n\nA mental shortcut becomes almost irresistible and maybe even rational by some lights. The two young black men on one side of the street look like so many others the officer has locked up. Two white men on the other side of the street-even in the same clothes-do not. The officer does not make the same association about the two white guys, whether that officer is white or black. And that drives different behavior. The officer turns toward one side of the street and not the other. We need to come to grips with the fact that this behavior complicates the relationship between police and the communities they serve.\n\nSo why has that officer-like his colleagues-locked up so many young men of color? Why does he have that life-shaping experience? Is it because he is a racist? Why are so many black men in jail? Is it because cops, prosecutors, judges, and juries are racist? Because they are turning a blind eye to white robbers and drug dealers?\n\nThe answer is a fourth hard truth: I don't think so. If it were so, that would be easier to address. We would just need to change the way we hire, train, and measure law enforcement and that would substantially fix it. We would then go get those white criminals we have been ignoring. But the truth is significantly harder than that.\n\nThe truth is that what really needs fixing is something only a few, like President Obama, are willing to speak about, perhaps because it is so daunting a task. Through the \"My Brother's Keeper\" initiative, the President is addressing the disproportionate challenges faced by young men of color. For instance, data shows that the percentage of young men not working or not enrolled in school is nearly twice as high for blacks as it is for whites. This initiative, and others like it, is about doing the hard work to grow drug-resistant and violence-resistant kids, especially in communities of color, so they never become part of that officer's life experience.\n\nSo many young men of color become part of that officer's life experience because so many minority families and communities are struggling, so many boys and young men grow up in environments lacking role models, adequate education, and decent employment-they lack all sorts of opportunities that most of us take for granted. A tragedy of American life-one that most citizens are able to drive around because it doesn't touch them-is that young people in \"those neighborhoods\" too often inherit a legacy of crime and prison. And with that inheritance, they become part of a police officer's life, and shape the way that officer-whether white or black-sees the world. Changing that legacy is a challenge so enormous and so complicated that it is, unfortunately, easier to talk only about the cops. And that's not fair.\n\nLet me be transparent about my affection for cops. When you dial 911, whether you are white or black, the cops come, and they come quickly, and they come quickly whether they are white or black. That's what cops do, in addition to all of the other hard and difficult and dangerous and frightening things that they do. They respond to homes in the middle of the night where a drunken father, wielding a gun, is threatening his wife and children. They pound up the back stairs of an apartment building, not knowing whether the guys behind the door they are about to enter are armed, or high, or both.\n\nI come from a law enforcement family. My grandfather, William J. Comey, was a police officer. Pop Comey is one of my heroes. I have a picture of him on my wall in my office at the FBI, reminding me of the legacy I've inherited and that I must honor.\n\nHe was the child of immigrants. When he was in the sixth grade, his father was killed in an industrial accident in New York. Because he was the oldest, he had to drop out of school so that he could go to work to support his mom and younger siblings. He could never afford to return to school, but when he was old enough, he joined the Yonkers, New York, Police Department.\n\nOver the next 40 years, he rose to lead that department. Pop was the tall, strong, silent type, quiet and dignified, and passionate about the rule of law. Back during Prohibition, he heard that bootleggers were running beer through fire hoses between Yonkers and the Bronx.\n\nNow, Pop enjoyed a good beer every now and again, but he ordered his men to cut those hoses with fire axes. Pop had to have a protective detail, because certain people were angry and shocked that someone in law enforcement would do that. But that's what we want as citizens-that's what we expect. And so I keep that picture of Pop on my office wall to remind me of his integrity, and his pride in the integrity of his work.\n\nLaw enforcement ranks are filled with people like my grandfather. But, to be clear, although I am from a law enforcement family, and have spent much of my career in law enforcement, I'm not looking to let law enforcement off the hook. Those of us in law enforcement must redouble our efforts to resist bias and prejudice. We must better understand the people we serve and protect-by trying to know, deep in our gut, what it feels like to be a law-abiding young black man walking on the street and encountering law enforcement. We must understand how that young man may see us. We must resist the lazy shortcuts of cynicism and approach him with respect and decency.\n\nWe must work-in the words of New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton-to really see each other. Perhaps the reason we struggle as a nation is because we've come to see only what we represent, at face value, instead of who we are. We simply must see the people we serve.\n\nBut the \"seeing\" needs to flow in both directions. Citizens also need to really see the men and women of law enforcement. They need to see what police see through the windshields of their squad cars, or as they walk down the street. They need to see the risks and dangers law enforcement officers encounter on a typical late-night shift. They need to understand the difficult and frightening work they do to keep us safe. They need to give them the space and respect to do their work, well and properly.\n\nIf they take the time to do that, what they will see are officers who are human, who are overwhelmingly doing the right thing for the right reasons, and who are too often operating in communities-and facing challenges-most of us choose to drive around.\n\nOne of the hardest things I do as FBI Director is call the chiefs and sheriffs in departments around the nation when officers have been killed in the line of duty. I call to express my sorrow and offer the FBI's help. Officers like Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, two of NYPD's finest who were gunned down by a madman who thought his ambush would avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. I make far too many calls. And, there are far too many names of fallen officers on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and far too many names etched there each year.\n\nOfficers Liu and Ramos swore the same oath all in law enforcement do, and they answered the call to serve the people, all people. Like all good police officers, they moved toward danger, without regard for the politics or passions or race of those who needed their help-knowing the risks inherent in their work. They were minority police officers, killed while standing watch in a minority neighborhood-Bedford-Stuyvesant-one they and their fellow officers had rescued from the grip of violent crime.\n\nTwenty years ago, Bed-Stuy was shorthand for a kind of chaos and disorder in which good people had no freedom to walk, shop, play, or just sit on the front steps and talk. It was too dangerous. But today, no more, thanks to the work of those who chose lives of service and danger to help others.\n\nBut despite this selfless service-of these two officers and countless others like them across the country-in some American communities, people view the police not as allies, but as antagonists, and think of them not with respect or gratitude, but with suspicion and distrust.\n\nWe simply must find ways to see each other more clearly. And part of that has to involve collecting and sharing better information about encounters between police and citizens, especially violent encounters.\n\nNot long after riots broke out in Ferguson late last summer, I asked my staff to tell me how many people shot by police were African-American in this country. I wanted to see trends. I wanted to see information. They couldn't give it to me, and it wasn't their fault. Demographic data regarding officer-involved shootings is not consistently reported to us through our Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Because reporting is voluntary, our data is incomplete and therefore, in the aggregate, unreliable.\n\nI recently listened to a thoughtful big city police chief express his frustration with that lack of reliable data. He said he didn't know whether the Ferguson police shot one person a week, one a year, or one a century, and that in the absence of good data, \"all we get are ideological thunderbolts, when what we need are ideological agnostics who use information to try to solve problems.\" He's right.\n\nThe first step to understanding what is really going on in our communities and in our country is to gather more and better data related to those we arrest, those we confront for breaking the law and jeopardizing public safety, and those who confront us. \"Data\" seems a dry and boring word but, without it, we cannot understand our world and make it better.\n\nHow can we address concerns about \"use of force,\" how can we address concerns about officer-involved shootings if we do not have a reliable grasp on the demographics and circumstances of those incidents? We simply must improve the way we collect and analyze data to see the true nature of what's happening in all of our communities.\n\nThe FBI tracks and publishes the number of \"justifiable homicides\" reported by police departments. But, again, reporting by police departments is voluntary and not all departments participate. That means we cannot fully track the number of incidents in which force is used by police, or against police, including non-fatal encounters, which are not reported at all.\n\nWithout complete and accurate data, we are left with \"ideological thunderbolts.\" And that helps spark unrest and distrust and does not help us get better. Because we must get better, I intend for the FBI to be a leader in urging departments around this country to give us the facts we need for an informed discussion, the facts all of us need, to help us make sound policy and sound decisions with that information.\n\n* * *\n\nAmerica isn't easy. America takes work. Today, February 12, is Abraham Lincoln's birthday. He spoke at Gettysburg about a \"new birth of freedom\" because we spent the first four score and seven years of our history with fellow Americans held as slaves-President Healy, his siblings, and his mother among them. We have spent the 150 years since Lincoln spoke making great progress, but along the way treating a whole lot of people of color poorly. And law enforcement was often part of that poor treatment. That's our inheritance as law enforcement and it is not all in the distant past.\n\nWe must account for that inheritance. And we-especially those of us who enjoy the privilege that comes with being the majority-must confront the biases that are inescapable parts of the human condition. We must speak the truth about our shortcomings as law enforcement, and fight to be better. But as a country, we must also speak the truth to ourselves. Law enforcement is not the root cause of problems in our hardest hit neighborhoods. Police officers-people of enormous courage and integrity, in the main-are in those neighborhoods, risking their lives, to protect folks from offenders who are the product of problems that will not be solved by body cameras.\n\nWe simply must speak to each other honestly about all these hard truths.\n\nIn the words of Dr. King, \"We must learn to live together as brothers or we will all perish together as fools.\"\n\nWe all have work to do-hard work, challenging work-and it will take time. We all need to talk and we all need to listen, not just about easy things, but about hard things, too. Relationships are hard. Relationships require work. So let's begin that work. It is time to start seeing one another for who and what we really are. Peace, security, and understanding are worth the effort.

The Phoenix Police Department released a statement late Thursday saying that the officer involved in the shooting was a white, 30-year-old male with seven years of experience on the force.\n\n\"This one went bad from the standpoint of how it ended, but the officer was doing exactly what we want him to do,\" Sgt. Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman, said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nBut Ann Hart, chairwoman of the African American Police Advisory Board for South Phoenix, said the shooting only reinforces \"the impression it's open season for killing black men.\"\n\n\"We need to look into that,\" Hart told NBC station KPNX of Phoenix . \"We need to take a deeper dive into why police officers are feeling compelled to shoot and kill as opposed to apprehend and detain, arrest and jail.\"\n\nAnother rally was scheduled for Friday night. With police being questioned about the deaths of unarmed black men not only in Phoenix but also in Ferguson, Missouri, and in New York, a nonprofit police foundation in nearby Tempe, Arizona, canceled a fundraising \"Run From the Cops 5K\" race scheduled for Saturday, citing \"sensitivity, respect, and support for all sides of an important debate taking place all across our great country.\"\n\nCrump told reporters that the officer and his partner were responding to a burglary call about 6 p.m. Tuesday (8 p.m. ET) when a local resident told them that men in a black sport-utility vehicle were dealing drugs. The license plate number given by the resident matched a vehicle owned by a resident of a block where police were already investigating a report of loud music, Crump said, so the officer approached the SUV, whose driver got out.\n\nWhen the officer told the driver, later identified as Brisbon, to show his hands, the driver instead put his hands into the waistband of his pants, at which point the officer drew his gun, Crump said. Brisbon began to run away, but the officer chased him down, and they began struggling, Crump said.\n\n\"The officer believed he felt the handle of a gun while holding the suspect's hand in his pocket,\" Crump said. Unable to keep his grip on Brisbon's hand, the officer fired two shots, he added. The object in Brisbon's pocket was later discovered to be a bottle of pain pills. The Phoenix Police Department said in a statement later on Thursday that there was a semi-automatic handgun found on the driver's side floor board of the SUV where Brisbon had been, and a jar containing what is believed to be marijuana was also found in the vehicle.\n\nThe Rev. Jarrett Maupin, an organizer of Thursday night's march, told KPNX that Brisbon was probably justified in fearing for his life and trying to flee when the Phoenix officer approached him and his friend Tuesday night.\n\n\"The Phoenix Police Department does not treat white people this way,\" Maupin said. \"What that officer did was harass and accost them.\"\n\nMarci A. Kratter, an attorney for Brisbon's family, told The Arizona Republic newspaper of Phoenix that eyewitnesses would dispute the official police account and that \"we intend to pursue this to the full extent of the law.\"\n\nAfter two days of questions and doubts, a community rally for Brisbon is scheduled downtown Thursday night and a public march was scheduled for Friday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NBCNews.com\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Police, who were responding to a burglary call when they encountered the scene, \"went and confronted him,\" police spokesman Sgt. Paul Rodriguez told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . \"There was an altercation. An officer discharged his weapon and struck the suspect.\"\n\nThe officer who shot Taylor, identified by police as 49-year-old Brad Miller, had recently graduated from the police academy in March 2015 and was still in field training working under the supervision of a training officer, according to the police department. Miller was placed on administrative leave, according to standard protocol when an officer uses deadly force.\n\n\"We're having two independent investigations - a criminal and administrative,\" Rodriguez said. \"As an agency, we take the loss of any human life as serious, but we owe it to our community to conduct a clear and transparent investigation to determine what exactly took place.\"\n\nRELATED: Killing of Sam DuBose shows importance of police video\n\nTaylor's great uncle, Clyde Fuller, told the Star-Telegram that Taylor was \"a good kid\" and that \"something doesn't sound right\" about the police account. Fuller said he didn't believe his great-nephew would burglarize the dealership and thinks \"something is going on that somebody is lying about.\"\n\nTaylor, whose death comes amid growing national outcry over the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police or in police custody, took to Twitter a few days after Brown was shot and killed on Aug. 9, 2014, to say \"I don't feel protected by police.\"\n\nPolice taking black lives as easy as flippin a coin, with no consequences smh\n\nLater, in December 2014, after a grand jury in New York City decided not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the apparent chokehold death of Eric Garner and a month after 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot by police while paying with a toy gun, he wrote: \"Our police system is a joke, when will we ever be protected?\" and \"Police taking black lives as easy as flipping a coin, with no consequences.\"\n\nSurveillance video does not show the shooting, Rodriguez told the Star-Telegram , and the Arlington police department has not yet implemented a pilot program that would equip officers with body cameras. The spokesman said that the video shows Taylor engaged in \"criminal activity\" before the shooting, however.\n\nThe tag \"#ChristianTaylor\" has been mentioned over 140,000 times on social media as Taylor's name becomes the latest in a growing list of young people of color killed in police altercations. According to The Guardian , 695 people have been killed by U.S. police so far in 2015.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting to this story.\n\nSan Angelo police stay pullin ppl over\n\nOur police system is a joke, when will we ever be protected?\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Roberts said one of the men assaulted the officer, Ryan Donald, 35.\n\nIn audio of Donald's communications with a dispatcher during the incident, he is asked whether the men are armed. He replies: \"No. He just assaulted me with a skateboard. I tried to, uh, grab his friend. They're very aggressive, just so you know.\"\n\nDonald shot the man, who fled into the woods with his stepbrother, Roberts said. They then came back out of the woods, and \"the officer felt threatened and discharged his firearm\" again, hitting the other man multiple times in the torso, he said.\n\nRELATED: Police took 2 seconds to shoot homeowner mistaken for suspect\n\nBoth men were taken to hospitals, where one was in critical condition and the other was described as stable. Donald was put on administrative leave pending an internal investigation and a separate probe by the Critical Incident Team, a cooperative of investigators from five local law enforcement agencies under supervision of the Thurston County Sheriff's Office.\n\nPolice records indicate the incident is the first officer-related shooting in Olympia in at least three years. Mayor Stephen Buxbaum called it \"a tragic event\" and said he had coordinated with local churches and colleges to set aside time and locations for community gatherings.\n\n\"Let's not be reactive,\" he said. \"Let's take the path of consciously addressing our questions of what happened as best we can - seek justice and healing.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Pink Houses in East New York, Brooklyn. Liang and another officer, Shaun Landa, were climbing the darkened stairwell when Gurley, who was visiting his girlfriend's apartment, entered the stairwell from a floor below the officers. Liang, with his gun drawn, fired a single shot that struck Gurley in the chest.\n\nRELATED: Thousands protest against police killings\n\nNew York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton described Gurley as a \"total innocent.\" Liang has been on desk-duty since the shooting.\n\nBoth Liang and Landa had been on the job for less than 18 months at the time of the shooting, and their immediate handling of the shooting was called into question. According to reports, the officers notified their union representatives of the shooting before their supervisors.\n\nGurley's killing came as New York City and the nation were gripped in protest over the deaths of a number of unarmed black men by police, including Eric Garner, a Staten Island man killed in an apparent police chokehold by police. A month after Gurley's Nov. 20 killing, a grand jury decided not to indict the officer involved in Garner's death.\n\n\"This is the first step in a fight for justice in this wrongful and reckless shooting of an innocent man,\" Scott Rynecki, an attorney for Gurley's family, told NBC New York.\n\nPatrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, a union that represents NYPD officers, responded to news of the indictment by saying Liang deserves rights of due process, adding that the officer's work detail contributed to the shooting.\n\n\"This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,\" Lynch said. \"The fact the he was assigned to patrol one most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident.\"\n\nThe Kings County District Attorney's Office said it could not offer comment at this time because the grand jury's deliberations remain legally sealed. The district attorney's office said it will release more information Wednesday afternoon following Liang's arrangement, scheduled for 2 p.m. ET.\n\nLast week, Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson announced the indictment of another NYPD officer, this one charged with third-degree assault, third-degree attempted assault and one count of official misconduct for allegedly stomping on a suspect's head while the suspect was face down and being handcuffed. The officer, Joel Edouard, faces up to a year in jail if convicted.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

The sentence, in what was deemed the \"loud music trial,\" also carries an additional 90 years for three previous convictions of attempted murder - 30 consecutive years for each count - and 15 concurrent years for firing a gun into an occupied vehicle.\n\nRELATED: Michael Dunn found guilty of first-degree murder\n\nDunn, 47, who is white, fired 10 rounds at the 17-year-old African-American and his friends in November 2012 after fighting with them about music coming from their SUV in a Jacksonville parking lot. During a retrial on Oct. 1, jurors unanimously found Dunn guilty of first-degree murder for Davis' death. In Florida, first-degree murder is punishable by life in prison without parole.\n\nIn February, Dunn was convicted of three counts of second-degree attempted murder toward Davis' friends. But after more than 30 hours, jurors couldn't reach a verdict on his first-degree murder charge, resulting in a mistrial on that count.\n\nAt the hearing on Friday, Dunn read a brief statement and, for the first time, publicly apologized for killing the teen. Several of Davis' family members and friends attended the hearing and addressed Dunn.\n\n\"I miss his big, wide, toothy smile,\" Davis' mother, Lucy McBath, said through tears. \"For me, there will be no college graduation. There will be no daughter-in-law. For me, there will be no future generation.\"\n\nShe went on to add, \"I, too, must be willing to forgive. And so I choose to forgive you, Mr. Dunn, for taking my son's life. I pray that God has mercy on your soul.\"\n\nDunn, a software engineer who has a concealed-weapons permit, previously testified in his own defense. He said he felt threatened when he thought he saw \"the barrel of a gun\" emerge from a window of the vehicle and acted in self-defense. Police later discovered that Davis had been unarmed. Officers also didn't find any weapons inside the SUV.\n\nAfter the shooting, Dunn and his girlfriend returned to their nearby hotel and ordered pizza. The next day, the couple drove 175 miles south of Jacksonville, to Dunn's home, where he was later arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder.\n\nThe case made national headlines when it occurred just months after former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot and killed unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida. Last summer, Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges related to Martin's death.\n\nBoth cases struck racial cords and prompted protests. National dialogue about the often deadly interactions between armed whites and unarmed black men again restarted in August after the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nRELATED: Michael Dunn found guilty of first-degree murder in death of Jordan Davis\n\nFlorida was the first state to adopt the so-called \"Stand-Your-Ground\" law in 2005 as an expansion of the \"Castle Doctrine.\" The current measure gives individuals the right to use deadly force to defend themselves without retreating from potentially harmful situations. Although Stand-Your-Ground was not used in the Zimmerman defense, Florida police initially said they could not arrest him because of such state laws. Nearly half of the country has joined the state in adopting a similar policy, most often originally aimed at addressing domestic abuse cases.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

During a press conference shortly after the shooting deaths, a cadre of police officers literally turned their backs on de Blasio as he arrived, stoking the passions of officers and their supporters who feel the mayor hasn't stood strongly enough with them.\n\n\"There's blood on many hands tonight,\" said Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association. \"That blood on the hands starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor.\"\n\nRelated: Cops turn their backs on NYC mayor\n\nInvestigators continue to pore over evidence in the case, and what may have driven the suspected killer, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, to murder. Brinsley, who police say shot a female acquaintance in Baltimore earlier in the day before driving to Brooklyn, allegedly made remarks on social media saying that he planned on killing so-called \"pigs\" and made reference to the killing of Eric Garner. Police said after the shooting Brinsley fled to a nearby subway station, where he shot and killed himself.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, police and their supporters have blamed the overwhelmingly peaceful protest movements sparked by the grand jury decisions in the Michael Brown and Garner cases for spurring Saturday's killings. As the city mourns what can only be described as the senseless killings of the officers, protesters and protests leaders have decried the loose connection between the protests and the killings as divisive, irresponsible and dangerous.\n\nThe Police Benevolent Association put out a statement after the killings saying they mayor's hands are \"dripping with our blood because of his words, actions and policies\" and that the department has \"for the first time in a number of years, become a 'wartime' police department.\"\n\n\"We will act accordingly,\" the statement read. Many critics of the union's harsh words led some on social media to ask the question, if the department is at war then with whom exactly?\n\n\"We have to put all of this in proper context. What happened Saturday was tragic but completely unconnected to the movement,\" Cherrell Brown said, an organizer with Equal Justice U.S.A, who has been active in the umbrella of protests calling for an end to what she described as the \"extra-judicial killings\" of black people by police. \"This wasn't at all related to protests, this wasn't some revolutionary act. This was a senseless murder,\" she said on the \"Melissa Harris-Perry Show\" Sunday morning.\n\nBrown followed up with msnbc that \"What we need more than anything right now is collective healing, not polarization based on false equivalencies.\"\n\nThere's no contradiction thinking murder of these police officers is awful and the deaths of unarmed black men is awful. Murder is awful.\n\nGarner was killed in July during an altercation with police on Staten Island after one of the officers placed Garner in an apparent chokehold. Protests erupted in New York and across the country after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who killed Garner. The protests fueled what had already been a growing national movement against police violence sparked by the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager in a St. Louis suburb in August. Just weeks before the grand jury's decision in the Garner case not to indict the officer, a Missouri grand jury opted not to indict the officer who killed Brown.\n\nA host of social justice groups have condemned the equivocation between the officers' deaths and the protests.\n\nJoo-Hyun Kang, director of Communities United for Police Reform, said \"there are people who would seek to exploit this tragedy and use it to condemn the growing national moment to end police violence and discriminatory policing.\n\n\"Attempts to link [Saturday's] tragic events with a movement that holds justice, dignity and respect for all as its core values are cheap political punditry, and dangerous in their divisiveness,\" Kang said.\n\nA coalition of organizations that have led protests in Ferguson released a joint statement in which they said they were \"shocked and saddened\" by the killings.\n\n\"We mourned with the families of Eric Garner and Mike Brown who experienced unspeakable loss, and similarly our hearts go out to the families of these officers who are now experiencing that same grief. They deserve all of our prayers,\" the statement from the coalition, Ferguson Action said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there have been attempts to draw misleading connections between this movement and today's tragic events. Millions have stood together in acts of non-violent civil disobedience, one of the cornerstones of our democracy,\" it continued. \"It is irresponsible to draw connections between this movement and the actions of a troubled man who took the lives of these officers and attempted to take the life of his ex-partner, before ultimately taking his own.\"\n\n\"This wasn't at all related to protests, this wasn't some revolutionary act. This was a senseless murder.\"'\n\nThe shooting comes as tensions across the city and the country remain high as thousands of protesters have taken to the streets demanding justice for the many black men killed each year by police. The recent killings of a growing list of unarmed young black men and boys in Ohio and Arizona have stoked sometimes fiery demonstrations, with mostly non-violent acts of civil disobedience shutting down department stores, streets and bridges in small and major cities like New York.\n\nFollowing the jury's decision on Staten Island in the Garner case, Mayor de Blasio called for peace, but angered police advocates when he concurred that drastic police reforms were needed and described the conversations he's had with his own biracial son about being careful during interactions with the police. While the sentiments grounded him with many of those in communities that shoulder the brunt of alleged police abuses, police groups blasted the mayor for not seeming to stand whole-heartedly with officers.\n\nThe protests haven't gone completely without incident. Last week, two officers were assaulted and hospitalized by protesters near the Brooklyn Bridge, police said, during a largely peaceful protest that drew more than 25,000 people. Three people have been arrested in connection with the assault.\n\nShortly after Saturday's killings, Lynch, the police union leader, pounced at the opportunity to strike at the mayor and protesters.\n\n\"Those that incited violence on this street under the guise of protests, that tried to tear down what New York City police officers did every day, we tried to warn, it must not go on,\" he said.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, an msnbc host and leader of the National Action Network which has organized marches and rallies on behalf of many of the most recent victims of police violence, including the families of Brown and Garner, has been one of the most vocal supporters of the protests but also among the most targeted publicly by those staunchly in support of law enforcement.\n\nSharpton in a statement said he has talked with Eric Garner's family and they are beside themselves with the insinuation that those fighting in his name support the heinous killing of the officers.\n\nRelated: Thousands protest against police killings nationwide\n\n\"I have spoken to the Garner family and we are outraged by the early reports of the police killed in Brooklyn today,\" Sharpton said. \"Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases.\"\n\n\"We have stressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown,\" he continued.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Gwen Carr, Garner's mother, told reporters that standing on the side of her son means standing with peace.\n\n\"Anyone who's standing with us, we want you to not use Eric Garner's name for violence because we are not about that,\" Carr told reporters. \"I'm standing here in sorrow about losing those two police officers.\"\n\nEsaw Garner, Garner's widow, said her husband was not a violent man in life and that in death her family only wants peace.\n\n\"We don't want violence connected to his name,\" she said, empathizing with the families of the slain officers. \"I know what they're going through to lose a loved one right before the holidays.\"\n\nWhitney Dow, a filmmaker behind the Whitness Project, described by Dow as \"an interactive investigation into how Americans who identify as white experience their ethnicity, said the response and reaction to the officer's deaths are typical of the manner in which Americans tend to see racially loaded events.\n\n\"As Americans we are prone to always putting these kinds of things in the political bucket, rather than seeing them as being about social justice,\" Dow said. \"It speaks to the binary nature of this country, but humans aren't binary creatures.\"\n\nDow said the protests on either side are led by those at the very front, the pointy tip ahead of the mass of supporters.\n\n\"But behind that pointy tip are very reasonable people,\" he said. \"The question becomes, how do you begin to have discussions with those people who are reasonable and most willing and able to have reasonable conversations.\"\n\nCherrell Brown, the organizer, said long before the shooting groups had planned a silent march and vigil in Harlem on Sunday night. The timing couldn't be more poignant, she said.\n\n\"It's even more important that we come together now in love and wrap our arms around each other,\" Brown said. \"This is not an anti-cop movement. We're just against the extra-judicial killing of black people with impunity.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

But there's a big racial split on the question.\n\nSeventy percent of blacks say the decisions have decreased their confidence in the system, while just 9% say the decisions have increased their confidence. For whites, the split is smaller: 35% who say their confidence has decreased, and 21% who say it's increased.\n\nAmong all Americans, 43% say their confidence has taken a hit, 17% say it's increased, and 32% say the decisions made no difference.\n\nLast month, a grand jury in St. Louis County, Missouri decided not to indict Darren Wilson, a Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed local teen. The decision set off several nights of angry protests in the region.\n\nRelated: After Ferguson, some see a movement taking shape\n\nWednesday, a Staten Island grand jury also decided not to indict New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo for an encounter with another unarmed black man, Eric Garner, who died after Pantaleo used a choke-hold on him-a moved banned by NYPD guidelines.\n\nThe twin decisions, along with other cases of police violence against blacks, have sparked mass nationwide protests and a burgeoning movement for police and criminal justice reform.\n\nThe poll showed other evidence of a sharp racial split. Eighty-two percent of blacks agree that law enforcement applies different standards to whites and blacks. Eighty percent strongly agree. Only 39% of whites agree with that, while 51% disagree.\n\nSince blacks are overwhelmingly Democratic, it's not surprising that the split on the question is partisan, too. Sixty-four percent of Democrats agree that law enforcement uses different standards for whites and blacks, while 64% of Republicans disagree. Among all Americans, 47% agree and 44% disagree.\n\nIt's a similar story on the issue of excessive force. Seventy-nine percent of whites say they have \"a great deal\" or a \"fair amount\" of confidence that police won't use excessive force. But 52% of blacks have \"just some\" or \"very little\" confidence that they won't.\n\nOne area of agreement, that could underscore hopes for reform: Seventy-four percent of whites and 81% of blacks say police should be required to wear body cameras to monitor their policing. On Monday, President Obama announced he'd ask for $75 million to fund body cameras for law enforcement nationwide.\n\nJust 30% of all Americans approve of the president's handling of the grand jury decisions, while 46% disapprove. Among blacks, the numbers aren't too different: 46% disapprove while 35% approve.\n\nIn his response to the decisions, the president has acknowledged problems in the relationship between police and minority communities, and pledged action. But his tone has mostly been calm and understated-perhaps out of an awareness that many white Americans are supportive of police.\n\nThe poll was conducted Dec. 4-5-the two days that followed news of the Garner decision. It surveyed 1,018 adults, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Why Vonderrit Myers matters\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nFERGUSON, Missouri - Vonderrit Myers is no Michael Brown. Myers, the black 18-year old shot and killed by a St. Louis police officer last week, is also no Trayvon Martin or Jordan Davis or any of the others on a growing list of slain unarmed black men who have invigorated a new generation's fight for racial justice.\n\nBut Myers doesn't have to be.\n\nUnlike Brown and others who were clearly unarmed during their fatal confrontations with white antagonists, police say Myers shot first, and the officer he shot at returned fire and killed the teen. Lab results found Myers had gun powder residue on his right hand at the time of his death. He was also facing trial on earlier gun charges and was wearing an ankle bracelet as a condition of his bond in that case.\n\nMyers at 16 was arrested for another shooting but was never charged. And photographs have gone viral on social media showing him posing with guns just days before his death.\n\nMyers, in other words, may not be the model victim in the ongoing story of police brutality and white violence against young black men. But his death nonetheless has sparked an important wave in the burgeoning movement built around the notion that black lives matter. All black lives -- not just those that draw the most public sympathy.\n\n\"Vonderitt Myers matters because we are still talking about a fundamental question of the value of black children and the value of black life,\" said Brittany Packnett, head of Teach for America in St. Louis. \"The circumstances may be different, but there's the recognition that if we don't come out early and often to demand justice for African-American children, quite often it doesn't come.\"\n\n\"He has no incentive to engage the police in a shooting\"\n\nBrown's death in Ferguson on August 9 sparked weeks of rage and protest, in large part because he was unarmed and witnesses say had raised his hands in surrender when he was fatally struck.\n\nMyers's family insists that he too was unarmed when he was shot on October 8, packing little more than a sandwich at the time. They remember Myers as a beloved teenager who had hopes of getting his life back on track.\n\nProtesters took to the St. Louis streets in the hours and days after Myers's shooting, just as they had a dozen miles away in Ferguson. They marched and chanted. There were showdowns with police and some burned American flags. The unrest became something of a parallel protest to what had happened to Brown.\n\nPHOTO ESSAY: Ferguson's 'Weekend of Resistance'\n\nMyers's family and their supporters say they don't trust the police. They've poked holes in the police account of how the teen was killed and have highlighted over and again how often that account has changed.\n\n\"A lot of people believe St. Louis police compromised this case by doing things that I hate to think they could have done in this situation,\" said Jermaine Wooten, an attorney for Myers' family.\n\nBrown's killing was highly symbolic, another name on the tragic roll call of unarmed black men gunned down by white men and cops. The list includes Sean Bell, killed the morning of his wedding in Queens, New York in 2006; Oscar Grant, shot by a transit cop on an Oakland, California subway platform in 2009; Trayvon Martin, shot to death by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in Florida in 2012; and Jordan Davis, gunned down by motorist Michael Dunn in 2012 in a scuffle over loud music.\n\nBrown's killing was also among a string of similar cases across America this summer, where cops killed unarmed black men under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThey include Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York on July 17, killed in a police chokehold after being confronted over selling untaxed cigarettes; John Crawford in Beavercreek, Ohio on August 5, shot down by police at a Walmart as he talked on his cell phone and toyed with a plastic gun he'd picked up off a shelf in the toy department; and Ezell Ford in Los Angeles on August 11, felled by police bullets after they stopped him on a sidewalk, at which point they say he made \"suspicious movements\" before attempting to take an officer's gun.\n\nThe protests sparked by Brown's killing only grew more emboldened by what happened to Myers weeks later. But while Brown's killing fits a much neater narrative, with multiple eyewitness accounts and forensic evidence, the Myers case is murky.\n\nThere are the photos of Myers allegedly showing off with handguns, holding one in each hand and another sitting in his lap. A lawyer for the officer who killed Myers told reporters the gun in Myers's lap had been reported stolen in late September and investigators had identified it as the gun police believe Myers used to fire at the officer.\n\nThe police account of what happened the night of the shooting has changed multiple times. And even with mounting evidence to the contrary, there is the unshakable heart-of-hearts belief among those who love Myers that he was not armed that night.\n\n\"We as attorneys understand what these lab results mean,\" Jermaine Wooten said. \"If I fire a gun at you in close proximity there is going to be gun powder residue all over your body. So the fact that the gun powder residue is on Vonderrit is not indicative at all that he fired a weapon.\"\n\nWooten acknowledged Myers had pleaded not guilty to earlier charges of eluding police and illegal possession of a weapon. The charges stemmed from Myers's involvement in a high-speed car chase that ended with him jumping out of the car and eventually throwing a handgun into a sewage drain, police said.\n\nMyers was released on bond for the incident and was facing a court date in November, Wooten said. \"He has no incentive to engage the police in a shooting. Any kid I don't care if they are 14 or 18 knows that's a losing battle,\" Wooten said.\n\n\"We're done, as a police union, standing in the shadows in these cases\"\n\nEyewitnesses to Myers's shooting told Wooten that the officer, who was off-duty and working a second job as a security guard, had come out from a gangway and never identified himself as he chased Myers and a handful of people with him that night.\n\n\"No one knew who this man was chasing these kids with a gun,\" Wooten said.\n\nOn Tuesday, not long after St. Louis police released the lab results showing the residue on Myers's hand, the St. Louis Police Officers' Association held a press conference to discuss the case.\n\nJeff Roorda, the organization's business manager, cautioned that such high-profile cases are often tried in the court of public opinion rather than on hard evidence.\n\n\"We're done, as a police union, standing in the shadows in these cases,\" Roorda said, adding he and other members of the union had seen the photographs allegedly showing Myers posing with guns and were aware of Myers's earlier arrest.\n\nWooten accused the union of being biased and protective of its own. He also said law enforcement in St. Louis and the surrounding region, in the wake of the persistent unrest in Ferguson, has an incentive to show Myers's shooting was justified.\n\n\"I think the last thing St. Louis expected was another police shooting. If it's another unarmed black man, I think we would have been on the verge of chaos,\" Wooten said. \"That's why I think a lot of people aren't willing to accept that he was unarmed.\"\n\n'Ferguson is the Birmingham of our time'\n\nThe Myers killing rekindled activism in Ferguson, having taken place just days before a so-called \"Weekend of Resistance\" there which drew scores of protesters from across the country. The Myers and Brown shootings served as a double-sided rallying cry against police violence.\n\nBetween Oct. 10 and Oct. 13, protesters staged massive rallies and marches as well as meticulously planned acts of civil disobedience. Demonstrators blockaded local Walmart stores, crashed a fundraiser for a local politician, shut down a main road in Ferguson and even staged an elaborate protest during a Monday Night Football game between the St. Louis Rams and San Francisco 49ers.\n\nSome 43 people were arrested during an action staged at Ferguson police headquarters, including a number of clergy and high-profile community leaders.\n\n\"Ferguson is the Birmingham of our time. There is no doubt about it. Ferguson is the Montgomery of our time. So each life matters. The black life matters,\" activist and author Cornel West told msnbc. West took part in the Weekend of Resistance, where he was arrested and briefly detained.\n\nNo Justice, No Trust\n\nMyers was, in fact, the second man killed by police in St. Louis after Brown's death.\n\nKajieme Powell, a mentally ill 25-year-old, was shot and killed by St. Louis city police just 10 days after Brown. Police initially said Powell had lunged at a pair of officers with a knife raised over his head. Cell phone video released shortly after the shooting revealed that he neither lunged nor ever raised a knife.\n\nThe killings of Brown, Powell and Myers have widened an already gaping abyss of mistrust between the black community and the police.\n\n\"With Vonderrit you have the structure saying trust me while we find the truth. But how can we trust you in the midst of all of this,\" said DeRay McKesson, a protest organizer. \"How dare you demand my trust when you continue to violate our ability to be alive, our freedom to assemble and continue to threaten the assembly of black bodies.\"\n\n\"We're out here because people are dying,\" McKesson added. \"We also refuse to live in a world where blackness is a death sentence. I refuse to let that be my reality.\"\n\nMany believe the events that led to Myers's death was an act of racial profiling.\n\nPolice said the off-duty officer had stopped Myers and a group of men during a \"pedestrian check,\" and that the men scattered. Police initially said the officer gave chase and that at some point Myers hopped menacingly from behind a bush. The police version later changed, as no bushes apparently exist where the shooting occurred.\n\nThe latest iteration of the story alleges that the officer chased Myers into an alley, where they engaged in some sort of physical confrontation that ended with Myers running away, falling to the ground and firing on the officer.\n\nPolice say Myers fired three shots and that the gun they believe was used in the shooting was recovered at the scene.\n\n\"The thing is even if Vonderrit did start shooting at the cop I can't necessarily say, especially in the environment we are currently in with everything going on in the city with Mike Brown, I still have an extreme level of distrust of the police,\" protester Leon Kemp said. \"I have to take what they say with a grain of salt and I'm still skeptical.\"\n\n'I Just Can't Move'\n\nLast Monday morning more than 1,000 people staged a massive sit-in on the campus of St. Louis University, not far from where Myers was killed in the city's Shaw neighborhood. Protesters blocked intersections, jumping rope and throwing balls, a play on a common chant during rallies that authority \"think it's a game, think it's a joke.\"\n\nPolice in riot gear stood at the ready, as the peaceful protests swelled through the campus. At one point protesters held a moment of silence, a minute for each day since the teen was killed.\n\nMyers father, Vonderrit Myers Sr. stood at the front of the crowd.\n\n\"You make my heart feel easy,\" he said over a loudspeaker. \"God bless you.\"\n\nThe Myers family has joined a national club of heartbroken parents whose children have been taken, regardless of circumstances, too soon.\n\nA few days earlier, the fathers of Michael Brown Jr. and Vonderrit Myers Jr. met face to face for the first time.\n\n\"It was really a beautiful moment,\" said the Rev. Carlton Lee, who was in the room during the meeting. \"They just talked and showed love. It's what they both needed.\"\n\nDuring the meeting Ron Davis, the father of Jordan Davis, called in and spoke with both men. Tracey Martin, Trayvon Martin's father, has also reached out.\n\nVonderitt Myers Sr. was scheduled to join Michael Brown Sr. for a service at Rev. Lee's Flood Christian Church. But in the middle of his sermon, Lee received a text from Myers, saying: \"I just can't move.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Words were exchanged between Dunn and the teens inside and at some point the 47-year-old pulled out a gun and fired ten shots into the car, mortally wounding Davis, who was unarmed. The gunfire missed the other teens, who were also unarmed.\n\nDunn claimed he saw someone aim a gun from one of the car's windows. Police found no weapon at the scene.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Dunn and his girlfriend drove back to their nearby hotel and ordered pizza. The next day the couple drove 175 miles south of Jacksonville to Dunn's home where he was later arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder.\n\nDunn also reportedly described the teens he fired on as \"thugs\" and \"gangsters\" in his initial conversations with authorities about the incident.\n\nThe case also took on added significance since it came just months after former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot and killed unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.\n\nBoth cases struck racial cords and spurred national protests and added to a string of killings of unarmed black men that prompted dialogue about the often deadly interactions between armed whites and unarmed black men especially.\n\nLast summer Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges related to Martin's death.\n\nIn February of this year, Dunn was found guilty of three counts of attempted murder and firing into an occupied vehicle. However, the judge declared a mistrial on the count of first-degree murder, which results in a retrial this month. The ruling angered many who saw the case as a slam-dunk, while discouraging others still in shock over the Zimmerman acquittal.\n\nDunn testified in his own defense, claiming that he feared for his life when he shot at Davis and his fellow passengers.\n\n\"He wasn't shooting at the tires. He wasn't shooting at the windows. He was shooting to kill, aiming at Jordan Davis,\" prosecutor Erin Wolfson told jurors.\n\nDuring court proceedings this week, Dunn told jurors reiterated what he'd said to law enforcement shortly after the shooting, that he saw a \"very angry-looking young man\" in the back seat, referring to Davis, who he said then raised a barrel of a gun to the window and threatened to kill him.\n\n\"I saw the barrel of a gun. I'm petrified. I'm in fear for my life. This guy just threatened to kill me - and he showed me a gun,\" Dunn testified on the witness stand during his retrial, according to reports. The jury on Wednesday deliberated for less than five hours on Wednesday, a stark contrast from the 30 hours the jury in Dunn's original trial took to return its decision.\n\nDunn, 47, already faces at least 60 years in prison for his earlier convictions.\n\nFollowing the hearing Davis's parents, Ron Davis and Lucy McBath told reporters that the verdict was not just their family's victory alone.\n\n\"We are very grateful that justice has been served, justice not only for Jordan, but justice for Trayvon and justice all the nameless, faceless children and people that will never have a voice,\" Lucy McBath, Jordan's mother said after the verdict. \"And Ron and I are committed to giving our lives to walking out Jordan's justice and Jordan's legacy.\"\n\n\"We know that Jordan's life and legacy will live on for others,\" McBath said.\n\nRon Davis said he found solace and reassurance in the verdict.\n\n\"I wanted Jacksonville to be a shining example that you can have a jury made up of mostly white people, white men and to be an example to the rest of the world to stop the discriminatory practices, stop discriminating, stop looking where we have to look at juries and say what the makeup of juries are,\" he said.\n\nThe names of both Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis have been intoned in recent weeks as unrest continues in Ferguson, MO over the cop-killing of black teen Michael Brown.  Like Martin and Davis before him, Brown was unarmed at the time of his killing.\n\nThe list of cases involving unarmed young black men killed by white men or law enforcement continues to grow, as do the protests demanding justice in their name.\n\nAttorney John Phillips, who has represented the Davis family in this case for two years, said hearing the guilty verdict was \"surreal\" and brought an aspect of closure. He said he felt prosecutors were better prepared to counter defense attempts to paint Jordan Davis in a negative light. In the retrial, Phillips said \"the race card wasn't played, it was an American card.\"\n\nHe added: \"Jordan opened the door to people who's minds were closed before all this happened.\"\n\n\"All across this nation, every time there is a trial between a victim that is black and someone that shot him that is white, we look at what is the make-up of the jury. Is the black victim going to be represented? Hopefully this is a start where we don't have to look at the makeup of the jury anymore,\" Ron Davis said. \"All we can do is look at the case, look at the minds and the souls and the hearts of people, of human beings, not of skin color, but of human beings.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

The New York march was conceived and organized by Synead Nichols and Umaara Iynaas Elliott , two young performers , with support later coming from Million Hoodies Movement for Justice and Justice League NYC . Similar demonstrations took place in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and other cities across the country. Among the signs and chants that decorated the day, the words \"Black Lives Matter\" were perhaps the most popular. The simple but powerful slogan was created by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, and has moved from a Twitter hashtag to \"movement project,\" to borrow Garza's phrase, that has \"connected people across the country working to end the various forms of injustice impacting our people\" and \"created space for the celebration and humanization of Black lives.\" All that is a bit different from what unfolded in the nation's capital that same day. Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network (NAN) called for a national march on Washington. They drew a crowd of about 10,000 , but among those were some young people expressing anger toward Sharpton and his organization, suggesting that the event was co-opting their struggle for Sharpton's own aggrandizement, diluting their message and drowning out the voices of the people who have faced down tanks, tear gas and rubber bullets in their efforts to get justice. The tension reached a tipping point when a group of activists, some who had been on the ground in Ferguson from the day Michael Brown was killed, took to the stage and demanded the microphone. Johnetta Elzie, one half of the duo responsible for the Ferguson e-mail newsletter that has kept its subscribers apprised of the latest in movement news, used the moment before the microphone was cut off to say : \"This movement was started by the young people. We started this. It should be young people all over this stage. It should be young people all up here.\" Sharpton told The Root there were young people invited to speak. The day after all of these marches took place, reclusive soul singer D'Angelo released the long-awaited third album, Black Messiah. It's quite a hefty title, particularly for a project fifteen years in the making. In explaining why he chose this title for this new album, D'Angelo wrote : \"For me, the title is about all of us. It's about the world. It's about an idea we can aspire to. We should all aspire to be a Black Messiah....bIt's not about praising one charismatic leader but celebrating thousands of them....' Black Messiah' is not one man. It's a feeling that, collectively, we are all that leader.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In order for us all to be leaders, though, we also need to know what role we play in the movement. I think this is what some of our elders are struggling with most. Sharpton has been a constant presence in the streets and in the media for nearly thirty years now. There's no denying that his work, however polarizing he or his persona have been, has kept the victims of police violence in our national consciousness when others would have turned away. But now, at 60 years old with a nationally syndicated radio show, an MSNBC primetime television program and a seat in President Obama's unofficial cabinet, Sharpton's days as an outside agitator are over. He is firmly part of the establishment. And being part of the establishment (and wanting to maintain that position) necessitates that you not advance an agenda aimed at radical change, lest you compromise your own privileges. Sharpton has become a leading voice or respectability politics , consistently admonishing black youth for their choices in music and clothing. And his position on police brutality is that the problem is a few bad apples, rather tha the racist and unjust nature of policing in the United States. If all we are left with is Sharpton to lead a grassroots movement from an establishment position, we march toward justice would move along at a pace that Toni Morrison's \" slow walk of trees \" would find too stagnant. But it isn't all bad. We could use more insiders that understand and/or are sympathetic to the voices of outsiders. From his new position, Sharpton could be amplifying the voices of those young people fighting every day in this new movement, providing them a platform to be heard. The media attention that he once had to fight for he can now hand over to a new generation with relative ease. But he has to understand that he no longer defines the movement. In saying that, I don't mean to suggest that Sharpton, or any other leaders/activists/organizers of his generation, should have no say in the movement's direction. Healthy dialogue, debate and critique from all sides are vital to any movement. But when you're sucking up all the oxygen in the room, and not using your resources toward the most effective means , you have to ask yourself if you're being more of a hindrance to progress. This new movement is being led by mostly young black women who won't allow us to forget that black women's lives matter, too (Columbia University Law professor Kimberle Crenshaw was present with a large banner that featured the pictues and names of black women and girls also killed by police). It is drawing in diverse crowds, including white allies who are not calling for gradual change, but a total end to white supremacy. The people in the street have neck tattoos, are dressed in sagging skinny jeans, and curse loudly (among the more popular chants: \"BACK UP, BACK UP, WE WANT FREEDOM, FREEDOM, ALL THESE RACIST ASS COPS, WE DON'T NEED 'EM, NEED 'EM!\" and \"WHO SHUT SHIT DOWN? WE SHUT SHIT DOWN!\"). The movement doesn't look or sound like anything our elders remember (or were taught) about the civil rights era. And that's OK. We have a new fight. We have to create a new model of resistance. Everyone has a role to play, and in order for a movement to be successful, everyone (young and old) must understand what that role is and not be afraid to shift into a new one when the time for that comes.\n\nAll that is a bit different from what unfolded in the nation's capital that same day.

They have been inspired by the #blacklivesmatter demonstrations directed against the killing of unarmed black men and women by police as well as the inability of the criminal justice system to deliver justice. The most remarkable part of these protests was not just their breadth nor the stature of the athletes involved but that commissioners and coaches seemed to be allowing it and, in some cases, even nodding in approval. Clearly suspending LeBron James for being upset about the killing of unarmed African-Americans was not seen as savvy public relations. Now, in the wake of the horrific killing of two NYPD detectives, everything has changed. This eruption of athlete activism will probably not only come to a close but get thrown down the memory hole where the Masters of Sports keep the lost athletic years of Muhammad Ali, John Carlos and Craig Hodges. In other words, management support will die. The sports bosses-and probably friends and family as well-will tell players that it is time to shut up and play. They will be told that it would be the heights of insensitivity to be seen as criticizing the police while officers, their families and many others are in mourning. It would be tasteless, bad for business, and even dangerous. If the athlete-activists do retreat into silence, it would be a tragic mistake. Now more than ever, players who wore the slogan \"I Can't Breathe\" a week ago should wear it today. In fact, trying to find your breath when police and media are declaring war against a peaceful movement could not be more critical. For players to say that standing with the families of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and others would now be \"inappropriate\" is a concession to political actors who are maliciously reframing why they stepped up in the first place. The senseless murder of two police officers by a suicidal lone gunman with a history of mental illness in no way negates the single most important organizing principle of the movement: that black lives matter. Those like Rudy Giuliani, George Pataki, and their ilk who are equating this movement with violence and murder have never given a damn about opposing police brutality. Instead, they see themselves as foot soldiers in a bigger project of chilling, burying or even criminalizing all criticism of anyone who wears a badge. The entire focus of everyone involved in this movement-from the people in the street to LeBron and Derrick Rose-has been to demand that African-Americans be afforded the same humanity as everyone else: to be treated as people and not \"demons\" that need to be put down. There is nothing in the slogans \"black lives matter\" or \"I can't breathe\" or the marches and die-ins that remotely suggests that projecting violence toward police is a solution to police violence. In fact, we have seen athletes like the NFL's Reggie Bush and pro wrestler MVP who have been both part of the movement and have police officers in their immediate family. Given the explicit calls for vengeance by the NYPD and the rush by the media to place the blame for the shooting on people protesting violence, athletes could use their stature to assert that this movement is just. I am well aware that this is easy as hell for me to say. It's not my risk. It's not my paycheck. It's not my livelihood. But when you lend support to a movement, you bear a responsibility for that movement's well being. Black lives matter, and in fact that needs to be expressed with urgency. As long-time criminal justice organizer Keeanga Yahmatta-Taylor said to me, \"I can hardly imagine the fear coursing through black New York today. Don't let your young sons out of the house. This is what we can't give into-the siege in black communities to avenge murder in the name of the law.\" It's easy when management is patting you on the back, thousands are in the street and Fox News is in the corner mumbling to itself. But now the sunshine is gone and the chill is settling in. If LeBron or Derrick Rose-hell, if Nik Stauskas or Jeremy Lin-can turn their spotlight into even a little bit of sunlight, it will make a difference. If you believed that LeBron, Kenny Britt, Ariyana Smith, the women of Berkeley and so many other athlete activists were on the side of right a week ago, then there is no reason to not believe that they are still right today. Their voices are needed more than ever.\n\nThe most remarkable part of these protests was not just their breadth nor the stature of the athletes involved but that commissioners and coaches seemed to be allowing it and, in some cases, even nodding in approval.

The video shows Blake, a Black man, walking towards his parked vehicle followed by two police officers who have their guns drawn on him. As Blake reaches his car door, one of the officers grabs Blake's tank top and holds him in place as he, or the other officer, fires multiple shots into Blake at point-blank range. In the video, seven shots can be heard. Witnesses say Blake had exited his car not long before to break up a fight between two women. Cops, who were apparently called to the scene, claim that Blake was noncompliant with their instructions when they arrived. Blake's three young children were in the car when the police shot him. Blake was taken to a hospital, where he remains in the intensive care unit. Less than 24 hours later, on Monday, Republicans started their national nominating convention in a crowded, mask-optional room in Charlotte, N.C. Vice President Mike Pence, accepting his renomination to his office, declared, \"We're gonna back the Blue.\" Pence, apparently, couldn't say \"Black lives matter.\" Not only that, he insisted on elevating the police, which is a profession, to the level of an immutable (if, yes, constructed) characteristic like race, color, or ethnicity. There's no such thing as a \"blue\" life. There are just people armed at the behest of the state who are supposed to follow constitutional guidelines while they protect and serve unarmed citizens. Such was the first installment of the Republicans' days-long convention-as-culture war, which will cast cops, like the ones who shot Blake, as victims in need of \"protection\" from an unarmed citizenry. If Blake's story comes up at all, it will arrive in the form of red-faced denunciations of the protesters decrying Blake's attempted murder, rather than outrage over the attempted murder of another unarmed Black man. Pence didn't even bother to offer \"thoughts and prayers\" to Blake or his children or family. When it comes to Black men gunned down by the cops, even the usual useless platitudes get caught in Republican throats. Current Issue View our current issue Pence, presumably, isn't at all sorry that a Black man was shot several times in the back as his children cried out in horror. I imagine he, and most Republicans, think the murder was justified. I can tell you exactly what the cops will say: They'll say that they thought Blake was \"reaching for a gun\" somewhere in his vehicle (even though there was no gun). The cops will say, with a straight face, that they shot a man in the back in \"self-defense.\" And that defense might work. Betty Shelby, the cop who shot Terrence Crutcher in the middle of a Tulsa street when she was surrounded by fellow officers and a police helicopter, was acquitted. Many Republicans just don't think gunning down unarmed Black men is illegal. Many of them probably think the Black guy had it coming, for one reason or another. The Republican Party has fully aligned itself with the most violent and racist elements in our society. Everybody from the white supremacists who showed up in Charlottesville to QAnon conspiracy theorists to unashamed bigots like Laura Loomer-anybody, quite simply, who has violent impulses toward people of color-has a home in the modern Republican Party.

It's because cops know that Trump and the Republicans will take their side against any Black person they murder. Republicans simply do not want to protect Black people from the police. Democrats haven't always been champions of Black lives either. But Republicans have stood, and continue to stand, against every suggested measure to address police brutality. I'm not just talking about the big, structural changes that progressives have been pushing in recent years; Republicans oppose even the small changes that would simply make it harder for cops to gun down Black people with impunity. Republicans oppose measures that would bring more transparency to police forces through the disclosure of their disciplinary records. Republicans oppose a national registry of \"bad apples\" so that they can't be shuffled from one department to another. Republicans oppose independent commissions set up to prosecute police. Republicans oppose federal oversight and consent decrees entered into with the Department of Justice, oppose federal use-of-force regulations, and oppose strengthening Fourth Amendment protections to prevent cops from racial profiling or executing no-knock warrants. It would be possible to support any or all of these positions and still be a \"law and order\" Republican. Transparency, accountability, and oversight over policing are ideas everybody should agree to, whether they believe that systemic racism infects law enforcement or not. But you won't find those kinds of Republicans, or plans, at the convention. Instead of an anti-police-brutality agenda, Republicans have Tim Scott, the Senator from South Carolina who happens to be Black. Scott spoke last night at the convention. Scott's proposals to address police brutality are underwhelming, but if Scott represented the actual Republican agenda on police violence, it would at least be a starting point. But Scott's ideas were not adopted as part of the Republican Party platform. In fact, the Republican Party in 2020 adopted no platform at all. The GOP blamed (wait for it) coronavirus social-distancing rules for preventing it from gathering and agreeing on a 2020 agenda. Instead of adopting actual policies, the Republicans just put out a blanket resolution \"enthusiastically\" supporting Donald Trump. I'm not making that up. The 2020 GOP is not a political party; it is, officially , a cult of personality set up to support Trump. I f there is one thing we know about Trump and the party that is now forever tied to his existence, it's that they do not care if people die. Black and brown people are, and have long been, at the top of that list of not caring, but the thing about death cults is that they tend to expand. Today's Republicans don't care if people are killed by law enforcement. They don't care if people die in floods, hurricanes, or fires brought on by climate change. They figuratively shrug their shoulders as our children are gunned down at school. And just a few weeks back, we saw President Trump literally shrug his shoulders and say \"It is what it is\" when confronted with the reality of the Americans felled by Covid-19 on his watch.

They don't have to come up with a national plan to combat the virus if there was nothing that could be done anyway. Grandma had to die of something, I guess. They don't have to respond to mass shootings if they act like school shooters are unpredictable lightning bolts from an angry God. They don't have to address police brutality if Black lives do not matter.

Cops, who were apparently called to the scene, claim that Blake was noncompliant with their instructions when they arrived. Blake's three young children were in the car when the police shot him. Blake was taken to a hospital, where he remains in the intensive care unit. Less than 24 hours later, on Monday, Republicans started their national nominating convention in a crowded, mask-optional room in Charlotte, N.C. Vice President Mike Pence, accepting his renomination to his office, declared, \"We're gonna back the Blue.\" Pence, apparently, couldn't say \"Black lives matter.\" Not only that, he insisted on elevating the police, which is a profession, to the level of an immutable (if, yes, constructed) characteristic like race, color, or ethnicity. There's no such thing as a \"blue\" life. There are just people armed at the behest of the state who are supposed to follow constitutional guidelines while they protect and serve unarmed citizens. Such was the first installment of the Republicans' days-long convention-as-culture war, which will cast cops, like the ones who shot Blake, as victims in need of \"protection\" from an unarmed citizenry. If Blake's story comes up at all, it will arrive in the form of red-faced denunciations of the protesters decrying Blake's attempted murder, rather than outrage over the attempted murder of another unarmed Black man. Pence didn't even bother to offer \"thoughts and prayers\" to Blake or his children or family. When it comes to Black men gunned down by the cops, even the usual useless platitudes get caught in Republican throats. Current Issue View our current issue Pence, presumably, isn't at all sorry that a Black man was shot several times in the back as his children cried out in horror. I imagine he, and most Republicans, think the murder was justified. I can tell you exactly what the cops will say: They'll say that they thought Blake was \"reaching for a gun\" somewhere in his vehicle (even though there was no gun). The cops will say, with a straight face, that they shot a man in the back in \"self-defense.\" And that defense might work. Betty Shelby, the cop who shot Terrence Crutcher in the middle of a Tulsa street when she was surrounded by fellow officers and a police helicopter, was acquitted. Many Republicans just don't think gunning down unarmed Black men is illegal. Many of them probably think the Black guy had it coming, for one reason or another. The Republican Party has fully aligned itself with the most violent and racist elements in our society. Everybody from the white supremacists who showed up in Charlottesville to QAnon conspiracy theorists to unashamed bigots like Laura Loomer-anybody, quite simply, who has violent impulses toward people of color-has a home in the modern Republican Party.

It's because cops know that Trump and the Republicans will take their side against any Black person they murder. Republicans simply do not want to protect Black people from the police. Democrats haven't always been champions of Black lives either. But Republicans have stood, and continue to stand, against every suggested measure to address police brutality. I'm not just talking about the big, structural changes that progressives have been pushing in recent years; Republicans oppose even the small changes that would simply make it harder for cops to gun down Black people with impunity. Republicans oppose measures that would bring more transparency to police forces through the disclosure of their disciplinary records. Republicans oppose a national registry of \"bad apples\" so that they can't be shuffled from one department to another. Republicans oppose independent commissions set up to prosecute police. Republicans oppose federal oversight and consent decrees entered into with the Department of Justice, oppose federal use-of-force regulations, and oppose strengthening Fourth Amendment protections to prevent cops from racial profiling or executing no-knock warrants. It would be possible to support any or all of these positions and still be a \"law and order\" Republican. Transparency, accountability, and oversight over policing are ideas everybody should agree to, whether they believe that systemic racism infects law enforcement or not. But you won't find those kinds of Republicans, or plans, at the convention. Instead of an anti-police-brutality agenda, Republicans have Tim Scott, the Senator from South Carolina who happens to be Black. Scott spoke last night at the convention. Scott's proposals to address police brutality are underwhelming, but if Scott represented the actual Republican agenda on police violence, it would at least be a starting point. But Scott's ideas were not adopted as part of the Republican Party platform. In fact, the Republican Party in 2020 adopted no platform at all. The GOP blamed (wait for it) coronavirus social-distancing rules for preventing it from gathering and agreeing on a 2020 agenda. Instead of adopting actual policies, the Republicans just put out a blanket resolution \"enthusiastically\" supporting Donald Trump. I'm not making that up. The 2020 GOP is not a political party; it is, officially , a cult of personality set up to support Trump.

When it comes to Black men gunned down by the cops, even the usual useless platitudes get caught in Republican throats. Current Issue View our current issue Pence, presumably, isn't at all sorry that a Black man was shot several times in the back as his children cried out in horror. I imagine he, and most Republicans, think the murder was justified. I can tell you exactly what the cops will say: They'll say that they thought Blake was \"reaching for a gun\" somewhere in his vehicle (even though there was no gun). The cops will say, with a straight face, that they shot a man in the back in \"self-defense.\" And that defense might work. Betty Shelby, the cop who shot Terrence Crutcher in the middle of a Tulsa street when she was surrounded by fellow officers and a police helicopter, was acquitted. Many Republicans just don't think gunning down unarmed Black men is illegal. Many of them probably think the Black guy had it coming, for one reason or another. The Republican Party has fully aligned itself with the most violent and racist elements in our society.

It's because cops know that Trump and the Republicans will take their side against any Black person they murder. Republicans simply do not want to protect Black people from the police. Democrats haven't always been champions of Black lives either. But Republicans have stood, and continue to stand, against every suggested measure to address police brutality. I'm not just talking about the big, structural changes that progressives have been pushing in recent years; Republicans oppose even the small changes that would simply make it harder for cops to gun down Black people with impunity. Republicans oppose measures that would bring more transparency to police forces through the disclosure of their disciplinary records. Republicans oppose a national registry of \"bad apples\" so that they can't be shuffled from one department to another. Republicans oppose independent commissions set up to prosecute police. Republicans oppose federal oversight and consent decrees entered into with the Department of Justice, oppose federal use-of-force regulations, and oppose strengthening Fourth Amendment protections to prevent cops from racial profiling or executing no-knock warrants. It would be possible to support any or all of these positions and still be a \"law and order\" Republican. Transparency, accountability, and oversight over policing are ideas everybody should agree to, whether they believe that systemic racism infects law enforcement or not. But you won't find those kinds of Republicans, or plans, at the convention. Instead of an anti-police-brutality agenda, Republicans have Tim Scott, the Senator from South Carolina who happens to be Black. Scott spoke last night at the convention. Scott's proposals to address police brutality are underwhelming, but if Scott represented the actual Republican agenda on police violence, it would at least be a starting point. But Scott's ideas were not adopted as part of the Republican Party platform. In fact, the Republican Party in 2020 adopted no platform at all. The GOP blamed (wait for it) coronavirus social-distancing rules for preventing it from gathering and agreeing on a 2020 agenda. Instead of adopting actual policies, the Republicans just put out a blanket resolution \"enthusiastically\" supporting Donald Trump. I'm not making that up. The 2020 GOP is not a political party; it is, officially , a cult of personality set up to support Trump. I f there is one thing we know about Trump and the party that is now forever tied to his existence, it's that they do not care if people die. Black and brown people are, and have long been, at the top of that list of not caring, but the thing about death cults is that they tend to expand. Today's Republicans don't care if people are killed by law enforcement. They don't care if people die in floods, hurricanes, or fires brought on by climate change. They figuratively shrug their shoulders as our children are gunned down at school. And just a few weeks back, we saw President Trump literally shrug his shoulders and say \"It is what it is\" when confronted with the reality of the Americans felled by Covid-19 on his watch. The callousness of Trump and the Republicans is matched only by the nihilism of their supporters.

Instead of an anti-police-brutality agenda, Republicans have Tim Scott, the Senator from South Carolina who happens to be Black. Scott spoke last night at the convention. Scott's proposals to address police brutality are underwhelming, but if Scott represented the actual Republican agenda on police violence, it would at least be a starting point. But Scott's ideas were not adopted as part of the Republican Party platform. In fact, the Republican Party in 2020 adopted no platform at all. The GOP blamed (wait for it) coronavirus social-distancing rules for preventing it from gathering and agreeing on a 2020 agenda. Instead of adopting actual policies, the Republicans just put out a blanket resolution \"enthusiastically\" supporting Donald Trump. I'm not making that up. The 2020 GOP is not a political party; it is, officially , a cult of personality set up to support Trump. I f there is one thing we know about Trump and the party that is now forever tied to his existence, it's that they do not care if people die. Black and brown people are, and have long been, at the top of that list of not caring, but the thing about death cults is that they tend to expand. Today's Republicans don't care if people are killed by law enforcement. They don't care if people die in floods, hurricanes, or fires brought on by climate change. They figuratively shrug their shoulders as our children are gunned down at school. And just a few weeks back, we saw President Trump literally shrug his shoulders and say \"It is what it is\" when confronted with the reality of the Americans felled by Covid-19 on his watch. The callousness of Trump and the Republicans is matched only by the nihilism of their supporters. A recent poll found that 57 percent of Republicans viewed the 170,000 (and counting) American deaths from Covid-19 as \"acceptable.\" More from Mystal How Yale Became the Latest Target in the Plot to Kill Affirmative Action Elie Mystal The DNC Refuses to Address the Elephant in the Room Elie Mystal America's Racist Police Won't Be Dismantled by 2 Weeks of Protests Elie Mystal This willful indifference in the face of systemic suffering is the defining feature of the modern Republican Party.

Signs are even emerging of a new level of social movement activity around racial justice and the criminal justice system that may outlast the current wave of anger and heartbreak. What stands before us, therefore, is the hard work of both building political power and articulating what that change might look like. So far politicians, police and even many community leaders have trotted out many of the well-worn proposals that have failed to deliver in the past and offer little hope for the future. Police Diversity While the racial imbalance between the police and the policed in Ferguson was no doubt a contributing factor in the breakdown of community trust in the police, increasing police diversity is unlikely to improve things much on its own. Increasingly, large urban police departments are becoming much more diverse and reflective of the communities being policed. For years, Philadelphia police have had to live in the city, resulting in a department that largely mirrors the city's demographics. That department, however, has been rife with corruption, mismanagement and excessive use of force. As a result, residents of color have seen little relief from the daily indignities of discourtesy and aggressive criminalization. Even the NYPD has significantly enhanced its diversity in recent years in terms of race, ethnicity, gender and language skills, but few are likely to claim that this has led to a dividend of courtesy or respect. Recent uproars over the diversity of NYPD leadership in recent months are a further red herring. There is no evidence that black and Latino police executives have been a force for moderation under either Commissioners Kelly or Bratton. Top cops like Phil Banks and Rafael Pineiro oversaw a massive expansion of stop-and-frisk under Kelly and fully embraced the over-policing of communities of color as the primary strategy for crime reduction. Community Policing Everyone likes the idea of a neighborhood police officer who knows and respects the community and can tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. Unfortunately, this is a mythic understanding of the history and nature of urban policing. What distinguishes the police from other city agencies is the legal authorization to use force. Their primary tools of problem solving are arrest and coercion. While we need police to follow the law and be restrained in their use of force, we cannot expect them to be significantly more friendly given their current role in society. The reality is that when given the task of enforcing a war on drugs, stamping out quality-of-life violations and engaging in \"broken windows\" policing, their interactions with the public in high crime and disorder areas is going to be at best gruff and distant and at worst hostile and abusive. When their basic job is to criminalize all disorderly behavior, the public will resist them and view their efforts as intrusive and illegitimate, and the police will react to this resistance with defensiveness and increased assertiveness. Community policing is not possible under these conditions.

Officers are subjected to paramilitary drilling and discipline, lectured on paperwork and legal procedure, taught how to drive and shoot a gun, and then let loose on the public, where their colleagues quickly tell them to forget everything they learned in the academy. So, yes, training improvements are needed, but their effect on communities of color are unlikely to be significantly beneficial. While inadequate training and supervision may have played a role in some recent high-profile incidents, the fact remains that the massive criminalization of communities of color is being carried out using \"proper procedures.\" The tens of thousands of arrests for low-level drug possession, trespassing, jumping subway turnstiles and dozens of other \"broken window\" offenses are generally carried out consistent with police policy, if not strict legal standards. Eric Garner may have been killed by improper arrest procedures and use of force, but he was also killed because the police were following orders to arrest people for selling loose cigarettes. Community Control of the Police Even more radical strategies like calling for community control of the police have serious drawbacks. There are two main problems. The first is that communities are not well suited for this task. Most people have very little interest or expertise in undertaking the role of managing a complex city service. In addition, no matter what it might say on paper, community power is typically no match for the entrenched bureaucratic power of the police. Numerous studies show that even when the community is supposed to be given a role in directing police services, the police quickly come to control the community process. Second, even if communities were to develop the power to direct the police, we might not like the results. Given the highly segregated nature of American cities, enclaves of racialized policing could be expected to emerge, as white communities attempt to wall themselves off from the perceived threats of outsiders. Even in communities of color, local community leaders are not always operating with the best interests of the entire community in mind. Those that tend to populate community institutions tend to be older, more conservative and closely tied to local landlords and businesses. These players are unlikely to be the source of dramatic changes in police policy. Body Cameras This is a reform that has some potential. But body cameras are only as effective as the accountability mechanisms in place. If local DAs and grand juries are unwilling to act on the evidence, then the courts won't be an effective tool for accountability, as we have seen in the Garner case and several others. It is possible that cameras will lead to more civil litigation and more internal disciplinary procedures, causing the city to pay out large damages to the Garner family and that one or more of the officers involved may be disciplined or even fired over their actions. Civil judgments can put pressure on departments for change and can even result in settlement agreements that mandate specific changes, as in the stop-and-frisk case. Firings and significant discipline can also alter officer behavior. Finally, the accountability mechanism of last resort is the public. The combination of critical media coverage and protest action can have the effect of shifting public opinion sufficiently or creating a governing crisis that political leaders have to address. This is what happened around stop-and-frisk when the stopping of hundreds of thousands of young men of color was transformed from a policing issue into a civil rights issue. Police Prosecutions It is unlikely that criminal prosecution will ever be a significant driver of police reform. There is a fundamental conflict of interest for DAs who must work closely with police and typically rely on their political support for re-election. Also, the legal standards for police use of force are incredibly permissive and give heavy weight to officer perceptions of danger at the time of the incident. We can take steps to strengthen this process. We could take prosecutions out of the hands of local DAs and turn it over to a statewide \"Blue Desk.\" This office would be responsible for investigating and prosecuting all cases of police misconduct statewide and would ideally develop the expertise and independence necessary for these difficult cases. Changing the Police Role What we really need, though, is a major rethink of the police role. A part of the story of over-policing is hundreds of years old and is about slave patrols, Black Codes, and Jim Crow. Another part of the story, however, is more recent. It's about the war on drugs, the war on crime and \"quality of life\" and \"broken windows\" policing. We need to push back on this dramatic expansion of police power and its role in the development of mass incarceration that has radically transformed poor communities of color in profoundly negative ways and is at the heart of the \"new Jim Crow.\" For too long, residents in these communities have faced a terrible dilemma. On the one hand, they have suffered the consequences of high crime and disorder. It is their children who are shot and robbed. But they have also had to bear the brunt of aggressive, invasive and humiliating policing that has criminalized huge swaths of the community. There must be an alternative to this. We have to take steps to dial back our reliance on the police as the primary tool of resolving neighborhood crime and disorder problems. For instance, we have overwhelming evidence that the policing of drugs is a corrosive and counterproductive strategy that has done nothing to reduce the negative impact of drugs on communities. Drugs are a public health problem, not a policing problem. The same approach should be taken for sex work. Recently Mayor de Blasio announced a new $130 million package to divert people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and to better treat those who are already there. Our nation's jails and prisons have become massive warehouses for the mentally ill, and this is a welcome development. However, it still rests on a foundation of police intervention. Access to services is still predicated on coming into contact with the police. The tragedy is that police are poorly trained and equipped for this role. They are primarily equipped with the tools of arrest and physical coercion, which can be incredibly counterproductive when dealing with a person in crisis. Instead, we should rely on civilian crisis intervention teams. We also need to develop community-based mental health services that don't require criminal justice involvement to access. Similar arguments can be made for dealing with homeless people. Even more serious crime, such as violence committed by youths, may be more receptive to community-based efforts that do not rely on the punitive and coercive power of the police. Across the country community-based organizations in high-crime areas are working with young people to stop the violence using a variety of public health and community empowerment strategies. The overall effectiveness of these strategies is still being evaluated, but we know that they do not come with the many negative collateral consequences of mass criminalization. Along the same lines, we need to get police out of schools. Numerous studies have shown that criminalizing school children worsens safety in the schools and drives the most needy students onto the streets, where they often become involved in more serious criminality. Enlightened school leaders with adequate resources have shown that they can increase school safety through creative restorative justice programs that involve students in disciplinary procedures and attempt to take home and community conditions into consideration in resolving problems. Any real agenda for police reform must look not to make the police friendlier and more professional. Instead, it must work to reduce the police role and replace it with empowered communities working to solve their own problems. We don't need community control of the police. We need community control over services that will create safer and more stable neighborhoods and cities.\n\nWhat stands before us, therefore, is the hard work of both building political power and articulating what that change might look like. So far politicians, police and even many community leaders have trotted out many of the well-worn proposals that have failed to deliver in the past and offer little hope for the future.

The combination of critical media coverage and protest action can have the effect of shifting public opinion sufficiently or creating a governing crisis that political leaders have to address. This is what happened around stop-and-frisk when the stopping of hundreds of thousands of young men of color was transformed from a policing issue into a civil rights issue. Police Prosecutions It is unlikely that criminal prosecution will ever be a significant driver of police reform. There is a fundamental conflict of interest for DAs who must work closely with police and typically rely on their political support for re-election. Also, the legal standards for police use of force are incredibly permissive and give heavy weight to officer perceptions of danger at the time of the incident. We can take steps to strengthen this process. We could take prosecutions out of the hands of local DAs and turn it over to a statewide \"Blue Desk.\" This office would be responsible for investigating and prosecuting all cases of police misconduct statewide and would ideally develop the expertise and independence necessary for these difficult cases. Changing the Police Role What we really need, though, is a major rethink of the police role. A part of the story of over-policing is hundreds of years old and is about slave patrols, Black Codes, and Jim Crow. Another part of the story, however, is more recent. It's about the war on drugs, the war on crime and \"quality of life\" and \"broken windows\" policing. We need to push back on this dramatic expansion of police power and its role in the development of mass incarceration that has radically transformed poor communities of color in profoundly negative ways and is at the heart of the \"new Jim Crow.\" For too long, residents in these communities have faced a terrible dilemma. On the one hand, they have suffered the consequences of high crime and disorder. It is their children who are shot and robbed. But they have also had to bear the brunt of aggressive, invasive and humiliating policing that has criminalized huge swaths of the community. There must be an alternative to this. We have to take steps to dial back our reliance on the police as the primary tool of resolving neighborhood crime and disorder problems. For instance, we have overwhelming evidence that the policing of drugs is a corrosive and counterproductive strategy that has done nothing to reduce the negative impact of drugs on communities. Drugs are a public health problem, not a policing problem. The same approach should be taken for sex work. Recently Mayor de Blasio announced a new $130 million package to divert people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and to better treat those who are already there. Our nation's jails and prisons have become massive warehouses for the mentally ill, and this is a welcome development. However, it still rests on a foundation of police intervention. Access to services is still predicated on coming into contact with the police. The tragedy is that police are poorly trained and equipped for this role. They are primarily equipped with the tools of arrest and physical coercion, which can be incredibly counterproductive when dealing with a person in crisis. Instead, we should rely on civilian crisis intervention teams. We also need to develop community-based mental health services that don't require criminal justice involvement to access. Similar arguments can be made for dealing with homeless people. Even more serious crime, such as violence committed by youths, may be more receptive to community-based efforts that do not rely on the punitive and coercive power of the police. Across the country community-based organizations in high-crime areas are working with young people to stop the violence using a variety of public health and community empowerment strategies. The overall effectiveness of these strategies is still being evaluated, but we know that they do not come with the many negative collateral consequences of mass criminalization. Along the same lines, we need to get police out of schools. Numerous studies have shown that criminalizing school children worsens safety in the schools and drives the most needy students onto the streets, where they often become involved in more serious criminality. Enlightened school leaders with adequate resources have shown that they can increase school safety through creative restorative justice programs that involve students in disciplinary procedures and attempt to take home and community conditions into consideration in resolving problems. Any real agenda for police reform must look not to make the police friendlier and more professional. Instead, it must work to reduce the police role and replace it with empowered communities working to solve their own problems. We don't need community control of the police. We need community control over services that will create safer and more stable neighborhoods and cities.\n\nPolice Diversity While the racial imbalance between the police and the policed in Ferguson was no doubt a contributing factor in the breakdown of community trust in the police, increasing police diversity is unlikely to improve things much on its own. Increasingly, large urban police departments are becoming much more diverse and reflective of the communities being policed. For years, Philadelphia police have had to live in the city, resulting in a department that largely mirrors the city's demographics. That department, however, has been rife with corruption, mismanagement and excessive use of force. As a result, residents of color have seen little relief from the daily indignities of discourtesy and aggressive criminalization. Even the NYPD has significantly enhanced its diversity in recent years in terms of race, ethnicity, gender and language skills, but few are likely to claim that this has led to a dividend of courtesy or respect. Recent uproars over the diversity of NYPD leadership in recent months are a further red herring. There is no evidence that black and Latino police executives have been a force for moderation under either Commissioners Kelly or Bratton. Top cops like Phil Banks and Rafael Pineiro oversaw a massive expansion of stop-and-frisk under Kelly and fully embraced the over-policing of communities of color as the primary strategy for crime reduction. Community Policing Everyone likes the idea of a neighborhood police officer who knows and respects the community and can tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. Unfortunately, this is a mythic understanding of the history and nature of urban policing. What distinguishes the police from other city agencies is the legal authorization to use force. Their primary tools of problem solving are arrest and coercion. While we need police to follow the law and be restrained in their use of force, we cannot expect them to be significantly more friendly given their current role in society. The reality is that when given the task of enforcing a war on drugs, stamping out quality-of-life violations and engaging in \"broken windows\" policing, their interactions with the public in high crime and disorder areas is going to be at best gruff and distant and at worst hostile and abusive. When their basic job is to criminalize all disorderly behavior, the public will resist them and view their efforts as intrusive and illegitimate, and the police will react to this resistance with defensiveness and increased assertiveness. Community policing is not possible under these conditions.

Officers are subjected to paramilitary drilling and discipline, lectured on paperwork and legal procedure, taught how to drive and shoot a gun, and then let loose on the public, where their colleagues quickly tell them to forget everything they learned in the academy. So, yes, training improvements are needed, but their effect on communities of color are unlikely to be significantly beneficial. While inadequate training and supervision may have played a role in some recent high-profile incidents, the fact remains that the massive criminalization of communities of color is being carried out using \"proper procedures.\" The tens of thousands of arrests for low-level drug possession, trespassing, jumping subway turnstiles and dozens of other \"broken window\" offenses are generally carried out consistent with police policy, if not strict legal standards. Eric Garner may have been killed by improper arrest procedures and use of force, but he was also killed because the police were following orders to arrest people for selling loose cigarettes. Community Control of the Police Even more radical strategies like calling for community control of the police have serious drawbacks. There are two main problems. The first is that communities are not well suited for this task. Most people have very little interest or expertise in undertaking the role of managing a complex city service. In addition, no matter what it might say on paper, community power is typically no match for the entrenched bureaucratic power of the police. Numerous studies show that even when the community is supposed to be given a role in directing police services, the police quickly come to control the community process. Second, even if communities were to develop the power to direct the police, we might not like the results. Given the highly segregated nature of American cities, enclaves of racialized policing could be expected to emerge, as white communities attempt to wall themselves off from the perceived threats of outsiders. Even in communities of color, local community leaders are not always operating with the best interests of the entire community in mind. Those that tend to populate community institutions tend to be older, more conservative and closely tied to local landlords and businesses. These players are unlikely to be the source of dramatic changes in police policy. Body Cameras This is a reform that has some potential. But body cameras are only as effective as the accountability mechanisms in place. If local DAs and grand juries are unwilling to act on the evidence, then the courts won't be an effective tool for accountability, as we have seen in the Garner case and several others. It is possible that cameras will lead to more civil litigation and more internal disciplinary procedures, causing the city to pay out large damages to the Garner family and that one or more of the officers involved may be disciplined or even fired over their actions. Civil judgments can put pressure on departments for change and can even result in settlement agreements that mandate specific changes, as in the stop-and-frisk case. Firings and significant discipline can also alter officer behavior. Finally, the accountability mechanism of last resort is the public. The combination of critical media coverage and protest action can have the effect of shifting public opinion sufficiently or creating a governing crisis that political leaders have to address.

Community policing is not possible under these conditions.

Officers are subjected to paramilitary drilling and discipline, lectured on paperwork and legal procedure, taught how to drive and shoot a gun, and then let loose on the public, where their colleagues quickly tell them to forget everything they learned in the academy. So, yes, training improvements are needed, but their effect on communities of color are unlikely to be significantly beneficial. While inadequate training and supervision may have played a role in some recent high-profile incidents, the fact remains that the massive criminalization of communities of color is being carried out using \"proper procedures.\" The tens of thousands of arrests for low-level drug possession, trespassing, jumping subway turnstiles and dozens of other \"broken window\" offenses are generally carried out consistent with police policy, if not strict legal standards. Eric Garner may have been killed by improper arrest procedures and use of force, but he was also killed because the police were following orders to arrest people for selling loose cigarettes. Community Control of the Police Even more radical strategies like calling for community control of the police have serious drawbacks. There are two main problems. The first is that communities are not well suited for this task. Most people have very little interest or expertise in undertaking the role of managing a complex city service. In addition, no matter what it might say on paper, community power is typically no match for the entrenched bureaucratic power of the police. Numerous studies show that even when the community is supposed to be given a role in directing police services, the police quickly come to control the community process. Second, even if communities were to develop the power to direct the police, we might not like the results. Given the highly segregated nature of American cities, enclaves of racialized policing could be expected to emerge, as white communities attempt to wall themselves off from the perceived threats of outsiders. Even in communities of color, local community leaders are not always operating with the best interests of the entire community in mind. Those that tend to populate community institutions tend to be older, more conservative and closely tied to local landlords and businesses. These players are unlikely to be the source of dramatic changes in police policy. Body Cameras This is a reform that has some potential. But body cameras are only as effective as the accountability mechanisms in place. If local DAs and grand juries are unwilling to act on the evidence, then the courts won't be an effective tool for accountability, as we have seen in the Garner case and several others. It is possible that cameras will lead to more civil litigation and more internal disciplinary procedures, causing the city to pay out large damages to the Garner family and that one or more of the officers involved may be disciplined or even fired over their actions. Civil judgments can put pressure on departments for change and can even result in settlement agreements that mandate specific changes, as in the stop-and-frisk case. Firings and significant discipline can also alter officer behavior. Finally, the accountability mechanism of last resort is the public. The combination of critical media coverage and protest action can have the effect of shifting public opinion sufficiently or creating a governing crisis that political leaders have to address. This is what happened around stop-and-frisk when the stopping of hundreds of thousands of young men of color was transformed from a policing issue into a civil rights issue. Police Prosecutions It is unlikely that criminal prosecution will ever be a significant driver of police reform. There is a fundamental conflict of interest for DAs who must work closely with police and typically rely on their political support for re-election. Also, the legal standards for police use of force are incredibly permissive and give heavy weight to officer perceptions of danger at the time of the incident. We can take steps to strengthen this process. We could take prosecutions out of the hands of local DAs and turn it over to a statewide \"Blue Desk.\" This office would be responsible for investigating and prosecuting all cases of police misconduct statewide and would ideally develop the expertise and independence necessary for these difficult cases. Changing the Police Role What we really need, though, is a major rethink of the police role. A part of the story of over-policing is hundreds of years old and is about slave patrols, Black Codes, and Jim Crow. Another part of the story, however, is more recent. It's about the war on drugs, the war on crime and \"quality of life\" and \"broken windows\" policing. We need to push back on this dramatic expansion of police power and its role in the development of mass incarceration that has radically transformed poor communities of color in profoundly negative ways and is at the heart of the \"new Jim Crow.\" For too long, residents in these communities have faced a terrible dilemma. On the one hand, they have suffered the consequences of high crime and disorder. It is their children who are shot and robbed. But they have also had to bear the brunt of aggressive, invasive and humiliating policing that has criminalized huge swaths of the community. There must be an alternative to this. We have to take steps to dial back our reliance on the police as the primary tool of resolving neighborhood crime and disorder problems. For instance, we have overwhelming evidence that the policing of drugs is a corrosive and counterproductive strategy that has done nothing to reduce the negative impact of drugs on communities. Drugs are a public health problem, not a policing problem. The same approach should be taken for sex work. Recently Mayor de Blasio announced a new $130 million package to divert people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and to better treat those who are already there. Our nation's jails and prisons have become massive warehouses for the mentally ill, and this is a welcome development. However, it still rests on a foundation of police intervention. Access to services is still predicated on coming into contact with the police. The tragedy is that police are poorly trained and equipped for this role. They are primarily equipped with the tools of arrest and physical coercion, which can be incredibly counterproductive when dealing with a person in crisis. Instead, we should rely on civilian crisis intervention teams. We also need to develop community-based mental health services that don't require criminal justice involvement to access. Similar arguments can be made for dealing with homeless people. Even more serious crime, such as violence committed by youths, may be more receptive to community-based efforts that do not rely on the punitive and coercive power of the police. Across the country community-based organizations in high-crime areas are working with young people to stop the violence using a variety of public health and community empowerment strategies. The overall effectiveness of these strategies is still being evaluated, but we know that they do not come with the many negative collateral consequences of mass criminalization. Along the same lines, we need to get police out of schools. Numerous studies have shown that criminalizing school children worsens safety in the schools and drives the most needy students onto the streets, where they often become involved in more serious criminality. Enlightened school leaders with adequate resources have shown that they can increase school safety through creative restorative justice programs that involve students in disciplinary procedures and attempt to take home and community conditions into consideration in resolving problems. Any real agenda for police reform must look not to make the police friendlier and more professional. Instead, it must work to reduce the police role and replace it with empowered communities working to solve their own problems. We don't need community control of the police. We need community control over services that will create safer and more stable neighborhoods and cities.\n\nEveryone likes the idea of a neighborhood police officer who knows and respects the community and can tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. Unfortunately, this is a mythic understanding of the history and nature of urban policing. What distinguishes the police from other city agencies is the legal authorization to use force. Their primary tools of problem solving are arrest and coercion. While we need police to follow the law and be restrained in their use of force, we cannot expect them to be significantly more friendly given their current role in society. The reality is that when given the task of enforcing a war on drugs, stamping out quality-of-life violations and engaging in \"broken windows\" policing, their interactions with the public in high crime and disorder areas is going to be at best gruff and distant and at worst hostile and abusive. When their basic job is to criminalize all disorderly behavior, the public will resist them and view their efforts as intrusive and illegitimate, and the police will react to this resistance with defensiveness and increased assertiveness.

Even in communities of color, local community leaders are not always operating with the best interests of the entire community in mind. Those that tend to populate community institutions tend to be older, more conservative and closely tied to local landlords and businesses. These players are unlikely to be the source of dramatic changes in police policy. Body Cameras This is a reform that has some potential. But body cameras are only as effective as the accountability mechanisms in place. If local DAs and grand juries are unwilling to act on the evidence, then the courts won't be an effective tool for accountability, as we have seen in the Garner case and several others. It is possible that cameras will lead to more civil litigation and more internal disciplinary procedures, causing the city to pay out large damages to the Garner family and that one or more of the officers involved may be disciplined or even fired over their actions. Civil judgments can put pressure on departments for change and can even result in settlement agreements that mandate specific changes, as in the stop-and-frisk case. Firings and significant discipline can also alter officer behavior. Finally, the accountability mechanism of last resort is the public. The combination of critical media coverage and protest action can have the effect of shifting public opinion sufficiently or creating a governing crisis that political leaders have to address. This is what happened around stop-and-frisk when the stopping of hundreds of thousands of young men of color was transformed from a policing issue into a civil rights issue. Police Prosecutions It is unlikely that criminal prosecution will ever be a significant driver of police reform. There is a fundamental conflict of interest for DAs who must work closely with police and typically rely on their political support for re-election. Also, the legal standards for police use of force are incredibly permissive and give heavy weight to officer perceptions of danger at the time of the incident. We can take steps to strengthen this process. We could take prosecutions out of the hands of local DAs and turn it over to a statewide \"Blue Desk.\" This office would be responsible for investigating and prosecuting all cases of police misconduct statewide and would ideally develop the expertise and independence necessary for these difficult cases. Changing the Police Role What we really need, though, is a major rethink of the police role. A part of the story of over-policing is hundreds of years old and is about slave patrols, Black Codes, and Jim Crow. Another part of the story, however, is more recent. It's about the war on drugs, the war on crime and \"quality of life\" and \"broken windows\" policing. We need to push back on this dramatic expansion of police power and its role in the development of mass incarceration that has radically transformed poor communities of color in profoundly negative ways and is at the heart of the \"new Jim Crow.\" For too long, residents in these communities have faced a terrible dilemma. On the one hand, they have suffered the consequences of high crime and disorder. It is their children who are shot and robbed. But they have also had to bear the brunt of aggressive, invasive and humiliating policing that has criminalized huge swaths of the community. There must be an alternative to this. We have to take steps to dial back our reliance on the police as the primary tool of resolving neighborhood crime and disorder problems. For instance, we have overwhelming evidence that the policing of drugs is a corrosive and counterproductive strategy that has done nothing to reduce the negative impact of drugs on communities. Drugs are a public health problem, not a policing problem. The same approach should be taken for sex work. Recently Mayor de Blasio announced a new $130 million package to divert people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and to better treat those who are already there. Our nation's jails and prisons have become massive warehouses for the mentally ill, and this is a welcome development. However, it still rests on a foundation of police intervention. Access to services is still predicated on coming into contact with the police. The tragedy is that police are poorly trained and equipped for this role. They are primarily equipped with the tools of arrest and physical coercion, which can be incredibly counterproductive when dealing with a person in crisis. Instead, we should rely on civilian crisis intervention teams. We also need to develop community-based mental health services that don't require criminal justice involvement to access. Similar arguments can be made for dealing with homeless people. Even more serious crime, such as violence committed by youths, may be more receptive to community-based efforts that do not rely on the punitive and coercive power of the police. Across the country community-based organizations in high-crime areas are working with young people to stop the violence using a variety of public health and community empowerment strategies. The overall effectiveness of these strategies is still being evaluated, but we know that they do not come with the many negative collateral consequences of mass criminalization. Along the same lines, we need to get police out of schools. Numerous studies have shown that criminalizing school children worsens safety in the schools and drives the most needy students onto the streets, where they often become involved in more serious criminality. Enlightened school leaders with adequate resources have shown that they can increase school safety through creative restorative justice programs that involve students in disciplinary procedures and attempt to take home and community conditions into consideration in resolving problems. Any real agenda for police reform must look not to make the police friendlier and more professional. Instead, it must work to reduce the police role and replace it with empowered communities working to solve their own problems. We don't need community control of the police. We need community control over services that will create safer and more stable neighborhoods and cities.\n\nWhile inadequate training and supervision may have played a role in some recent high-profile incidents, the fact remains that the massive criminalization of communities of color is being carried out using \"proper procedures.\" The tens of thousands of arrests for low-level drug possession, trespassing, jumping subway turnstiles and dozens of other \"broken window\" offenses are generally carried out consistent with police policy, if not strict legal standards. Eric Garner may have been killed by improper arrest procedures and use of force, but he was also killed because the police were following orders to arrest people for selling loose cigarettes. Community Control of the Police Even more radical strategies like calling for community control of the police have serious drawbacks. There are two main problems. The first is that communities are not well suited for this task. Most people have very little interest or expertise in undertaking the role of managing a complex city service. In addition, no matter what it might say on paper, community power is typically no match for the entrenched bureaucratic power of the police. Numerous studies show that even when the community is supposed to be given a role in directing police services, the police quickly come to control the community process. Second, even if communities were to develop the power to direct the police, we might not like the results. Given the highly segregated nature of American cities, enclaves of racialized policing could be expected to emerge, as white communities attempt to wall themselves off from the perceived threats of outsiders.

We need to push back on this dramatic expansion of police power and its role in the development of mass incarceration that has radically transformed poor communities of color in profoundly negative ways and is at the heart of the \"new Jim Crow.\" For too long, residents in these communities have faced a terrible dilemma. On the one hand, they have suffered the consequences of high crime and disorder. It is their children who are shot and robbed. But they have also had to bear the brunt of aggressive, invasive and humiliating policing that has criminalized huge swaths of the community. There must be an alternative to this. We have to take steps to dial back our reliance on the police as the primary tool of resolving neighborhood crime and disorder problems. For instance, we have overwhelming evidence that the policing of drugs is a corrosive and counterproductive strategy that has done nothing to reduce the negative impact of drugs on communities. Drugs are a public health problem, not a policing problem. The same approach should be taken for sex work. Recently Mayor de Blasio announced a new $130 million package to divert people with mental illness from the criminal justice system and to better treat those who are already there. Our nation's jails and prisons have become massive warehouses for the mentally ill, and this is a welcome development. However, it still rests on a foundation of police intervention. Access to services is still predicated on coming into contact with the police. The tragedy is that police are poorly trained and equipped for this role. They are primarily equipped with the tools of arrest and physical coercion, which can be incredibly counterproductive when dealing with a person in crisis. Instead, we should rely on civilian crisis intervention teams. We also need to develop community-based mental health services that don't require criminal justice involvement to access. Similar arguments can be made for dealing with homeless people. Even more serious crime, such as violence committed by youths, may be more receptive to community-based efforts that do not rely on the punitive and coercive power of the police. Across the country community-based organizations in high-crime areas are working with young people to stop the violence using a variety of public health and community empowerment strategies. The overall effectiveness of these strategies is still being evaluated, but we know that they do not come with the many negative collateral consequences of mass criminalization. Along the same lines, we need to get police out of schools. Numerous studies have shown that criminalizing school children worsens safety in the schools and drives the most needy students onto the streets, where they often become involved in more serious criminality. Enlightened school leaders with adequate resources have shown that they can increase school safety through creative restorative justice programs that involve students in disciplinary procedures and attempt to take home and community conditions into consideration in resolving problems. Any real agenda for police reform must look not to make the police friendlier and more professional. Instead, it must work to reduce the police role and replace it with empowered communities working to solve their own problems. We don't need community control of the police. We need community control over services that will create safer and more stable neighborhoods and cities.\n\nIt is unlikely that criminal prosecution will ever be a significant driver of police reform. There is a fundamental conflict of interest for DAs who must work closely with police and typically rely on their political support for re-election. Also, the legal standards for police use of force are incredibly permissive and give heavy weight to officer perceptions of danger at the time of the incident. We can take steps to strengthen this process. We could take prosecutions out of the hands of local DAs and turn it over to a statewide \"Blue Desk.\" This office would be responsible for investigating and prosecuting all cases of police misconduct statewide and would ideally develop the expertise and independence necessary for these difficult cases.

The people he shot were never charged with attempted robbery, which they would have been had Goetz had any evidence of the crime. Goetz claimed he had bought the gun for self-defense after being attacked on the subway three years earlier. The story drew national attention. Some people hailed him as a hero, others damned him as a villain. Goetz was eventually charged with assault and attempted murder but was only convicted on one count of carrying an unlicensed firearm. He served eight months in prison and, as far as I know, is still out there somewhere in the world, armed and dangerous. Goetz's case did not come up at the Supreme Court yesterday, during oral arguments in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen . But as I listened to conservative lawyers and justices congratulate themselves on rewriting the Second Amendment into a grotesque invitation to commit murder and suicide, I felt Goetz in the room. I felt his irrational fears and racist beliefs being warped into a new imprimatur of constitutional validity. And I felt a new generation of Goetzes locking and loading. The issue in front of the court was New York state's licensing rules for a concealed weapon. Currently, the state requires people who want to take a gun outside of their home to show a \"proper cause\" for needing to carry a weapon in public. That's been the law for over a hundred years. But conservatives (armed as they are with a supermajority on the Supreme Court) have decided to challenge that long-standing rule by arguing that the requirement to show cause violates the Second Amendment. The notion that it violates the Second Amendment to require people to give a reason to carry a gun strikes me as ludicrous, particularly when that amendment states the reason to bear arms clear in its first clause (\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the Security of a free State...\"). But conservative justices made that bad argument sound even worse. Justice Samuel Alito argued that commuters need the freedom to carry loaded weapons on New York City subways to protect themselves from the criminals he believes are stalking every passenger on the 7 train. It sounded a lot like the white fear that drenched the Goetz case. Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts might have thought they were being clever when they cited a need for self-defense in \"high-crime areas,\" but I knew whom they were talking about shooting. People who look like me, or my sons. \"Law-abiding\" New Yorkers should have the ability to shoot us on the subway if we scare them. Decades after a white man shot four unarmed Black men and got only eight months for carrying an unlicensed handgun, conservatives are trying to make the \"unlicensed\" violation a nonissue. There doesn't appear to be a way to stop conservatives from doing this, however. There's no way to prevent them from unleashing trigger-happy vigilantes onto our streets and subways. That's because, at core, NYS Rifle is about extending the warped logic of the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller to its bloody yet logical conclusion. In Heller , the Supreme Court for the first time recognized a \"right\" to bear arms purely for personal self-defense. Heller was limited to self-defense inside the home, but if one accepts its logic (which I do not), it's difficult to argue that the new right to shoot things that go bump in the night can be limited to one's private domain. And if one agrees that there's a personal right to self-defense outside the home, well, this is how you get Rambo riding the subway.

She argued that the need to show cause makes sense in a state as diverse as New York. In more rural areas of the state, she pointed out, conceal carry permits are often granted because the \"cause\" to defend yourself \"in the woods\" (as she put it) is high and you are unlikely to harm other innocent people. In the crowded city, however, permits are usually not granted, because the danger to others is simply too great. Current Issue View our current issue But the conservative justices were having none of it. Roberts flipped her argument around and suggested that the need for a gun is actually greater in \"high-crime areas.\" Alito, as I said, painted a picture of New York subways as dens of scum and villainy. And Amy Coney Barrett went right for the heart of the issue when she made Underwood admit that Heller was rightly decided. Underwood had to say yes-her line was \"I have no quarrel with Heller \"-because you can't go in front of the conservative majority and tell them your whole case rests on their admitting they were wrong. But from there, Barrett asked her to explain how the court could be bound by Heller but somehow not extend its logic to beyond the home, and there's no great answer to that besides \"because if you extend your violent decision, more people will die.\" Underwood basically said that, but conservatives do not care. Conservative argued that New York should change its laws to say the state \"shall\" issue conceal carry permits to any \"ordinary\" citizen (so, not ex-felons), instead of making them show \"cause\" to get one. It would take the discretion out of the system and basically mean that anybody can get a permit if they fill out a form. The conservative justices noted that many other states already do this, and that New York gives out hunting licenses on a \"shall\" issue basis. That comparison really bothered the liberals, especially Stephen Breyer, who said that with hunting licenses, \"rabbits have some problems,\" but with conceal carry licenses, \"people die.\" But conservative super lawyer Paul Clement (who argued the case on behalf of the guns) waved this concern away and mentioned other cities that have \"shall issue\" conceal carry laws without things erupting into bloody violence. Amazingly, one of the cities Clement cited positively was... Chicago. This drew a laugh and a sharp critique from Elena Kagan, who noted what conservative usually say about crime in Chicago, but the conservatives refused to concede their own hypocrisy. Remember this the next time Fox News fearmongers about gun violence in the Windy City: Conservative lawyers and justices think its gun policies are a model for the nation. I've always felt the court will rule against New York's gun laws, 6-3, and nothing happened at oral arguments to change that likely outcome. But the hearing did suggest an opening for New York to keep itself from turning into Texas. Both Roberts and Barrett asked questions about gun regulations in \"sensitive places\" like schools, government buildings, and sports arenas. It's certainly possible that these two will uphold state regulations prohibiting guns in these sensitive spots, even if they won't uphold New York's overall gun licensing scheme. Even Clement conceded that guns could still be prohibited in schools and \"in Times Square, on New Year's Eve\" (although he had no answer for Underwood's argument that Times Square looks like New Year's Eve pretty much every night before the Broadway shows start). The legislative work-around is therefore obvious. New York state should pass regulations specifically prohibiting firearms from a wide list of locations, including all forms of public transportation, large gatherings, and bars and restaurants. It's not ideal, and it requires the New York State Legislature actually to get something done. But while Roberts and Barrett seem set to close a door, they may have opened a window. At the very least, it's incumbent upon New York state to try. Ammosexuals may argue that lethal phallic symbols are the only things that compensate for their feelings of fear, but I know who these people will be shooting at. It'll be me. It'll be my kids. I have the right to ride home from a Mets game without worrying that a hysterical white man is going to shoot me for breathing on him with my broad West Indian nose.

The Supreme Court wants to make it even easier for them to do it, without so much as an illegal weapons charge, and there's nothing I can do about that. But if New York can pass a bill to reinstate through a back door what minimal protections the Supreme Court is poised to take away, it has to do it. Conservatives control the Supreme Court, and with that power they intend to keep us living in the most violent wealthy country on Earth. The few states Democrats control must rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nGoetz's case did not come up at the Supreme Court yesterday, during oral arguments in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen . But as I listened to conservative lawyers and justices congratulate themselves on rewriting the Second Amendment into a grotesque invitation to commit murder and suicide, I felt Goetz in the room. I felt his irrational fears and racist beliefs being warped into a new imprimatur of constitutional validity. And I felt a new generation of Goetzes locking and loading. The issue in front of the court was New York state's licensing rules for a concealed weapon. Currently, the state requires people who want to take a gun outside of their home to show a \"proper cause\" for needing to carry a weapon in public. That's been the law for over a hundred years. But conservatives (armed as they are with a supermajority on the Supreme Court) have decided to challenge that long-standing rule by arguing that the requirement to show cause violates the Second Amendment. The notion that it violates the Second Amendment to require people to give a reason to carry a gun strikes me as ludicrous, particularly when that amendment states the reason to bear arms clear in its first clause (\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the Security of a free State...\"). But conservative justices made that bad argument sound even worse. Justice Samuel Alito argued that commuters need the freedom to carry loaded weapons on New York City subways to protect themselves from the criminals he believes are stalking every passenger on the 7 train. It sounded a lot like the white fear that drenched the Goetz case. Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts might have thought they were being clever when they cited a need for self-defense in \"high-crime areas,\" but I knew whom they were talking about shooting. People who look like me, or my sons. \"Law-abiding\" New Yorkers should have the ability to shoot us on the subway if we scare them. Decades after a white man shot four unarmed Black men and got only eight months for carrying an unlicensed handgun, conservatives are trying to make the \"unlicensed\" violation a nonissue. There doesn't appear to be a way to stop conservatives from doing this, however. There's no way to prevent them from unleashing trigger-happy vigilantes onto our streets and subways. That's because, at core, NYS Rifle is about extending the warped logic of the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller to its bloody yet logical conclusion. In Heller , the Supreme Court for the first time recognized a \"right\" to bear arms purely for personal self-defense. Heller was limited to self-defense inside the home, but if one accepts its logic (which I do not), it's difficult to argue that the new right to shoot things that go bump in the night can be limited to one's private domain. And if one agrees that there's a personal right to self-defense outside the home, well, this is how you get Rambo riding the subway.

She argued that the need to show cause makes sense in a state as diverse as New York. In more rural areas of the state, she pointed out, conceal carry permits are often granted because the \"cause\" to defend yourself \"in the woods\" (as she put it) is high and you are unlikely to harm other innocent people. In the crowded city, however, permits are usually not granted, because the danger to others is simply too great. Current Issue View our current issue But the conservative justices were having none of it. Roberts flipped her argument around and suggested that the need for a gun is actually greater in \"high-crime areas.\" Alito, as I said, painted a picture of New York subways as dens of scum and villainy. And Amy Coney Barrett went right for the heart of the issue when she made Underwood admit that Heller was rightly decided. Underwood had to say yes-her line was \"I have no quarrel with Heller \"-because you can't go in front of the conservative majority and tell them your whole case rests on their admitting they were wrong. But from there, Barrett asked her to explain how the court could be bound by Heller but somehow not extend its logic to beyond the home, and there's no great answer to that besides \"because if you extend your violent decision, more people will die.\" Underwood basically said that, but conservatives do not care. Conservative argued that New York should change its laws to say the state \"shall\" issue conceal carry permits to any \"ordinary\" citizen (so, not ex-felons), instead of making them show \"cause\" to get one. It would take the discretion out of the system and basically mean that anybody can get a permit if they fill out a form. The conservative justices noted that many other states already do this, and that New York gives out hunting licenses on a \"shall\" issue basis. That comparison really bothered the liberals, especially Stephen Breyer, who said that with hunting licenses, \"rabbits have some problems,\" but with conceal carry licenses, \"people die.\" But conservative super lawyer Paul Clement (who argued the case on behalf of the guns) waved this concern away and mentioned other cities that have \"shall issue\" conceal carry laws without things erupting into bloody violence. Amazingly, one of the cities Clement cited positively was... Chicago. This drew a laugh and a sharp critique from Elena Kagan, who noted what conservative usually say about crime in Chicago, but the conservatives refused to concede their own hypocrisy. Remember this the next time Fox News fearmongers about gun violence in the Windy City: Conservative lawyers and justices think its gun policies are a model for the nation. I've always felt the court will rule against New York's gun laws, 6-3, and nothing happened at oral arguments to change that likely outcome. But the hearing did suggest an opening for New York to keep itself from turning into Texas. Both Roberts and Barrett asked questions about gun regulations in \"sensitive places\" like schools, government buildings, and sports arenas. It's certainly possible that these two will uphold state regulations prohibiting guns in these sensitive spots, even if they won't uphold New York's overall gun licensing scheme. Even Clement conceded that guns could still be prohibited in schools and \"in Times Square, on New Year's Eve\" (although he had no answer for Underwood's argument that Times Square looks like New Year's Eve pretty much every night before the Broadway shows start). The legislative work-around is therefore obvious. New York state should pass regulations specifically prohibiting firearms from a wide list of locations, including all forms of public transportation, large gatherings, and bars and restaurants. It's not ideal, and it requires the New York State Legislature actually to get something done. But while Roberts and Barrett seem set to close a door, they may have opened a window. At the very least, it's incumbent upon New York state to try. Ammosexuals may argue that lethal phallic symbols are the only things that compensate for their feelings of fear, but I know who these people will be shooting at. It'll be me. It'll be my kids. I have the right to ride home from a Mets game without worrying that a hysterical white man is going to shoot me for breathing on him with my broad West Indian nose.

She argued that the need to show cause makes sense in a state as diverse as New York. In more rural areas of the state, she pointed out, conceal carry permits are often granted because the \"cause\" to defend yourself \"in the woods\" (as she put it) is high and you are unlikely to harm other innocent people. In the crowded city, however, permits are usually not granted, because the danger to others is simply too great. Current Issue View our current issue But the conservative justices were having none of it. Roberts flipped her argument around and suggested that the need for a gun is actually greater in \"high-crime areas.\" Alito, as I said, painted a picture of New York subways as dens of scum and villainy. And Amy Coney Barrett went right for the heart of the issue when she made Underwood admit that Heller was rightly decided. Underwood had to say yes-her line was \"I have no quarrel with Heller \"-because you can't go in front of the conservative majority and tell them your whole case rests on their admitting they were wrong. But from there, Barrett asked her to explain how the court could be bound by Heller but somehow not extend its logic to beyond the home, and there's no great answer to that besides \"because if you extend your violent decision, more people will die.\" Underwood basically said that, but conservatives do not care. Conservative argued that New York should change its laws to say the state \"shall\" issue conceal carry permits to any \"ordinary\" citizen (so, not ex-felons), instead of making them show \"cause\" to get one. It would take the discretion out of the system and basically mean that anybody can get a permit if they fill out a form. The conservative justices noted that many other states already do this, and that New York gives out hunting licenses on a \"shall\" issue basis. That comparison really bothered the liberals, especially Stephen Breyer, who said that with hunting licenses, \"rabbits have some problems,\" but with conceal carry licenses, \"people die.\" But conservative super lawyer Paul Clement (who argued the case on behalf of the guns) waved this concern away and mentioned other cities that have \"shall issue\" conceal carry laws without things erupting into bloody violence. Amazingly, one of the cities Clement cited positively was... Chicago. This drew a laugh and a sharp critique from Elena Kagan, who noted what conservative usually say about crime in Chicago, but the conservatives refused to concede their own hypocrisy. Remember this the next time Fox News fearmongers about gun violence in the Windy City: Conservative lawyers and justices think its gun policies are a model for the nation. I've always felt the court will rule against New York's gun laws, 6-3, and nothing happened at oral arguments to change that likely outcome. But the hearing did suggest an opening for New York to keep itself from turning into Texas. Both Roberts and Barrett asked questions about gun regulations in \"sensitive places\" like schools, government buildings, and sports arenas. It's certainly possible that these two will uphold state regulations prohibiting guns in these sensitive spots, even if they won't uphold New York's overall gun licensing scheme. Even Clement conceded that guns could still be prohibited in schools and \"in Times Square, on New Year's Eve\" (although he had no answer for Underwood's argument that Times Square looks like New Year's Eve pretty much every night before the Broadway shows start). The legislative work-around is therefore obvious. New York state should pass regulations specifically prohibiting firearms from a wide list of locations, including all forms of public transportation, large gatherings, and bars and restaurants. It's not ideal, and it requires the New York State Legislature actually to get something done. But while Roberts and Barrett seem set to close a door, they may have opened a window. At the very least, it's incumbent upon New York state to try. Ammosexuals may argue that lethal phallic symbols are the only things that compensate for their feelings of fear, but I know who these people will be shooting at. It'll be me. It'll be my kids.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The newly opened National Memorial of Peace and Justice and its accompanying Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama, confront the long and dark history of lynching in the United States. Stranger Fruit , Jason Pollock's documentary about the police shooting of Michael Brown four summers ago, was released nationally on April 3 and will premiere on Starz next month. 1 The film's investigation of Brown's killing invites us to grapple with a difficult legacy, and in so doing, challenges us to pursue a more just future. 2 Stranger Fruit opens with scenes of Ferguson, Missouri, protests set to Billie Holiday's haunting 1939 song. It reconsiders how Brown's lifeless body came to rest on smoldering blacktop for over four hours in the Missouri heat, pointing to glaring contradictions in the official story. And it raises the possibility that local law enforcement obstructed justice by lying to federal investigators after the grand jury non-indictment. 3 The official story in question goes like this: Darren Wilson suspected Brown of robbing a convenience store before stopping him and Dorian Johnson in the street. An angry and aggressive Brown initiated a struggle over the officer's gun. To protect himself, Wilson discharged his weapon twice, wounding Brown in his hand. Brown took off running as Wilson gave chase. After a distance of 180 feet, Brown turned back toward Wilson, charged at him \"like a demon,\" and was then shot six or seven more times as Wilson emptied his clip. 4 The Department of Justice stated that federal agents canvassed 300 residences; interviewed dozens of witnesses, including local officials; and collected physical evidence, autopsy reports, cell-phone records, and e-mails. \"In so doing, we assessed the witnesses' demeanor, tone, bias, and ability to accurately perceive or recall the events of August 9, 2014.\" 5 The film shows three instances in which police gave official statements to the press or the grand jury that are incompatible with the final version. Numerous witnesses said Michael Brown did not attack Darren Wilson and attempted to surrender. But federal officials stated that none of these witnesses, most of whom were Brown's black neighbors, were \"credible.\" Their statements were deemed inconsistent or \"contradicted by the physical and forensic evidence.\" 6 You might assume that federal officials applied the same standards to local law enforcement too.

The highest-ranking officer, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, gave the first press statement, hours after Brown's death. He described \"the entire scene\" of the shooting as occurring within \"about 35 feet\" and involving a \"couple\" of shots. \"It was more than a couple but I don't think it was ah, ah many more than that,\" he said. \"We've done a very comprehensive canvas.\" According to the physical evidence and ballistics, all 12 shell casings were documented and recovered.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nThe people of Ferguson, Missouri, have rallied and marched and protested for eleven straight days and nights. They want justice for Michael Brown, the 18-year-old unarmed black boy killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on August 9. They've been met with tear gas, assault rifles, rubber bullets, armored police cars, dogs and the National Guard. And they show no signs of letting up. But why? I've been trying to figure out why so many people have had such a strong reaction to Brown's killing. Because this isn't new. His death is tragic, but fairly ordinary in the course of black people's interactions with the police. We deal with this all the time. On her MSNBC show this past Saturday, Melissa Harris-Perry demonstrated just how ordinary it is . She read a list of names of unarmed black men killed by police in the last decade alone, and it was chilling, to say the least. \"Timothy Stansbury, unarmed. Sean Bell, unarmed. Oscar Grant, unarmed. Aaron Campbell, unarmed. Alonzo Ashley, unarmed. Wendell Allen, unarmed. Jonathan Ferrell, unarmed. Eric Garner, unarmed,\" she said, before adding, \"From 2006 to 2012, a white police officer killed a black person at least twice a week in this country.\" Twice a week. It's business as usual for police to kill black people. And those are only a few names-many more black men and women have been killed by police. Many of them were also unarmed. Many were around the same age as Michael Brown. So what makes him special? Why did his death elicit such a strong reaction? Of course, there are several factors to consider. That he was a young black man and not a young black woman is part of it. Black women/girls are often forgotten as victims in the discussion of police violence. That he was regarded as a \"gentle giant\" (Brown was 6'4\" tall and close to 300 pounds) and a prospective college student are relevant. His image as \"harmless\" and \"respectable\" makes him more sympathetic to some people. That a mostly white police force routinely harasses black residents of Ferguson matters. And the fact witnesses say at the time of his shooting Brown had his hands up in the air, surrendering, also matters. It makes the six bullet wounds he suffered appear even more callous. But for me, the detail that sticks is that Brown's body was left in the street for at least four hours. Not only did people in the community witness the shooting, they were forced to look at the aftermath. For hours, they had to see Michael Brown's bullet-ridden, bloody body lie rotting in the street. It's not unlike Henry Simmons's bullet-filled body being hung from in tree in Palm Beach, Florida, in June of 1923. Or that of William Turner, whose body was hung, then cut down, then hung again before being burned in a bonfire in Helena, Arkansas, in November 1921. There was also Jim Roland, shot and killed by a mob in Camillia, Georgia, after having refused to dance for a white man who was pointing a gun at him in February 1921. And also Frank Dodd, shot and hung from a tree \"in a negro settlement on the outskirts of DeWitt, Arkansas, in October 1916.\" And so many more.* They were lynched. They were killed and displayed publicly for the amusement of the lynch mobs and other white folks, and for the further terrorization of black people. The police didn't hang Michael Brown, but they made a public display of his killing. They left his body lying there for all to see. The psychic toll that exerts on a community calls to mind the eerie words once sung by Billie Holiday: \"Southern trees bear strange fruit/ blood on the leaves and blood at the root.../ here is a fruit for the crows to pluck/ for the rain to gather, for the wind to suck.\" But for Brown and Ferguson, the \"poplar trees\" were replaced with a city street. It is an injustice that Michael Brown was killed. But injustice alone doesn't move people to action. His killing is one of many. But the sight of Michael Brown's body being left in the middle of the street is the closest this generation has come to seeing, in real life, the strange fruit of which Holiday sang. That's an image you just can't shake. *Each of these lynchings is documented in the book 100 Years of Lynchings , by Ralph Ginzburg.\n\nBut why?

These developments, while benefiting the poor across the board, especially help African Americans, who have long been a larger proportion of the unemployed and uninsured. Donald Trump's fearmongering to the contrary, crime-whose victims are also disproportionately black and Hispanic-is at historic lows. After 40 years of unrelenting expansion, the nation's prison population has begun to shrink. And racial disparities in criminal-justice enforcement have also diminished. From the Archives: \" Will Obama the Constitutional Lawyer Please Stand Up? \" by David K. Shipler, from the February 1, 2013, issue of The Nation . Yet even before Trump's surprise election, polls reported that Americans were more pessimistic about racial division than they had been in nearly a generation. A June Pew poll found that 43 percent of African Americans believe that the country will not make the changes necessary to assure them equal rights. There has been a steady stream of incidents, many captured on video, in which police officers have shot unarmed black men. Seemingly in response, two disturbed black men ambushed and killed multiple police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge in separate incidents in July. Campuses across the country have been roiled by racial protests. And Trump premised his presidential campaign on racial division, lashing out against Muslims, Mexicans, and Black Lives Matter. Similar contradictions mark President Obama's specific record on civil rights and respect for the rule of law in the fight against terrorism. He has made considerable strides in these areas, and he will be sorely missed by all who care about these values. He rejected George W. Bush's theories of unchecked executive war-making powers and insisted that the fight against Al Qaeda must be conducted in accordance with domestic and international legal constraints. He forbade torture and rescinded and released the once-secret Justice Department memos that authorized the CIA's interrogation program. He promised to close Guantánamo and, despite consistent opposition from Congress and his own Defense Department, has succeeded in shrinking the prison population there to 60. Yet civil-liberties and human-rights groups have been harshly critical, accusing him of not doing more to close Guantánamo; of vastly expanding targeted killing though the use of unmanned drones; of stifling dissent by prosecuting a record number of whistle-blowers; and of relying on excessive claims of secrecy that have obstructed accountability. Sometimes our dissatisfactions are most strongly felt when what was previously unattainable appears within our grasp. How, in light of these contradictions, should we judge his legacy on civil and human rights? Few presidents have been more committed to civil rights and civil liberties. And, in a perverse way, the turmoil that marked race relations even before the election and the criticism from human-rights advocates that Obama has borne may well be both a cause of and a testament to the progress he has made. As Frederick Douglass famously noted, \"Power concedes nothing without a demand.\" And sometimes it's precisely when what was previously unattainable appears within our grasp that our dissatisfactions are most strongly felt.

Yet when one measures Obama's accomplishments in civil rights against the goals his administration set for itself, the remarkable thing is how much he has delivered. The website of the 2008 Obama-Biden transition team still exists, at change.gov. Among the promises made on civil rights, Obama pledged to fight employment discrimination, expand hate-crime laws, end racial profiling, support ex-offenders' reentry into society, eliminate sentencing disparities, expand drug courts as an alternative to incarceration, support rights for LGBTQ individuals, and repeal \"don't ask, don't tell,\" the Clinton-era policy that barred openly gay people from serving in the military. The administration achieved many if not all of these goals. It's been most successful in the arena of gay and lesbian rights. Obama signed into law an expansion of the hate-crime statute to include crimes motivated by antigay bias. He ended \"don't ask, don't tell\" and, more recently, lifted the ban on transgender people serving in the military. He issued an executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. He personally endorsed marriage equality in May 2012 and refused to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, the law signed by Bill Clinton that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples married in states that recognized such marriages, thereby easing the way for its invalidation by the Supreme Court in 2013. And when the Court took up the question of same-sex marriage directly, the Obama administration supported the claimants, and Obama's solicitor general, Don Verrilli, delivered an impassioned argument for why the Court shouldn't defer recognition of same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. A federal bill barring employment discrimination against LGBTQ people has not passed, but there the blame lies with Congress. Related Article Barack Obama's Crash Course in Foreign Policy Andrew J. Bacevich The Obama administration's most important achievements in racial justice have, appropriately, concerned criminal justice. As the recent racial unrest sparked by police shootings has underscored, America's criminal-justice system is at the core of racial division in the United States. African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately victimized by both crime and criminal- law enforcement. Obama, with the full-throated support of his first attorney general, Eric Holder, has been a leader on criminal-justice reform. He signed into law the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. Obama was the first president to visit a federal prison. He directed the Justice Department to review the use of solitary confinement, leading to a 2016 guidance that reduces its use in the federal prison system, especially for juveniles and the mentally ill, and urges states to follow suit. Under a clemency initiative, he has commuted the sentences of 944 people and pardoned 70 others, a substantial increase over most of his predecessors. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has conducted high- profile investigations of multiple police departments for systematic civil-rights abuses, including those in New Orleans, Cleveland, Newark, and Ferguson, Missouri. The investigations produced damning reports and significant consent decrees requiring meaningful reform and ongoing oversight. Holder also issued an expanded ban on profiling by federal law-enforcement agencies and their state and local partners, though he maintained existing exceptions for border control and airport screeners. In speeches that would have been unimaginable from any other attorney general in the past 40 years, Holder publicly questioned the efficacy and fairness of the War on Drugs and spoke out forcefully against mass incarceration. And he didn't just talk a good game: He reversed a policy instituted by George W. Bush's attorney general, John Ashcroft, that required prosecutors to charge defendants with the most serious crimes available. Instead, Holder instructed federal prosecutors to use their charging discretion wisely to prioritize the most serious crimes; to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with crimes that trigger draconian mandatory-minimum sentences; and to pursue alternatives to incarceration where appropriate. In the wake of these reforms, federal drug-trafficking cases dropped, prosecutors sought mandatory minimums in drug cases much less often, and the federal prison population fell for the first time in decades. Obama has been a leader on criminal-justice reform, but his record on immigrants' rights is more mixed. Even so, every time a case seeking to hold police officers accountable to constitutional constraints in their encounters with citizens reached the Supreme Court, the administration sided with the police. It advocated narrow understandings of Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, and it pressed expansive readings of doctrines that limit remedies when police violate those rights. This past term, for example, the administration supported a ruling that allows the police to use evidence found after an unconstitutional stop if a routine record check discloses an outstanding arrest warrant. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, noting that in some areas, such as Ferguson, very high percentages of the population have outstanding arrest warrants, often for trivial offenses such as failure to pay a parking ticket. The ruling, the dissenters warned, invites officers to stop people for no reason at all, run their names through the system, and then search them if a warrant pops up. Among other sources, Sotomayor cited Ta-Nehisi Coates in condemning the rule as an invitation to discriminate. Yet the Obama administration sided with the police in this and every other case that came before the Court. In other words, while the Obama administration has been willing to exercise its discretion to mitigate the ill effects of the War on Drugs and mass incarceration, it has not been willing to support more restrictive constitutional limits on that discretion, which would be more durable and farther-reaching. The federal government accounts for less than 2 percent of criminal-law enforcement; the rest is carried out by the states. Constitutional limits apply across the board to every police department in the country; a federal policy initiative, by contrast, affects only federal prosecutors and police. And as Trump will gleefully demonstrate on his first day in office, executive initiatives can be reversed by a successor administration with the stroke of a pen. * * * Obama's record is considerably more mixed with respect to immigration and immigrants' rights. On the one hand, the president pushed for reform legislation that would have provided a path to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, and, after that effort died in Congress, used his unilateral authority to extend \"deferred action\"-a status that suspends deportation efforts-to children who arrived illegally and to undocumented parents whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. The program directed at children provided benefits to as many as 1.7 million undocumented persons; the program directed at parents, which would have reached more than twice that number, was enjoined by the courts and thus has not taken effect. Obama deserves credit for his efforts to regularize the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to society and whose deportation would divide families. But Trump is virtually certain to end that program, inflicting untold harm on deserving members of our community. It's on the issue of transparency, particularly regarding drones, that Obama has most come up short. Trump has promised a sweeping deportation effort. But the Obama administration itself has already undertaken one of the most aggressive deportation and border-control campaigns in memory, expelling about 2.4 million noncitizens. Apparently believing that it needed to be strict on enforcement in order to achieve reform, the administration ramped up its deportation efforts. Many individuals who have made their lives here for decades became pawns in the administration's chess game. The Obama administration has also employed harsh practices at the border that risked turning back many legitimate asylum seekers. It has opposed the appointment of counsel in deportation proceedings even for indigent children and mentally ill immigrants who, without such assistance, cannot possibly obtain a meaningful hearing. And it has supported detention policies and practices that unnecessarily lock up immigrants, even when there is no evidence that they pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight. * * * On national security, Obama's record is similarly mixed. As noted above, his basic approach differs sharply from that of his predecessor: While Bush resisted any legal restrictions on his authority as commander in chief, Obama has insisted on acting within the bounds of statutory, constitutional, and international law. Indeed, early in his tenure, when a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that his detention authority at Guantánamo wasn't limited by international law, the administration took the extraordinary step of arguing that the court had given it too much power, and insisted that its actions must be limited by international law. The full court then issued a decision declaring that the panel's dismissal of international law would have no precedential effect. One would be hard-pressed to identify another president who argued that a court had given him too much power. From day one, Obama committed his administration to abjuring torture and other forms of cruel and inhuman interrogation tactics. He has tried to close Guantánamo, a task that is much easier promised than accomplished, as he has learned. Still, he has not brought a single new detainee to the prison, and has transferred many. He supported both unilateral and congressional reforms to the National Security Agency's program to collect domestic telephone metadata-although not until Edward Snowden informed the American people of the program's breathtaking reach, spurring widespread protests. And while it is often noted that Obama has brought more prosecutions against whistle-blowers (or, in his view, leakers) than all prior presidents combined, that is probably more attributable to the enhanced ability to identify leakers in the digital age than to Obama's views on free press and free speech. It is on the issue of transparency that Obama has most come up short. He promised that his would be \"the most transparent administration in history,\" yet he has invoked the state-secrets doctrine to block lawsuits by torture victims; fought aggressively against Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to a wide range of national-security initiatives; opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate torture; and kept under wraps virtually all the relevant facts concerning the administration's targeted-killing program. If the Snowden revelations and their aftermath have taught us anything, it's that accountability depends upon transparency. Snowden's leaks forced all three branches of the federal government to take more rights- protective positions. Some secrecy is of course essential, both in armed conflicts and concerning the details of security programs. Yet democracy requires that we the people know what the government is doing in our name if we are to have a chance of ensuring accountability. Obama's secrecy with respect to drones is the most disturbing, especially given the precedent it sets for his successor. He has asserted the power to order the killing of individuals far from any battlefield, without a hearing, without any form of external accountability, and without even admitting that he has done so. If Russia or China were exercising such authority with respect to its enemies, Obama would be sounding the alarm. If another nation were dropping bombs on individuals it deemed threatening inside our borders, we would not accept its actions as lawful. Yet that is what the United States has been doing in places like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia for years. Obama deserves some credit for moving toward increased transparency regarding the drone program. At the outset, the administration didn't even acknowledge that the program existed. But beginning with a speech by State Department legal adviser Harold Koh in 2010, the administration offered increasingly detailed defenses of the program; released aggregate estimates of the number of civilians it has killed; and, under court order, produced a redacted version of the 2013 Presidential Policy Guidance limiting targeted killing outside zones of armed conflict. But it still refuses to provide any details on the people it has targeted and killed, the factual and legal basis for those actions, and the number of innocent civilians killed in each strike. While there may be a legitimate basis for maintaining the secrecy of some of this information at the time of a strike, Obama has not released such information, even in redacted form, for a single one of the hundreds of strikes he has authorized over eight years. Without more detail, it is impossible to know whether the administration is adhering to the law, or even to its own policy guidelines. And if the president is to be accountable with respect to any authority, surely taking a human being's life should be at the top of the list. We often devote decades to ensuring that a decision to impose the death penalty is justified. With drone strikes, there is not even a public after-action review. * * * Barack Obama has done more than probably any president since Lyndon Johnson to advance civil rights, and certainly more than any on LGBTQ rights in particular. The Affordable Care Act, still his signature achievement, extended a much-needed economic right to millions. He has presided over the first drop in the incarcerated population in nearly 40 years, and he and Eric Holder have played an important part in changing the politics of crime, helping to shift the national consensus from a tough-on-crime imperative to a smart-on-crime approach that seeks to limit incarceration. Obama's immigration efforts are disappointing, but he has provided tangible benefits to more than 1 million undocumented immigrants, and he has tried to do so for many millions more. And while he has pursued a combined military and law- enforcement response to the terrorism threat from Al Qaeda and ISIS, he has sought to conduct those campaigns within the rule of law, rather than assert that legal limits are inapplicable. His record has been far from perfect, as I've laid out above. But no president's ever will be; there are simply too many conflicting demands. So what should we make of all the protests? It is a mistake common to all assessments of a presidential legacy to focus too narrowly on the president himself. Where Obama has succeeded, it has not been simply because he had good intentions, but because political forces emerged to demand reform. Criminal-justice reform is now a bipartisan issue, supported by the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, the Cato Institute, and the Koch brothers. Achieving marriage equality was the result of a decades-long campaign by gay and lesbian organizations and individuals coming out, defending their equal dignity, and acting strategically and patiently to develop the momentum necessary to achieve constitutional change. The push to legalize undocumented immigrants has been driven by the Dreamers, backed by important sectors of the labor movement. And human-rights groups have been ever vigilant in calling the administration to task for its shortfalls in fighting terrorism. In his speech at the Democratic convention supporting the nomination of Hillary Clinton, Obama stressed that the operative word must be \"we,\" not \"I.\" A presidential legacy is, in an important sense, our legacy-because what presidents do is a function not only of their own desires and commitments, but of ours. It's no coincidence that much of the progress we've seen has come in the context of increasing public protests for racial justice, LGBTQ rights, immigrants' rights, and against the unending War on Terror. And that's why the protests must go on if we are to limit the damage from the next administration.

Obama's immigration efforts are disappointing, but he has provided tangible benefits to more than 1 million undocumented immigrants, and he has tried to do so for many millions more. And while he has pursued a combined military and law- enforcement response to the terrorism threat from Al Qaeda and ISIS, he has sought to conduct those campaigns within the rule of law, rather than assert that legal limits are inapplicable. His record has been far from perfect, as I've laid out above. But no president's ever will be; there are simply too many conflicting demands. So what should we make of all the protests? It is a mistake common to all assessments of a presidential legacy to focus too narrowly on the president himself. Where Obama has succeeded, it has not been simply because he had good intentions, but because political forces emerged to demand reform. Criminal-justice reform is now a bipartisan issue, supported by the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, the Cato Institute, and the Koch brothers. Achieving marriage equality was the result of a decades-long campaign by gay and lesbian organizations and individuals coming out, defending their equal dignity, and acting strategically and patiently to develop the momentum necessary to achieve constitutional change. The push to legalize undocumented immigrants has been driven by the Dreamers, backed by important sectors of the labor movement. And human-rights groups have been ever vigilant in calling the administration to task for its shortfalls in fighting terrorism. In his speech at the Democratic convention supporting the nomination of Hillary Clinton, Obama stressed that the operative word must be \"we,\" not \"I.\" A presidential legacy is, in an important sense, our legacy-because what presidents do is a function not only of their own desires and commitments, but of ours. It's no coincidence that much of the progress we've seen has come in the context of increasing public protests for racial justice, LGBTQ rights, immigrants' rights, and against the unending War on Terror. And that's why the protests must go on if we are to limit the damage from the next administration. Listen to David Cole discuss Obama's legacy on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nSimilar contradictions mark President Obama's specific record on civil rights and respect for the rule of law in the fight against terrorism. He has made considerable strides in these areas, and he will be sorely missed by all who care about these values. He rejected George W. Bush's theories of unchecked executive war-making powers and insisted that the fight against Al Qaeda must be conducted in accordance with domestic and international legal constraints. He forbade torture and rescinded and released the once-secret Justice Department memos that authorized the CIA's interrogation program. He promised to close Guantánamo and, despite consistent opposition from Congress and his own Defense Department, has succeeded in shrinking the prison population there to 60. Yet civil-liberties and human-rights groups have been harshly critical, accusing him of not doing more to close Guantánamo; of vastly expanding targeted killing though the use of unmanned drones; of stifling dissent by prosecuting a record number of whistle-blowers; and of relying on excessive claims of secrecy that have obstructed accountability. Sometimes our dissatisfactions are most strongly felt when what was previously unattainable appears within our grasp. How, in light of these contradictions, should we judge his legacy on civil and human rights? Few presidents have been more committed to civil rights and civil liberties. And, in a perverse way, the turmoil that marked race relations even before the election and the criticism from human-rights advocates that Obama has borne may well be both a cause of and a testament to the progress he has made. As Frederick Douglass famously noted, \"Power concedes nothing without a demand.\" And sometimes it's precisely when what was previously unattainable appears within our grasp that our dissatisfactions are most strongly felt.

Yet when one measures Obama's accomplishments in civil rights against the goals his administration set for itself, the remarkable thing is how much he has delivered. The website of the 2008 Obama-Biden transition team still exists, at change.gov. Among the promises made on civil rights, Obama pledged to fight employment discrimination, expand hate-crime laws, end racial profiling, support ex-offenders' reentry into society, eliminate sentencing disparities, expand drug courts as an alternative to incarceration, support rights for LGBTQ individuals, and repeal \"don't ask, don't tell,\" the Clinton-era policy that barred openly gay people from serving in the military. The administration achieved many if not all of these goals. It's been most successful in the arena of gay and lesbian rights. Obama signed into law an expansion of the hate-crime statute to include crimes motivated by antigay bias. He ended \"don't ask, don't tell\" and, more recently, lifted the ban on transgender people serving in the military. He issued an executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. He personally endorsed marriage equality in May 2012 and refused to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, the law signed by Bill Clinton that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples married in states that recognized such marriages, thereby easing the way for its invalidation by the Supreme Court in 2013. And when the Court took up the question of same-sex marriage directly, the Obama administration supported the claimants, and Obama's solicitor general, Don Verrilli, delivered an impassioned argument for why the Court shouldn't defer recognition of same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. A federal bill barring employment discrimination against LGBTQ people has not passed, but there the blame lies with Congress. Related Article Barack Obama's Crash Course in Foreign Policy Andrew J. Bacevich The Obama administration's most important achievements in racial justice have, appropriately, concerned criminal justice. As the recent racial unrest sparked by police shootings has underscored, America's criminal-justice system is at the core of racial division in the United States. African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately victimized by both crime and criminal- law enforcement. Obama, with the full-throated support of his first attorney general, Eric Holder, has been a leader on criminal-justice reform. He signed into law the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. Obama was the first president to visit a federal prison. He directed the Justice Department to review the use of solitary confinement, leading to a 2016 guidance that reduces its use in the federal prison system, especially for juveniles and the mentally ill, and urges states to follow suit. Under a clemency initiative, he has commuted the sentences of 944 people and pardoned 70 others, a substantial increase over most of his predecessors. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has conducted high- profile investigations of multiple police departments for systematic civil-rights abuses, including those in New Orleans, Cleveland, Newark, and Ferguson, Missouri. The investigations produced damning reports and significant consent decrees requiring meaningful reform and ongoing oversight. Holder also issued an expanded ban on profiling by federal law-enforcement agencies and their state and local partners, though he maintained existing exceptions for border control and airport screeners. In speeches that would have been unimaginable from any other attorney general in the past 40 years, Holder publicly questioned the efficacy and fairness of the War on Drugs and spoke out forcefully against mass incarceration. And he didn't just talk a good game: He reversed a policy instituted by George W. Bush's attorney general, John Ashcroft, that required prosecutors to charge defendants with the most serious crimes available. Instead, Holder instructed federal prosecutors to use their charging discretion wisely to prioritize the most serious crimes; to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with crimes that trigger draconian mandatory-minimum sentences; and to pursue alternatives to incarceration where appropriate. In the wake of these reforms, federal drug-trafficking cases dropped, prosecutors sought mandatory minimums in drug cases much less often, and the federal prison population fell for the first time in decades. Obama has been a leader on criminal-justice reform, but his record on immigrants' rights is more mixed. Even so, every time a case seeking to hold police officers accountable to constitutional constraints in their encounters with citizens reached the Supreme Court, the administration sided with the police. It advocated narrow understandings of Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, and it pressed expansive readings of doctrines that limit remedies when police violate those rights. This past term, for example, the administration supported a ruling that allows the police to use evidence found after an unconstitutional stop if a routine record check discloses an outstanding arrest warrant. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, noting that in some areas, such as Ferguson, very high percentages of the population have outstanding arrest warrants, often for trivial offenses such as failure to pay a parking ticket. The ruling, the dissenters warned, invites officers to stop people for no reason at all, run their names through the system, and then search them if a warrant pops up. Among other sources, Sotomayor cited Ta-Nehisi Coates in condemning the rule as an invitation to discriminate. Yet the Obama administration sided with the police in this and every other case that came before the Court. In other words, while the Obama administration has been willing to exercise its discretion to mitigate the ill effects of the War on Drugs and mass incarceration, it has not been willing to support more restrictive constitutional limits on that discretion, which would be more durable and farther-reaching. The federal government accounts for less than 2 percent of criminal-law enforcement; the rest is carried out by the states. Constitutional limits apply across the board to every police department in the country; a federal policy initiative, by contrast, affects only federal prosecutors and police. And as Trump will gleefully demonstrate on his first day in office, executive initiatives can be reversed by a successor administration with the stroke of a pen. * * * Obama's record is considerably more mixed with respect to immigration and immigrants' rights. On the one hand, the president pushed for reform legislation that would have provided a path to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, and, after that effort died in Congress, used his unilateral authority to extend \"deferred action\"-a status that suspends deportation efforts-to children who arrived illegally and to undocumented parents whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. The program directed at children provided benefits to as many as 1.7 million undocumented persons; the program directed at parents, which would have reached more than twice that number, was enjoined by the courts and thus has not taken effect. Obama deserves credit for his efforts to regularize the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to society and whose deportation would divide families. But Trump is virtually certain to end that program, inflicting untold harm on deserving members of our community. It's on the issue of transparency, particularly regarding drones, that Obama has most come up short. Trump has promised a sweeping deportation effort. But the Obama administration itself has already undertaken one of the most aggressive deportation and border-control campaigns in memory, expelling about 2.4 million noncitizens. Apparently believing that it needed to be strict on enforcement in order to achieve reform, the administration ramped up its deportation efforts. Many individuals who have made their lives here for decades became pawns in the administration's chess game. The Obama administration has also employed harsh practices at the border that risked turning back many legitimate asylum seekers. It has opposed the appointment of counsel in deportation proceedings even for indigent children and mentally ill immigrants who, without such assistance, cannot possibly obtain a meaningful hearing. And it has supported detention policies and practices that unnecessarily lock up immigrants, even when there is no evidence that they pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight. * * * On national security, Obama's record is similarly mixed. As noted above, his basic approach differs sharply from that of his predecessor: While Bush resisted any legal restrictions on his authority as commander in chief, Obama has insisted on acting within the bounds of statutory, constitutional, and international law. Indeed, early in his tenure, when a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that his detention authority at Guantánamo wasn't limited by international law, the administration took the extraordinary step of arguing that the court had given it too much power, and insisted that its actions must be limited by international law. The full court then issued a decision declaring that the panel's dismissal of international law would have no precedential effect. One would be hard-pressed to identify another president who argued that a court had given him too much power. From day one, Obama committed his administration to abjuring torture and other forms of cruel and inhuman interrogation tactics. He has tried to close Guantánamo, a task that is much easier promised than accomplished, as he has learned. Still, he has not brought a single new detainee to the prison, and has transferred many. He supported both unilateral and congressional reforms to the National Security Agency's program to collect domestic telephone metadata-although not until Edward Snowden informed the American people of the program's breathtaking reach, spurring widespread protests. And while it is often noted that Obama has brought more prosecutions against whistle-blowers (or, in his view, leakers) than all prior presidents combined, that is probably more attributable to the enhanced ability to identify leakers in the digital age than to Obama's views on free press and free speech. It is on the issue of transparency that Obama has most come up short. He promised that his would be \"the most transparent administration in history,\" yet he has invoked the state-secrets doctrine to block lawsuits by torture victims; fought aggressively against Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to a wide range of national-security initiatives; opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate torture; and kept under wraps virtually all the relevant facts concerning the administration's targeted-killing program. If the Snowden revelations and their aftermath have taught us anything, it's that accountability depends upon transparency. Snowden's leaks forced all three branches of the federal government to take more rights- protective positions. Some secrecy is of course essential, both in armed conflicts and concerning the details of security programs. Yet democracy requires that we the people know what the government is doing in our name if we are to have a chance of ensuring accountability. Obama's secrecy with respect to drones is the most disturbing, especially given the precedent it sets for his successor. He has asserted the power to order the killing of individuals far from any battlefield, without a hearing, without any form of external accountability, and without even admitting that he has done so. If Russia or China were exercising such authority with respect to its enemies, Obama would be sounding the alarm. If another nation were dropping bombs on individuals it deemed threatening inside our borders, we would not accept its actions as lawful. Yet that is what the United States has been doing in places like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia for years. Obama deserves some credit for moving toward increased transparency regarding the drone program. At the outset, the administration didn't even acknowledge that the program existed. But beginning with a speech by State Department legal adviser Harold Koh in 2010, the administration offered increasingly detailed defenses of the program; released aggregate estimates of the number of civilians it has killed; and, under court order, produced a redacted version of the 2013 Presidential Policy Guidance limiting targeted killing outside zones of armed conflict. But it still refuses to provide any details on the people it has targeted and killed, the factual and legal basis for those actions, and the number of innocent civilians killed in each strike. While there may be a legitimate basis for maintaining the secrecy of some of this information at the time of a strike, Obama has not released such information, even in redacted form, for a single one of the hundreds of strikes he has authorized over eight years. Without more detail, it is impossible to know whether the administration is adhering to the law, or even to its own policy guidelines. And if the president is to be accountable with respect to any authority, surely taking a human being's life should be at the top of the list. We often devote decades to ensuring that a decision to impose the death penalty is justified. With drone strikes, there is not even a public after-action review. * * * Barack Obama has done more than probably any president since Lyndon Johnson to advance civil rights, and certainly more than any on LGBTQ rights in particular. The Affordable Care Act, still his signature achievement, extended a much-needed economic right to millions.

And that's why the protests must go on if we are to limit the damage from the next administration.

Yet when one measures Obama's accomplishments in civil rights against the goals his administration set for itself, the remarkable thing is how much he has delivered. The website of the 2008 Obama-Biden transition team still exists, at change.gov. Among the promises made on civil rights, Obama pledged to fight employment discrimination, expand hate-crime laws, end racial profiling, support ex-offenders' reentry into society, eliminate sentencing disparities, expand drug courts as an alternative to incarceration, support rights for LGBTQ individuals, and repeal \"don't ask, don't tell,\" the Clinton-era policy that barred openly gay people from serving in the military. The administration achieved many if not all of these goals. It's been most successful in the arena of gay and lesbian rights. Obama signed into law an expansion of the hate-crime statute to include crimes motivated by antigay bias. He ended \"don't ask, don't tell\" and, more recently, lifted the ban on transgender people serving in the military. He issued an executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. He personally endorsed marriage equality in May 2012 and refused to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, the law signed by Bill Clinton that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples married in states that recognized such marriages, thereby easing the way for its invalidation by the Supreme Court in 2013. And when the Court took up the question of same-sex marriage directly, the Obama administration supported the claimants, and Obama's solicitor general, Don Verrilli, delivered an impassioned argument for why the Court shouldn't defer recognition of same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. A federal bill barring employment discrimination against LGBTQ people has not passed, but there the blame lies with Congress. Related Article Barack Obama's Crash Course in Foreign Policy Andrew J. Bacevich The Obama administration's most important achievements in racial justice have, appropriately, concerned criminal justice. As the recent racial unrest sparked by police shootings has underscored, America's criminal-justice system is at the core of racial division in the United States. African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately victimized by both crime and criminal- law enforcement. Obama, with the full-throated support of his first attorney general, Eric Holder, has been a leader on criminal-justice reform. He signed into law the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. Obama was the first president to visit a federal prison. He directed the Justice Department to review the use of solitary confinement, leading to a 2016 guidance that reduces its use in the federal prison system, especially for juveniles and the mentally ill, and urges states to follow suit. Under a clemency initiative, he has commuted the sentences of 944 people and pardoned 70 others, a substantial increase over most of his predecessors. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has conducted high- profile investigations of multiple police departments for systematic civil-rights abuses, including those in New Orleans, Cleveland, Newark, and Ferguson, Missouri. The investigations produced damning reports and significant consent decrees requiring meaningful reform and ongoing oversight. Holder also issued an expanded ban on profiling by federal law-enforcement agencies and their state and local partners, though he maintained existing exceptions for border control and airport screeners. In speeches that would have been unimaginable from any other attorney general in the past 40 years, Holder publicly questioned the efficacy and fairness of the War on Drugs and spoke out forcefully against mass incarceration. And he didn't just talk a good game: He reversed a policy instituted by George W. Bush's attorney general, John Ashcroft, that required prosecutors to charge defendants with the most serious crimes available. Instead, Holder instructed federal prosecutors to use their charging discretion wisely to prioritize the most serious crimes; to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with crimes that trigger draconian mandatory-minimum sentences; and to pursue alternatives to incarceration where appropriate. In the wake of these reforms, federal drug-trafficking cases dropped, prosecutors sought mandatory minimums in drug cases much less often, and the federal prison population fell for the first time in decades. Obama has been a leader on criminal-justice reform, but his record on immigrants' rights is more mixed. Even so, every time a case seeking to hold police officers accountable to constitutional constraints in their encounters with citizens reached the Supreme Court, the administration sided with the police. It advocated narrow understandings of Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, and it pressed expansive readings of doctrines that limit remedies when police violate those rights. This past term, for example, the administration supported a ruling that allows the police to use evidence found after an unconstitutional stop if a routine record check discloses an outstanding arrest warrant. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, noting that in some areas, such as Ferguson, very high percentages of the population have outstanding arrest warrants, often for trivial offenses such as failure to pay a parking ticket. The ruling, the dissenters warned, invites officers to stop people for no reason at all, run their names through the system, and then search them if a warrant pops up. Among other sources, Sotomayor cited Ta-Nehisi Coates in condemning the rule as an invitation to discriminate. Yet the Obama administration sided with the police in this and every other case that came before the Court. In other words, while the Obama administration has been willing to exercise its discretion to mitigate the ill effects of the War on Drugs and mass incarceration, it has not been willing to support more restrictive constitutional limits on that discretion, which would be more durable and farther-reaching. The federal government accounts for less than 2 percent of criminal-law enforcement; the rest is carried out by the states. Constitutional limits apply across the board to every police department in the country; a federal policy initiative, by contrast, affects only federal prosecutors and police. And as Trump will gleefully demonstrate on his first day in office, executive initiatives can be reversed by a successor administration with the stroke of a pen. * * * Obama's record is considerably more mixed with respect to immigration and immigrants' rights. On the one hand, the president pushed for reform legislation that would have provided a path to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, and, after that effort died in Congress, used his unilateral authority to extend \"deferred action\"-a status that suspends deportation efforts-to children who arrived illegally and to undocumented parents whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. The program directed at children provided benefits to as many as 1.7 million undocumented persons; the program directed at parents, which would have reached more than twice that number, was enjoined by the courts and thus has not taken effect. Obama deserves credit for his efforts to regularize the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to society and whose deportation would divide families. But Trump is virtually certain to end that program, inflicting untold harm on deserving members of our community. It's on the issue of transparency, particularly regarding drones, that Obama has most come up short. Trump has promised a sweeping deportation effort. But the Obama administration itself has already undertaken one of the most aggressive deportation and border-control campaigns in memory, expelling about 2.4 million noncitizens. Apparently believing that it needed to be strict on enforcement in order to achieve reform, the administration ramped up its deportation efforts. Many individuals who have made their lives here for decades became pawns in the administration's chess game. The Obama administration has also employed harsh practices at the border that risked turning back many legitimate asylum seekers. It has opposed the appointment of counsel in deportation proceedings even for indigent children and mentally ill immigrants who, without such assistance, cannot possibly obtain a meaningful hearing. And it has supported detention policies and practices that unnecessarily lock up immigrants, even when there is no evidence that they pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight. * * * On national security, Obama's record is similarly mixed. As noted above, his basic approach differs sharply from that of his predecessor: While Bush resisted any legal restrictions on his authority as commander in chief, Obama has insisted on acting within the bounds of statutory, constitutional, and international law. Indeed, early in his tenure, when a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that his detention authority at Guantánamo wasn't limited by international law, the administration took the extraordinary step of arguing that the court had given it too much power, and insisted that its actions must be limited by international law. The full court then issued a decision declaring that the panel's dismissal of international law would have no precedential effect. One would be hard-pressed to identify another president who argued that a court had given him too much power. From day one, Obama committed his administration to abjuring torture and other forms of cruel and inhuman interrogation tactics. He has tried to close Guantánamo, a task that is much easier promised than accomplished, as he has learned. Still, he has not brought a single new detainee to the prison, and has transferred many. He supported both unilateral and congressional reforms to the National Security Agency's program to collect domestic telephone metadata-although not until Edward Snowden informed the American people of the program's breathtaking reach, spurring widespread protests. And while it is often noted that Obama has brought more prosecutions against whistle-blowers (or, in his view, leakers) than all prior presidents combined, that is probably more attributable to the enhanced ability to identify leakers in the digital age than to Obama's views on free press and free speech. It is on the issue of transparency that Obama has most come up short. He promised that his would be \"the most transparent administration in history,\" yet he has invoked the state-secrets doctrine to block lawsuits by torture victims; fought aggressively against Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to a wide range of national-security initiatives; opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate torture; and kept under wraps virtually all the relevant facts concerning the administration's targeted-killing program. If the Snowden revelations and their aftermath have taught us anything, it's that accountability depends upon transparency. Snowden's leaks forced all three branches of the federal government to take more rights- protective positions. Some secrecy is of course essential, both in armed conflicts and concerning the details of security programs. Yet democracy requires that we the people know what the government is doing in our name if we are to have a chance of ensuring accountability. Obama's secrecy with respect to drones is the most disturbing, especially given the precedent it sets for his successor. He has asserted the power to order the killing of individuals far from any battlefield, without a hearing, without any form of external accountability, and without even admitting that he has done so. If Russia or China were exercising such authority with respect to its enemies, Obama would be sounding the alarm. If another nation were dropping bombs on individuals it deemed threatening inside our borders, we would not accept its actions as lawful. Yet that is what the United States has been doing in places like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia for years. Obama deserves some credit for moving toward increased transparency regarding the drone program. At the outset, the administration didn't even acknowledge that the program existed. But beginning with a speech by State Department legal adviser Harold Koh in 2010, the administration offered increasingly detailed defenses of the program; released aggregate estimates of the number of civilians it has killed; and, under court order, produced a redacted version of the 2013 Presidential Policy Guidance limiting targeted killing outside zones of armed conflict. But it still refuses to provide any details on the people it has targeted and killed, the factual and legal basis for those actions, and the number of innocent civilians killed in each strike. While there may be a legitimate basis for maintaining the secrecy of some of this information at the time of a strike, Obama has not released such information, even in redacted form, for a single one of the hundreds of strikes he has authorized over eight years. Without more detail, it is impossible to know whether the administration is adhering to the law, or even to its own policy guidelines. And if the president is to be accountable with respect to any authority, surely taking a human being's life should be at the top of the list. We often devote decades to ensuring that a decision to impose the death penalty is justified. With drone strikes, there is not even a public after-action review. * * * Barack Obama has done more than probably any president since Lyndon Johnson to advance civil rights, and certainly more than any on LGBTQ rights in particular. The Affordable Care Act, still his signature achievement, extended a much-needed economic right to millions. He has presided over the first drop in the incarcerated population in nearly 40 years, and he and Eric Holder have played an important part in changing the politics of crime, helping to shift the national consensus from a tough-on-crime imperative to a smart-on-crime approach that seeks to limit incarceration. Obama's immigration efforts are disappointing, but he has provided tangible benefits to more than 1 million undocumented immigrants, and he has tried to do so for many millions more. And while he has pursued a combined military and law- enforcement response to the terrorism threat from Al Qaeda and ISIS, he has sought to conduct those campaigns within the rule of law, rather than assert that legal limits are inapplicable. His record has been far from perfect, as I've laid out above. But no president's ever will be; there are simply too many conflicting demands. So what should we make of all the protests? It is a mistake common to all assessments of a presidential legacy to focus too narrowly on the president himself. Where Obama has succeeded, it has not been simply because he had good intentions, but because political forces emerged to demand reform. Criminal-justice reform is now a bipartisan issue, supported by the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, the Cato Institute, and the Koch brothers. Achieving marriage equality was the result of a decades-long campaign by gay and lesbian organizations and individuals coming out, defending their equal dignity, and acting strategically and patiently to develop the momentum necessary to achieve constitutional change. The push to legalize undocumented immigrants has been driven by the Dreamers, backed by important sectors of the labor movement. And human-rights groups have been ever vigilant in calling the administration to task for its shortfalls in fighting terrorism. In his speech at the Democratic convention supporting the nomination of Hillary Clinton, Obama stressed that the operative word must be \"we,\" not \"I.\" A presidential legacy is, in an important sense, our legacy-because what presidents do is a function not only of their own desires and commitments, but of ours.

On the one hand, the president pushed for reform legislation that would have provided a path to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, and, after that effort died in Congress, used his unilateral authority to extend \"deferred action\"-a status that suspends deportation efforts-to children who arrived illegally and to undocumented parents whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. The program directed at children provided benefits to as many as 1.7 million undocumented persons; the program directed at parents, which would have reached more than twice that number, was enjoined by the courts and thus has not taken effect. Obama deserves credit for his efforts to regularize the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to society and whose deportation would divide families. But Trump is virtually certain to end that program, inflicting untold harm on deserving members of our community. It's on the issue of transparency, particularly regarding drones, that Obama has most come up short. Trump has promised a sweeping deportation effort. But the Obama administration itself has already undertaken one of the most aggressive deportation and border-control campaigns in memory, expelling about 2.4 million noncitizens. Apparently believing that it needed to be strict on enforcement in order to achieve reform, the administration ramped up its deportation efforts. Many individuals who have made their lives here for decades became pawns in the administration's chess game. The Obama administration has also employed harsh practices at the border that risked turning back many legitimate asylum seekers. It has opposed the appointment of counsel in deportation proceedings even for indigent children and mentally ill immigrants who, without such assistance, cannot possibly obtain a meaningful hearing. And it has supported detention policies and practices that unnecessarily lock up immigrants, even when there is no evidence that they pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight. * * * On national security, Obama's record is similarly mixed. As noted above, his basic approach differs sharply from that of his predecessor: While Bush resisted any legal restrictions on his authority as commander in chief, Obama has insisted on acting within the bounds of statutory, constitutional, and international law. Indeed, early in his tenure, when a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that his detention authority at Guantánamo wasn't limited by international law, the administration took the extraordinary step of arguing that the court had given it too much power, and insisted that its actions must be limited by international law. The full court then issued a decision declaring that the panel's dismissal of international law would have no precedential effect. One would be hard-pressed to identify another president who argued that a court had given him too much power. From day one, Obama committed his administration to abjuring torture and other forms of cruel and inhuman interrogation tactics. He has tried to close Guantánamo, a task that is much easier promised than accomplished, as he has learned. Still, he has not brought a single new detainee to the prison, and has transferred many. He supported both unilateral and congressional reforms to the National Security Agency's program to collect domestic telephone metadata-although not until Edward Snowden informed the American people of the program's breathtaking reach, spurring widespread protests. And while it is often noted that Obama has brought more prosecutions against whistle-blowers (or, in his view, leakers) than all prior presidents combined, that is probably more attributable to the enhanced ability to identify leakers in the digital age than to Obama's views on free press and free speech. It is on the issue of transparency that Obama has most come up short. He promised that his would be \"the most transparent administration in history,\" yet he has invoked the state-secrets doctrine to block lawsuits by torture victims; fought aggressively against Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to a wide range of national-security initiatives; opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate torture; and kept under wraps virtually all the relevant facts concerning the administration's targeted-killing program. If the Snowden revelations and their aftermath have taught us anything, it's that accountability depends upon transparency. Snowden's leaks forced all three branches of the federal government to take more rights- protective positions. Some secrecy is of course essential, both in armed conflicts and concerning the details of security programs. Yet democracy requires that we the people know what the government is doing in our name if we are to have a chance of ensuring accountability. Obama's secrecy with respect to drones is the most disturbing, especially given the precedent it sets for his successor. He has asserted the power to order the killing of individuals far from any battlefield, without a hearing, without any form of external accountability, and without even admitting that he has done so. If Russia or China were exercising such authority with respect to its enemies, Obama would be sounding the alarm. If another nation were dropping bombs on individuals it deemed threatening inside our borders, we would not accept its actions as lawful. Yet that is what the United States has been doing in places like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia for years. Obama deserves some credit for moving toward increased transparency regarding the drone program. At the outset, the administration didn't even acknowledge that the program existed. But beginning with a speech by State Department legal adviser Harold Koh in 2010, the administration offered increasingly detailed defenses of the program; released aggregate estimates of the number of civilians it has killed; and, under court order, produced a redacted version of the 2013 Presidential Policy Guidance limiting targeted killing outside zones of armed conflict. But it still refuses to provide any details on the people it has targeted and killed, the factual and legal basis for those actions, and the number of innocent civilians killed in each strike. While there may be a legitimate basis for maintaining the secrecy of some of this information at the time of a strike, Obama has not released such information, even in redacted form, for a single one of the hundreds of strikes he has authorized over eight years. Without more detail, it is impossible to know whether the administration is adhering to the law, or even to its own policy guidelines. And if the president is to be accountable with respect to any authority, surely taking a human being's life should be at the top of the list. We often devote decades to ensuring that a decision to impose the death penalty is justified. With drone strikes, there is not even a public after-action review. * * * Barack Obama has done more than probably any president since Lyndon Johnson to advance civil rights, and certainly more than any on LGBTQ rights in particular. The Affordable Care Act, still his signature achievement, extended a much-needed economic right to millions. He has presided over the first drop in the incarcerated population in nearly 40 years, and he and Eric Holder have played an important part in changing the politics of crime, helping to shift the national consensus from a tough-on-crime imperative to a smart-on-crime approach that seeks to limit incarceration. Obama's immigration efforts are disappointing, but he has provided tangible benefits to more than 1 million undocumented immigrants, and he has tried to do so for many millions more. And while he has pursued a combined military and law- enforcement response to the terrorism threat from Al Qaeda and ISIS, he has sought to conduct those campaigns within the rule of law, rather than assert that legal limits are inapplicable. His record has been far from perfect, as I've laid out above. But no president's ever will be; there are simply too many conflicting demands. So what should we make of all the protests? It is a mistake common to all assessments of a presidential legacy to focus too narrowly on the president himself. Where Obama has succeeded, it has not been simply because he had good intentions, but because political forces emerged to demand reform. Criminal-justice reform is now a bipartisan issue, supported by the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, the Cato Institute, and the Koch brothers. Achieving marriage equality was the result of a decades-long campaign by gay and lesbian organizations and individuals coming out, defending their equal dignity, and acting strategically and patiently to develop the momentum necessary to achieve constitutional change. The push to legalize undocumented immigrants has been driven by the Dreamers, backed by important sectors of the labor movement. And human-rights groups have been ever vigilant in calling the administration to task for its shortfalls in fighting terrorism. In his speech at the Democratic convention supporting the nomination of Hillary Clinton, Obama stressed that the operative word must be \"we,\" not \"I.\" A presidential legacy is, in an important sense, our legacy-because what presidents do is a function not only of their own desires and commitments, but of ours. It's no coincidence that much of the progress we've seen has come in the context of increasing public protests for racial justice, LGBTQ rights, immigrants' rights, and against the unending War on Terror. And that's why the protests must go on if we are to limit the damage from the next administration. Listen to David Cole discuss Obama's legacy on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nAndrew J. Bacevich\n\nThe Obama administration's most important achievements in racial justice have, appropriately, concerned criminal justice. As the recent racial unrest sparked by police shootings has underscored, America's criminal-justice system is at the core of racial division in the United States. African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately victimized by both crime and criminal- law enforcement. Obama, with the full-throated support of his first attorney general, Eric Holder, has been a leader on criminal-justice reform. He signed into law the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1. Obama was the first president to visit a federal prison. He directed the Justice Department to review the use of solitary confinement, leading to a 2016 guidance that reduces its use in the federal prison system, especially for juveniles and the mentally ill, and urges states to follow suit. Under a clemency initiative, he has commuted the sentences of 944 people and pardoned 70 others, a substantial increase over most of his predecessors. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has conducted high- profile investigations of multiple police departments for systematic civil-rights abuses, including those in New Orleans, Cleveland, Newark, and Ferguson, Missouri. The investigations produced damning reports and significant consent decrees requiring meaningful reform and ongoing oversight. Holder also issued an expanded ban on profiling by federal law-enforcement agencies and their state and local partners, though he maintained existing exceptions for border control and airport screeners. In speeches that would have been unimaginable from any other attorney general in the past 40 years, Holder publicly questioned the efficacy and fairness of the War on Drugs and spoke out forcefully against mass incarceration. And he didn't just talk a good game: He reversed a policy instituted by George W. Bush's attorney general, John Ashcroft, that required prosecutors to charge defendants with the most serious crimes available. Instead, Holder instructed federal prosecutors to use their charging discretion wisely to prioritize the most serious crimes; to avoid charging low-level drug offenders with crimes that trigger draconian mandatory-minimum sentences; and to pursue alternatives to incarceration where appropriate. In the wake of these reforms, federal drug-trafficking cases dropped, prosecutors sought mandatory minimums in drug cases much less often, and the federal prison population fell for the first time in decades. Obama has been a leader on criminal-justice reform, but his record on immigrants' rights is more mixed. Even so, every time a case seeking to hold police officers accountable to constitutional constraints in their encounters with citizens reached the Supreme Court, the administration sided with the police. It advocated narrow understandings of Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, and it pressed expansive readings of doctrines that limit remedies when police violate those rights. This past term, for example, the administration supported a ruling that allows the police to use evidence found after an unconstitutional stop if a routine record check discloses an outstanding arrest warrant. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, noting that in some areas, such as Ferguson, very high percentages of the population have outstanding arrest warrants, often for trivial offenses such as failure to pay a parking ticket. The ruling, the dissenters warned, invites officers to stop people for no reason at all, run their names through the system, and then search them if a warrant pops up. Among other sources, Sotomayor cited Ta-Nehisi Coates in condemning the rule as an invitation to discriminate. Yet the Obama administration sided with the police in this and every other case that came before the Court. In other words, while the Obama administration has been willing to exercise its discretion to mitigate the ill effects of the War on Drugs and mass incarceration, it has not been willing to support more restrictive constitutional limits on that discretion, which would be more durable and farther-reaching. The federal government accounts for less than 2 percent of criminal-law enforcement; the rest is carried out by the states. Constitutional limits apply across the board to every police department in the country; a federal policy initiative, by contrast, affects only federal prosecutors and police. And as Trump will gleefully demonstrate on his first day in office, executive initiatives can be reversed by a successor administration with the stroke of a pen. * * * Obama's record is considerably more mixed with respect to immigration and immigrants' rights.

And as Trump will gleefully demonstrate on his first day in office, executive initiatives can be reversed by a successor administration with the stroke of a pen. * * * Obama's record is considerably more mixed with respect to immigration and immigrants' rights. On the one hand, the president pushed for reform legislation that would have provided a path to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, and, after that effort died in Congress, used his unilateral authority to extend \"deferred action\"-a status that suspends deportation efforts-to children who arrived illegally and to undocumented parents whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. The program directed at children provided benefits to as many as 1.7 million undocumented persons; the program directed at parents, which would have reached more than twice that number, was enjoined by the courts and thus has not taken effect. Obama deserves credit for his efforts to regularize the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to society and whose deportation would divide families. But Trump is virtually certain to end that program, inflicting untold harm on deserving members of our community. It's on the issue of transparency, particularly regarding drones, that Obama has most come up short. Trump has promised a sweeping deportation effort. But the Obama administration itself has already undertaken one of the most aggressive deportation and border-control campaigns in memory, expelling about 2.4 million noncitizens. Apparently believing that it needed to be strict on enforcement in order to achieve reform, the administration ramped up its deportation efforts. Many individuals who have made their lives here for decades became pawns in the administration's chess game. The Obama administration has also employed harsh practices at the border that risked turning back many legitimate asylum seekers. It has opposed the appointment of counsel in deportation proceedings even for indigent children and mentally ill immigrants who, without such assistance, cannot possibly obtain a meaningful hearing. And it has supported detention policies and practices that unnecessarily lock up immigrants, even when there is no evidence that they pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight. * * * On national security, Obama's record is similarly mixed. As noted above, his basic approach differs sharply from that of his predecessor: While Bush resisted any legal restrictions on his authority as commander in chief, Obama has insisted on acting within the bounds of statutory, constitutional, and international law. Indeed, early in his tenure, when a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that his detention authority at Guantánamo wasn't limited by international law, the administration took the extraordinary step of arguing that the court had given it too much power, and insisted that its actions must be limited by international law. The full court then issued a decision declaring that the panel's dismissal of international law would have no precedential effect. One would be hard-pressed to identify another president who argued that a court had given him too much power. From day one, Obama committed his administration to abjuring torture and other forms of cruel and inhuman interrogation tactics. He has tried to close Guantánamo, a task that is much easier promised than accomplished, as he has learned. Still, he has not brought a single new detainee to the prison, and has transferred many. He supported both unilateral and congressional reforms to the National Security Agency's program to collect domestic telephone metadata-although not until Edward Snowden informed the American people of the program's breathtaking reach, spurring widespread protests. And while it is often noted that Obama has brought more prosecutions against whistle-blowers (or, in his view, leakers) than all prior presidents combined, that is probably more attributable to the enhanced ability to identify leakers in the digital age than to Obama's views on free press and free speech. It is on the issue of transparency that Obama has most come up short. He promised that his would be \"the most transparent administration in history,\" yet he has invoked the state-secrets doctrine to block lawsuits by torture victims; fought aggressively against Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to a wide range of national-security initiatives; opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate torture; and kept under wraps virtually all the relevant facts concerning the administration's targeted-killing program. If the Snowden revelations and their aftermath have taught us anything, it's that accountability depends upon transparency. Snowden's leaks forced all three branches of the federal government to take more rights- protective positions. Some secrecy is of course essential, both in armed conflicts and concerning the details of security programs. Yet democracy requires that we the people know what the government is doing in our name if we are to have a chance of ensuring accountability. Obama's secrecy with respect to drones is the most disturbing, especially given the precedent it sets for his successor. He has asserted the power to order the killing of individuals far from any battlefield, without a hearing, without any form of external accountability, and without even admitting that he has done so. If Russia or China were exercising such authority with respect to its enemies, Obama would be sounding the alarm. If another nation were dropping bombs on individuals it deemed threatening inside our borders, we would not accept its actions as lawful. Yet that is what the United States has been doing in places like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia for years. Obama deserves some credit for moving toward increased transparency regarding the drone program. At the outset, the administration didn't even acknowledge that the program existed. But beginning with a speech by State Department legal adviser Harold Koh in 2010, the administration offered increasingly detailed defenses of the program; released aggregate estimates of the number of civilians it has killed; and, under court order, produced a redacted version of the 2013 Presidential Policy Guidance limiting targeted killing outside zones of armed conflict. But it still refuses to provide any details on the people it has targeted and killed, the factual and legal basis for those actions, and the number of innocent civilians killed in each strike. While there may be a legitimate basis for maintaining the secrecy of some of this information at the time of a strike, Obama has not released such information, even in redacted form, for a single one of the hundreds of strikes he has authorized over eight years. Without more detail, it is impossible to know whether the administration is adhering to the law, or even to its own policy guidelines. And if the president is to be accountable with respect to any authority, surely taking a human being's life should be at the top of the list. We often devote decades to ensuring that a decision to impose the death penalty is justified. With drone strikes, there is not even a public after-action review. * * * Barack Obama has done more than probably any president since Lyndon Johnson to advance civil rights, and certainly more than any on LGBTQ rights in particular. The Affordable Care Act, still his signature achievement, extended a much-needed economic right to millions. He has presided over the first drop in the incarcerated population in nearly 40 years, and he and Eric Holder have played an important part in changing the politics of crime, helping to shift the national consensus from a tough-on-crime imperative to a smart-on-crime approach that seeks to limit incarceration. Obama's immigration efforts are disappointing, but he has provided tangible benefits to more than 1 million undocumented immigrants, and he has tried to do so for many millions more. And while he has pursued a combined military and law- enforcement response to the terrorism threat from Al Qaeda and ISIS, he has sought to conduct those campaigns within the rule of law, rather than assert that legal limits are inapplicable. His record has been far from perfect, as I've laid out above. But no president's ever will be; there are simply too many conflicting demands. So what should we make of all the protests? It is a mistake common to all assessments of a presidential legacy to focus too narrowly on the president himself. Where Obama has succeeded, it has not been simply because he had good intentions, but because political forces emerged to demand reform. Criminal-justice reform is now a bipartisan issue, supported by the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, the Cato Institute, and the Koch brothers. Achieving marriage equality was the result of a decades-long campaign by gay and lesbian organizations and individuals coming out, defending their equal dignity, and acting strategically and patiently to develop the momentum necessary to achieve constitutional change. The push to legalize undocumented immigrants has been driven by the Dreamers, backed by important sectors of the labor movement. And human-rights groups have been ever vigilant in calling the administration to task for its shortfalls in fighting terrorism. In his speech at the Democratic convention supporting the nomination of Hillary Clinton, Obama stressed that the operative word must be \"we,\" not \"I.\" A presidential legacy is, in an important sense, our legacy-because what presidents do is a function not only of their own desires and commitments, but of ours. It's no coincidence that much of the progress we've seen has come in the context of increasing public protests for racial justice, LGBTQ rights, immigrants' rights, and against the unending War on Terror. And that's why the protests must go on if we are to limit the damage from the next administration. Listen to David Cole discuss Obama's legacy on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nObama has been a leader on criminal-justice reform, but his record on immigrants' rights is more mixed.\n\nEven so, every time a case seeking to hold police officers accountable to constitutional constraints in their encounters with citizens reached the Supreme Court, the administration sided with the police. It advocated narrow understandings of Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, and it pressed expansive readings of doctrines that limit remedies when police violate those rights. This past term, for example, the administration supported a ruling that allows the police to use evidence found after an unconstitutional stop if a routine record check discloses an outstanding arrest warrant. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, noting that in some areas, such as Ferguson, very high percentages of the population have outstanding arrest warrants, often for trivial offenses such as failure to pay a parking ticket. The ruling, the dissenters warned, invites officers to stop people for no reason at all, run their names through the system, and then search them if a warrant pops up. Among other sources, Sotomayor cited Ta-Nehisi Coates in condemning the rule as an invitation to discriminate. Yet the Obama administration sided with the police in this and every other case that came before the Court. In other words, while the Obama administration has been willing to exercise its discretion to mitigate the ill effects of the War on Drugs and mass incarceration, it has not been willing to support more restrictive constitutional limits on that discretion, which would be more durable and farther-reaching. The federal government accounts for less than 2 percent of criminal-law enforcement; the rest is carried out by the states. Constitutional limits apply across the board to every police department in the country; a federal policy initiative, by contrast, affects only federal prosecutors and police.

It is a mistake common to all assessments of a presidential legacy to focus too narrowly on the president himself. Where Obama has succeeded, it has not been simply because he had good intentions, but because political forces emerged to demand reform. Criminal-justice reform is now a bipartisan issue, supported by the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, the Cato Institute, and the Koch brothers. Achieving marriage equality was the result of a decades-long campaign by gay and lesbian organizations and individuals coming out, defending their equal dignity, and acting strategically and patiently to develop the momentum necessary to achieve constitutional change. The push to legalize undocumented immigrants has been driven by the Dreamers, backed by important sectors of the labor movement. And human-rights groups have been ever vigilant in calling the administration to task for its shortfalls in fighting terrorism. In his speech at the Democratic convention supporting the nomination of Hillary Clinton, Obama stressed that the operative word must be \"we,\" not \"I.\" A presidential legacy is, in an important sense, our legacy-because what presidents do is a function not only of their own desires and commitments, but of ours. It's no coincidence that much of the progress we've seen has come in the context of increasing public protests for racial justice, LGBTQ rights, immigrants' rights, and against the unending War on Terror. And that's why the protests must go on if we are to limit the damage from the next administration. Listen to David Cole discuss Obama's legacy on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nObama's record is considerably more mixed with respect to immigration and immigrants' rights. On the one hand, the president pushed for reform legislation that would have provided a path to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, and, after that effort died in Congress, used his unilateral authority to extend \"deferred action\"-a status that suspends deportation efforts-to children who arrived illegally and to undocumented parents whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. The program directed at children provided benefits to as many as 1.7 million undocumented persons; the program directed at parents, which would have reached more than twice that number, was enjoined by the courts and thus has not taken effect. Obama deserves credit for his efforts to regularize the lives of millions of undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to society and whose deportation would divide families. But Trump is virtually certain to end that program, inflicting untold harm on deserving members of our community. It's on the issue of transparency, particularly regarding drones, that Obama has most come up short. Trump has promised a sweeping deportation effort. But the Obama administration itself has already undertaken one of the most aggressive deportation and border-control campaigns in memory, expelling about 2.4 million noncitizens. Apparently believing that it needed to be strict on enforcement in order to achieve reform, the administration ramped up its deportation efforts. Many individuals who have made their lives here for decades became pawns in the administration's chess game. The Obama administration has also employed harsh practices at the border that risked turning back many legitimate asylum seekers. It has opposed the appointment of counsel in deportation proceedings even for indigent children and mentally ill immigrants who, without such assistance, cannot possibly obtain a meaningful hearing. And it has supported detention policies and practices that unnecessarily lock up immigrants, even when there is no evidence that they pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight. * * * On national security, Obama's record is similarly mixed. As noted above, his basic approach differs sharply from that of his predecessor: While Bush resisted any legal restrictions on his authority as commander in chief, Obama has insisted on acting within the bounds of statutory, constitutional, and international law. Indeed, early in his tenure, when a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that his detention authority at Guantánamo wasn't limited by international law, the administration took the extraordinary step of arguing that the court had given it too much power, and insisted that its actions must be limited by international law. The full court then issued a decision declaring that the panel's dismissal of international law would have no precedential effect. One would be hard-pressed to identify another president who argued that a court had given him too much power. From day one, Obama committed his administration to abjuring torture and other forms of cruel and inhuman interrogation tactics. He has tried to close Guantánamo, a task that is much easier promised than accomplished, as he has learned. Still, he has not brought a single new detainee to the prison, and has transferred many. He supported both unilateral and congressional reforms to the National Security Agency's program to collect domestic telephone metadata-although not until Edward Snowden informed the American people of the program's breathtaking reach, spurring widespread protests. And while it is often noted that Obama has brought more prosecutions against whistle-blowers (or, in his view, leakers) than all prior presidents combined, that is probably more attributable to the enhanced ability to identify leakers in the digital age than to Obama's views on free press and free speech. It is on the issue of transparency that Obama has most come up short. He promised that his would be \"the most transparent administration in history,\" yet he has invoked the state-secrets doctrine to block lawsuits by torture victims; fought aggressively against Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to a wide range of national-security initiatives; opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate torture; and kept under wraps virtually all the relevant facts concerning the administration's targeted-killing program. If the Snowden revelations and their aftermath have taught us anything, it's that accountability depends upon transparency. Snowden's leaks forced all three branches of the federal government to take more rights- protective positions. Some secrecy is of course essential, both in armed conflicts and concerning the details of security programs. Yet democracy requires that we the people know what the government is doing in our name if we are to have a chance of ensuring accountability. Obama's secrecy with respect to drones is the most disturbing, especially given the precedent it sets for his successor. He has asserted the power to order the killing of individuals far from any battlefield, without a hearing, without any form of external accountability, and without even admitting that he has done so. If Russia or China were exercising such authority with respect to its enemies, Obama would be sounding the alarm. If another nation were dropping bombs on individuals it deemed threatening inside our borders, we would not accept its actions as lawful. Yet that is what the United States has been doing in places like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia for years. Obama deserves some credit for moving toward increased transparency regarding the drone program. At the outset, the administration didn't even acknowledge that the program existed. But beginning with a speech by State Department legal adviser Harold Koh in 2010, the administration offered increasingly detailed defenses of the program; released aggregate estimates of the number of civilians it has killed; and, under court order, produced a redacted version of the 2013 Presidential Policy Guidance limiting targeted killing outside zones of armed conflict. But it still refuses to provide any details on the people it has targeted and killed, the factual and legal basis for those actions, and the number of innocent civilians killed in each strike. While there may be a legitimate basis for maintaining the secrecy of some of this information at the time of a strike, Obama has not released such information, even in redacted form, for a single one of the hundreds of strikes he has authorized over eight years. Without more detail, it is impossible to know whether the administration is adhering to the law, or even to its own policy guidelines. And if the president is to be accountable with respect to any authority, surely taking a human being's life should be at the top of the list. We often devote decades to ensuring that a decision to impose the death penalty is justified. With drone strikes, there is not even a public after-action review. * * * Barack Obama has done more than probably any president since Lyndon Johnson to advance civil rights, and certainly more than any on LGBTQ rights in particular. The Affordable Care Act, still his signature achievement, extended a much-needed economic right to millions. He has presided over the first drop in the incarcerated population in nearly 40 years, and he and Eric Holder have played an important part in changing the politics of crime, helping to shift the national consensus from a tough-on-crime imperative to a smart-on-crime approach that seeks to limit incarceration. Obama's immigration efforts are disappointing, but he has provided tangible benefits to more than 1 million undocumented immigrants, and he has tried to do so for many millions more. And while he has pursued a combined military and law- enforcement response to the terrorism threat from Al Qaeda and ISIS, he has sought to conduct those campaigns within the rule of law, rather than assert that legal limits are inapplicable.

He has presided over the first drop in the incarcerated population in nearly 40 years, and he and Eric Holder have played an important part in changing the politics of crime, helping to shift the national consensus from a tough-on-crime imperative to a smart-on-crime approach that seeks to limit incarceration. Obama's immigration efforts are disappointing, but he has provided tangible benefits to more than 1 million undocumented immigrants, and he has tried to do so for many millions more. And while he has pursued a combined military and law- enforcement response to the terrorism threat from Al Qaeda and ISIS, he has sought to conduct those campaigns within the rule of law, rather than assert that legal limits are inapplicable. His record has been far from perfect, as I've laid out above. But no president's ever will be; there are simply too many conflicting demands. So what should we make of all the protests? It is a mistake common to all assessments of a presidential legacy to focus too narrowly on the president himself. Where Obama has succeeded, it has not been simply because he had good intentions, but because political forces emerged to demand reform. Criminal-justice reform is now a bipartisan issue, supported by the ACLU, Black Lives Matter, the Cato Institute, and the Koch brothers. Achieving marriage equality was the result of a decades-long campaign by gay and lesbian organizations and individuals coming out, defending their equal dignity, and acting strategically and patiently to develop the momentum necessary to achieve constitutional change. The push to legalize undocumented immigrants has been driven by the Dreamers, backed by important sectors of the labor movement. And human-rights groups have been ever vigilant in calling the administration to task for its shortfalls in fighting terrorism. In his speech at the Democratic convention supporting the nomination of Hillary Clinton, Obama stressed that the operative word must be \"we,\" not \"I.\" A presidential legacy is, in an important sense, our legacy-because what presidents do is a function not only of their own desires and commitments, but of ours. It's no coincidence that much of the progress we've seen has come in the context of increasing public protests for racial justice, LGBTQ rights, immigrants' rights, and against the unending War on Terror. And that's why the protests must go on if we are to limit the damage from the next administration. Listen to David Cole discuss Obama's legacy on the Start Making Sense podcast.\n\nIt is on the issue of transparency that Obama has most come up short. He promised that his would be \"the most transparent administration in history,\" yet he has invoked the state-secrets doctrine to block lawsuits by torture victims; fought aggressively against Freedom of Information Act requests for documents related to a wide range of national-security initiatives; opposed a bipartisan commission to investigate torture; and kept under wraps virtually all the relevant facts concerning the administration's targeted-killing program. If the Snowden revelations and their aftermath have taught us anything, it's that accountability depends upon transparency. Snowden's leaks forced all three branches of the federal government to take more rights- protective positions. Some secrecy is of course essential, both in armed conflicts and concerning the details of security programs. Yet democracy requires that we the people know what the government is doing in our name if we are to have a chance of ensuring accountability. Obama's secrecy with respect to drones is the most disturbing, especially given the precedent it sets for his successor. He has asserted the power to order the killing of individuals far from any battlefield, without a hearing, without any form of external accountability, and without even admitting that he has done so. If Russia or China were exercising such authority with respect to its enemies, Obama would be sounding the alarm. If another nation were dropping bombs on individuals it deemed threatening inside our borders, we would not accept its actions as lawful. Yet that is what the United States has been doing in places like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia for years. Obama deserves some credit for moving toward increased transparency regarding the drone program. At the outset, the administration didn't even acknowledge that the program existed. But beginning with a speech by State Department legal adviser Harold Koh in 2010, the administration offered increasingly detailed defenses of the program; released aggregate estimates of the number of civilians it has killed; and, under court order, produced a redacted version of the 2013 Presidential Policy Guidance limiting targeted killing outside zones of armed conflict. But it still refuses to provide any details on the people it has targeted and killed, the factual and legal basis for those actions, and the number of innocent civilians killed in each strike. While there may be a legitimate basis for maintaining the secrecy of some of this information at the time of a strike, Obama has not released such information, even in redacted form, for a single one of the hundreds of strikes he has authorized over eight years. Without more detail, it is impossible to know whether the administration is adhering to the law, or even to its own policy guidelines. And if the president is to be accountable with respect to any authority, surely taking a human being's life should be at the top of the list. We often devote decades to ensuring that a decision to impose the death penalty is justified.

While the story was unique in the attention it received, it shed light on a national problem: our police are systematically targeting people of color, are alarmingly quick to use lethal force and are alienating communities by using equipment more appropriate to a war zone. The history of racist and abusive policing in the United States is long and the numbers are stark. According to the latest study compiled by the FBI, in the seven years leading up to 2012, one black person was killed by a police officer at least twice each week. Thanks in large part to tireless organizing-including on the part of young people of color and their allies-more people are now paying attention. It is long past time for our federal government to act. Although the Obama administration cannot singlehandedly end our country's long history of abusive policing, the executive branch can make concrete changes and it can do so without needing the support of our recalcitrant Congress. Through executive actions and the work of the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Defense, the administration can move us closer to ending discriminatory police tactics, holding departments accountable for systematic abuse and getting tanks, riot gear and other military equipment off our streets.

A new generation of reporters has risen to cover a grim and new-seeming iteration of that beat: police shootings of unarmed black men.\n\nIn his new book, \"They Can't Kill Us All: Ferguson, Baltimore, and a New Era in America's Racial Justice Movement,\" the Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery describes traveling from shooting to shooting during 2014 and 2015. He'd see the same reporters in each city, and about this cohort he says: \"We'd become a morbid fraternal order.\"\n\nMr. Lowery is young (he was born in 1990) and talented (he was a member of the team awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his newspaper's coverage of police shootings) and black. His book is electric, because it is so well reported, so plainly told and so evidently the work of a man who has not grown a callus on his heart.\n\nHe had a moment of unwanted fame in August 2014 when he was in Ferguson, Mo., to cover the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white policeman named Darren Wilson. He was eating and doing work in a McDonald's - a journalist's go-to spot because of the free wifi, electrical outlets and bathrooms - when police ordered the restaurant cleared out.\n\nMr. Lowery didn't move quickly enough. He was shoved against a soda dispenser and arrested . Ryan Reilly, a reporter for The Huffington Post, was arrested as well. Thanks to social media, this news went viral in minutes. \"My colleagues at The Post knew I had been arrested,\" the author writes, \"before Ryan and I had even made it back to the police station.\"\n\nMr. Lowery has a lot to say about social media and the way it has been put to use by the activists in the movement that's come to be loosely known as Black Lives Matter. Sites like Facebook and Twitter, he writes, together function as \"a hybrid newsfeed, broadcasting platform and ongoing group therapy space.\" The movement's opponents, he finds, use it in much the same way.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

She faces up to 99 years in prison.\n\ntranscript\n\nWe the jury unanimously find the defendant, Amber Guyger, guilty of murder as charged in the indictment. [clapping] Judge: Deputies, can you clear the courtroom for me, please. Deputy: \"Everybody clear the courtroom, we'd appreciate it.\"\n\nBy Marina Trahan Martinez Sarah Mervosh and John Eligon\n\nDALLAS - The case was unusual from the very beginning: An off-duty police officer in Dallas said she came home from work one night last year, and, believing she had found an intruder inside her apartment, shot the man inside.\n\nBut it quickly became clear that the officer, Amber R. Guyger, who is white, was in the wrong apartment. And the man she shot was not an intruder, but her neighbor, Botham Shem Jean, a 26-year-old black accountant who was watching television and eating ice cream in the apartment he rented directly above Ms. Guyger's.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Jean's family braced themselves for the possibility that his death would be treated like many others across the country, in which police officers have been cleared of wrongdoing in the killings of unarmed black men. But that moment never came: A Dallas County jury found Ms. Guyger, 31, guilty of murder, choosing the more serious conviction over a lesser option of manslaughter.\n\nThe verdict set off a scene of jubilation across the courthouse in downtown Dallas, a diverse city with a history of racial tensions with the police. Mr. Jean's mother, Allison Jean, stood up in the courtroom, raised her hands in the air and celebrated with a prayer: \"God is good.\" In the hallways, supporters shouted an affirmation: \"Black lives matter.\"\n\nThe case did not fit into the familiar narratives of police killings in which officers fired their weapons on duty. But it was widely viewed as a test for whether there was anywhere in America where black men could be safe, if not in their own homes. With Ms. Guyger's tearful testimony that she was afraid for her life when she saw a silhouetted figure in the darkened living room, the guilty verdict was seen by many activists as a step toward police accountability, and a rebuke of the stereotype that black men are inherently scary.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Police Try to Lower Racial Bias, but Under Pressure, It Isn't So Easy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Benedict Carey and Erica Goode\n\nThe recent string of racially charged police shootings, and the deadly response on Thursday in Dallas, have come despite efforts by police departments across the United States to train officers to recognize and reduce the effects of racial stereotypes in potentially violent situations.\n\nWhether these bias reduction programs can lead to lasting change in policing is an unanswered question. Their effect on split-second decision making is extremely hard to measure - and experts say some programs may even backfire.\n\nStudies find that police officers harbor the same unconscious biases toward minorities, particularly blacks, that the general American population does.\n\nIn one measure, called the implicit association test , study participants are asked to make rapid-fire associations between images of blacks, whites or other races, and threatening words or images. The pattern of responses is nearly universal: Blacks are more often and more quickly paired with threats. This tends to be true regardless of the ethnicity of the person doing the associating, or that person's professed views on race.\n\nStandard police training and walking a beat can reduce those biases, at least in a laboratory setting, research has found. In a landmark 2007 study that simulated threatening situations, researchers led by Joshua Correll, who is now at the University of Colorado, found that police officers showed no racial bias when choosing to shoot. By contrast, civilians were far more trigger-happy, and shot nearly three times the number of unarmed black men.\n\n\"This is contrary to what people assume,\" Dr. Correll said, \"but it's important to keep in mind that these are simulations, in a lab, where everyone knows it's a game.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Walter Scott's Death Should End Public's Denial of Police Victimization of Blacks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalter Katz, a former public defender, was part of a task force that challenged convictions in cases brought by corrupt Los Angeles police officers in the Ramparts case. He is a member of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement and has been part of the office of independent review, monitoring the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.  He is on Twitter .\n\nUpdated April  9, 2015,  2:07 PM\n\nThere is a phenomenon in the United States which most of the public is unwilling or unable to fully acknowledge. The killings by police of unarmed black men and boys is akin to climate change - for many, seemingly no evidence will convince them that there is a relationship between race and police violence. The justifiably outraged reaction to the apparent murder of Walter Scott suggests that the denial may be finally wearing off. Now is the time to confront that denial and ask whether the reforms that are typically called for are sufficient to combat an obvious disparate impact on black Americans.\n\nFor years black Americans and their allies have been saying that officers are killing blacks with impunity. The common reaction is to dissect each fatal encounter and explain what the deceased did to justify being killed. This allowed the majority of the public to disengage from the conversation and write off each death as the deceased's fault. What the shooting of Walter Scott tore off was any pretense of a legal justification that he was posing an imminent threat  to officer Michael T. Slager.\n\nWhat is still missing is any evidence of racial motivation. The circumstantial evidence, though, is strong because each questionable death seems to occur when the civilian is black or brown be it on a New York City sidewalk, the back corner of a suburban Walmart, a park in Cleveland or a field in South Carolina. The recent President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing addressed racial bias and recommended better collection of demographic data of police encounters and the racial composition of police departments and adoption and of policies prohibiting racial profiling. Those recommendations have to be expanded upon and implemented.\n\nFirst and foremost, the dearth of data surrounding lethal use of force must be eliminated. Lawmakers have to force police departments to adopt a culture of transparency where a range of data including the use of force, traffic stops and complaints are made public.\n\nSecond, de-escalation tactics must always precede the use of force. The current legal justification for using both lethal and non-lethal force is very broad. As long as officer can demonstrate that he feared an imminent threat of harm and it appears reasonable, he is not subject to any discipline for the use of force.\n\nThird, addressing implicit bias through training may not be enough. What the Department of Justice investigation of Ferguson, Mo. clearly showed is that the bias can be very explicit. Departments have to adopt zero tolerance for racial bias and dishonesty and remove any officers from their forces when racial motivations or lying is uncovered.\n\nFinally, investigations of deadly force incidents must be far more robust. In far too many troubling shootings, investigators are not willing to ask the officers the tough questions they would ask in any other homicide that did not involve cops but instead let them off the hook with softball questions.\n\nThere are no easy answers but the killing of Walter Scott demonstrates once and for all that some cops lie and murder and think they can get away with it. As long as the public was in denial that approach worked, now the burden is on all of us, police departments and their political leadership to say \"enough is enough.\"\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate .\n\nTopics: criminal justice , law enforcement , police , race\n\nHave police officers become too willing to use force or are they reacting to the dangers they face every day?

Pink Houses in the East New York neighborhood. At one point, Officer Liang opened a door into an unlighted stairwell and his gun went off. The bullet glanced off a wall and hit Akai Gurley, 28, who was walking down the stairs with his girlfriend, and pierced his heart.\n\nMr. Liang, a rookie officer who had graduated from the Police Academy the year before the shooting, was also found guilty of official misconduct for failing to help Mr. Gurley as he lay on a fifth-floor landing. Mr. Gurley's girlfriend, Melissa Butler, had testified that while she knelt in a pool of his blood trying to resuscitate him, the officer stopped briefly but did not help before proceeding down the stairs.\n\nThe verdict, delivered in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, comes amid a national debate on the policing of black neighborhoods after a string of killings of unarmed black men by police officers. And the jury's decision is a rare instance in which a police officer was convicted of killing someone in the line of duty.\n\nThe jury deliberated a little more than two days before reaching a verdict. The Police Department said soon after the verdict that it had fired Officer Liang.\n\nAfter hearing the verdict, Officer Liang bowed his head and sank his face into his hands.

      "text": "The Emerging Movement for Police and Prison Abolition\n\nThe murder of George Floyd last spring provoked an unprecedented outpouring of protests, and a rare national reckoning with both racism and police violence. Public officials across the country pledged police reform. On April 20th, Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, was found guilty of murder. It is rare for police to be prosecuted, let alone punished. I remember my incredulous reaction, in 1992, when my mother called to tell me that the four police officers who beat Rodney King, in Los Angeles, were found not guilty. I remember, in the summer of 2013, being at a Chicago restaurant, having dinner with my wife, and feeling the numbing shock of seeing in real time, on television, George Zimmerman acquitted for the murder of Trayvon Martin . We left the restaurant to join a protest downtown, crossing the street to catch the train. When I walked through the turnstile, a Black woman wearing the uniform of the Chicago Transit Authority looked at me with tears in her eyes, and mouthed, \"They let him get away with it.\" For most ordinary African-Americans who have watched helplessly, for years, as police act with violent impunity in their communities, the conviction of Chauvin feels like justice long delayed. For Floyd's family, the verdict came as a relief. Philonise Floyd said that the conviction \"makes us happier knowing that his life, it mattered, and he didn't die in vain.\"\n\nIn a certain sense, the trial of Chauvin has been viewed as a piece of a national reform strategy. There is a hope that his conviction will serve as evidence that police do not operate above the law and that they can be subjected to its punishments. But if it takes tens of millions of people marching, and an extraordinary recording capturing Chauvin's cool torpor as Floyd's life left his body, to secure some measure of legal accountability for the police, then what does this conviction mean for the transformation of American policing? In effect, Chauvin had to be convicted for it to remain even remotely credible that, in the United States, the law protects the rights of African-Americans. Pursuing such an outcome allowed Chauvin's employers and supervisors to disavow him, describing him as a rogue cop who had abandoned his training. \"Policing is a noble profession,\" the prosecutor Steven Schleicher said at the trial. \"Make no mistake, this is not a prosecution of the police-it is a prosecution of the defendant. And there's nothing worse for good police than bad police.\"\n\nDays into the protracted spectacle of the Chauvin trial, the police killing of an unarmed twenty-year-old Black man, Daunte Wright, ten miles north of Minneapolis, in the suburb of Brooklyn Center, sparked fresh protests. The details of that latest outrage bore all the markings of the sanguinary and absurd cycle of racist police violence. Consider that police stopped Wright's car because of some minor technicality often used a pretext for racial profiling, that they threatened him with arrest because of an existing warrant, and that, in the most tragic turn of events, the officer who killed Wright claimed to confuse her Taser with her gun. Within hours of his murder, the chief of police and the officer who pulled the trigger, Kim Potter, had resigned their jobs, and Potter was subsequently arrested for second-degree manslaughter. The quick resignation and arrest are other indications that things are not quite the same regarding the police, but nothing that led to the confrontation and the ultimately death of Wright has been undone.\n\nIndeed, as the high-stakes trial of Chauvin was unfolding, the news was roiled by the release of body-camera footage showing a Black soldier being pepper-sprayed during a routine traffic stop in Virginia, followed by the release of body-camera footage documenting the police shooting, in Chicago, of thirteen-year-old Adam Toledo, his empty hands in the air. Chicago officials initially claimed that Toledo had an \"armed confrontation\" with the officer who shot him. Misleading comments from Mayor Lori Lightfoot and others revived memories of the murder of seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald, seven years earlier. McDonald was shot sixteen times by a Chicago cop, Jason Van Dyke, who claimed that the teen-ager attacked him with a knife. Subsequent release of dashboard-camera footage showed McDonald walking away from the police as Van Dyke unleashed a fusillade of bullets in his direction. The revelations surrounding McDonald's murder exposed a coverup that stretched high into Chicago's political leadership, effectively ending the then mayor Rahm Emanuel's political career there. The killing of McDonald was also supposed to usher in a new period of police reform in a city long dogged by scandals and crises of police racism, corruption, and brutality. Jason Van Dyke was also convicted of murder, but the controversy surrounding the death of Adam Toledo shows that the Chicago Police Department remains far from reformed.\n\nMinutes before the verdict in the Chauvin trial was revealed, a white police officer in Columbus, Ohio, shot a Black sixteen-year-old, Ma'Khia Bryant, four times in the chest , killing her. Bryant was wielding a knife and threatening to stab another girl when she was shot, but the officer's default to shooting and Bryant's resulting death quickly dashed any hopes that the guilty verdict in Minneapolis indicated a turning point in American policing. Since then, new cases involving police shootings of unarmed Black men have surfaced in North Carolina and Virginia .\n\nThe continuation of police abuse has reaffirmed the calls of some activists for an end to policing as we know it; for others, it has confirmed that the institution of policing should be abolished completely. In the past year or two, the propositions of defunding or abolishing police and prisons has travelled from incarcerated-activist networks and academic conferences and scholarship into mainstream conversations. Of course, this doesn't mean that these politics have become mainstream, but the persistence of police violence disproportionately harming Black communities has pushed far more people to contemplate radical proposals for dealing with issues of harm and safety.\n\nOne Black woman who has been at the center of these conversations is Mariame Kaba, an educator and organizer who is based in New York City. Kaba fund-raised for large-scale mutual-aid operations as the impact of COVID -19 began to set in and the lack of public provisions threatened hunger, homelessness, and illness for untold numbers. She is also known for helping to organize a successful campaign to award reparations to Black men who survived torture orchestrated by the former Chicago police commander Jon Burge. Those reparations include a five-and-a-half-million-dollar compensation fund for the victims and their families, waived tuition at the City Colleges of Chicago, a mandatory curriculum for Chicago public schools about the police torture, and a public memorial. It was an unprecedented campaign and outcome, which mirrored the professed values of the growing abolitionist movement: repair and restoration. Kaba and her fellow-activists were less interested in prosecuting the offending police officers than in developing initiatives that could repair the harms done by the Chicago Police Department.\n\nMany were introduced to Kaba and her work through her blog, Prison Culture , which she began, in 2010, as a way to talk about her organizing projects and to educate and engage with a small public about the consequences of prevailing law-and-order politics in the United States. Kaba writes in Prison Culture about the culture of punishment that has functioned as a guiding principle in American jurisprudence. She also shares movement reports, articles published elsewhere, poems from other writers, and lots of visual art. When I spoke to Kaba recently, she told me, \"I am not interested in writing. I am an organizer who writes.\" But, as an organizer, she writes quite a bit, and, in February, she published a book, \" We Do This 'Til We Free Us: Abolitionist Organizing and Transforming Justice ,\" an eclectic collection of articles, interviews, speeches, short pieces co-written with some of Kaba's political collaborators, and more, edited by the sociologist Tamara K. Nopper.\n\nThe book, which débuted on the Times best-seller list, offers an entry point into the world of abolitionist politics, beginning with an essay titled \"So You're Thinking about Becoming an Abolitionist.\" It contains several basic but profound observations: \"Increasing rates of incarceration have a minimal impact on crime rates. Moreover, crime and harm are not synonymous. All that is criminalized isn't harmful, and all harm isn't necessarily criminalized.\" If there is a mismatch between punishment and crime, and crime and harm, then what is the intent of the criminal-justice system and the police it employs? Kaba refers to the \"criminal punishment system\" to emphasize that justice in the United States means a promise of retribution much more than an effort to understand why an infraction has occurred. She writes, \"If we want to reduce (or end) sexual and gendered violence, putting a few perpetrators in prison does little to stop the many other perpetrators. It does nothing to change a culture that makes this harm imaginable, to hold the individual perpetrator accountable, to support their transformation, or to meet the needs of the survivors.\" When we spoke, Kaba told me, \"I am looking to abolish what I consider to be death-making institutions, which are policing, imprisonment, sentencing, and surveillance. And what I want is to basically build up another world that is rooted in collective wellness, safety, and investment in the things that would actually bring those things about.\"\n\nKaba is the daughter of West African immigrants who came to the United States in the sixties, her mother from Côte d'Ivoire and her father from Guinea. Her father completed graduate studies, in economics, at Columbia before accepting a job at the United Nations. Kaba, born in 1971, came of age in the racial tumult of nineteen-eighties New York City. She recalled \"going to school on the subway, and all the sudden seeing houseless people in the subway. . . . It had a lot to do with deinstitutionalization, as well as the crack epidemic, as well as the AIDS epidemic, as well as all these things piling onto each other at the same time.\"\n\nIn our conversation and in her book, she made note of the police killing of Michael Stewart as formative to her own political awakening. On September 15, 1983, Stewart, a twenty-five-year-old African-American artist, was arrested for graffitiing the subway. Transit police beat and hog-tied him; he never regained consciousness. Nearly two years later, an all-white jury acquitted six police officers accused of murdering Stewart. On October 29, 1984, the sixty-seven-year-old Eleanor Bumpurs was shot and killed by police who were assisting in her eviction from public housing in the Bronx. Bumpurs suffered from mental illness, claiming that Ronald Reagan had come through the walls of her home, and she had barricaded herself inside her apartment. As police broke through the front door, Bumpers, wielding a knife, was shot twice, in the hand and the chest. The cop who shot Bumpurs was eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges. Both cases received national attention and inspired grassroots organizing and protest. Kaba notes that, while she was drawn into action to protest the killing of Stewart, she was not compelled in the same way by the activism surrounding the killing of Bumpurs. She writes, \"I remember very clearly that she was killed. I remember that people were organizing against her killing. I don't remember organizing against it, because I thought very much that the killing of Black men was the main thing we were fighting to end. I didn't see myself so much as a woman or a girl. In terms of my own identity, my gender didn't figure in the way that my race did.\"\n\nThis had changed by the time Kaba left college and returned to New York City to work with survivors of domestic violence. She was befuddled that many of the women she was working with did not want to call the police on their partners. Kaba said, \"Then I started asking people questions like, 'Why don't you want to go to the police?' And people would look at me, like, 'What are you talking about? Why wouldn't I go to the cops? Do you not see who I am? The cops don't keep me safe.' And so I slowly came to consciousness.\" In her book, Kaba writes, \"What happens when you define policing as actually an entire system of harassment, violence, and surveillance that keeps oppressive gender and racial hierarchies in place? When that's your definition of policing, then your whole frame shifts. And it also forces you to stop talking about it as though it's an issue of individuals, forces you to focus on the systemic structural issues to be addressed in order for this to happen.\"\n\nThere is no definitive beginning point for prison-abolition politics, but it is clearly connected to a turn, beginning in the sixties, in American imprisonment, in which it went from a method, in part, of rehabilitation to one of control or punishment. During the civil-rights movement, police were the shock troops for the massive resistance of the white political establishment in the American South. By the mid-sixties, policing and the criminal-justice system were being retrofitted as a response to a growing insurgency in Black urban communities. By the seventies, they were being used to contain and control both Black radicals and Black prisoners. The scholar and activist Angela Y. Davis may be the best-known prison abolitionist in the United States today. But, in 1972, she was facing charges of kidnapping, murder, and conspiracy, after guns registered to her were used by the seventeen-year-old Jonathan Jackson, in a botched attempt to free his brother, the Black radical George Jackson, from Soledad prison.\n\nDavis had become a leader of George Jackson's defense committee and had developed a close relationship with him. As a result of their collaboration, and of Davis's experience of spending sixteen months in jail before her acquittal, she devoted her political energies to prisoners' rights and eventually to prison abolition. In an interview that she gave while awaiting the outcome of her trial, Davis said, \"We simply took it upon ourselves at first to defend George Jackson, John Clutchette, and Fleeta Drumgo\"-the radicals known as the Soledad Brothers. \"But we later realized that the question was much broader than that. It wasn't simply a matter of three individuals who were being subject to the repressive forces of the penal system. It was the system itself that had to be attacked. It was the system itself that had to be abolished.\"\n\nIn 1995, the radical theorist Mike Davis wrote a cover story for The Nation describing a new \"prison-industrial complex\" being established in California, with no pretense that the exponential growth of prisons was tied to the rise and fall of crime. Indeed, according to the scholar and activist Ruth Wilson Gilmore, in her pathbreaking book \" Golden Gulag: Prisons, Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition in Globalizing California ,\" even though the crime rate peaked in 1980, between 1984 and the early two-thousands, California \"completed twenty-three major new prisons,\" at a cost of two hundred and eighty to three hundred and fifty million dollars each. By contrast, the state had built only twelve prisons between 1852 and 1964. Bodies were necessary to justify the rapid growth of the prison sector, and the Crime Bill of 1994, along with California's three-strikes legislation, passed that same year, provided them. Gilmore writes that \"the California state prison population grew nearly 500 percent between 1982 and 2000.\" The three-strikes law, which mandated twenty-five-years-to-life sentences for a third felony, had an especially severe effect on Black and Latinx communities. Mike Davis reported that, during the first six months of prosecutions under the new law, \"African-Americans made up fifty-seven percent of the 'three strikes' filings in L.A. County,\" even though they made up only ten per cent of the state population. This was seventeen times higher than the rate at which whites were being charged under the new law, even though white men were responsible for \"at least sixty percent of all the rape, robberies, and assaults in the state.\"\n\nThe three-strikes law was an accelerant to what would come to be called \"mass incarceration,\" but it was also the makings of a new movement against prisons and against the means and methods by which they became populated-namely, policing. In 1997, in Berkeley, Davis, Gilmore, and others formed the organizing group Critical Resistance , which brought together activists, the formerly incarcerated, and academics to \"build an international movement to end the prison industrial complex by challenging the belief that caging and controlling people make us safe.\" Ten years later, Gilmore published \"Golden Gulag,\" which she describes as the culmination of research projects undertaken with Black mothers of incarcerated persons in California state prisons. She wrote, \"What we learned twice over was this: the laws had written into the penal code breathtakingly cruel twists in the meaning and practice of justice.\" This produced new questions, extending far beyond the passage of new laws. The mothers, along with Gilmore, asked, \"Why prisons? Why now? Why for so many people-especially people of color? And why were they located so far from prisoner's homes?\" In this sense, although academics have been important to formulating the movement's arguments, the journey toward abolition is not an academic or intellectual exercise. Instead, it has been gestated within the communities deeply scarred by the disappearing of sons and daughters by the state.\n\nBy the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, the cumulative, devastating effects of twenty years of increasing policing and incarceration-inaugurated by Reagan but abetted by the policies of the Clinton Administration-came into greater focus, as new conversations opened up about structural inequality in the United States. Michelle Alexander's book \" The New Jim Crow ,\" published in 2010, offered a breakthrough analysis of continued Black inequality as a product of years of policing and imprisonment in Black communities. Kaba identifies the failure to stop the execution of the Georgia death-row inmate Troy Davis, in 2011, as catalyzing the emergence of an abolitionist consciousness among what Elizabeth Alexander has described as the \"Trayvon Generation.\" Five months after Davis's execution, Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. Kaba noted that \"the call, when Trayvon Martin was killed, was to arrest and to prosecute and to convict Zimmerman.\" In 2014, after Michael Brown was killed, \"the push was to indict Darren Wilson, and for body cameras.\" Zimmerman was acquitted, and a grand jury failed to bring charges against Wilson. Kaba said, \"And, because so many of these young folks were actually mobilized in the organizing, they could see the futility of the demands that they were making and the limits of those demands, and wanted and were ready to hear something new.\"\n\nThat generation's maturation in the world of police reform became apparent last summer, when many young activists and organizers began to embrace a demand that funding for police departments be redistributed to other public agencies and institutions. The demand originated in Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed, and where the city council briefly committed to defunding the police department. But, Kaba said, it's important to note that local Black radical organizations-Black Visions Collective, Reclaim the Block, and MPD150-had been campaigning for years to divest from the police department and invest in community groups, battling the police over the city's budget. She explained, \"You've already got folks on the ground over there that have had two cycles of budget fights around defunding the police based on divestment. So the part of this people don't understand is the continuity of these ideas. They don't just come out of nowhere. People aren't just yelling stuff randomly. It got picked up nationally because people were, like, 'This makes sense.' \"\n\nAlthough the demand to defund the police may have had its specific origins in Minneapolis, Kaba understands that the growing curiosity about abolitionist politics is rooted in something much broader. She said, \"People are frustrated by the way that the welfare state has completely been defunded. People don't have what they need to survive. And yet the military and prisons keep getting more and more and more.\" Contrary to the beliefs of their critics, abolitionists are not impervious to the realities of crime and violence. But they have a fundamental understanding that crime is a manifestation of social deprivation and the reverberating effects of racial discrimination, which locks poor and working-class communities of color out of schooling, meaningful jobs, and other means to keep up with the ever-escalating costs of life in the United States. These problems are not solved by armed agents of the state or by prisons, which sow the seeds of more poverty and alienation, while absorbing billions of dollars that might otherwise be spent on public welfare. The police and prisons aren't solving these problems: they are a part of the problem.\n\nAt its core, abolitionist politics are inspired by the necessity for what Martin Luther King, Jr., described as the \"radical reconstruction\" of the entirety of U.S. society. They intend to promote systemic thinking instead of our society's obsession with \"personal responsibility.\" Derek Chauvin's conviction was premised on the idea that he was personally responsible for George Floyd's murder. The emphasis on his accountability distracts from a system of policing that administered his continued employment, even though eighteen complaints had been lodged against him during his nineteen-year career. Moreover, Chauvin was a field-training officer , who had trained two of the other officers who will face trial for participating in Floyd's murder. Chauvin may be held to account for the killing, but neither the Minneapolis Police Department nor the elected officials charged with overseeing the M.P.D. will be held to account for allowing someone like Chauvin to be on the streets, let alone responsible for training others.\n\nTo approach harm systemically is to imagine that, if people's most critical needs were met, the tensions that arise from deprivation and poverty could be mitigated. And when harm still occurs, because human beings have the propensity to hurt one another, nonlethal responses could attend to it-and also to the reasons for it. To be sure, these are lofty aspirations, but they are no more unrealistic than believing that another study, exposé, commission, firing, or police trial is capable of meeting the desire for change that, last summer, compelled tens of millions of ordinary people to pour into the streets. Indeed, the trial of Derek Chauvin could not even conclude before a Black man was killed at a traffic stop.\n\nOur current criminal-justice system is rooted in the assumption that millions of people require policing, surveillance, containment, prison. It is a dark view of humanity. By contrast, Kaba and others in this emergent movement fervently believe in the capacity of people to change in changed conditions. That is the optimism at the heart of the abolitionist project. As Kaba insists in her book, \"The reason I'm struggling through all of this is because I'm a deeply, profoundly hopeful person. Because I know that human beings, with all of our foibles and all the things that are failing, have the capacity to do amazingly beautiful things, too. That gives me the hope to feel like we will, when necessary, do what we need to do.\" Abolition is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Even the guiding lights of the movement are embedded in campaigns for short-term reforms that make a difference in daily life. For Kaba, that has meant raising funds for mutual aid during the pandemic and campaigning for reparations in Chicago. For Gilmore, it has meant working with incarcerated people and their families to challenge the building of prisons across California. For Angela Davis, it has meant lending her voice to movements for civil and human rights, from Ferguson to Palestine. The point is to work in solidarity with others toward the world as they wish for it to be. \"Hope is a discipline,\" Kaba writes. \"We must practice it daily.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Police Reform: Does Anything Work?\n\nAfter the riots in Baltimore, and then the sudden, unexpected criminal charges against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake asked the United States Department of Justice to conduct an audit of her police department and make recommendations for reform. \"We all know that Baltimore continues to have a fractured relationship between the police and the community,\" Rawlings-Blake said . \"I'm willing to do what it takes to reform my department.\"\n\nThe request for help from Washington, though, amounted to an implicit admission that Rawlings-Blake did not know what that reform should look like. The mayor of Baltimore, like mayors in most cities, appoints the police commissioner, and Rawlings-Blake named the current chief, Anthony Batts, in 2012. The Justice Department often steps in when the political leadership of a city proves unable or unwilling to address problems with the local police; that's what happened in Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of Michael Brown. But Rawlings-Blake isn't resistant to scrutiny; to the contrary, she invites it. Her problem is that she appears to have little idea what to do.\n\nRawlings-Blake's perplexity may seem peculiar-aren't mayors supposed to know how to address the problems in their own cities?-but her dilemma may be more understandable than it at first appears. The deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police, beginning with Brown, last August, have brought widespread attention to the issue of race relations in law enforcement. This focus has not generated any real consensus on what would be appropriate solutions. Rather, the current crisis in criminal justice has proved, in significant part, to be a vehicle for the exercise of preëxisting prejudices.\n\nConsider the claim that family breakdown, absent fathers, and lack of parental discipline are to blame for both violence within the black community and conflicts with police. This constellation of issues tends to be cited by conservatives. Toya Graham, the Baltimore mother who was caught on video smacking her sixteen-year-old son, who appeared to be joining the rioting, briefly became a folk hero . Rupert Murdoch's New York Post saluted Graham in an editorial: \"If hauling your son out of a violent confrontation with police is abuse, we need more abusive parents. In days of yore, everyone would've seen Graham's actions as what they were: old-fashioned discipline.\" It is true that children who grow up in intact homes tend to have better chances in life than those who do not. But one can recognize the problem of broken families (Graham is raising six children as a single parent) without endorsing a mother's attack on her son.\n\nMoreover, conservatives rarely explain how intact families, valuable as they are, can provide jobs in communities like Baltimore, where about thirty-seven per cent of black men are unemployed, compared with ten per cent of white men. Other cities report similar data , and liberals often use it to counter claims that black families are at issue. Conservatives push culture, liberals stress economics, and neither is entirely wrong-or right.\n\nFollowing Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, community policing emerged as a popular panacea. There is a mismatch in Ferguson between the racial makeup of its police force (overwhelmingly white) and its population (overwhelmingly black). The death of a young black man at the hands of a white officer seemed like a tragic outgrowth of this misalliance. But Freddie Gray died at the hands of a police force that is nearly as integrated as the city of Baltimore, and that is headed by an African-American commissioner. Of the officers charged in his death, three are black and three are white. Again, a police force that looks like the city it patrols is a good idea, but hardly a guarantee of racial peace or skillful law enforcement.\n\nHillary Clinton contributed to the debate by calling for all police officers to wear body cameras, which would, in theory, resolve ambiguities about encounters with the public. But the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island, at the hands of the New York City Police Department, was captured on video-which did not conclusively resolve the question of whether the police acted unlawfully.\n\nI discovered the limits of admirable attempts to address racial disparities in law enforcement when I went to Milwaukee earlier this year, to look at the innovative work being done by the local district attorney, John Chisholm. ( I wrote about Chisholm in the magazine.) After Chisholm took office, in 2007, he allowed a research and policy group to examine the racial implications of his work. They found that he was prosecuting African-Americans more harshly than whites for nonviolent drug offenses. In response, Chisholm adopted policies that sharply restricted criminal prosecution for nonviolent drug offenses; this, of course, did away with most racial disparities in these areas. But violent crime remains concentrated in Milwaukee's heavily African-American north side, and Chisholm has continued to prosecute those cases, in which both the defendants and the victims are overwhelmingly black. So there has been little change in the over-all ratio of black-to-white prosecutions.\n\nThere are other initiatives, too, that governments can undertake to address the deep hostility between African-American communities and police departments. Many have some value. But will any of them make a dramatic difference in the underlying problems? So far, alas, it seems that the answer is no.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Tulsa's Hopeful Anger\n\nWhenever a black man dies at the hands of police, Tiffany Crutcher must bear witness. This is what people seem to think. She does not seek out the initial headlines hesitant to assign blame, the cries for transparency on social media, the eventual gruesome video evidence. They flood her in-boxes anyway, as her friends and online followers assume she will know how to make sense of things. As if she has peered beyond the veil and returned with a wisdom that she can share at a time of crisis. The torrent began anew on Tuesday, May 26th, when people began sending her articles about George Floyd .\n\nCrutcher, a physical therapist turned criminal-justice-reform activist, was on her sofa in Tulsa, Oklahoma, working from home, owing to COVID -19. She saw a picture of a police officer with his knee on Floyd's neck. She felt nauseated. She watched a short video clip of Floyd calling out for his mother as the life was choked out of him. She felt angry. Over the next few days, a cruel cocktail of emotions familiar to far too many black people-rage, fear, sadness-made it difficult for her to sleep.\n\nBut there was work to be done, and certain expectations for how to respond properly. Over the last several years, as cell-phone videos have documented with increased frequency the killings of unarmed black people, Americans have developed an intuitive understanding of the prescribed boundaries of outrage. On Facebook, Crutcher encouraged people to call leaders in Minneapolis and demand justice for Floyd. She used all the familiar hashtags: #blacklivesmatter, #icantbreathe, #policereformNOW. At a May 28th press conference organized by black community leaders, at a North Tulsa church, she spoke with a halting exhaustion that carried the weight of much more than the past few days' events. \"Here we are, yet again, angry and devastated at the killing of another unarmed black man by law enforcement,\" she said, in front of a phalanx of impassive cameras. \"The compounded trauma that my family, that our community, that we endure is real.\"\n\nCrutcher had exchanged so many words over the years in city-council meetings, social-media posts, town halls, and press conferences. \"Is this going to help anything?\" she recalls thinking that day. \"They're not hearing us.\" In the aftermath of Floyd's death, she felt hopeless, pantomiming solutions that didn't seem to be moving the criminal-justice system far enough or fast enough. And, even as her allies made similar comments in the lobby of the church, denouncing racism and calling for change, her pain was different. Her urgency would be, too. \"It was almost as if Terence had died all over again,\" she told me.\n\nTerence Crutcher loved to sing. When he and Tiffany, his twin sister, were children, they developed a mutual love of music. She played the viola and he played the cello. The pair celebrated their fortieth birthday, in August of 2016, with a phone call discussing Terence's plans to return to school and one day open a music-production studio. They spoke of their hopes and dreams for the second half of their lives.\n\nOne month later, on the evening of September 16th, Terence's car was left idling in the middle of a North Tulsa road. He had recently left Tulsa Community College, where he was enrolled in a music-appreciation class. Terence abandoned the vehicle and was behaving erratically, according to eyewitness accounts. One witness said that, when his wife saw a distressed man walking down the road, she wanted to help the man, because he appeared to be in need of medical attention. But the witness said that he was afraid to approach Terence. Instead, at least two observers on the scene called 911. Terence's next encounter was with a Tulsa Police Department officer named Betty Shelby.\n\nAerial footage from a police helicopter showed Terence walking toward his vehicle with his hands up as Shelby walked behind him, gun drawn. \"That looks like a bad dude,\" the helicopter's pilot, Michael Richert, said in the video clip. \"Could be on something.\" Three more officers arrived at the scene. Shelby and two other officers pointed weapons at Terence, and he walked back toward his car with his hands up . As Terence stood by the driver-side door of his vehicle, Shelby fired a shot into his chest, causing him to crumple to the ground. She would later claim that Terence was reaching into his car window, though lawyers for the Crutcher family said the window was closed. Terence was unarmed, and police found no weapons in his vehicle. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital that night.\n\nShelby was arrested six days after killing Terence, and charged with first-degree manslaughter. She chose to stage an unusually public defense. In an interview with \" 60 Minutes \" before her trial, Shelby said that Terence caused his own death. \"I saw a threat, and I used the force I felt necessary to stop a threat,\" she said. Tiffany Crutcher, who had always shared in her twin brother's pain, became Terence's public advocate. \"She wasn't called to the scene because Terence was committing a crime,\" Crutcher said, of Shelby. \"She just noticed a car in the middle of the road, and the outcome was my brother was murdered.\"\n\nShelby's legal defense built on the arguments she had laid out on \"60 Minutes.\" At her trial, the following month, she said that she had feared for her life because of Terence's behavior. She said that Terence had refused to comply with her repeated orders to stop and get on his knees. While she described him as \"very big\" and looking like a \"zombie,\" she overestimated his height by three inches and his weight by forty-six pounds. Defense lawyers suggested that Terence had been dangerous in the past, as well as on the night he was shot by Shelby. They outlined portions of his criminal record during the trial, and hinged much of their argument on a toxicology report that revealed that PCP, a hallucinogenic drug, had been in Terence's system at the time of his death. No one claimed that Terence had behaved in an aggressive or violent manner. The perceived threat of violence, Shelby and her lawyers said, was enough.\n\nA jury consisting of nine white people and three black people agreed. Shelby was acquitted of all charges on May 17th, 2017, and whisked out of the courtroom within moments of the announcement of the verdict. (After resigning from the Tulsa Police Department, she was hired by the Rogers County Sheriff's Office, and taught a class to other officers on \"surviving the aftermath\" of shooting someone while in uniform.) Crutcher, standing with her father before the news cameras in the courthouse, was left to stew in the aftermath of the verdict. Her grief quickly crystallized into conviction. \"I'm going to make sure that I don't rest until we get reform for this police department in Tulsa, Oklahoma,\" she said.\n\nIt was a monumental task. The relationship between Tulsa police and the black residents they are bound to protect was poisoned nearly a hundred years ago, in 1921, when white rioters burned down the thriving black neighborhood of Greenwood, which had become known as Black Wall Street because of its success. Whites destroyed more than a thousand homes and killed as many as three hundred residents. Many of the vandals were deputized by police, and they herded black Tulsans into internment camps, where the detainees were held by armed guards for as long as two weeks. None of the perpetrators faced serious criminal prosecution. For decades afterward, Tulsa police followed an unspoken rule that white cops would not follow African-American suspects across the railroad tracks and into North Tulsa, which is predominantly black. Such policies extended nearly into the twenty-first century, with black officers claiming, in a 1994 lawsuit, that they were often denied backup from their white colleagues and were routinely deprived of raises and promotions.  (The suit was settled in 2002, with the department agreeing to multiple reforms.)\n\nBut, beyond the calluses of history, Terence's murder was characterized by the wounds of the current moment. Shortly before he was killed, Tulsa-area officers had shot two other unarmed black men. In 2014, an off-duty Tulsa Police Department officer drove to the home of Jeremy Lake, his daughter's black boyfriend, and shot him twice, killing him. In 2015, a Tulsa County volunteer sheriff's deputy accidentally fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing a fleeing suspect, Eric Harris. Both officers were found guilty of manslaughter, though Lake's killer was only convicted after three mistrials. A study released by the city of Tulsa and the Rockefeller Foundation in 2018, called the Equality Indicators Report, found that black residents were more than twice as likely as white ones to experience the use of force from police officers.\n\nTiffany hoped to build a coalition of residents who could reverse these trends and halt the tragedies. In 2017, she formed the Terence Crutcher Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for criminal-justice reform and provides scholarships for students who are interested in the arts. \"What Dr. Crutcher does incredibly well is she brings people from all perspectives and backgrounds to the table,\" Greg Robinson, a local community organizer and member of the Terence Crutcher Foundation's board, told me. Robinson recalled meeting Crutcher for the first time over Budweisers and beef brisket, at a gathering of community activists that she had convened several months after Shelby's acquittal. \"As she says, we're her volunteer army.\"\n\nIn May of 2018, the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund, the Terence Crutcher Foundation, and a  variety of community leaders issued a letter to the mayor of Tulsa, G.T. Bynum, demanding a wide range of police reforms. Among the most urgent was the establishment of an independent agency to investigate lethal encounters with police, commonly known as an office of the independent monitor. Such an agency would be able to immediately inspect a crime scene where an officer fired a weapon, reëxamine evidence and witnesses, and recommend discipline for police misconduct.\n\nThe independent monitor in Denver, Colorado, which was created in 2004, has all of those powers. That city's office is considered one of the most powerful in the nation, and it has a staff of twelve, which includes attorneys, policy analysts, and community-outreach managers. In 2017, the Denver monitor challenged its police force's lax use-of-force standards, prompting a more stringent policy, and the office has successfully advocated for the suspension of officers who inappropriately fired their weapons. \"Any time a Denver officer fires his or her weapon, I get called by dispatch, just like the police command gets called,\" Nick Mitchell, an attorney who serves as Denver's lead independent monitor, told me. \"We have access to all of the files and materials and interviews of internal affairs. We can walk in there and pick up any investigation.\"\n\nThere are eighteen thousand police departments in the United States, but only a hundred and sixty-six of them, or less than one per cent, have oversight agencies. Among the few such agencies that exist, only twenty per cent can conduct independent investigations of police conduct, and even fewer can do so immediately after the incident. Indiana University researchers studying the impact of civilian oversight found that the presence of a monitor with investigative powers reduces racial disparities in police homicides of citizens by six per cent per year. Nationally, over the last five years, unarmed blacks were four times as likely to be shot and killed by police as unarmed whites.\n\nCrutcher imagined how such a monitor might have changed the outcome of the Shelby investigation. Shelby was not interviewed until three days after the shooting, and was advised by a superior not to speak to investigators until she retained a lawyer. She was allowed to view a video of the shooting before being interviewed by police. Such actions would have been discouraged in Denver, according to Mitchell. \"It's not ideal,\" he told me, of the sequence of events in that investigation. \"I want people's native recollections of what they remember unaltered by extraneous information.\"\n\nBynum, Tulsa's mayor, has been receptive to police reform. The forty-two-year-old conservative leader has styled himself as a policy wonk who's too data-driven to play politics-in 2017, he gave a TED talk entitled \"A Republican Mayor's Plan to Replace Partisanship with Policy.\" Two weeks after taking office, in 2016, Bynum established the Tulsa Commission on Community Policing, comprising city-council members, police officials, and local residents. The commission issued seventy-seven recommendations to improve policing in the city, such as instituting a crisis-intervention team to deal with mentally ill residents and requiring implicit bias training for all officers. Establishing an agency to investigate police wasn't among the recommendations. In January of 2019, Bynum and his staff visited Denver's office of the independent monitor to learn more about implementation strategies and speak to staffers, community activists, and the local police chief. Later that month, Bynum announced that Tulsa would have its own independent monitor, though the precise investigative powers of Tulsa's version were not disclosed.\n\nWithin days, the Tulsa Fraternal Order of Police, the city's police union, issued a letter to Bynum threatening to sue the city if an independent monitor were established without first negotiating with them. Such tactics are common among police unions opposed to outside oversight. \"It's not what the community's asking for. It's what you can negotiate with these unions, which put a lot of restrictions on it,\" Susan Hutson, the president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, told me. \"Access to data, access to their officers, all the things that make oversight independent.\"\n\nMonths passed as the city searched for a solution that would satisfy community leaders and not invite legal action from the police union. When details of the monitor's role finally emerged, as a city-council ordinance, in the summer of 2019, the office was not as independent as Tiffany Crutcher and other activists had hoped. Instead of being an investigator, like Mitchell, Denver's lead monitor, who could roam a crime scene, question police, and launch investigations at the public's behest, the Tulsa monitor would act more like an auditor, reviewing internal-affairs investigations after the fact and offering policy recommendations. The mayor later said that he  hoped to increase the monitor's power through collective bargaining with the police union. Crutcher called the proposed new post toothless. \"It was watered down, it didn't have any power, and it wouldn't prevent what happened to Terence from happening again,\" she said. She and other activists pulled their support for the bill and convinced some city-council members to, as well, forcing the mayor to withdraw it.\n\nIn March of this year, city leaders tried a different tack, with the councillor Vanessa Hall-Harper proposing an ordinance that would put the establishment of a monitor up to a public vote in August. While the measure initially had the support of a majority of the council, most members ended up voting against it, citing opposition from their constituents. \"To have a punitive or corrective authority that manages something that they don't fully understand, I think, is dangerous,\" the councillor Ben Kimbro told the Tulsa World . Behind the scenes, the Fraternal Order of Police mobilized Tulsa residents to send thousands of e-mails and make phone calls to city-council members-and even to show up at their houses-in opposition to the measure, the union chairman, Jerad Lindsey, said on a recent podcast.\n\nThree and a half years after Terence Crutcher's death, Tulsa's police department continued to police itself. And while the fight for change had come to consume Tiffany's life-she moved from Montgomery, Alabama, back to Tulsa, to pursue activism full-time, in December of 2018-for most Tulsans, it played out quietly, in newspaper articles that they didn't read and city-council meetings they didn't attend. Among those who did engage, contention over what to do about police seemed to be growing, rather than reaching a consensus, in a city that is seventy per cent white, thirteen per cent Hispanic, and ten per cent African-American. Even in one of the reddest states in America, though, the death of George Floyd would change all of that. \"People automatically assume that all police officers are good, maybe the victim did something wrong,\" Crutcher told me. \"They toil, they go back and forth between what's right and what's wrong and what was or what wasn't. But, this time, I think the light bulb finally came on.\"\n\nCrutcher was quiet as the Tulsa protest began, on May 30th. An unexpectedly large crowd of several hundred had convened in Brookside, a posh leisure district filled with upscale restaurants and boutiques, south of downtown Tulsa. Protesters were initially contained to the sidewalks, but they eventually streamed out onto the streets and staged a \"die-in\" in front of an Urban Outfitters store. They chanted Terence Crutcher's name as police peered down from the roof of a popular sports bar. Crutcher paced among the bodies splayed out on the sweltering asphalt, recording everything with her phone for Facebook Live. She spoke only briefly at the start of the march, asking the crowd to acknowledge Terence's three daughters, who were accompanying her and wearing \"#Justice 4 Crutch\" T-shirts. Then she directed everyone to start marching.\n\nThe crowd was energized, rapidly growing, and surprisingly white. People brandished signs bearing the jolts of moral clarity that have suddenly, strangely, been accepted by a wide audience: \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"White Silence Is Violence,\" \"Terence Crutcher Should Be Alive!\" Many people told me that they were attending their first-ever protest. A twenty-year-old black Tulsa native named Josiah, who declined to give his last name, pointed down the road, toward a neighborhood in midtown Tulsa, where he grew up. He said that when he was sixteen, while he was out jogging there, police officers stopped him and wanted to know where he lived. \"It has been Ahmaud Arbery. It has been Eric Garner. It has been George Floyd,\" Josiah said. \"It could be you, it could be me.\"\n\nFarther ahead in the procession, Greg Robinson, the organizer and Terence Crutcher Foundation board member, wielded a bullhorn like a drum major's mace. As protesters staged another die-in, at an intersection next to a QuikTrip gas station, Robinson turned from chanting to orating. \"Dr. Tiffany Crutcher and the Crutcher family has done everything they could for this city! They've talked to the mayor! They've researched for the mayor! They've sung for the mayor! They've laid Terence Crutcher's bloody clothes down at City Hall for the mayor! And what were they asking for?\"\n\nThe crowd roared back, \"Justice!\"\n\n\"And yet justice has still not been served.\"\n\nWith the crowd quiet and forming a natural circle around the die-in, Robinson continued: \"We have four simple demands.\" He listed them, one by one. They wanted an independent monitor, which Tiffany Crutcher and a cadre of community leaders had first called for in 2018. They wanted some of the city budget to be divested from the Tulsa Police Department and invested in mental-health services. They wanted the city to settle pending litigation with the Crutcher family, which filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Tulsa in 2018. And they wanted the mayor to cancel the city's contract with \"Live PD,\" a \"Cops\"-like reality show on A&E, which shadows police officers performing arrests and has been decried as racist by critics.\n\nRobinson worked on the Presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton before returning to Tulsa, after Terence Crutcher was killed. He told me that he learned that politics and community organizing were two sides of the same coin. In both cases, he has to gather people around a common cause, channel their emotion into action, and provide clear steps toward enacting change. \"Both are motivated a lot of times by a hopeful anger,\" Robinson told me later. \"Anybody can get somebody to protest, but it's going from the protest to the policy side that requires the strategy and the organization.\"\n\nAs the demonstration swelled to more than a thousand people, Crutcher noticed that police had successfully guessed the route of the march and diverted traffic as the protesters walked. They were, in essence, serving as escorts. She thought of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s Albany Movement, of the early nineteen-sixties, in which an effort to gain attention for the black struggle for desegregation in Georgia was thwarted because the town of Albany's police chief savvily chose not to brutalize black protesters while cameras were present. \"Let's take the highway,\" she said, on her live stream. \"We need the mayor to hear us.\"\n\nProtesters streamed onto the exit ramp of Interstate 44, darting between idling vehicles and scrambling over a concrete overpass. One protester was injured as a truck accelerated along the left-shoulder lane and struck him. But soon enough protesters had overtaken both sides of the highway. It would remain closed for at least half an hour. Standing near the interstate median, Robinson repeated the group's demands on his bullhorn as Crutcher circled him with her phone, continuing to broadcast the demonstration live. \"It's not what you say, it's what you keep saying,\" Crutcher told me later. \"People who are influencers could go back when they left the protest to their centers of influence, to their churches, to their friends, to their families, to their kitchen tables, to discuss these demands and figure out if it makes sense to them and their respective communities.\"\n\nLater, the protesters marched toward the mayor's house, with hundreds chanting \"Black Lives Matter!\" as they passed leafy mansions tucked behind stone walls. Under the direction of police, Bynum, along with his wife and children, had left his house when he found out marchers were headed in their direction. In a Facebook post that Saturday night, he wrote, \"Change occurs in Tulsa through collaboration, deliberation and thoughtful action - not through attempts at intimidation.\" (Bynum did not respond to a request for an interview.)\n\nThe Saturday march, unlike many that unfolded around the country that weekend, did not end with aggression by police, or looting, or vandalism. It ended with Crutcher standing before the crowd back at Brookside, her voice louder than it had been in any public setting since George Floyd's death. \"I need y'all to do just one more chant for me. Just one more chant for the ancestors.\"\n\nThe call and response was deafening.\n\n\"Justice for Greenwood!\"\n\n\"Justice for Crutch!\"\n\n\"Reparations Now!\"\n\nIf Tulsa seemed slow to react to Floyd's death initially, everything lurched into fast-forward after the Saturday protest. An even larger demonstration on Sunday attracted a young, lively crowd, though it ended with police firing pepper-spray balls on protesters who refused to leave the darkened streets. The following Monday, the mayor agreed to meet with Crutcher and other activists in an impromptu gathering at City Hall. Part candid discussion, part strategic negotiation, the meeting ended with Bynum agreeing to back another city-council push for an independent monitor, enter into collective bargaining with the police union to strengthen the monitor's role, and engage in arbitration with the union if it refused to accept civilian oversight.  He also agreed to end the city's contract with the television show \"Live PD.\" For Crutcher and Robinson, who led the negotiations, it was a breakthrough that proved protesting worked, but so did dialogue. \"What happened today-work, three hours sitting in a room, two sides, coming together to find a middle ground to move our city forward-is what this is about,\" Robinson said as he stood next to Bynum and Crutcher.\n\nWhen I met with Crutcher three days later, in a park dedicated to victims of the 1921 massacre, she seemed cautiously optimistic about the prospects of coöperating with the mayor. Already, the police union had come out against the independent-monitor idea again, and the \"Live PD\" cancellation had caused a backlash in conservative circles. \"Getting some agreements established, those are small victories,\" she said, wearing a salmon-colored sweatshirt that said \"Support Black Colleges.\" \"But that's just the battle. We haven't won the war just yet.\"\n\nHer optimism was short-lived. The following Sunday, Crutcher found herself once again defending her brother on national television. In a \"CBS Morning News\" segment on Tulsa's history of racial violence, Mayor Bynum said he didn't believe that Betty Shelby's killing of Terence Crutcher had anything to do with the fact that Terence was black. \"It is more about the really insidious nature of drug utilization than it is about race,\" the mayor said. Crutcher was also interviewed for the segment, but she focussed on policy. \"The use-of-force standard has to be changed,\" she said. \"Then, he could then finally rest in peace.\"\n\nLater, Crutcher told me that the mayor's comments-especially coming after the progress that had been made in their Monday meeting-felt like one of the toughest setbacks she had experienced in her three years as a police-reform advocate. She has always been in a delicate dance with the city, advocating for broad policy reforms even as she seeks a very personal legal remedy. But she sees the two causes as linked, and the outpouring of local frustration with the mayor's comments indicated that many Tulsans did, too. \"I feel like he ripped the Band-Aid off and my community is bleeding yet again,\" Crutcher said. On June 10th, Bynum walked back his comments in another Facebook post, calling them dumb and simplistic. \"I did an interview over the weekend that hurt a lot of good people and has caused a lot of my allies in our work to address racial disparity to question my real commitment,\" he wrote. \"I'm sorry for letting people down in a critical moment.\"\n\nDays later, the actions of three Tulsa police officers reignited tensions. On June 8th, Travis Yates, a major in the Tulsa Police Department, said, on a local conservative radio show, \"We're shooting African-Americans about twenty-four per cent less than we probably ought to be, based on the crimes being committed,\" citing specious research. The major's comments sparked condemnation from the mayor and the Black Officers Coalition. That same day, Tulsa Police released body-cam footage of two officers accosting a pair of black teen-agers and forcing them to the ground, ostensibly for jaywalking. That encounter is under internal investigation. Since Tulsa still has no independent monitor, the exact nature of the investigation will remain opaque.\n\nOn June 10th, President Donald Trump announced that he would be holding his first rally since March in Tulsa, on Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the date in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. (He later moved the date of the rally back a day, to June 20th.) Though Tulsa's large annual Juneteenth celebration had been cancelled, due to coronavirus concerns, leaders in the black community quickly revived it and are now planning an \"I, Too, Am America\" rally, in the heart of Black Wall Street. The Terence Crutcher Foundation is among the event's sponsors. \"We don't want him in our city, and we're not honored to have him,\" Crutcher said in an interview on MSNBC. The Trump rally marks yet another contrast between Crutcher and Mayor Bynum, who wrote on Facebook, \"‪In Tulsa, we protect the free and peaceful exchange of ideas. We did it during the last two weeks of protests, and we will do it during the President's visit to Tulsa next week.\"\n\nBy the time Trump announced his intentions, Crutcher and Robinson had already decided to take political matters in the city into their own hands. After a long and anxious few days  spent trying to determine the appropriate way to respond to all that had happened in Tulsa since George Floyd was killed-really, since Terence Crutcher was killed-they met at the Tulsa County Election Board, on the blustery morning of June 10th. Robinson had exchanged his \"Legalize Being Black\" T-shirt for a charcoal suit. Crutcher wielded a fifty-dollar check, made out to the city of Tulsa, rather than a bullhorn. The pair announced that Robinson would be running for mayor, and Crutcher would be his senior campaign adviser.\n\nAt age thirty, Robinson could be the youngest mayor in Tulsa's history, and the first black one. \"I have to tell you that I'm scared,\" he said, at the start of his speech announcing his candidacy. \"I'm scared to stand up and say this is what the time has called for, and that I'm the person that's called for it. But what I'm more scared of is continuing to live in a city where we're not doing right by all of the citizens of Tulsa.\" Crutcher rubbed Robinson's shoulder as he spoke.\n\nThe decision to run for mayor had come at the last minute. Even that morning, the two had exchanged text messages questioning whether to go through with it. But Robinson tried to put the moment in context for the small gaggle of reporters who had gathered. He said that he was a soldier in a fight bigger than himself. \"It's not about me,\" he said. \"The time has passed to be of the opinion that government cannot function for us. We are citizens, too. All of us are citizens of Tulsa. And all of us have the right to participate.\"\n\nCrutcher nodded in quiet agreement. If Robinson hadn't been able or willing to run, she would have run herself. \"This is really a form of protest for us,\" she told me.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Black Body: Rereading James Baldwin's \"Stranger in the Village\"\n\nThen the bus began driving into clouds, and between one cloud and the next we caught glimpses of the town below. It was suppertime and the town was a constellation of yellow points. We arrived thirty minutes after leaving that town, which was called Leuk. The train to Leuk had come in from Visp, the train from Visp had come from Bern, and the train before that was from Zurich, from which I had started out in the afternoon. Three trains, a bus, and a short stroll, all of it through beautiful country, and then we reached Leukerbad in darkness. So Leukerbad, not far in terms of absolute distance, was not all that easy to get to. August 2, 2014: it was James Baldwin's birthday. Were he alive, he would be turning ninety. He is one of those people just on the cusp of escaping the contemporary and slipping into the historical-John Coltrane would have turned eighty-eight this year; Martin Luther King, Jr., would have turned eighty-five-people who could still be with us but who feel, at times, very far away, as though they lived centuries ago.\n\nJames Baldwin left Paris and came to Leukerbad for the first time in 1951. His lover Lucien Happersberger's family had a chalet in a village up in the mountains. And so Baldwin, who was depressed and distracted at the time, went, and the village (which is also called Loèche-les-Bains) proved to be a refuge for him. His first trip was in the summer, and lasted two weeks. Then he returned, to his own surprise, for two more winters. His first novel, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain,\" found its final form here. He had struggled with the book for eight years, and he finally finished it in this unlikely retreat. He wrote something else, too, an essay called \"Stranger in the Village\"; it was this essay, even more than the novel, that brought me to Leukerbad.\n\n\"Stranger in the Village\" first appeared in Harper's Magazine in 1953, and then in the essay collection \"Notes of a Native Son,\" in 1955. It recounts the experience of being black in an all-white village. It begins with a sense of an extreme journey, like Charles Darwin's in the Galápagos or Tété-Michel Kpomassie's in Greenland. But then it opens out into other concerns and into a different voice, swivelling to look at the American racial situation in the nineteen-fifties. The part of the essay that focusses on the Swiss village is both bemused and sorrowful. Baldwin is alert to the absurdity of being a writer from New York who is considered in some way inferior by Swiss villagers, many of whom have never travelled. But, later in the essay, when he writes about race in America, he is not at all bemused. He is angry and prophetic, writing with a hard clarity and carried along by a precipitous eloquence.\n\nI took a room at the Hotel Mercure Bristol the night I arrived. I opened the windows to a dark view, but I knew that in the darkness loomed the Daubenhorn mountain. I ran a hot bath and lay neck-deep in the water with my old paperback copy of \"Notes of a Native Son.\" The tinny sound from my laptop was Bessie Smith singing \"I'm Wild About That Thing,\" a filthy blues number and a masterpiece of plausible deniability: \"Don't hold it baby when I cry / Give me every bit of it, else I'd die / I'm wild about that thing.\" She could be singing about a trombone. And it was there in the bath, with his words and her voice, that I had my body-double moment: here I was in Leukerbad, with Bessie Smith singing across the years from 1929; and I am black like him; and I am slender; and have a gap in my front teeth; and am not especially tall (no, write it: short); and am cool on the page and animated in person, except when it is the other way around; and I was once a fervid teen-age preacher (Baldwin: \"Nothing that has happened to me since equals the power and the glory that I sometimes felt when, in the middle of a sermon, I knew that I was somehow, by some miracle, really carrying, as they said, 'the Word'-when the church and I were one\"); and I, too, left the church; and I call New York home even when not living there; and feel myself in all places, from New York City to rural Switzerland, the custodian of a black body, and have to find the language for all of what that means to me and to the people who look at me. The ancestor had briefly taken possession of the descendant. It was a moment of identification, and in the days that followed that moment was a guide.\n\n\"From all available evidence no black man had ever set foot in this tiny Swiss village before I came,\" Baldwin wrote. But the village has grown considerably since his visits, more than sixty years ago. They've seen blacks now; I wasn't a remarkable sight. There were a few glances at the hotel when I was checking in, and in the fine restaurant just up the road, but there are always glances. There are glances in Zurich, where I am spending the summer, and there are glances in New York City, which has been my home for fourteen years. There are glances all over Europe and in India, and anywhere I go outside Africa. The test is how long the glances last, whether they become stares, with what intent they occur, whether they contain any degree of hostility or mockery, and to what extent connections, money, or mode of dress shield me in these situations. To be a stranger is to be looked at, but to be black is to be looked at especially. (\"The children shout Neger! Neger! as I walk along the streets.\") Leukerbad has changed, but in which way? There were, in fact, no bands of children on the street, and few children anywhere at all. Presumably the children of Leukerbad, like children the world over, were indoors, frowning over computer games, checking Facebook, or watching music videos. Perhaps some of the older folks I saw in the streets were once the very children who had been so surprised by the sight of Baldwin, and about whom, in the essay, he struggles to take a reasonable tone: \"In all of this, in which it must be conceded that there was the charm of genuine wonder and in which there was certainly no element of intentional unkindness, there was yet no suggestion that I was human: I was simply a living wonder.\" But now the children or grandchildren of those children are connected to the world in a different way. Maybe some xenophobia or racism are part of their lives, but part of their lives, too, are Beyoncé, Drake, and Meek Mill, the music I hear pulsing from Swiss clubs on Friday nights.\n\nBaldwin had to bring his records with him in the fifties, like a secret stash of medicine, and he had to haul his phonograph up to Leukerbad, so that the sound of the American blues could keep him connected to a Harlem of the spirit. I listened to some of the same music while I was there, as a way of being with him: Bessie Smith singing \"I Need A Little Sugar In My Bowl\" (\"I need a little sugar in my bowl / I need a little hot dog on my roll\"), Fats Waller singing \"Your Feet's Too Big.\" I listened to my own playlist as well: Bettye Swann, Billie Holiday, Jean Wells, \"Coltrane Plays the Blues,\" the Physics, Childish Gambino. The music you travel with helps you to create your own internal weather. But the world participates, too: when I sat down to lunch at the Römerhof restaurant one afternoon-that day, all the customers and staff were white-the music playing overhead was Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody.\" History is now and black America.\n\nAt dinner, at a pizzeria, there were glances. A table of British tourists stared at me. But the waitress was part black, and at the hotel one of the staff members at the spa was an older black man. \"People are trapped in history, and history is trapped in them,\" Baldwin wrote. But it is also true that the little pieces of history move around at a tremendous speed, settling with a not-always-clear logic, and rarely settling for long. And perhaps more interesting than my not being the only black person in the village is the plain fact that many of the other people I saw were also foreigners. This was the biggest change of all. If, back then, the village had a pious and convalescent air about it, the feel of \"a lesser Lourdes,\" it is much busier now, packed with visitors from other parts of Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, and all over Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It has become the most popular thermal resort in the Alps. The municipal baths were full. There are hotels on every street, at every price point, and there are restaurants and luxury-goods shops. If you wish to buy an eye-wateringly costly watch at forty-six hundred feet above sea level, it is now possible to do so.\n\nThe better hotels have their own thermal pools. At the Hotel Mercure Bristol, I took an elevator down to the spa and sat in the dry sauna. A few minutes later, I slipped into the pool and floated outside in the warm water. Others were there, but not many. A light rain fell. We were ringed by mountains and held in the immortal blue.\n\n* * *\n\nIn her brilliant \"Harlem Is Nowhere,\" Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts writes, \"In almost every essay James Baldwin wrote about Harlem, there is a moment when he commits a literary sleight-of-hand so particular that, if he'd been an athlete, sportscasters would have codified the maneuver and named it 'the Jimmy.' I think of it in cinematic terms, because its effect reminds me of a technique wherein camera operators pan out by starting with a tight shot and then zoom out to a wide view while the lens remains focused on a point in the distance.\" This move, this sudden widening of focus, is present even in his essays that are not about Harlem. In \"Stranger in the Village,\" there's a passage about seven pages in where one can feel the rhetoric revving up, as Baldwin prepares to leave behind the calm, fabular atmosphere of the opening section. Of the villagers, he writes:\n\nThese people cannot be, from the point of view of power, strangers anywhere in the world; they have made the modern world, in effect, even if they do not know it. The most illiterate among them is related, in a way I am not, to Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Aeschylus, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, and Racine; the cathedral at Chartres says something to them which it cannot say to me, as indeed would New York's Empire State Building, should anyone here ever see it. Out of their hymns and dances come Beethoven and Bach. Go back a few centuries and they are in their full glory-but I am in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.\n\nWhat is this list about? Does it truly bother Baldwin that the people of Leukerbad are related, through some faint familiarity, to Chartres? That some distant genetic thread links them to the Beethoven string quartets? After all, as he argues later in the essay, no one can deny the impact \"the presence of the Negro has had on the American character.\" He understands the truth and the art in Bessie Smith's work. He does not, and cannot-I want to believe-rate the blues below Bach. But there was a certain narrowness in received ideas of black culture in the nineteen-fifties. In the time since then, there has been enough black cultural achievement from which to compile an all-star team: there's been Coltrane and Monk and Miles, and Ella and Billie and Aretha. Toni Morrison, Wole Soyinka, and Derek Walcott happened, as have Audre Lorde, and Chinua Achebe, and Bob Marley. The body was not abandoned for the mind's sake: Alvin Ailey, Arthur Ashe, and Michael Jordan happened, too. The source of jazz and the blues also gave the world hip-hop, Afrobeat, dancehall, and house. And, yes, when James Baldwin died in 1987, he, too, was recognized as an all-star.\n\nThinking further about the cathedral at Chartres, about the greatness of that achievement and about how, in his view, it included blacks only in the negative, as devils, Baldwin writes that \"the American Negro has arrived at his identity by virtue of the absoluteness of his estrangement from his past.\" But the distant African past has also become much more available than it was in 1953. It would not occur to me to think that, centuries ago, I was \"in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.\" But I suspect that for Baldwin it is, in part, a rhetorical move, a grim cadence on which to end a paragraph. In \"A Question of Identity\" (another essay collected in \"Notes of a Native Son\"), he writes, \"The truth about that past is not that it is too brief, or too superficial, but only that we, having turned our faces so resolutely away from it, have never demanded from it what it has to give.\" The fourteenth-century court artists of Ife made bronze sculptures using a complicated casting process lost to Europe since antiquity, and which was not rediscovered there until the Renaissance. Ife sculptures are equal to the works of Ghiberti or Donatello. From their precision and formal sumptuousness we can extrapolate the contours of a great monarchy, a network of sophisticated ateliers, and a cosmopolitan world of trade and knowledge. And it was not only Ife. All of West Africa was a cultural ferment. From the egalitarian government of the Igbo to the goldwork of the Ashanti courts, the brass sculpture of Benin, the military achievement of the Mandinka Empire and the musical virtuosi who praised those war heroes, this was a region of the world too deeply invested in art and life to simply be reduced to a caricature of \"watching the conquerors arrive.\" We know better now. We know it with a stack of corroborating scholarship and we know it implicitly, so that even making a list of the accomplishments feels faintly tedious, and is helpful mainly as a counter to Eurocentrism.\n\nThere's no world in which I would surrender the intimidating beauty of Yoruba-language poetry for, say, Shakespeare's sonnets, nor one in which I'd prefer the chamber orchestras of Brandenburg to the koras of Mali. I'm happy to own all of it. This carefree confidence is, in part, the gift of time. It is a dividend of the struggle of people from earlier generations. I feel no alienation in museums. But this question of filiation tormented Baldwin considerably. He was sensitive to what was great in world art, and sensitive to his own sense of exclusion from it. He made a similar list in the title essay of \"Notes of a Native Son\" (one begins to feel that lists like this had been flung at him during arguments): \"In some subtle way, in a really profound way, I brought to Shakespeare, Bach, Rembrandt, to the Stones of Paris, to the Cathedral at Chartres, and the Empire State Building a special attitude. These were not really my creations, they did not contain my history; I might search them in vain forever for any reflection of myself. I was an interloper; this was not my heritage.\" The lines throb with sadness. What he loves does not love him in return.\n\nThis is where I part ways with Baldwin. I disagree not with his particular sorrow but with the self-abnegation that pinned him to it. Bach, so profoundly human, is my heritage. I am not an interloper when I look at a Rembrandt portrait. I care for them more than some white people do, just as some white people care more for aspects of African art than I do. I can oppose white supremacy and still rejoice in Gothic architecture. In this, I stand with Ralph Ellison: \"The values of my own people are neither 'white' nor 'black,' they are American. Nor can I see how they could be anything else, since we are people who are involved in the texture of the American experience.\" And yet I (born in the United States more than half a century after Baldwin) continue to understand, because I have experienced in my own body the undimmed fury he felt about pervasive, limiting racism. In his writing there is a hunger for life, for all of it, and a strong wish to not be accounted nothing (a mere nigger, a mere neger ) when he knows himself to be so much. And this \"so much\" is neither a matter of ego about his writing nor an anxiety about his fame in New York or in Paris. It is about the incontestable fundamentals of a person: pleasure, sorrow, love, humor, and grief, and the complexity of the interior landscape that sustains those feelings. Baldwin was astonished that anyone anywhere should question these fundamentals, thereby burdening him with the supreme waste of time that is racism, let alone so many people in so many places. This unflagging ability to be shocked rises like steam off his written pages. \"The rage of the disesteemed is personally fruitless,\" he writes, \"but it is also absolutely inevitable.\"\n\nLeukerbad gave Baldwin a way to think about white supremacy from its first principles. It was as though he found it in its simplest form there. The men who suggested that he learn to ski so that they might mock him, the villagers who accused him behind his back of being a firewood thief, the ones who wished to touch his hair and suggested that he grow it out and make himself a winter coat, and the children who \"having been taught that the devil is a black man, scream in genuine anguish\" as he approached: Baldwin saw these as prototypes (preserved like coelacanths) of attitudes that had evolved into the more intimate, intricate, familiar, and obscene American forms of white supremacy that he already knew so well.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is a beautiful village. I liked the mountain air. But when I returned to my room from the thermal baths, or from strolling in the streets with my camera, I read the news online. There I found an unending sequence of crises: in the Middle East, in Africa, in Russia, and everywhere else, really. Pain was general. But within that larger distress was a set of linked stories, and thinking about \"Stranger in the Village,\" thinking with its help, was like injecting a contrast dye into my encounter with the news. The American police continued shooting unarmed black men, or killing them in other ways. The protests that followed, in black communities, were countered with violence by a police force that is becoming indistinguishable from an invading army. People began to see a connection between the various events: the shootings, the fatal choke hold, the stories of who was not given life-saving medication. And black communities were flooded with outrage and grief.\n\nIn all of this, a smaller, less significant story (but one that nevertheless signified ), caught my attention. The Mayor of New York and his police chief have a public-policy obsession with cleaning, with cleansing, and they decided that arresting members of the dance troupes that perform in moving subway cars is one of the ways to clean up the city. I read the excuses for this becoming a priority: some people fear being seriously injured by an errant kick (it has not happened, but they sure fear it), some people consider it a nuisance, some policymakers believe that going after misdemeanors is a way of preëmpting major crimes. And so, to combat this menace of dancers, the police moved in. They began chasing, and harassing, and handcuffing. The \"problem\" was dancers, and the dancers were, for the most part, black boys. The newspapers took the same tone as the government: a sniffy dismissal of the performers. And yet these same dancers are a bright spark in the day, a moment of unregulated beauty, artists with talents unimaginable to their audience. What kind of thinking would consider their abolition an improvement in city life? No one considers Halloween trick-or-treaters a public menace. There's no law enforcement against people selling Girl Scout cookies or against Jehovah's Witnesses. But the black body comes pre-judged, and as a result it is placed in needless jeopardy. To be black is to bear the brunt of selective enforcement of the law, and to inhabit a psychic unsteadiness in which there is no guarantee of personal safety. You are a black body first, before you are a kid walking down the street or a Harvard professor who has misplaced his keys.\n\nWilliam Hazlitt, in an 1821 essay entitled \"The Indian Jugglers,\" wrote words that I think of when I see a great athlete or dancer: \"Man, thou art a wonderful animal, and thy ways past finding out! Thou canst do strange things, but thou turnest them to little account!-To conceive of this effort of extraordinary dexterity distracts the imagination and makes admiration breathless.\" In the presence of the admirable, some are breathless not with admiration but with rage. They object to the presence of the black body (an unarmed boy in a street, a man buying a toy, a dancer in the subway, a bystander) as much as they object to the presence of the black mind. And simultaneous with these erasures is the unending collection of profit from black labor. Throughout the culture, there are imitations of the gait, bearing, and dress of the black body, a vampiric \"everything but the burden\" co-option of black life.\n\n* * *\n\nLeukerbad is ringed by mountains: the Daubenhorn, the Torrenthorn, the Rinderhorn. A high mountain pass called the Gemmi, another twenty-eight hundred feet above the village, connects the canton of Valais with the Bernese Oberland. Through this landscape-craggy, bare in places and verdant elsewhere, a textbook instance of the sublime-one moves as though through a dream. The Gemmipass is famous for good reason, and Goethe was there, as were Byron, Twain, and Picasso. The pass is mentioned in a Sherlock Holmes adventure, when Holmes crosses it on his way to the fateful meeting with Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls. There was bad weather the day I went up, rain and fog, but it was good luck, as it meant I was alone on the trails. While there, I remembered a story that Lucien Happersberger told about Baldwin going out on a hike in these mountains. Baldwin had lost his footing during the ascent, and the situation was precarious for a moment. But Happersberger, who was an experienced climber, reached out a hand, and Baldwin was saved. It was out of this frightening moment, this appealingly biblical moment, that Baldwin got the title for the book he had been struggling to write: \"Go Tell It On the Mountain.\"\n\nIf Leukerbad was his mountain pulpit, the United States was his audience. The remote village gave him a sharper view of what things looked like back home. He was a stranger in Leukerbad, Baldwin wrote, but there was no possibility for blacks to be strangers in the United States, nor for whites to achieve the fantasy of an all-white America purged of blacks. This fantasy about the disposability of black life is a constant in American history. It takes a while to understand that this disposability continues. It takes whites a while to understand it; it takes non-black people of color a while to understand it; and it takes some blacks, whether they've always lived in the U.S. or are latecomers like myself, weaned elsewhere on other struggles, a while to understand it. American racism has many moving parts, and has had enough centuries in which to evolve an impressive camouflage. It can hoard its malice in great stillness for a long time, all the while pretending to look the other way. Like misogyny, it is atmospheric. You don't see it at first. But understanding comes.\n\n\"People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.\" The news of the day (old news, but raw as a fresh wound) is that black American life is disposable from the point of view of policing, sentencing, economic policy, and countless terrifying forms of disregard. There is a vivid performance of innocence, but there's no actual innocence left. The moral ledger remains so far in the negative that we can't even get started on the question of reparations. Baldwin wrote \"Stranger in the Village\" more than sixty years ago. Now what?\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "What Antwon Rose's Poetry Tells Us About Being Black in America\n\nIn America, when a police-involved killing is caught on camera, the ensuing news coverage often omits a key voice─that of the victim. But, two days after the Pittsburgh-area police officer Michael Rosfeld fatally shot Antwon Rose, an unarmed seventeen-year-old black high-school senior from Rankin, Pennsylvania, hundreds of protestors, family, friends, and community members gathered on the street for a memorial and stood in silence to hear Antwon speak from beyond the grave. At the memorial, an activist took the stage to recite a poem , \" I AM NOT WHAT YOU THINK! ,\" that Antwon wrote during his tenth-grade honors English class, when he was just fifteen─old enough to understand the dangers of the world, but too young to face them alone. Rosfeld, who shot Antwon three times as he was fleeing a traffic stop, now faces a homicide charge .\n\nThe reason Antwon ran from Rosfeld is perhaps best explained by the first line of his poem: \"I am confused and afraid.\" In the line that follows, Antwon acknowledges the limitations of his fate and that of many young black men in America. \"I wonder what path I will take. I hear there's only two ways out,\" he wrote. Those \"two ways\" are the well-known expectations that many Americans have for young black men: death or incarceration. There was an audible gasp from the crowd when the activist recited the final lines of the first stanza: \"I see mothers bury their sons / I want my mom to never feel that pain / I am confused and afraid.\" Several days after the memorial, Antwon's mother, Michelle Kenney, buried her son.\n\n\" I AM NOT WHAT YOU THINK! \" was also recited during Antwon's funeral, a few days after the memorial, during which he was celebrated as a \" bright light \" within his community. The poem has since become a rallying cry in the movement against police brutality. But, though Antwon's words eerily predicted his future, the power of his poem isn't limited to its prescience. Like many black writers throughout American history, Antwon chose poetry as a means to express the feelings of fear and death─and hope and survival─that are unique to the black experience. Black writers have relied on poetry for creative self-expression for centuries, challenging the structural and grammatical constraints of traditional prose. For black writers, poetry has offered a sense of freedom seldom found in black life.\n\nThat tradition has thrived and evolved. Last year, hip-hop and R. & B., two descendants of poetry within the African-American community, became, as a group, America's most popular music genre . In April, Kendrick Lamar became the first rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize, for his album \" DAMN. \" Lamar's lyrics tell stories of death and survival while being poor and black in America. On the song \" FEAR. \" he rattles off dozens of ways that he might die─including by the hands of the police. \"I prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges,\" he raps. \"Body slammed on black-and-white paint, my bones snappin'.\" Gil Scott-Heron, widely known as the \"godfather of rap,\" was similarly obsessed with black life and death, as evident on \"Comment #1,\" a song on which he repeats the question, \" Who will survive in America? \"\n\nBut long before hip-hop became the cultural phenomenon that it is today, poetry was the preferred canvas for African-American writers concerned with the black experience and how it relates to fear and death. Langston Hughes used his poetry to illuminate the perils of black life. \" Who But the Lord? \" was written seventy-one years ago. \"Now, I do not understand / Why God don't protect a man / From police brutality. / Being poor and black / I've no weapon to strike back- / So who but the Lord / Can protect me?\" he wrote. In \" On Liberty and Slavery ,\" George Moses Horton─born a slave, in 1798─prayed for freedom from fear: \"Come Liberty, thou cheerful sound, / Roll through my ravished ears! / Come, let my grief in joys be drowned, / And drive away my fears.\" And nearly a hundred and fifty years after Horton, Audre Lorde's \" Litany for Survival \" mentions the word \"afraid\" or \"fear\" ten times. But the feminist theorist and civil-rights activist was decidedly more matter-of-fact. \"And when we speak we are afraid / our words will not be heard / nor welcomed / but when we are silent / we are still afraid / So it is better to speak / remembering / we were never meant to survive,\" she wrote.\n\nThroughout his poem, Antwon uses repetition of words and phrases for emphasis. The line \"I am confused and afraid\" is repeated four times, and his tone becomes more desperate with each mention, as if he were concerned that the reader might forget just how vulnerable he felt. In every other line, Antwon continues his catalogue of \"I\" statements, but follows \"I\" with a discrete action and fearful confessions: \"I pretend all is fine,\" \"I feel like I'm suffocating.\" His words bring into focus the cruel irony of what it feels like to be a young black man in America, a country in which he is told that he is free but is treated like a \"statistic.\"\n\nThe third and final stanza of Antwon's poem includes a line that complements the title. \"I understand people believe I'm just a statistic / I say to them I'm different.\" For black adolescents across America, the threat of becoming a \"statistic\" looms large, particularly when black men are jailed at five times the rate of white men . Antwon tells the reader that he is \"different,\" but he was not treated any differently from the other young unarmed black men who have been gunned down by the police in America.\n\nOn the night of Antwon's death, Rosfeld stopped a car that matched the description of a vehicle involved in a shooting. He began taking the driver into custody when Antwon fled. According to the criminal complaint filed by the Allegheny County Police Detectives, Rosfeld initially claimed that he saw Antwon carrying a gun. He later admitted that he did not see one. According to the Washington Post , Antwon was the four hundred and ninety-first person to be killed by the police in 2018, six per cent of whom were, like Antwon, unarmed.\n\n\"I dream of life getting easier / I try my best to make my dream come true / I hope that it does / I am confused and afraid.\" These are the final lines of Antwon's poem. His dream did not come true, but it lives on through those who are marching in his honor, filling the streets and demanding change, shouting Antwon's name-perhaps even loud enough for him to hear.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The End of the Gay-Panic Legal Defense\n\nIn 1944, in New York, a decade before Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs would publish their countercultural works, there was a killer in their midst. Lucien Carr was a brilliant Columbia University student from a prominent Midwestern family. He had introduced the three men to one another and was at the center of the circle of friends that defined what was later known as the Beat Generation. The nineteen-year-old Carr stabbed another member of the group, David Kammerer, in Riverside Park, with a Boy Scout knife, and dumped his body in the Hudson River. Carr claimed that Kammerer, his former scoutmaster, who was thirty-three, had followed him for years, from city to city, and made \"indecent\" advances. The New York press, defending Carr, portrayed the killing as an \"honor slaying.\" Although he was charged with murder, prosecutors allowed Carr to plead guilty to the lesser crime of manslaughter. He served two years in a reformatory and then lived out his life as a respected news-agency editor.\n\nThe case was one of the first high-profile instances of a \" gay panic\" defense , in which a person claims that his violent act was a sudden emotional response to an unwanted advance from a person of the same sex. If believed, a defendant's crime may be reduced, from murder to manslaughter, or from attempted murder to assault. A defendant might even raise it as a full-fledged defense to try to avoid liability altogether, but judges and juries have been much less amenable to it in recent years. Since the nineteen-sixties, the gay-panic defense has been used in half the states, but in relatively few reported cases, numbering in the dozens.\n\nThe case that brought the defense renewed attention was the killing, in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming, who was robbed, beaten, and set on fire by two men. At one of the defendants' murder trials, the defense provided evidence-later admitted to be false-that Shepard had been sexually aggressive. The defendant claimed that his own childhood history of being sexually bullied by another boy caused him to lose control of himself after Shepard's alleged unwanted advance. (Later reporting suggested that the accused had had a prior sexual relationship with Shepard.) The jury ultimately convicted the defendant of felony murder, which was less serious than the first-degree-murder conviction sought by the prosecution, but more serious than manslaughter, which had been sought by the defense. He was sentenced to two life sentences in prison.\n\nIn June, the New York State Assembly joined six other state legislatures that have passed bills banning gay-panic and trans-panic defenses. The New York bill provides that a \"non-violent sexual advance\" or \"the discovery of a person's sexual orientation or gender identity\" cannot serve as the \"reasonable explanation or excuse\" needed to reduce charges from murder to manslaughter. (Another half-dozen states have introduced similar bills.) Also in June, Senator Edward Markey and Representative Joe Kennedy, both of Massachusetts, introduced federal bills to ban gay- and trans-panic defenses for federal crimes. These moves arise from recognition of the high rates of homicide and other violence perpetrated against L.G.B.T.Q. people, and concern that defenses implicitly blame gay and trans people for violence against them or imply that their lives are worth less than others. What the bills leave in place, however, is a defendant's ability to claim that his own past trauma can explain the extreme reaction to a victim's conduct.\n\nThe gay-panic defense grows out of the traditional legal doctrine known as \"provocation,\" which dates to sixteenth-century England and remains in use in American courts. The doctrine allows a defendant to claim that another person's inflammatory conduct caused a sudden departure from rational judgment, and so an act of killing by that person was done in the \"heat of passion.\" The traditional paradigm for the defense was a man killing his wife's paramour upon unexpectedly discovering them in flagrante delicto-a reaction that was then considered reasonable. In addition to a spouse's adultery, classic provocations included combat, a serious assault, an illegal arrest, or the injury or abuse of a close relative. For centuries, courts limited provocation to these specific categories and inquired whether the situation was sufficiently provoking to cause a blood-boiling homicidal response in a reasonable person. But its use inevitably implied that the victim-provocateur was at least partially to blame. The notion of a \"true man\" lashing out at another male who purportedly offended his masculinity with sexual overtures fit the male honor norms that informed criminal regulation of violence in the nineteenth century. But the homosexual-panic defense did not formally appear in legal opinions until the nineteen-sixties.\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, progressive criminal-law thinkers called for the expansion of the provocation concept to accommodate defendants whose situations didn't fit the narrow categories that courts had developed. Their intent was to make the criminal code more forgiving of human fallibility. Following the standard proposed by the American Law Institute's influential Model Penal Code of 1962, New York liberalized its provocation doctrine, in 1967, to allow reduction of murder charges to manslaughter when a defendant killed while \"under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse.\" This shifted the focus toward a defendant's troubled internal emotional state, rather than demanding that the external circumstances display certain established types of facts. By 1976, New York's highest court noted that advances in psychology had made the public willing to reduce responsibility for \"those whose capacity has been diminished by mental trauma.\" What could explain a defendant's \"extreme emotional disturbance\" and excuse the violence was a trauma that developed \"for a substantial period of time, simmering in the unknowing subconscious and then inexplicably coming to the fore.\" If a defendant's trauma was the key to his defense, his own past was prologue.\n\nCurrent efforts to ban gay- and trans-panic defenses are uncontroversial in jurisdictions that embrace gay and transgender rights. But doing so may have unintended legal implications. Women who have killed abusive men have sometimes claimed that their charges should be reduced, even when they were not fighting off imminent death or serious injury, which would be valid self-defense. For decades, courts have allowed battered women to argue that their homicidal response was reasonably induced by a male victim's past abusive conduct. In fact, according to the legal scholar Aya Gruber, women have been more successful than men in using the provocation defense. This is likely because female defendants have more readily proved that they suffered prior trauma. That raises the question of what should be the range of a woman's reasonable response to a man's unwelcome sexual advances. If she panics and kills in a social context that makes women's fear of male sexual violence widespread and ordinary, should her response be considered reasonable and her responsibility mitigated?\n\nThe new bills bar both women and men from making a \"gender panic\" defense. They refuse to excuse, for example, a woman who kills a person who is sexually aggressive but not violent. But they would allow a woman to claim that a reasonable explanation for her homicidal reaction to a nonviolent sexual advance was the trauma caused by a past sexual assault. That defense would be possible regardless of the deceased person's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe new legislation's implications also reverberate in the realm of racial bias. The myriad killings of black males based on racially biased perceptions of danger immediately come to mind. The role of bigotry has been debated in the police killings of unarmed black men that the legal system has deemed justified, as well as in the case of George Zimmerman's killing of Trayvon Martin, a black teen-ager, for which a Florida jury acquitted him. A successful self-defense claim convinces a prosecutor or jury that the defendant reasonably feared for his life, and thus the killing was not a crime. The notorious trial of Bernhard Goetz, who shot four black teen-agers who approached him in the New York City subway, in 1984, resulted in his acquittal on attempted-murder and assault charges, presumably because the jury believed that his perception of danger was reasonable-a perception that was widely understood to be linked to the victims' race.\n\nBut black defendants have also claimed that they reasonably perceived danger from the white victims they have killed. In 2006, John White, a black man, shot and killed one of the five white teen-agers who appeared outside his Long Island home shouting racial epithets and accusing his son of wanting to rape a white girl. As Calvin Trillin reported in this magazine , the trial defense brought up White's grandfather's history of fleeing Alabama after a deadly attack by the Ku Klux Klan to explain that the defendant's perception of the white teen-agers as a lynch mob made his fear of death reasonable. The intergenerational family trauma was a way of claiming \"race panic.\" The prosecution sought a murder charge, but the grand jury indicted White of manslaughter-effectively mitigating the crime due to the claim of provocation. He was convicted but pardoned by Governor David Paterson after serving just five months in prison.\n\nIn a related vein, ethnic-minority defendants have claimed that their crimes should be reduced to less than murder. For example, in 2003, in California, a Japanese-American man who killed a woman who allegedly exploited him financially and threatened to kill his elderly parents argued that his Asian upbringing explained his violent reaction to humiliation at being taken advantage of, because, \"in Japanese culture, intense shame attaches to males who lack emotional control, who are unable to meet the expectations of others, and who violate their personal standards.\" The court excluded his sociological expert's testimony and found that the connection between the defendant's cultural background and state of mind was too general. He was convicted of murder. But in other cases courts have sometimes admitted arguments based on cultural background, allowing juries to credit what is effectively a \"cultural panic\" defense.\n\nDespite the new bills' claim to eliminate the gay- and trans-panic defenses, they still allow defendants to put on such a defense if they can tie their extreme emotional reactions to personal traumas. The federal bills explicitly state that a court may still admit evidence of a defendant's \"past trauma\" to excuse, justify, or mitigate an offense. That loophole limits the potential effects of the new rule, rendering the ban more of an expressive symbol than a concrete protection of L.G.B.T.Q. people.\n\nWhat we used to call \"heat of passion\" we now call \"trauma,\" which allows us to be more understanding of people who have had psychologically damaging experiences. But the fact that both victims and perpetrators may claim to have suffered trauma complicates our efforts to determine who is a perpetrator and who is a victim-that is, who is responsible and who is harmed. As the legal scholar Janet Halley has noted , a gay-panic reaction may lead people who identify as heterosexual to falsely perceive sexual minorities with whom they have engaged in sexual conduct as having committed sexual harassment or assault against them. The gay-panic debate, then, goes beyond excuses for murder. It reminds us more basically that biases can frame-and flip-perceptions of guilt.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Chronicle of a Riot Foretold\n\nF ERGUSON , Missouri-For a hundred and eight days, through the suffocating heat that turned the city into a kiln, through summer thunderstorms and the onset of an early winter, through bureaucratic callousness and the barbs of cynics who held that the effort was of no use and the prickly fear that they might be right, a community in Ferguson, Missouri, held vigil nightly, driven by the need to validate a simple principle: black lives matter. On November 24, 2014, we learned that they do indeed matter, just less than others-less than the prerogatives of those who wield power here, less than even the cynics may have suspected.\n\nLast night, the streets of Ferguson were congested with smoke and anger and disillusionment and disbelief, and also with batons and the malevolent percussion of gunfire and the hundreds of uniformed men brought here to marshal and display force. Just after eight on Monday evening, after a rambling dissertation from the St. Louis County Prosecutor, Robert McCulloch, that placed blame for tensions on social media and the twenty-four-hour news cycle, and ended with the announcement that the police officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted for shooting Michael Brown six times, the crowd that gathered in front of the police headquarters, on South Florissant Road, began to swell. Their mood was sombre at first, but some other sentiment came to the fore, and their restraint came unmoored. A handful of men began chanting \"Fuck the police!\" in front of the line of officers in riot gear that had gathered in front of the headquarters. Gunshots, the first I heard that night, cut through the air, and a hundred people began drifting in the direction of the bullets. One man ripped down a small camera mounted on a telephone pole. A quarter mile away, the crowd encountered an empty police car and within moments it was aflame. A line of police officers in military fatigues and gas masks turned a corner and began moving north toward the police building. There were four hundred protesters and nearly that many police officers filling an American street, one side demanding justice, one side demanding order, both recognizing that neither of those things was in the offing that night.\n\nWhat transpired in Ferguson last night was entirely predictable, widely anticipated, and, yet, seemingly inevitable. Late last week, Michael Brown, Sr., released a video pleading for calm, his forlorn eyes conveying exhaustion born of not only shouldering grief but also of insisting on civic calm in the wake of his son's death. One of the Brown family's attorneys, Anthony Gray, held a press conference making the same request, and announced that a team of citizen peacekeepers would be present at any subsequent protests. Ninety minutes later, the St. Louis mayor, Francis Slay, held a press conference in which he pledged that the police would show restraint in the event of protests following the grand-jury decision. He promised that tear gas and armored vehicles would not be deployed to manage protests. The two conferences bore a disturbing symmetry, an inversion of pre-fight hype in which each side deprecated about possible violence but expressed skepticism that the other side was capable of doing the same. It's possible that, recognizing that violence was all but certain, both sides were seeking to deflect the charge that they had encouraged it. Others offered no such pretense. Days ahead of the announcement, local businesses began boarding up their doors and windows like a coastal town anticipating a hurricane. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a preëmptive state of emergency a week before the grand jury concluded its work. His announcement was roughly akin to declaring it daytime at 3 *A.M. *{: .small}because the sun will rise eventually.\n\nFrom the outset, the great difficulty has been discerning whether the authorities are driven by malevolence or incompetence. The Ferguson police let Brown's body lie in the street for four and a half hours, an act that either reflected callous disregard for him as a human being or an inability to manage the situation. The release of Darren Wilson's name was paired with the release of a video purportedly showing Brown stealing a box of cigarillos from a convenience store, although Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson later admitted that Wilson was unaware of the incident when he confronted the young man. (McCulloch contradicted this in his statement on the non-indictment.) Last night, McCulloch made the inscrutable choice to announce the grand jury's decision after darkness had fallen and the crowds had amassed in the streets, factors that many felt could only increase the risk of violence. Despite the sizable police presence, few officers were positioned on the stretch of West Florissant near where Brown was killed.* The result was that damage to the area around the police station was sporadic and short-lived, but Brown's neighborhood burned. This was either bad strategy or further confirmation of the unimportance of that community in the eyes of Ferguson's authorities.\n\nThe pleas of Michael Brown's father and Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, were ultimately incapable of containing the violence that erupted last night, because in so many ways what happened here extended beyond their son. His death was a punctuation to a long, profane sentence, one which has insulted a great many, and with damning frequency of late. In his statement after the decision was announced, President Barack Obama took pains to point out that \"there is never an excuse for violence.\" The man who once told us that there was no black America or white America but only the United States of America has become a President whose statements on unpunished racial injustices are a genre unto themselves. Perhaps it only seems contradictory that the deaths of Oscar Grant and Trayvon Martin, Ezell Ford and John Crawford and Michael Brown-all unarmed black men shot by men who faced no official sanction for their actions-came during the first black Presidency.* Or perhaps the message here is that American democracy has reached the limits of its elasticity-that the symbolic empowerment of individuals, while the great many remain citizen-outsiders, is the best that we can hope for. The air last night, thick with smoke and gunfire, suggested something damning of the President.\n\n*Correction: An earlier version of this post conflated the names of Ezell Ford and John Crawford.\n\n*Correction: An earlier version of this post mistakenly stated that Brown was killed on West Florissant Avenue.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "A Night of Violent Protests Sets a Nation Ablaze\n\nIs the United States coming apart? That is the question many people are asking after another night of demonstrations and violence following the horrific death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. In Minneapolis, Atlanta, New York, Dallas, Oakland, and other cities, there were violent clashes between police and protesters, which left at least two people dead, businesses looted, and local politicians combining appeals for calm with expressions of fury. In Washington, D.C., Secret Service agents scuffled with demonstrators outside of the White House, as Donald Trump and other officials were locked down inside.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, announced that he was mobilizing the Minnesota National Guard and accepting offers of support from National Guard units in neighboring states. He also said that he had spoken with officials at the Pentagon about dispatching  elements of the military to Minneapolis, and the Department of Defense subsequently confirmed that it had ordered U.S. Army units to stand by. Walz claimed that the \"wanton destruction and chaos\" seen in Minneapolis on Friday night had been perpetrated by highly organized outsiders, including ideological extremists and experts in urban warfare. \"Our great cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are under assault by people who do not share our values . . . and certainly are not here to honor George Floyd,\" Walz said during a press conference . Appearing alongside Walz, Minneapolis's mayor, Jacob Frey, who is also a Democrat, echoed the claim that outside agitators were primarily responsible for the violence, saying, \"they are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region, to prey on everything that we have built over the last several decades.\"\n\nIn Atlanta, demonstrators set fires and destroyed property at the CNN Center, Centennial Olympic Park, and a mall in the Buckhead neighborhood.  In an impassioned press conference on Friday night, Atlanta's mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, tore into the protesters, saying, \"When you burn down this city, you are burning down our community. . . . You are disgracing our city. You are disgracing the life of George Floyd.\" Earlier on Friday, before the protests turned violent, Atlanta's police chief, Erika Shields, had expressed sympathy for the demonstrators. \"People are understandably upset,\" she told reporters. \"Black men are routinely killed. And whether it's by police or other individuals, the reality of it is we've diminished the value on their life. Think about that.\"\n\nThat is the tragedy of the situation: the main force driving the demonstrations is outrage and righteous anger about the callous murder of Floyd and the long history of racism in U.S. policing. Given the seemingly endless procession of cases in which unarmed black men have been killed by the police, it is a sign of societal strength rather than dysfunction that so many people, of all races, are protesting. \"There is something fundamentally wrong with American police training, police culture, police organization,\" Orlando Patterson, the eminent Harvard sociologist, noted in a conversation with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell on Friday night. All too often, Patterson explained, the American culture of policing \"sees the community as the enemy.\"\n\nIn some places on Friday, the police tactics appeared to inflame situations rather than deëscalate them. During a largely peaceful protest outside of the Barclays Center, in Brooklyn, members of the New York Police Department were captured on video hurling a woman to the ground and rushing into the crowd with their batons raised to make arrests. They also pepper-sprayed and handcuffed a local politician who was taking part in the protest. In Louisville, Kentucky, police opened fire on reporters with pepper balls for no apparent reason. However, there were clearly elements among the protesters who were intent on causing trouble, in New York and in other demonstrations across the country, and many of them appeared to be white. Outside of Fort Greene Park, in Brooklyn, protesters attacked a police van and set it alight. \"I saw non-black allies in particular escalating the situation,\" Jumaane Williams, New York City's public advocate, said . \"That decision should not be yours to make.\"\n\nAs the unrest continues, some commentators are comparing the situation to 1968, when there were riots in Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, and other cities following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4th, and unrest that continued throughout the summer. There are undoubtedly some parallels: 1968 was an election year; political activism was on the rise; in some cities, aggressive police tactics exacerbated the violence; and there was a Republican Presidential candidate, Richard Nixon, who exploited the turmoil to appeal to frightened white voters. At this stage, though, making a full historical comparison seems premature.\n\nDespite the dramatic footage of demonstrators confronting police and burning police vehicles in Atlanta and other cities, the unrest has been localized and scattered; the number of injuries and deaths has been relatively small; and the property damage has been fairly limited-certainly compared to what happened during the large-scale rioting in 1968. Also, after an inexplicable delay, authorities in Minneapolis have finally arrested Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on the windpipe of the cuffed Floyd for more than eight minutes, and charged him with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. It is possible that things will calm down. But with more protests planned in many cities, including Atlanta and New York, such an outcome is far from guaranteed, especially given the potential for Trump to further provoke things.\n\nAfter appearing to suggest in a pair of tweets on Thursday night that the police should shoot some of the demonstrators in Minneapolis, the President backed off a bit on Friday. He said that he had called Floyd's family, whom he described as \"terrific people,\" to express sorrow about Floyd's death; and he tried to walk back his incendiary tweets, claiming that they had been misinterpreted. In tweets on Saturday morning, Trump praised the Secret Service agents for how they had handled the protests outside of the White House on Friday night. \"They were not only totally professional, but very cool. I was inside, watched every move, and couldn't have felt more safe.\" He could have left it there, but, of course, he didn't. In another tweet, he said that the demonstrators, had they breached the security fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, would have \"been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. . . . Many Secret Service agents are just waiting for action.\"\n\nIn New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo struck a very different note. Appearing at his daily COVID -19 press conference , Cuomo announced that the state's attorney general, Letitia James, would carry out an inquiry into Friday night's unrest, examining both the police's tactics and the crowd's behavior. \"People do deserve answers, and people do deserve accountability,\" Cuomo said. \"If someone did something wrong, they should be held accountable.\" Cuomo also sought to deëscalate the situation, appealing to New Yorkers to take inspiration from the health-care workers and other people on the front lines who have helped get the state through the worst stages of the pandemic. \"Yes, be outraged, be frustrated,\" Cuomo said. \"Demand better, demand justice, but not violence. . . . There is nothing we can't overcome. We showed that here. We beat this damn virus. But the way we beat this virus, we can beat the virus of racism, we can beat the virus of discrimination, we can beat the virus of inequality. If we can beat this virus, we can beat anything.\"\n\nThese are fine-sounding words. It remains to be seen if they will have any effect.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Claudia Rankine's Home for the Racial Imaginary\n\nEarlier this month, Dylann Roof, the twenty-two-year-old avowed white supremacist, was sentenced to death for murdering nine black parishioners at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, South Carolina. His defense attorney, David Bruck, the anti-death-penalty advocate, argued that Roof was \"abnormal,\" \"delusional,\" and \"suicidal,\" but Roof, acting as his own attorney during the sentencing phase of his trial, denied it. He wasn't sorry for what he had done, only that it had to be done in the first place, because, as he confessed to authorities in 2015, he wanted to start a race war. \"I have to do it,\" Roof told Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the attack, before pumping bullets into her son's body. \"Y'all are raping our women and y'all are taking over our world.\"\n\nWhose world exactly was Roof referring to? Is it real or imagined? Would the answer make him any less guilty? And, if it's the latter, how do you disarm someone's imagination? Questions like these have been central to the work of the poet, writer, and artist Claudia Rankine. In 2011, she published an open letter addressed to friends inviting them to share their thoughts and experiences on writing about race, hoping to learn if the respondents believed that race could be decontextualized from history, what compelled them to write about race, what the difficulties and advantages were, their fears, expectations, and anxieties. A bevy of responses came in, and Rankine posted many of them on her Web site. She called the project the Racial Imaginary, which, with the help of her collaborator, Beth Loffreda, became a book in 2014.\n\nIn the book's introduction, Rankine and Loffreda explain that the racial imaginary is concerned not with who has the right to write about race but, rather, with where the desire comes from, and how to detect when race is \"taking up residence in the creative act.\" In other words, how to recognize when people's \"imagination is not entirely their own,\" and the real-world consequences of our culturally constructed biases.\n\n\"These systemic problems have infiltrated the mind so that when someone asks the white policeman who shoots someone, 'Why did you shoot him in the back?' his answer is 'I don't know.' Many of them say, 'I don't know,' and it's because they're being propelled forward by some imaginary conception of being under attack when they're not under attack,\" Rankine said recently. \"I think sometimes we're dealing with racists who go out to murder and I think sometimes we're dealing with people who have in their consciousness a built-up idea of who they are and who the 'other' is, and are inside a fight that doesn't exist except in their imagination, and because their imagination is armed, the person on the other side ends up dead.\" These racist constructions in the imagination throw people of color into a \"false fight for their humanity,\" she said, paraphrasing the poet Fred Moten. \"We're spending a lot of energy just trying to stay human.\"\n\nLast year, Rankine announced that she would use the money from her recently bestowed MacArthur \"Genius\" Grant to help establish the Racial Imaginary Institute in Manhattan, a brick-and-mortar extension of the original project where artists will present talks, read essays, host podcasts, and exhibit work focussed on race and the creative imagination. She is currently fund-raising while scouting locations on the Lower East Side, in Chelsea, and in SoHo, and envisions the institute as a mobile enterprise, headquartered in New York City with pop-ups and satellites all over the country, and maybe even the world.\n\nThe timing for the Racial Imaginary Institute could not be more auspicious. Many Americans were shocked that, despite the racism and racist language seen and heard throughout Donald Trump's campaign, Trump was elected, suggesting that the critical thinking needed to understand how racism functions and spreads is still sorely lacking.\n\nRankine told me that the Racial Imaginary Institute is not a response to the incoming Administration, but it does aim to look at the ways our lives are being influenced by people's understanding and misunderstanding of race. In an ironic twist, one of the goals will be to educate people about whiteness and white supremacy, a task that echoes the rhetoric used by white ethno-nationalists like Richard Spencer. But Rankine hopes the institute will be a place where artists will discuss, for example, \"why whiteness isn't written about as whiteness, as race, or the ways in which black life or the lives of people of color are codified inside the media in ways that are negative and confirming of different stereotypes.\" One project she may stage there is a forthcoming play she wrote that started out as an adaption of \" Citizen \"-her best-selling book about quotidian encounters with racism-but has since evolved into an entirely new project. \"It's the kind of thing that would belong in the institute because it's interested in how race is read and how perceptions that flow along racial lines end up both limiting and creating our freedom,\" she told me. Barry Jenkins's \" Moonlight ,\" a film adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney's \"In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,\" is another work that would make sense. \"I've seen the film three times, and each time I think about it in terms of the kinds of decisions that are being made by a conscious person who is making a work of art and also thinking about how race functions in our society.\"\n\nIn addition to being a gallery space, the institute will have much in common with social-justice-oriented organizations that investigate themes of injustice, inequality, and accountability, places that help people understand that Dylann Roof isn't just an aberration. \"The making of Dylann Roof is a cultural making, and we see variations of him all over our society at this point, maybe not overtly shooting nine people, but there are different ways that it gets articulated and implemented, that kind of ideology,\" Rankine said. For example, unarmed black men can be filmed being shot in the back by a police officer, as Walter Scott was , and somehow still be held responsible. \"Ten years ago I would have said, 'I'm sure the policeman shot him in the back.' And the people sitting around the table with me, mostly white, would say, 'Well, that's your perception. You can't really know that.' And now because the neighbor of the man who died took out his phone and filmed it and uploaded it, I can say, 'No, let's look,' \" Rankine said during a panel at the Albertine Festival, at New York's French Consulate, in November. During our recent interview, she acknowledged that videos aren't enough.\n\n\"One of the things that we are seeing, even with the evidence, and we saw this with Rodney King, was the fact that evidence does not change the drive to eradicate the black body, to erase it, to kill it, to bury it, to remove it. But what the videos do do, at least for me, is they present the counternarrative. If the counternarrative has the power to change the law, it still exists as a counternarrative. It doesn't change the fact that racism is systemic to the justice system, it's systemic to the consciousness of white jurors who let many of these people off, but it points to that fact, and that's all I feel like I have been doing, and many others have been doing, is pointing to the fact.\" She laughed at how simple that may sound.\n\nThere is no official timeline for the opening of the Racial Imaginary Institute, because, as Rankine put it, \"no grant that I have received will allow me to walk into a gallery in New York City and buy it.\" She and her curatorial and organizational teams, which include Loffreda, the playwright Casey Llewellyn, the poet Monica Youn, and the activist and scholar Margo Okazawa-Rey, among others, are still in the process of fund-raising. Aside from money, Rankine said the biggest challenge-what work they will get-is also the thing that's most exciting. But, like the response to her open letter, Rankine believes the work that will make the institute what it is already exists, and that people are ready to share it and to learn from it.\n\nArtists have been doing this work all along, she said, but they are so various and out there in so many different ways that it's time they all had a place to live. \"Maybe the institutions that show this work are not interested specifically in seeing the kind of work that we want,\" Rankine said. \"It will be really wonderful to be able to say to people, 'That work that somebody else wouldn't show, we'll show it. That reading that somebody else wasn't interested in, we're interested in it. That paper that you wanted to give, come here and give it here.' \"\n\n\"It's a challenge to want to hold what you don't know exists,\" she continued. \"But when it comes it will be incredibly exciting.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Unlikely Story of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"\n\nHalf a century ago, on March 7, 1965, state troopers knocked down, gassed, and beat a number of men and women who were participating in a peaceful march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama. That same day, radio listeners around the country might have heard Sam Cooke singing a lyric he'd written and recorded several months earlier, but which could have been describing the \"Bloody Sunday\" confrontation on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n\n_Then I go to my brother _ _And I say, \"Brother, help me please.\" _ _But he winds up knockin' me _ Back down on my knees.\n\nLike the Selma-to-Montgomery march, Cooke's brooding but bright civil-rights anthem \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" recently marked its fiftieth anniversary. The song, which was released as the B-side of Cooke's posthumous hit single \"Shake\" just days after his funeral, in December 1964, entered the national pop and R&B charts during the first week of 1965. It fell off the pop countdown, after peaking at No. 31, on March 13th, and would slip from the R&B charts, where it climbed to No. 9, on April 10.\n\nThese anniversaries have passed without much commemoration-somewhat surprisingly, given that Cooke's recording remains as beloved and as timely as ever. Then again, it may be that the song's persistent relevance explains the neglect. The serial shootings of unarmed black men by law enforcement; the Justice Department report on police abuse and corruption in Ferguson, Missouri; the gutting of a Voting Rights Act provision that was one key consequence of the Selma marches-these and other dispiriting headlines have perhaps rendered the confident optimism of Cooke's masterpiece difficult to sing along to without seeming naïve. If Cooke were alive to update \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" for the current political scene, he might be tempted to rename it \"The More Things Change.\"\n\nIn a story that has come to symbolize the ways in which American popular music intersected with and helped sustain the civil-rights movement, Cooke was motivated to write \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" by another sixties anthem, Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind.\" When he first heard that song, Peter Guralnick writes in 2005's \"Dream Boogie: The Triumph of Sam Cooke,\" he \"was so carried away with the message, and the fact that a white boy had written it, that . . . he was almost ashamed not to have written something like that himself.\"\n\nThe soul singer and former gospel star was further inspired when he heard Peter, Paul and Mary singing Dylan's song on the radio. As Daniel Wolff explains in his 1995 biography of Cooke, \"You Send Me: The Life and Times of Sam Cooke,\"_ _the folk trio piqued Cooke's commercial ambitions. Their recording proved that \"a tune could address civil rights and go to No. 2 on the pop charts.\" For Cooke, the result of these racial and artistic challenges was \"A Change Is Gonna Come.\"\n\nAs origin stories go, this one is satisfyingly precise and frustratingly incomplete. It pinpoints exactly what prodded Cooke to write a civil-rights-themed protest song, but says nothing about the specific protest song Cooke wound up writing, let alone the record he created (a key distinction, which is too often elided).\n\nFor one thing, \"Change\" delivers a message notably distinct from Dylan's in \"Blowin' in the Wind.\" On the recording, Dylan is obviously concerned about the troubles he's addressing, but his flat delivery conveys none of the urgency, hope, or confidence that are so paramount in Cooke's performance. Soon afterward, Dylan would write \"Only a Pawn in Their Game,\" in response to the murder of Medgar Evers, and he would travel to Greenwood, Mississippi, in support of voter registration, and perform at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But the Dylan of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" muses over important issues from a third-person distance that Cooke's song (\"I was born by the river...\") eschews from the jump. Dylan poses philosophical musings and rhetorical questions amid antiquated word choices (in the days of \"Ban the Bomb,\" he's going on about \"cannonballs\"), geological time frames (those washed-to-the-sea mountains), and Old Testament allusions. \"Blowin' in the Wind\" intimates that the answers we crave are where they have always been and where, tragically, they may well remain. \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" is unequivocal.\n\nThe two recordings also sound as unlike one another as two early-sixties records could: Cooke and Dylan were wading up different streams of the American song for inspiration. Dylan found much of his melody in the nineteenth-century black spiritual \"No More Auction Block for Me\" (also known as \"Many Thousands Gone,\" which was a source for another anthem of the era, \"We Shall Overcome\"), while his voice and phrasing, and his austere and static strum, are indebted to the Depression-era folk style of Woody Guthrie. By contrast, the melody to \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" with its long dynamic lines that trek the peaks and valleys of arranger René Hall's lush orchestral landscape, shows Cooke working off of Tin Pan Alley standards, film music, and show tunes.\n\n\"Change\" opens with a regal assemblage of strings, buffeted and borne heavenward by kettledrum and French horn, all of which build theatrically and then clear out quickly for Cooke's entrance-you can imagine the singer moving downstage into a spotlight, or a camera zooming to close-up. But while the musical setting is grandiloquent, Cooke's tale is down-to-earth. He was born alongside a river that, like him, has never stopped rolling. He's been run off when trying to see a movie downtown and beaten to his knees when asking for help. He's had his moments of fear and doubt, but through it all-big finish-he's nurtured a faith, now a conviction, that change is on the way. Cue tympani.\n\nNone of this sounds or feels like \"Blowin' in the Wind.\" It sounds like \"Ol' Man River.\"\n\nThe comparison isn't arbitrary; we know that Cooke was familiar with the song, which was written by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's 1927 musical \"Show Boat.\" He included a version of it, alongside \"Summertime\" and other Great American Songbook classics on his 1958 début album. \"I gets weary and sick of tryin' / I'm tired of livin' and scared of dyin',\" he sings in his oddly smooth and swinging performance of the Kern-Hammerstein tune. Six years later, he would transform those lines in the second verse of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\": \"It's been too hard livin', but I'm afraid to die.\"\n\nThat fairly direct allusion has been remarkably little noted, at least in print. In his new book,\"Who Should Sing 'Ol' Man River'?: The Lives of an American Song,\" Todd Decker notes only that Cooke's song, like the Kern-Hammerstein composition, mentions a river. More helpfully, he observes that \"the most prolific and engaged era for 'Ol' Man River',\" the years in which it was most often included on albums and performed on TV, stretched from the late nineteen-fifties well into the nineteen-sixties. To cite only one example out of dozens, Ray Charles released a version \"Ol' Man River\" in 1963 that nicely anticipates the slow pacing, heartfelt delivery, and big, old-school pop arrangement of \"A Change Is Gonna Come.\" In 1964, Dylan's wasn't the only racially themed protest song that was blowing in the wind.\n\n\"Ol' Man River\" is most closely associated with the stentorian African-American singer, actor, and activist Paul Robeson. He didn't début the song on stage, but Kern and Hammerstein wrote it with him in mind, and he became identified with the song thanks to his several recordings and innumerable live performances of it as well as his role in the 1936 film version of the musical.\n\n\"Show Boat,\" like the Edna Ferber novel on which it's based, was critical of racial-miscegenation laws in the Jim Crow South, and \"Ol' Man River\" was intended to evoke minstrel songs of ante- and post-bellum America-while subverting their sympathies. To that end, parts of Kern's melody for \"Ol' Man River\" sound as if they might have been penned by the nineteenth-century minstrel-song writer Stephen Foster. Kern and Hammerstein also allude to-and pull the rug from under-an even older anthem, Dan Emmett's \"Dixie.\"\n\n\"Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton,\" that most notorious of blackface minstrel songs declares. \"Old times there are not forgotten.\" In \"Ol' Man River,\" Kern and Hammerstein force \"Dixie\" to switch sides, as it were, borrowing the rhyme and, there at the end, a bit of the melody, to allow Robeson-and, later, Ray Charles and Sam Cooke and so many others-to make the opposite racial point: The white boss \"don't plant taters and he don't plant cotton / and them that plants them are soon forgotten.\"\n\nThanks to \"Ol' Man River,\" we can move from \"Dixie,\" the popular song most associated with the Confederacy and Jim Crow, to \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" one of the songs most associated with civil rights, in just two steps.\n\nOne way of reading this story is to note that racism isn't the only thing that lingers in America. Musical forms also persist. Sometimes, the old tunes will be tools that we can use-recycled or repurposed, sampled for the dance floor or shouted in a crowd, to aid in work that still needs to be done. In \"A Change Is Gonna Come,\" Sam Cooke moves from bigotry and bloodshed to hope and beauty in barely three minutes. But his song was a long time coming, its genesis stretching a hundred and fifty years and longer, from \"Blowin' in the Wind\" to \"No More Auction Block,\" from \"Ol' Man River\" all the way back to \"Dixie,\" and through countless other songs and people besides. Listen to the record today and you can hear a story that's ongoing. Cooke's rough, sweet voice-blues-born and church-bred, beat down but up again and marching-still rings.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Myth of the Dangerous Traffic Stop Is Killing Black Men in America\n\nOn Sunday, a police officer shot and killed Daunte Wright, an unarmed Black man, after pulling him over for hanging an air freshener from his rearview mirror. Wright's death is just the latest instance of police assaulting and killing drivers-specifically, Black men who pose no danger-following a routine traffic stop. Philando Castile, Walter Scott, and Sam DuBose were all shot and killed by police after a traffic stop; none of them posed any danger to the officers who took their lives.\n\nRacism surely plays a role here, but there is another reason so many appalling police shootings involve motorists: Law enforcement officers are taught that routine traffic stops pose extreme danger to their own lives. Courts have seized upon this idea to water down the constitutional rights of drivers, justifying police brutality on the grounds that officers must act quickly to protect themselves against the random violence that always lurks just around the corner.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThis theory has pervaded American law and law enforcement for decades. It is also untrue. In a 2019 article published in the Michigan Law Review, Jordan Blair Woods demonstrated that violence during traffic stops is, in fact, extremely rare. Woods, a professor at the University of Arkansas School of Law, also found that it is officers, not drivers, who frequently escalate those few stops that lead to actual violence. In a forthcoming article in the Stanford Law Review, Woods proposes removing police from traffic enforcement altogether to prevent more violence against motorists, especially Black civilians, during traffic stops. On Thursday, we spoke about his articles, which are tragically topical in light of Wright's killing. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMark Joseph Stern: What's the \"danger narrative\" about traffic stops, and where did it originate?\n\nJordan Blair Woods: Traffic stops are the most common way that people come into contact with police. The Supreme Court has traditionally deferred to the authority of police to order people out of vehicles, the authority of police to take action without questioning their judgment. And a lot of that is grounded in this narrative, this myth, that routine traffic stops are especially dangerous settings for the police. That narrative dates back to a study that Allen Bristow published in 1963 which put out the figure that one in every three police killings involves a traffic stop. The Supreme Court credited that study in a 1977 case called Pennsylvania v. Mimms . Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, and was one of the voices that called attention to some of the problems with the data that the Supreme Court was relying on. His basic point was that the data was being used in a way that didn't support the conclusions that the court was coming to. And I think he was right. Bristow's research has been distorted to perpetuate these danger narratives.\n\nWhat happened after the Supreme Court blessed this \"danger narrative\"?\n\nOver the next few decades, there were a lot of cases where the Supreme Court cited cases like Mimms to put forth the general idea that routine traffic stops are especially dangerous settings for police officers. Over time, the myth became a key justification for why the court will defer to officers' decisions on the grounds of officer safety. Courts don't want to second-guess these decisions, and instead say that officer safety is a justification that leans in favor of allowing police to do what they're doing. And it becomes very difficult for stopped drivers and passengers to bring a Fourth Amendment claim when courts are deferring to what the officers are doing on officer safety grounds.\n\nAnd as you write in your article, the narrative seeped into the culture of law enforcement, too.\n\nThis narrative has infiltrated law enforcement departments and culture. One of the ways we see this happening is with regard to officer training. Now it is very common that when officers are going through training, they see video clips of random traffic stops that look fairly routine, and drivers randomly shooting an officer or using random violence. And what agencies are trying to get across to officers is that if you're hesitant to use force and you're not aware at every second during a routine traffic stop, this is what the traffic stop will evolve into.\n\nThis training frames how you come to think about doing traffic stops yourself. You're told that no traffic stop is routine and you never know who you're stopping. That affects how you approach interacting with stopped drivers and passengers. It might mean you're too quick to take aggressive actions that escalate the situation. What I've tried to do in my research is point out the ways in which framing routine traffic stops as especially dangerous actually fuels escalation.\n\nHow did you conduct your study, and what did you find?\n\nI looked at traffic stops between 2005 and 2014 in Florida, because Florida has such comprehensive public records law. I looked at the incidents that resulted in violence and contacted law enforcement agencies to figure out what generally went down during each of these incidents. What I ended up finding was that the danger narrative about traffic stops that is commonly perpetuated in courts and law enforcement circles isn't supported by empirical research. What I found is that overall, violence against officers during traffic stops was fairly infrequent and the incidents that did happen were generally low-risk and didn't involve weapons.\n\nUsing my most conservative estimates, I found that the rate for felonious killing of an officer during routine traffic stops was 1 in every 6.5 million stops. The rate for an assault resulting in serious injury to an officer was 1 in every 361,111 stops. The rate for assault against an officer, whether it results in injury or not, was 1 in every 6,959 stops. The least conservative estimates suggest that the rates are much less: 1 in every 27.6 million stops for a killing, 1 in every 1.53 million stops involving an assault that results in serious injury to an officer, and 1 in every 29,550 stops for an assault against an officer, whether it resulted in officer injury or not.\n\nThe bottom line is the idea that routine traffic stops are these exceptionally dangerous events for police didn't pan out with my results.\n\nWhat did you find about the stops that did escalate?\n\nThere were many stops that came up in my research where the officers did much more than just stop the vehicle, ask for a driver's license and registration, check the documents, write the ticket or issue a warning, and go on their way. Instead, they escalated the situation. Officers put their hands inside of the car window. They touched a driver. They told them to get out of the car. They used an aggressive tone. The ways in which officers decide to exercise their authority can escalate a stop, especially in overpoliced communities that might be really fearful of the police.\n\nIn your most recent article, you propose a solution to the problems we've been discussing. What is it?\n\nWe tend to think of situations when police are mistreating and even killing stopped civilians as problems with officer training or maybe having a bad apple in the bunch. But the root problem is more of a structural issue of police being involved in traffic enforcement in the first place. The goal of the piece is to outline the ways in which police involvement in traffic enforcement has resulted in decades of overpolicing and overcriminalization and harm to communities of color. I try to provide a path forward: Here's what a traffic system in which traffic regulation is happening without the police would look like. I want to push against intuition that it's impossible for traffic regulation to happen without police.\n\nAnd what does that look like in practice?\n\nI think the best approach is to have unarmed civil agents be the ones handling traffic enforcement, rather than armed police officers. Right now, traffic stops are not really just about traffic. We know that for decades officers and law enforcement agencies have used traffic stops as a tool of criminal investigations. The optimal solution is to actually make traffic stops about the traffic violation. If we go back to a situation where the traffic stop is just about traffic, a lot of those sensationalized fears around the dangers of the traffic stop would go away.\n\nCan you say more about how traffic stops aren't just about traffic?\n\nThere's a deep history of officers using low-level crimes to search for evidence of a more serious crime that they have no probable cause or reasonable suspicion for. The traffic stop has really turned into a key tool of criminal enforcement. And Supreme Court decisions like Whren v. United States in 1996 put the rubber stamp on pretextual traffic stops. In Whren , the Supreme Court held if officers see a traffic violation, they're able to pull over that car even if their motivation for pulling over that car was entirely different. So you have officers able to conduct pretextual traffic stops, and most people they're pulling over are Black and brown.\n\nDoes using low-level crime, like traffic violations, as a pretext for invasive searches actually reduce crime?\n\nThe empirical evidence doesn't point in that direction. Several studies show that so many drivers, in particular Black and brown drivers, are stopped and searched and nothing is ever found. But the harms are real. The psychological and physical harms can be serious, not only for that stopped driver but their communities. The Supreme Court has played into this myth that traffic stops are just momentary inconveniences and not a big deal for the people who are stopped. As the tragic cases of unarmed Black men being killed during traffic stops show, that's just not true.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "\"We're in the Process of Mass Forgetting\"\n\n\"They're trying to George Floyd me,\" Keenan Anderson said as Los Angeles police pinned him to the ground on Jan. 3. While he was on the ground, they tased him six times over the course of 42 seconds .\n\nAnderson died in the hospital hours later, likely resulting from the incident , yet his story hasn't received as much attention as other police-involved killings of unarmed Black men-even though he is the cousin of one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, Patrisse Cullors.\n\nThe relatively muted response raises questions about what's happened in the past two and a half years, since George Floyd's murder sparked a national reckoning over race and policing.\n\n\"Has the public gotten busier since then? Crueler? More fickle? More tolerant of violence? More futile in our response to it?\" Ja'han Jones wrote for MSNBC. \"Where are the black Instagram squares, the corporate news releases claiming to stand for racial justice, the social media posts about white folks listening and learning about their privilege?\"\n\nThe underlying issue certainly hasn't gone away. Just days into the new year, Anderson was the third person of color killed by the LAPD alone. An ongoing analysis by The Washington Post found Black Americans are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white Americans-and in 2022, police killed the highest number of people on record.\n\nTo get some perspective on what has changed, and what hasn't, since George Floyd's murder, and the challenges facing efforts to end police violence, I spoke to Dr. Phillip Goff , co-founder and CEO of the Center for Policing Equity and a professor at Yale University. Here's our conversation, lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nShirin Ali: Why do you think the reaction to Keenan Anderson's death was more muted in comparison to similar cases, like George Floyd or Philando Castile?\n\nPhillip Goff : I think that is because we were distracted by a bumblebee. We've got George Santos , we have the failed attempts to choose a House speaker, the debt ceiling has hit. We're distracted. We're not paying attention to what's happening to Black people because there's anything else in the news. If you think about the names that you listed, all of them came at a time when there was space in the media ecosystem for a story about it. The other piece is that many of those stories had video attached, and the video was shocking. And the individual died right there at the scene. This is an individual who died in a hospital of cardiac arrest after multiple tasings. To the degree that there is video, it is not nearly as sensational, and it's happening at a time when we have a fairly saturated set of systems.\n\nDuring his encounter with police, Anderson called out for help. That's something we've seen in many police-involved killings, but more often than not the plea goes ignored. What do you make of that?\n\nThat's 1,000 percent correct. We see in some of our own research, Black folks are two to four times more likely to have force used on them than white folks in this country. We see the folks with serious mental illness are sometimes up to 12 times more likely to have force used on them than folks without. We probably shouldn't have armed responders to folks in mental crisis. But since we do have armed responders as the primary first responders to folks in mental crisis, they cannot possibly be trained to deal with them and de-escalate them the way that folks who have taken years of schooling and countless hours of training are taught to. We ended up with violence and punishment in response to mental health crises in places where we don't need it.\n\nI'm not suggesting that Keenan Anderson was in a mental health crisis per se. But, he literally said, \" please help me \" as the first words that are caught on camera. The result on the other end of it is that they tased him literally to death, because, according to police reports, he got scared that he might get killed by cops and so ran away. If you have ever been not quite in your right mind, and you did a thing that under other circumstances you wouldn't do because you were scared, right? I think that if anybody hasn't ever done that they haven't lived around humans. So it is absolutely the case that there are patterns of folks who are seeking help, who end up with law enforcement as the primary first and only responders and end up in a terrible situation, sometimes even in death.\n\nHow is it that we don't have other ways to help folks out? It's not just a pattern of traffic stops, it's a pattern across the country when you're living in places where you are vulnerable and you are asking for help. We have decided not to fund helpers, except when they come with the capacity to take life.\n\nMost recently, the police killing of George Floyd started this national conversation about police reform. Do you think there's been significant progress since then?\n\nGeorge Floyd's lynching in 2020 sort of reignited a conversation we've been having, since the founding of the country. I don't want anybody who reads this story to think that there was nothing, and then in 2020, all of a sudden it all started. Almost everybody remembers Ferguson, which was prior to that. Many people will also remember Trayvon Martin, which was both about policing and not about policing, and was a mere couple years before that. Many of your readers will remember the early '90s and what happened in Los Angeles after the verdict in the Rodney King beating . We actually do this in this country every 20 to 30 years. Before Rodney King, there was the Kerner Commission report in the late 1960s that said the reason we have these terrible incidents around race and policing is because we have systematically underinvested in the communities that tend to have a disproportionate number of descendants of former slaves.\n\nSo it's a cycle that we go through. We're currently in this period of the cycle that happens every 20 to 30 years, where we're in the process of mass forgetting. In another 20 to 30 years from now, unless somehow the cycle has picked up speed, we're going to say, oh, I remember that person and when they were killed and when that started it. George Floyd just reignited a pattern that we have in the United States. That said, I do see at every 30-year interval, there are real changes, and we do a disservice to the men and women who spend their lives dedicated to making those changes real, not to acknowledge them.\n\nWe've seen places focus on reducing our reliance on systems of punishment when systems of care can prevent that need. In Denver, the STAR program , which sends out mental health responders instead of law enforcement, has been an overwhelming success, and many places have replicated that. Berkeley, California, was the first to eliminate police responses to low-level traffic incidents. Philadelphia and Seattle caught wind of that and tried to replicate it. Pittsburgh and Los Angeles tried to replicate what Philadelphia has done, but Los Angeles only did a pilot program . If that program were city-wide, Keenan Anderson might be alive today.\n\nBut those elements where we're ending the reliance on systems of punishment, where they're unnecessary or systems of care can replace them and prevent the need, that's good news. In St. Louis, Missouri, they're doing that kind of work where they're using the same sort of philosophy-instead of sending police they're sending help. All of these local successes are great. What we'll need as a nation are leaders to aggregate those successes up and start telling those stories. Otherwise, we end up with what we almost ended up with in the midterms: people fearmongering about crime , saying that policing is the only answer when police themselves know better, and then using that as a political cudgel and forgetting the very communities that are asking for something different.\n\nIn what areas do you think there still hasn't been enough change?\n\nOh, in all areas-there's no place where I feel like, \"oh, yeah, we're done with that.\" I'd say that there are some local communities that have got the right amount of urgency, indignation, and rigorousness in terms of analysis and implementation of policy. They're making some headway, but we are still generations away from making the kind of headway where we can say we have done all of the care that we can do. We have to fundamentally rethink how we're setting up our society, if we want to solve these problems, because these aren't just problems of policing and public safety. What we saw in 2020 was the past-due notice for the unpaid debts owed to generations of Black people for 400-plus years in this country. If all we end up doing is adjusting policing, we haven't even addressed the root cause of these issues. So nowhere are we close to being done.\n\nHow have efforts to implement police reforms and address racial inequities been stymied over the years?\n\nIt's not that there are people who want to change things and then there are people who are neutral. There are people who want to change things, and there are people who like the way things are. We used to have some protections for voting rights for Black people, and they needed to be spelled out explicitly because there were folks who were murdering folks who were trying to vote. The people who were doing the murdering had kids and were elected to public office, and many of them were also law enforcement. They didn't come out of the ether whenever the protesters showed up-those are citizens, they vote, they give money to causes.\n\nSo we've got a governor in Florida who does not want people to learn about segregation in Florida, and racial violence in Florida, because if people learned about the truth, it would be harder for them to erect their entire political apparatus, right? We have people who think the best way to manage vulnerable Black communities is to lock them up or commit acts of violence whenever they are in a place where they shouldn't be, where they violate a law that was made to give them opportunities to lock the folks up.\n\nThere are people who genuinely believe that's a good idea, and many of them will tell you, honestly in their heart, that it has nothing to do with race. That it's just the right way for society to work. So for sure, there are constant, organized, and well-funded efforts to move things in the wrong direction on these issues that persist.\n\nThe short answer to your question is not just yes, but hell yes. At every point in time, both while the protests are going, while progress is being made, and while there is a lull in that.\n\nIs there anything within this moment that gives you hope?\n\nI like to say that hope in the face of reality is a revolutionary act, and you try to be a revolutionary every day. If you give up hope, you should probably get out of the way of the people who are going to fuel the change that needs to come. So I have to hope every day. The things that are giving me hope right now, they're young people being activated to this stuff, who are going to learn not just about the principles that are unnecessary to replace the systems that we've got, but about the logistics that are necessary to put the policies in place. I'm excited about them. I'm a professor, so I get to talk to students all the time. Students are always energizing for the work that I do.\n\nPolice chiefs have been saying for a couple of decades now: you use us for everything and blame us for everything, stop doing it. But now, we got activists saying it and we got electeds saying it. There are countless folks around the country who are trying to figure out how we shrink our reliance on systems of punishment and increase our reliance on systems of care. The Center for Policing Equity has the \"unlocking democracy\" learning communities. It's 20 different municipalities who are trying to do that in four different areas of mental health, cops in schools, traffic accidents-exactly like the Keenan Anderson incident-and street violence. These are five elements in each of the five municipalities trying to shrink their reliance on systems of punishment. None of it is perfect, and there's going to be a whole bunch of folks who get it wrong. But that is a commitment to this idea that we have to find new ways and new systems, that's going to make the uprisings that come 20 or 30 years from now so much more effective at getting political change than the ones that we've seen over the last 20 to 30 years.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "No, Feminism Is Not the Cause of Police Shootings\n\nDr. Ben Carson argues that police shootings aren't the fault of the police, but of feminists.\n\nPhoto by Laura Segall/Getty Images\n\nWhen cops gun down unarmed black men (or, in some cases, children ), conservatives cast around desperately for someone besides the actual triggerman to blame. Now conservative commentator and Fox News stalwart Dr. Ben Carson has stumbled on an exciting anyone-but-the-shooter scapegoat: feminists. Carson was being interviewed by phone on American Family Radio's \"Today's Issues\" to elaborate on his theory that police shootings are the result of insufficient deference to authority on the part of young black men.\n\n\"Certainly in a lot of our inner cities, in particular the black inner cities where 73 percent of the young people are born out of wedlock, the majority of them have no father figure in their life,\" Carson said, ignoring the fact that Ferguson, where the shooting of Mike Brown that kicked off this discussion happened, is hardly an \"inner city\"-it's actually a suburb of St. Louis. \"Usually the father figure is where you learn how to respond to authority. So now you become a teenager, you're out there, you really have no idea how to respond to authority, you eventually run into the police or you run into somebody else in the neighborhood who also doesn't know how to respond but is badder than you are, and you get killed or you end up in the penal system.\"\n\nHost Lauren Kitchen Stewards jumped in to widen the discussion and talk about how the kids these days are irredeemable screw-ups, regardless of race. \"My husband and I talk about the importance of teaching our children not only biblical principles, but one of those being to respect authority. Because you're doing them a favor when they learn to go, OK, that person's an authority over me.\" She added, \"I've been aghast, especially at this generation, the sense of entitlement that just dominates all that they are.\" Presumably, by \"this generation\" who disrespects authority, she doesn't mean the older folks playing at being revolutionaries in tri-cornered hats because they don't like the president, but those wicked millennials who feel entitled to not be shot by cops.\n\nCarson wholeheartedly agreed and put the blame on, where else, the '60s and, of course, feminists:\n\nI think a lot of it really got started in the '60s with the \"me generation.\" \"What's in it for me?\" I hate to say it, but a lot of it had to do with the women's lib movement. You know, \"I've been taking care of my family, I've been doing that, what about me?\" You know, it really should be about us.\n\nYou know what this means. Give up your independence and suffer unhappy marriages, ladies, or else it's your fault if your son is gunned down in the streets by an overly aggressive police officer.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "A Big New Study Says Police Officers Are No More Likely to Shoot Black Suspects. Should You Believe It?\n\nMark Wallheiser/Getty Images\n\nIs getting stopped by the police really more dangerous if you're black?\n\nA new study , which tore up several corners of the internet Monday thanks to an elaborate write-up in the New York Times , is offering a complicated answer to that exceedingly fraught question. It finds that while blacks and Hispanics are in fact more likely than whites to experience nonlethal force after being stopped by law enforcement, they are not more likely to be shot. The paper's author, Harvard economist Roland Fryer, called it \"the most surprising result of my career,\" and at first glance his conclusions seem to clash with the steady beat of stories about unarmed black men being gunned down by police that has fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. And given the last week's tragedies in Baton Rouge, Minnesota, and Dallas, the study has also landed at a really, really raw moment.\n\nSo what do we make of the findings?\n\nIn short, they're interesting, but have some important limitations, which Fryer, a MacArthur genius grant winner who was the youngest black professor to ever earn tenure at Harvard, is very open about. As he puts it, \"this paper takes first steps into the treacherous terrain of understanding the nature and extent of racial differences in police use of force.\" It's not meant to be the last word, nor should anybody treat it that way.\n\nData about law enforcement's use of force are notoriously spotty. But the Washington Post , which has created a database to track police shootings, has found that black people make up a disproportionate percentage of victims in lethal police shootings. The question is: Why? Is it because blacks are more likely to have run-ins with law enforcement? Or are police more likely to open fire on black suspects?\n\nFryer's findings seem to support the former theory. Much of his analysis is based on a large, random sample of arrest reports from the city of Houston, each of which his team analyzed for 300 different variables. The cases all involved a crime where, theoretically, the use of lethal force might have been legally justifiable in some circumstances-ranging from attempted murder of an officer down to resisting arrest. Based on the raw data, the researchers find that black and Hispanic suspects were in fact less likely to be shot in these confrontations than whites. After controlling for a comprehensive set of factors such as whether or not the suspect was found with a weapon, they find no statistically significant difference in the likelihood of suspects being shot based on their race.\n\nWhat about in other cities? Along with Houston, Fryer and his team collected police reports on more than 1,000 shootings involving officers in Los Angeles, Dallas, Austin, Orlando, Jacksonville, and four smaller counties in Florida. Of course, these documents tell us nothing about whether cops in these locales are more likely overall to use their guns on blacks than whites, given that all of the cases involve a weapon being fired. But they do tell us about the circumstances under which officers decide to employ lethal force. After controlling for all the circumstances surrounding the incidents, such as the kind of crime involved or the time of day, Fryer found that police were 47 percent less likely to shoot black suspects who hadn't already attacked them compared with whites. And they were 43 percent less likely to fire on Hispanics, compared with whites.\n\nWhen it came to nonlethal force, Fryer's results were quite different. Analyzing records from New York's stop-and-frisk program that spanned the years 2000 to 2013, he found strong evidence that black suspects were more likely to be grabbed, pushed to the ground, handcuffed without being arrested, have a weapon drawn on them, be pepper-sprayed, or hit with a baton. This was still the case when controlling for variables such as where the stop took place and the age or gender of the suspect. An analysis of data from the national Police-Public Contact Survey, which asks a nationally representative sample of Americans about their experience with law enforcement every three years, yielded similar results.\n\nAll of this opens up an obvious question: Why would police officers be more likely to get rough with black and Hispanic subjects, but not more likely to fire on them? Fryer suggests it might be a matter of stakes. In theory, police stand to lose a lot more if they shoot the wrong guy than if they give him a blow with a nightstick. But there isn't hard proof for that narrative, and frankly, given how rarely police appear to be punished after shootings, it's not especially satisfying. It also doesn't explain why police officers would be more restrained about shooting minorities before being attacked, compared with whites. Are they only able to keep biases in check when holding a gun? It's all a little puzzling.\n\nThen, of course, there are those limitations. First, much of the data on shootings comes from major cities with large black populations, which might be more sensitive about race issues in policing. This is especially striking when you consider that the most famous shooting of recent years took place in Ferguson, Missouri, a small, inner-ring suburb with its own police department. \"It is possible that these departments only supplied the data because they are either enlightened or were not concerned about what the analysis would reveal,\" Fryer writes. \"In essence, this is equivalent to analyzing labor market discrimination on a set of firms willing to supply a researcher with their Human Resources data!\" Who knows how the situation may look in other cities or towns. \"Relatedly, even police departments willing to supply data may contain police officers who present contextual factors at that time of an incident in a biased manner,\" Fryer adds-which is a polite researcher's way of saying that the study relies on reports written by officers who may well be lying about what really transpired.\n\nReaders also need to be cautious about how they interpret the findings. Once again, Fryer suggests blacks and Hispanics are no more likely to be shot than whites after they've been stopped by police. But as a few sharp writers have noted Monday, that doesn't tell us anything about whether people of color are being stopped excessively in the first place. And in parts of the country, they almost certainly are. In one-third white Ferguson, blacks made up 93 percent of arrests and 85 percent of traffic stops. Philando Castile was stopped by cops 52 times in 14 years before he was shot and killed by an officer in Minnesota last week. Fryer's paper may simply be telling us that deadly bias in American policing has less to do with how cops decide to pull the trigger and more to do with how they interact with the community overall. Hopefully, researchers will be able to replicate his in-depth analysis of Houston in many more cities to give us a better sense of whether that is actually the case.\n\nEven if police are only biased when it comes to the use of, say, hurling suspects to the ground-that's not exactly something to celebrate. Fryer put it excellently to the Times :\n\n\"Who the hell wants to have a police officer put their hand on them or yell and scream at them? It's an awful experience,\" he said. \" I 've had it multiple, multiple times . Every black man I know has had this experience. Every one of them. It is hard to believe that the world is your oyster if the police can rough you up without punishment. And when I talked to minority youth, almost every single one of them mentions lower level uses of force as the reason why they believe the world is corrupt.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Actually, Blacks Do Care About Black Crime\n\nPhoto by Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn cities across the country, crowds are protesting police violence against unarmed black men. Demonstrators want justice, not just for Michael Brown, but for Eric Garner , John Crawford , and Tamir Rice , the 12-year-old boy killed by Cleveland police last month. To that end, they've stopped parades and blocked highways in an effort to show the value of a black life.\n\nBut to some critics, this outrage is misplaced. \"Somebody has to tell me, something somebody needs to tell me why Michael Brown has been chosen as the face of black oppression,\" said MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on Monday morning, during his daily show. His co-panelist, Donny Deutsch, agreed. \"It's not a black-white situation. It's a thug-police officer situation,\" he said. \"Where are the angry crowds demanding justice for blacks such as these, who were wiped out in St. Louis by other blacks in recent memory?\" wonders Deroy Murdock in a column for National Review . \"One can hear birds chirp while listening for public outcry over the deaths of black citizens killed by black perpetrators. Somehow, these black lives don't seem to matter,\" writes Murdock, who doesn't note that- in those cases -perpetrators are usually caught and convicted. And then there's former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who-after President Obama spoke on Ferguson- told CNN that \"[Obama] also should have spent 15 minutes on training the [black] community to stop killing each other.\"\n\nThis basic question-\"Where is all the outrage over black-on-black crime?\"-is raised whenever black Americans protest a police shooting, or any other violence against unarmed black men. \"Nationally, nearly half of all murder victims are black,\" wrote conservative commentator Juan Williams after Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012, \"And the overwhelming majority of those black people are killed by other black people. Where is the march for them?\"\n\nThere are huge problems with \"black-on-black crime\" as a construct, mostly dealing with the banality of intra-racial crime, the foolishness of attributing violent criminality to blackness-rather than particular conditions faced by some black people-and the injustice of treating all blacks as criminally suspect because of the actions of a small minority.\n\nLet's ignore those.\n\nInstead, let's look directly at the question raised by Murdock, Giuliani, and Williams-\"Do black people care about crime in their neighborhoods?\" They treat it as a rhetorical concern-a prelude to broad statements about black American concerns. But we should treat it as an empirical question-an issue we can resolve with some time and research.\n\nThis isn't as easy as it sounds. While blacks are more likely to face criminal victimization than other groups, that doesn't tell us how black Americans feel about crime and where it ranks as a problem for their communities. For that, we have to look to public opinion surveys and other research. And while it's hard to draw a conclusive answer, all the available evidence points to one answer: Yes, black people are concerned with crime in their neighborhoods.\n\nFirst, a little context: In the last 20 years, we've seen a sharp drop in homicide among blacks, from a victimization rate of 39.4 homicides per 100,000 in 1991 to a rate of roughly 20 homicides per 100,000 in 2008. Likewise, the offending rate for blacks has dropped from 51.1 offenders per 100,000 in 1991 to 24.7 offenders per 100,000 in 2008. This decrease has continued through the 2010s and is part of a larger-and largely unexplained -national drop in crime.\n\nBut while black neighborhoods are far less dangerous than they were a generation ago, black people are still concerned with victimization. Take this 2014 report from the Sentencing Project on perceptions of crime and support for punitive policies. Using data from the University of Albany's Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, the Sentencing Project found that-as a group-racial minorities are more likely than whites to report an \"area within a mile of their home where they would be afraid to walk alone at night\" (41 percent to 30 percent) and more likely to say there are certain neighborhoods they avoid, which they otherwise might want to go to (54 percent to 46 percent). And among black Americans in particular-circa 2003-\"43 percent said they were 'very satisfied' about their physical safety in contrast to 59 percent of Hispanics, and 63 percent of whites.\"\n\nMore recent data shows a similar picture. In 2012, Gallup found that , compared to the general public, blacks were more worried about \"being attacked\" while driving their car, more worried about being the victim of a hate crime, and-most salient for our discussion-more worried about \"being murdered.\" Likewise, according to a 2013 survey for NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard School of Public Health, 26 percent of black Americans rank crime as the most important issue facing the area they live. That's higher than the ranking for the economy (16 percent), housing (4 percent), the environment (7 percent), social issues (4 percent), and infrastructure (7 percent). And in a recently published survey for Ebony magazine and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 13 percent rank violent crime as a top issue-which sits in the middle of the rankings-and 48 percent say that the black community is losing ground on the issue.\n\nFinally, Atlantic Media's \" State of the City \" poll-published this past summer-shows an \"urban minority\" class that's worried about crime, and skeptical toward law enforcement, but eager for a greater police presence if it means less crime. Just 22 percent of respondents say they feel \"very safe\" walking in their neighborhoods after dark, and only 35 percent say they have \"a lot\" of confidence in their local police. That said, 60 percent say hiring more police would have a \"major impact\" on improving safety in their neighborhoods. And while \"urban minority\" includes a range of different groups, there's a good chance this is representative of black opinion in some areas of high crime and victimization, given the large black presence in many American cities.\n\nIt's important to note that this concern with crime doesn't translate to support for punitive policies. Despite high victimization rates, black Americans are consistently opposed to harsh punishments and greater incarceration . Instead, they support more education and job training.\n\nBeyond the data, there's the anecdotal evidence. And in short, it's easy to find examples of marches and demonstrations against crime. In the last four years, blacks have held community protests against violence in Chicago; New York; Newark, New Jersey; Pittsburgh; Saginaw, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana. Indeed, there's a whole catalog of movies, albums, and sermons from a generation of directors, musicians, and religious leaders, each urging peace and order. You may not have noticed black protests against crime and violence, but that doesn't mean they haven't happened. Black Americans-like everyone else-are concerned with what happens in their communities, and at a certain point, pundits who insist otherwise are either lying or willfully ignorant.\n\nTo that point, it's worth noting the extent to which \"what about black-on-black crime\" is an evasion, an attempt to avoid the fundamental difference between being killed by a citizen and being killed by an agent of law. And it's not new. \"When Ida B. Wells ... tried to explain to a wealthy suffragist in Chicago that anti-black violence in the nation must end,\" writes historian Khalil Gibran Muhammad for The Nation , \"Mary Plummer replied: Blacks need to \"drive the criminals out\" of the community. 'Have you forgotten that 10 percent of all the crimes that were committed in Chicago last year were by colored men [less than 3 percent of the population]?' \"\n\nRegardless of cause or concern, a community doesn't forfeit fair treatment because it has crime. That was true then when the scourge was lynching, and it's true now that the scourge is unjust police violence. Say what you will about \"black-on-black crime,\" just don't pretend it has anything to do with unfair killings at the hands of the state.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "More Guns, More Fear, More Killings\n\nMark Wallheiser/Getty Images\n\nPhilando Castile worked as the cafeteria supervisor at the school where one of our friends sends his kids. Phil, as he was known, was reportedly widely beloved. He is dead , the latest in a growing number of black men killed by the police during a routine traffic stop, this one reportedly over a broken taillight.\n\nMuch has already been said about the role of race in these shootings. As Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said plainly this week: \"Would this have happened if those passengers or driver were white? I don't think it would have.\" Neither do we. As President Obama observed, echoing Justice Sonia Sotomayor's powerful dissent in Utah v. Strieff , deaths like Phil's are not isolated incidents. Rather, \"they're symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system.\"\n\nWhile there's no denying that race played a critical role in Phil's death, we think it's also worth highlighting the way his case is different than many of the others: He had a gun. According to his girlfriend's account , he voluntarily told the officer who stopped him that he had a gun, and she reportedly told the officer that he was licensed for concealed carry. ( Civilians are encouraged to volunteer this information in any interaction with the police). But evidently that didn't matter. As he reached for his wallet, the cop thought \"gun,\" and he started firing directly into the car. (It's important to note that we still don't have the officer's account of what happened, and there is no video of what transpired before Phil Castile was shot.)\n\nThis happened just a day after police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, killed another black man, 37-year-old Alton Sterling . Sterling also had a gun; he apparently purchased it almost immediately before the shooting in order to protect himself .\n\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from these two incidents, it's that the proliferation of guns promises to make already racialized policing far more deadly. As guns multiply, both police officers and civilians are ever more inclined to assume that everyone is carrying, and that assumption doesn't leave a lot of time for sober thought and clarifying discussion.\n\nThere are good reasons why some police organizations have expressed concerns about liberalizing gun laws. Police groups have long been aware that reforms like background checks make cops safer, and that castle and \"stand your ground\" laws can make their jobs more difficult.\n\nAs if we needed another sobering reminder, Thursday night's attack on police officers in Dallas -five officers are dead and seven more were injured-showed that police have difficult, ever more dangerous jobs. They are frequently placed in situations in which their lives are at risk, and they are, as the Supreme Court put it in the 1989 case Graham v. Connor , \"often forced to make split-second judgments-in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving-about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\" That very uncertainty is why the legal standard for the use of force by a police officer doesn't require them to be perfect. It permits them to use force, even deadly force, when they reasonably believe a suspect is a threat to them or to others.\n\nThere are a number of problems with the way this \"reasonableness\" standard has been applied to police officers, who are usually afforded enormous latitude by the courts. Clearly the proliferation of guns in our everyday lives only exacerbates the problem, just as it has in self-defense law more generally. In Texas, an open carry state, it's exceedingly difficult for police to discern who does and doesn't have the right to brandish a weapon , particularly in a volatile situation like the one we saw Thursday night. (That difficulty likely contributed to the Dallas Police Department identifying the wrong man as a suspect in the shooting.) Put most simply: In jurisdictions that make it ever easier for civilians to be armed, it becomes ever more reasonable for the police to suspect that anyone, and everyone, is armed. The unsurprising result? The reasonableness standard becomes a race to the bottom.\n\nEven if particular officer-involved shootings (like the shooting of Phil Castile) might seem unreasonable in isolation, it's going to be harder and harder to say that a police officer is acting unreasonably in assuming that the guy with the gun can kill him instantly. As professor Rachel Harmon at the University of Virginia law school points out in an email, police officers cannot know or care within a split second whether a gun in the hands of a suspect comes with a permit, or whether it's illegal: \"Police fear legally carried weapons as well as illegally carried ones. Since generous carry laws likely mean that police will encounter more armed individuals, even randomly, as in a traffic stop, it's time to think a lot more about the role gun carry laws might play in police fear and police shootings.\"\n\nThe continued proliferation of guns means that more civilian-police interactions in which guns are brandished will be resolved hastily and with deadly force. It also makes it ever more \"reasonable\" for police to assume guns are always present. It's a vicious circle.\n\nThese two trends-the increasing access to lethal weapons and a declining standard for reasonable fear by police-are on an indisputable collision course. We will either have more guns and therefore more police shootings, or we will somehow have to train police officers to believe that it is objectively unreasonable to be afraid of being shot in the split second they have to contend with an armed stranger. The shootings in Dallas are more likely to tilt the standard in the opposite direction and make officers more likely to think the people they encounter are out to do them harm.\n\nThis would all be an intractable problem on its own, but it becomes even deadlier when we layer in the obvious problem of implicit and explicit racial bias. Assumptions about the threat posed by a civilian suspect-and particularly assumptions about whether that person has a gun-will always affect people of color disproportionately. White men open-carrying might be terrifying to some of us, but they won't generate as many calls to the police as black men carrying guns. That racial disparity is also evident in statistics about police-involved shootings. A report from October 2014 by ProPublica showed that young black men are 21 times more likely to be shot by the police than young white men: \"The 1,217 deadly police shootings from 2010 to 2012 captured in the federal data show that blacks, age 15 to 19, were killed at a rate of 31.17 per million, while just 1.47 per million white males in that age range died at the hands of police.\" The disparity holds even for unarmed black men. A recent study found evidence of \"a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the probability of being black, unarmed, and shot by police was about 3.49 times the probability of being white, unarmed, and shot by police on average.\" So long as race correlates with poverty, and with living in high-crime neighborhoods, the vast disparity between lethal police shootings of black men and their white counterparts will persist.\n\nThe profoundly sad lesson of Louisiana and Minnesota is that it is now objectively reasonable for black civilians to be ever more afraid of routine traffic stops. The lesson of Dallas is that it is also objectively reasonable for cops to be ever more afraid of civilians with guns. So we have mistrust and fear and panic on both sides, both apparently reasonable. But what makes these encounters lethal-as opposed to merely ambiguous and fraught-is the guns. And what makes it \"reasonable\" to use force in response to the reasonable fear, is the lethality of guns. This ends only in more death on both sides, death all couched in legal standards of reasonableness. And that death will always be racially disproportionate.\n\nThis need not be a conversation about whether you \"support\" Black Lives Matter or whether you \"support\" law enforcement. Supporting both is the only rational answer , and reason suggests it's the very prevalence and lethality of guns that will continue to define legal \"reasonableness\" down.\n\nSee more of Slate's coverage of the Dallas shooting.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Prosecutors Shouldn't Wait for a National Tragedy to Hold Police Accountable\n\nThe anger and grief we are seeing in the streets is not solely about the killing of George Floyd. It derives from decades of abuses never acknowledged or addressed, decades of unwillingness to demand better, and decades of never holding police accountable while failing to put an end to policies that have destroyed entire families and communities. People are crying out because nothing seems to change. Police continue to abuse their power, yet almost never face meaningful consequences.\n\nProsecutors have an important role to play in breaking this cycle. We must treat officers like everyone else and show that no one is above the law. We have tried to do that in our cities. It is admittedly difficult. Police departments often fail to properly and thoroughly investigate shootings and other crimes committed by their officers. For instance, a report last year by the Philadelphia Inquirer uncovered \"secret\" police records showing that over 100 police officers had charges of misconduct dismissed or overturned by the police arbitration board that is charged internally with resolving investigations into officers for misconduct. Many prioritize protecting the \"blue wall of silence,\" the refusal to inform on another officer, even when that person has committed a crime, an act of misconduct, or even a shocking act of brutality. One of us has even investigated cases where officers were themselves victims of police violence, and they still refused to provide information about the incidents. There are numerous elected prosecutors across the country who have never prosecuted a police officer, even when the facts clearly call for it.\n\nBut prosecutors' power to hold police accountable is not limited to filing criminal charges when officers abuse their power. Prosecutors may not be able to fire police officers, but we can refuse to call officers with a history of misconduct or dishonest behavior as witnesses, and we can decline to accept criminal charges sought by them. An arrest, let alone a conviction, can upend a person's entire life. The potential harm is far too severe to rely on the word of a police officer who has been proven to be untrustworthy.\n\nOur offices have compiled exclusion lists of officers whose credibility is so damaged that we will not rely on them to testify in court or bring charges based on their word alone in any case. We felt it was our obligation to do so because if a police officer lacks integrity and honesty, the entire criminal justice system is compromised. In each case, the police force fought back. The local police unions in both Philadelphia and St. Louis filed lawsuits to, in essence, prevent the do-not-call lists from going into effect; they were more concerned with publicity stunts than finding ways to help the police department become a more trusted organization throughout the community. Thankfully, the courts found that a prosecutor has the inherent discretion to determine if a police officer's testimony would be trustworthy. Still, those police unions , like police unions in most jurisdictions across the country, continue to fight against every attempt to bring a semblance of accountability to the police force.\n\nPolice officers have too much power, and keeping officers who abuse that power on the force and relying on them in court destroys public trust and leads to even more damage down the road. Prosecutors should not wait to act until an out-of-control police officer causes a national tragedy. Most officers go to work each day and admirably perform their job. But every day, there are some officers who inflict unacceptable harms on communities by using racist or xenophobic language , fabricating evidence , being dishonest about their investigations, conducting illegal searches and seizures , and harassing and disrespecting the individuals they encounter. Too many prosecutors are content to simply look the other way.\n\nProsecutors cannot transform police culture alone. Our local officials and our police departments also need to take action. There need to be changes made to police union contracts so that our police chiefs can effectively discipline bad officers. We need to increase training for our officers so that they know how to accurately assess danger, and their instincts begin with how to de-escalate, not aggravate, potentially violent situations. And we need to stop asking the police to do so much. Right now, we rely on them to be mental health providers and family counselors and to solve substance use disorders. That isn't fair to them, or our community, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\nObviously, none of these solutions will fix the underlying racism that infects all of these issues. There is no question that black and brown people are overpoliced and they are harassed, arrested, abused, and killed disproportionately by the police. We must keep drawing attention to the systemic racism that undergirds policing and work throughout our communities to reform the entire system. But a first step in this long-overdue reckoning must be prosecutors using their discretion, authority, and responsibility to the communities they serve to root out the bad actors from our police forces.\n\nProsecutors have the authority to make those calls, and many are starting to wield that power in the last two weeks alone. But it should not have taken more killings of unarmed black men and national protests for this to occur. When prosecutors, police chiefs, and other elected officials do nothing, they send a message to these communities that their lives don't matter. It is no wonder people are so angry. It is long past time for all of us to recognize that turning a blind eye to police misconduct and violence makes our communities less safe. We must commit to building a country that truly cares and values the life of each and every person.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "We Can't Just Replace Cops With Social Workers\n\nIn the past several weeks, amid unprecedented protests responding to recent high-profile deaths of unarmed Black men and women at the hands of police, Americans' opinion on law enforcement has profoundly shifted . Large-scale reform suddenly seems like a distinct possibility. One common refrain on social media and elsewhere suggests that we replace cops with social workers. This has largely taken the form of a broad gesture, with people intuiting that social workers, who are trained to nonviolently aid those in crisis might have a better hope of resolving problems than cops, but professional associations for social workers have joined the chorus too. The National Association of Social Workers itself gestured toward this idea in a June 16 tweet : \" @realDonaldTrump signed an executive order calling for more police training. #socialworkers will be integral: 'This is what they have studied and worked on all their lives. We will have the best of them put in our police departments...' \" The New York chapter of the NASW was even more direct, posting a since-deleted graphic stating, \"social workers belong in police departments.\" But as a social worker myself, I greet this newfound zeal for our work with some suspicion and reluctance. In order to fully understand why, it helps to know something about the history of my discipline.\n\nThe United States only began widespread social programs to aid the disenfranchised during the Great Depression. Before then, most forms of aid were administered through private benevolent societies funded by the upper class. These funds were most often distributed by members of the societies, primarily women, known as \"friendly visitors.\" They would visit the poor where they lived and try to encourage them to lift themselves out of poverty through a combination of personal stories and moral persuasion while helping dispense some aid. They did provide some relief, but the problems with the model are starkly obvious: They did little to challenge the systems that made such people poor in the first place and were mainly focused on assuaging the guilt of the privileged.\n\nOther proto-social workers resisted this model, believing that to be effective, one must live in the community in which one works. Jane Addams, founder of Hull House in Chicago, is perhaps the most representative of this approach. Addams founded Hull House in 1889, and over time, the organization compiled a variety of services to aid the working-class immigrants who were its neighbors: kindergarten and day care facilities, an art gallery, libraries, art classes, and an employment bureau, among others. Addams was an outspoken public intellectual and pacifist, and she would be rewarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931 for her efforts. She was also a eugenicist, a position she shared with many other early social workers and supposed progressives in the early part of the 20 th century. Addams and others were attracted to the scientific veneer of eugenics and saw it as a way to prevent the widespread suffering they routinely witnessed.\n\nThe efforts of the friendly visitors and the settlement house residents combined over time to form the discipline of social work. Colleagues of Addams' founded the graduate school where I received my training and now teach, the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago, formerly known as the Social Science Center for Practical Training in Philanthropy and Social Work, before it merged with the university in 1920. While there are obvious differences in how we practice today, some features of those earlier efforts have been retained: Many social workers, whether case workers or child protection advocates, visit clients in their homes to offer them services to lift them out of their current situations in some manner. Just as before, the majority of social workers are white, and often the people that we serve are not. There remains an inescapable element of the outsider parachuting in to help the poor and deserving before returning to their homes. None of this is news to most contemporary social workers; these are active conversations we are having at our work, in schools, and across social media. Switching police officers with social workers would do nothing to address the fundamental disparities poisoning the criminal justice system; we would still have a mostly white professional class primarily working with people of color.\n\nMore serious proposals for reform have proposed shifting some resources from the police to social workers, so that we could answer calls for people in a mental health crisis. Many cities have tried variations on this approach , and it tends to work pretty well. Police tend to be used to fill in gaps in the public sector, but there is no clear reason why people trained to use force need respond to those in a mental health crisis, or those experiencing homelessness. Social workers and other trained professionals are much more equipped to offer targeted assistance, are much less likely to escalate the situation, and offer solutions that are much more cost effective.\n\nThe swap is not sufficient, however. Perhaps most obviously, it's not always immediately obvious if a person is experiencing a mental health crisis, or if something else is going on. Here is an example, from my neighborhood: Two years ago, police responded to calls that an individual was breaking windows in an alley. They found Charles Thomas , then a fourth-year student at the University of Chicago, in the midst of a likely manic episode caused by his bipolar disorder. The police seemed to have some idea of this, as one of them shouted, \"We have a mental\" at one point, but that did not stop the officers from shooting him when they reported that he ran toward them and they felt threatened. Thomas survived but was charged with two felonies, and his legal woes are ongoing.\n\nHaving social workers integrated into a police department would not have stopped the cops from shooting Charles Thomas. They most likely would not have answered the call because it was not immediately apparent that he was in a mental health crisis, and even if they were present, it is not at all clear that their voices would be regarded above those of the police officers. Social workers would not have prevented the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, or countless others, because these situations are not the results of police not understanding mental health issues but of police not understanding policing. Social workers are also limited by the constraints of our social safety net; we can only refer them to mental health treatment or housing solutions if such resources exist in the first place. The solution to the problem of modern policing cannot only be having social workers work alongside police or respond to people in mental health crises, for the problem is modern policing itself. Any suggestion for reform that falls short of a wholesale reinvention of what the police do and how exactly they serve us falls short. At worst, it drafts social workers into an unjust system to provide a putative stamp of approval for their actions.\n\nSocial work is in the midst of its own reform efforts; after a swift outcry to the NASW's tweet, it has backed away from any gesture of approval. While I hope that we can contribute to solving the issue of police brutality, we are not the answer. A temptation that has been present within social work from the beginning is to offer a thin veneer of respectability to systems that must be radically reimagined. We should seize the momentum of our moment and not settle for any such compromises. The first step is to begin listening to Black and brown Americans as they share their stories and their efforts at reform; anything less merely continues the dynamics of white supremacy that have led us to this problem in the first place.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Privilege of 911\n\nOn Tuesday, a white graduate student at Yale called the police to report that one of her black classmates was napping in a dorm common area. The ensuing encounter between the police and the student, Lolade Siyonbola, who is getting a master's degree in African studies, was captured in a video that has drawn national attention to the case.\n\nIt's the latest in a string of recent incidents in which white Americans have called the police on their black neighbors for nothing at all: In Philadelphia, it was Starbucks while black . In Rialto, California, Airbnb while black . And in New Haven, Connecticut, trying to pull an all-nighter while black .\n\nAt the core of each incident is white Americans' deep suspicion and mistrust of their black neighbors. The most infamous example of this dynamic occurred in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012, when neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman called the police on 17-year-old Trayvon Martin before stalking him, confronting him, and killing him. (The Sanford Police Department told Zimmerman not to follow Martin; Zimmerman was ultimately acquitted on charges of second-degree murder.) But more mundane displays of this regularly play out on forums like NextDoor , a website for neighborhood news and activism where interest gravitates, tabloid-style, towards perceived disorder and its perpetrators.\n\nWhat warrants a call to the police? In 2014, writing in the aftermath to the death of Eric Garner, who died in an illegal police chokehold while being detained for selling cigarettes in Staten Island, New York, Emily Bazelon made the case that white people ought to avoid calling the police on black people in non-emergency situations, given the increased risks they face from law enforcement. \"It's become pretty much a given for me that if the criminal justice system gets a hold of a black person, especially if he is poor, there is a terrible, heightened risk that it will try to crush him,\" she wrote. It's fair to assume Bazelon's strategy has become more prevalent among liberal whites as videos and reports of police brutality become more and more common.\n\nThis recent spate of 911 calls gone awry may prompt renewed ethical debates at dinner parties in Center City Philadelphia or New Haven, a reflection of an expanding awareness of a national crisis of confidence in police. But, as ever, liberal whites are a little late to the issue, which is not just that the police are being called too often, but also that many people don't trust law enforcement enough to call 911 at all. For minorities, immigrants, and lower-income Americans, as well as those living with mental illness, the legitimacy of the police has been in question for years. Whites are abusing a privilege those people don't even have. In many places, the police are being called less often , not more, than a trusted force should be.\n\nIn 2016, a team of sociologists analyzed more than a million 911 calls made over a period of seven years in Milwaukee. The idea was to discern how the brutal 2004 beating of Frank Jude, a black man leaving a party in a white neighborhood, and subsequent police cover-up would have affected black confidence in calling the MPD. They found that calls to police dropped steeply after the Jude beating, especially in black neighborhoods. And 911 calls also dropped in black neighborhoods after two other high-profile police shootings, one of which-the 2006 killing of Sean Bell by plainclothes and undercover NYPD officers-occurred more than 1,000 miles away.\n\n\"High-profile cases of excessive police force constitute a severe breach in the social contract that exists between citizens and the criminal justice system,\" the researchers concluded . \"That breach is so sudden and violent when unarmed black men are beaten or killed that virtually no institutional response, from public apologies to sanctioning offending officers, can swiftly repair it.\" The result was a city where crimes went unreported and witnesses were less likely to come forward. The six-month period in 2005 after Jude's story was reported in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel saw a 32 percent increase in homicides over the previous and subsequent year, the deadliest spring and summer over the seven-year period.\n\nFamilies of those with mental illness have long said that police forces are ill-trained to respond to reports of people- especially minorities -who may not be able to submit to their orders. Last month, police in New York shot and killed Saheed Vassell, a Brooklyn man who struggled with bipolar disorder. Three locals called 911 reporting that Vassell was threatening people with what appeared to be a gun; after he was shot, the object was revealed to be a pipe. The New York Daily News reported on other New Yorkers with loved ones who struggled with mental illness. Even those who fear that their relatives will hurt themselves or those around them are reluctant to make 911 calls.\n\nThis problem has been compounded by the lax and inconsistent application of federal law protecting disabled people from police violence. The Americans with Disabilities Act clearly requires law enforcement officers to accommodate mentally ill individuals-by, for instance, refraining from pulling the trigger when a disabled person does not immediately respond to a verbal command. But while lower courts have confirmed and enforced this rule, the Supreme Court has yet to resolve it definitively . That ambiguity has allowed officers to flout their obligations under the ADA. Nearly half of police shooting victims are mentally ill.\n\nResidents of low-income communities have other reasons to hesitate before calling the cops. Across the country, \"nuisance laws\" trigger penalties for residents who make multiple 911 calls, discouraging victims of domestic violence from reporting their abusers. Landlords receive fines for addresses that draw multiple police visits, and usually respond by evicting tenants. (The ACLU has sued to overturn nuisance laws in several places, but they remain popular among municipal leaders.) In addition to penalizing survivors of domestic abuse, an Ohio study found that nuisance designations tend to fall on people \"experiencing mental health crises and residents seeking medical assistance to prevent a fatal drug overdose,\" expanding the group of people who have strong incentives not to call the police.\n\nAnother group that's not calling the police: immigrants. Beginning in the George W. Bush years, city and county police departments established \"287(g)\" agreements with the Department of Homeland Security, which deputized beat cops to serve as immigration police. Many of these agreements were phased out during the Obama administration, but they've come roaring back under Trump as part of the president's efforts to turn Immigration and Customs Enforcement into a ruthlessly efficient deportation force.\n\nUndocumented immigrants may thus have good reason not to trust their local police. Some have called 911 to report a crime and instead wound up detained by ICE . Some conservative states like Texas have passed laws that force every police officer to act as an immigration agent. The results have been predictable: According to a recent survey, undocumented Mexican immigrants in San Diego said they would be 60 percent less likely to report a crime if they knew local police were working with ICE, and 43 percent less likely to report being a victim of a crime. ICE activity at courthouses has further discouraged immigrants from cooperating with local law enforcement, which is one reason police chiefs have defended \"sanctuary city\" measures as law-and-order policies that build trust in immigrant communities rather than degrade it.\n\nWhat these accounts show is that while well-off white people may call the police too frequently, we won't solve this problem by discouraging them from doing so. Bad laws, bad police, and a bad criminal justice system have already had a chilling effect on trust in law enforcement. Yes, the student who called the cops on Lolade Siyonbola was partly at fault. But so, too, were the officers who treated her like a legitimate suspect, seeming to assume her guilt.\n\nThings being what they are, white people should think long and hard before calling the police on a minority. Many of us have been inculcated with a vision of cops as benign guardians of liberty. Yet their presence raises the possibility of racial bias, abuse, and even extrajudicial execution . We should resist calling the police when we're suspicious of a minor crime like shoplifting . We should reserve 911 for situations that present the possibility of violence. Each time we call the cops, we risk shunting someone into a racist criminal justice system designed to strip them of their rights and dignity .\n\nIn March, Dave Reiling, a resident of Sacramento, California, called the police after somebody broke into his truck. When officers arrived on the scene, they promptly shot Stephon Clark-a black, 22-year-old, unarmed father of two, standing on his grandparents' patio-eight times, killing him. \"It makes me never want to call 911 again,\" Reiling said three weeks later . \"They shot an innocent person.\"\n\nThere, in a nutshell, is America's 911 problem: When white people like Reiling call the police, they expect the level of caution and respect they've grown accustomed to in their own law enforcement interactions. For many Americans, that's not the way things turn out. This state of affairs is the result of a police force that operates under the assumption of white innocence and black guilt. One consequence of that? When the most vulnerable members of society need the police, they are too afraid for their own wellbeing to summon them to the scene.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBlack men are still disproportionately likely to be killed by police.\n\nby Sean Collins\n\nThe protests that have risen up in many cities in the United States over the past week were sparked by the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd , by now-fired police officers in Minneapolis. Even though one former officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder, protests have continued night after night because they are not just about that single killing but what it represents: rampant police brutality that seems to have no consequences.\n\nIn fact, a recent analysis by advocacy group Mapping Police Violence found that 99 percent of police killings from 2014 to 2019 did not result in officers even being charged with, let alone convicted of, a crime.\n\nMapping Police Violence's data, which is gathered from public databases and law enforcement records, also shows that the number of police killings varied by year from 2013 to 2019 but did not fall significantly overall - in that span, the number of killings fell to a low of 1,050 in 2014, and had a high of 1,143 in 2018. For comparison, 373 people were killed in mass shootings in 2018 and about 1,010 Americans died of Covid-19 on May 30.\n\nNumbers such as these are a stark reminder that despite years of demonstrations and advocacy - and even changes in policy, such as the adoption of body cameras or requirements that officers use deescalation techniques before resorting to violence - little has changed numerically.\n\nThose numbers are of killings of people of all races - but the same can be said when looking at the data broken down by ethnicity: killings of black Americans by police appears to be trending slightly downward, as are the killings of white Americans; the killings of Latinx Americans are slightly up. Police killings of Native and Asian Americans have spiked, then fallen; the killings of Americans of unknown race are up.\n\nThose are totals, and reminders that police killings are not just a problem suffered by black Americans - that they affect Americans of all ethnicities. But controlling for population (that is, looking at killings per million people) shows that it is black Americans who are most likely to be killed by police officers - that they are nearly twice as likely to be killed as a Latinx person and nearly three times more likely to be killed than a white person. Black Americans are also about 1.4 times more likely to be unarmed in fatal interactions with police than white Americans are (and about 1.2 times more likely to be killed unarmed than Latinx Americans).\n\nThis disparity is such that in eight US cities - including Reno, Nevada; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Scottsdale, Arizona - the rate at which police killed black men was higher than the US murder rate. And from a criminal justice perspective, there appears to be little connection between police killings and violent crime. Some cities with high rates of violent crime have fewer police killings than those with higher violent crime rates, a situation that can make police killings feel wanton and baseless.\n\nIt is this reality that people are protesting. There have been many protests against police killing unarmed black men in recent years, some of which have gone on for weeks, like the 2017 St. Louis protests over the killing of Anthony Lamar Smith by former police officer Jason Stockley, and the 2014 uprisings in Ferguson that followed the killing of Michael Brown. Out of those protests have come the Black Lives Matter movement and other advocacy initiatives, as well as oversight, like the consent decree the Baltimore Police Departmen t entered into with the Department of Justice following the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray.\n\nAnd some studies have shown that the adoption of measures pushed for by these advocates has helped reduce police killings broadly - a Mapping Police Violence analysis of data from the Police Use of Force Project found that chokehold and stronghold bans reduced killings by 22 percent, for instance.\n\nThose reductions, however, have not been enough. The protests have not been enough. Mapping Police Violence's analysis shows this, as do other studies, like one from researchers at Rutgers University, the University of Michigan, and Washington University in St. Louis recently explained by my colleague Dylan Scott .\n\nUsing data from 2013 to 2018, the researchers worked to understand how at risk American men and women were of being killed by police. The results showed black men had a 1 in 1,000 chance in being killed by police - just higher than the odds the the average American has of dying in a motorcycle crash, according to the National Safety Council .\n\nIf past protests have not changed this tragic paradigm, it is not clear that the present ones will either. But there is little else protesters can do than to draw attention to this problem that has not gone away. While many have been encouraged to vote, Mapping Police Violence's data shows that these killings take place in cities with a broad range of leadership types, and regardless of which party is in control.\n\nMany advocates argue that no change can come about until policies are put in place weakening police unions, and ensuring police cannot be militarized or demilitarized at the whim of the president of the United States . The decision to offer police military equipment is not made at the local, but federal level. And police union officials, who often shape the rules police officers are governed by, are voted in by officers in the union - not by the public.\n\nAlso, as Scott notes, complaints about police action are not always looked into - Chauvin had 18 complaints against him , but was nevertheless allowed on the street the day of Floyd's killing. And again, 99 percent of officers are not charged following killings.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby German Lopez\n\nMost of the racial prejudice Americans harbor today is subtle and manifests itself in stealthier ways than it did in the past. It shows up in how employers view potential hires, how salespeople choose to assist people at high-end stores, or how teachers dole out punishments to misbehaving students. Often subconscious, these race-based evaluations of character or intelligence have wide-ranging effects.\n\nExtensive research on the subject shows that just about everyone carries this subconscious prejudice, known as implicit bias, no matter how well-meaning they might be. In the criminal justice system, this implicit bias may contribute to the many racial disparities in law enforcement. When it comes to police officers, implicit bias is a widespread concern, precisely because of how devastating its effects can be, with trade publications and federal programs taking steps to address it through training and awareness.\n\nThere are law enforcement officials who understand how devastating the effects of implicit bias can be, but no one understands this more than the people living in communities where racial minorities are disproportionately targeted by police and arrested. The reaction to police killings since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri - most recently, the police shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma - is about more than a specific individual incident; it's also about the overall system that makes such deaths at the hands of police disproportionately common.\n\nBut it's not just police shootings. When looking at the criminal justice system as a whole, there are many, many racial disparities - in incarceration rates, length of prison sentences for the exact same crimes, and even the death penalty .\n\nSome of the disparities are explained by socioeconomic factors - such as poverty, unemployment, and segregation - that make black Americans much more likely to commit crime than their white counterparts. But a 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found, \"There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.\" That suggests something else - such as, potentially, racial bias - is going on.\n\nCops stereotype black men without being aware of it Lorie Fridell is a University of South Florida criminologist who works with cops to help them resist subconscious biases, particularly against young black men. She previously talked to me about how these biases can work.\n\n\"Similarly to explicit bias, [implicit bias] groups people into stereotypes and prejudices,\" Fridell said. \"What's different is it doesn't come with outward hostility.\"\n\nIn police work, this bias can show itself when an officer stops a subject he views as a potential threat. Police officers are legally allowed to use force based on their perception of a threat, so long as their perception is defined as reasonable (usually as judged by a prosecutor, judge, jury, or grand jury). That doesn't, however, mean they always use force. \"Police very often use a lesser level of force even when they're justified at a higher level,\" Fridell said.\n\nBut if some cops automatically consider black men more dangerous, they probably won't show nearly as much restraint against a black suspect as they would against, say, an elderly white woman. So police officers might be more likely to use deadly force against black people that's legally justified but perhaps not totally necessary.\n\nResearchers at the University of Colorado Boulder and California State University Northridge in May 2014 reviewed a decade of empirical evidence about cops and implicit bias. They found police officers seem to possess implicit bias that might make them more likely to shoot black suspects than white ones. But this bias may be partly controlled through proper training, and police officers appear to perform better - meaning they show less implicit bias - than participants from the general public.\n\nTo test these disparities, researchers have run all sorts of simulations with police officers and other participants. In the earlier days, these simulations would quickly flash images of black and white people along with different objects, and ask participants to identify if the object was a gun. More recently, researchers have used video games to see how people react to suspects of different races.\n\nJosh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor, ran some of these tests with a shooter video game . His initial findings showed police officers generally did a good job of avoiding shooting unarmed targets of all races, but when shooting was warranted, officers pulled the trigger more quickly against black suspects than white ones. This suggests that officers exhibit some racial bias in shooting.\n\nIn the real world, this could lead police to shoot black people at disproportionate rates. Real policing situations, after all, are often much more complicated: Factors - such as a real threat to the officer's life and whether a bullet will miss and accidentally hit a passerby - can make the situation much more confusing to officers.\n\nSo if cops, as Correll's simulations suggest, tend to shoot black suspects more quickly, it's possible that could lead to more errors - such as shooting a black suspect when it's not necessary - in the field. \"In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,\" he previously told me, \"we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them.\"\n\nOther research found that the public and police are less likely to view black people as innocent. As part of a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2014, researchers studied 176 mostly white, male police officers, and tested them to see if they held an unconscious \"dehumanization bias\" against black people by having them match photos of people with photos of big cats or apes. Researchers found that officers commonly dehumanized black people, and those who did were most likely to be the ones who had a record of using force on black children in custody.\n\nIn the same study, researchers interviewed 264 mostly white, female college students and found that they tended to perceive black children ages 10 and older as \"significantly less innocent\" than their white counterparts.\n\n\"Children in most societies are considered to be in a distinct group with characteristics such as innocence and the need for protection,\" Phillip Goff, a UCLA researcher and author of the study, said in a statement. \"Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent.\"\n\nThe one optimistic part of all this grim research is that implicit biases may be reduced over time through practice and experience. The longer officers and other participants took part in the simulations, the less likely they were to make errors. Some of Correll's research also found that certain types of training can diminish racial bias.\n\nFridell, of the University of South Florida, capitalizes on this research to help police departments around the country train their officers all along the chain of command.\n\nThe training relies mainly on the types of shooting simulations used by Correll and other researchers to test cops, but the training sessions are redeveloped to purposely disprove stereotypes against race, gender, age, and other factors. As a result, the training sessions help officers learn to focus more on other cues - body language, what someone is holding - instead of race. (This training isn't generally required by law, but it's becoming more common as concerns grow about racial disparities in the criminal justice system.)\n\nFridell said that this training needs to look beyond race. \"In the same way we as humans have stereotypes linking blacks to crime and aggressiveness, we also have stereotypes of lack of crime and aggressiveness,\" she said, pointing to women and the elderly as two examples. \"For a police officer, this might lead him to be under-vigilant against certain groups.\"\n\nNeill Franklin, a retired major who served for 34 years in the Maryland State Police and Baltimore Police Department, previously told me that the need for this kind of training is something he witnessed in his everyday work. As the commander in training units in both the state and local police forces, he often pushed for officers to consider their bias before taking any official action as a cop.\n\n\"[W]e all have this subconscious bias. Even me, as a black police officer, I felt the same,\" Franklin said. \"When I would be in certain parts of the city and see young black males, it would run through my mind, 'What are they up to? Are they dealing?' That's because of what we've been bombarded with for so many years from so many different directions, including the media.\"\n\nBeyond the simulations and training, Fridell said community policing, which focuses on building ties between local police departments and their communities, can help break down stereotypes. This is what's called the contact theory : Positive interactions with stereotyped groups can reduce explicit and implicit biases. A cop who interacts with black residents in his town might realize that many of his previous prejudices, implicit or not, weren't warranted.\n\nCommunity policing can work in two directions. Just as police's perceptions toward the community change, so do community perceptions toward police. This could, Fridell explained, make communities less defensive - and therefore less aggressive - during police interactions.\n\nFranklin, now the executive director of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , which opposes the war on drugs , worries the training might not be enough in the face of perverse incentives in the criminal justice system. Local police departments are under constant pressure to obtain federal grants , which can be tied in part to, for instance, how many arrests they carry out. As was the case in Ferguson , the tickets issued by police officers can also make up a huge source of money for local governments, which encourages police to issue as many tickets as possible - potentially in the black communities they're more likely to be deployed in - to bring in more revenue.\n\nGiven those incentives, Franklin said, police are encouraged to go after \"low-hanging fruit\" often found in minority communities that lack political and financial power, magnifying the effects of implicit bias.\n\nThere are also broader issues with how police are deployed and the tactics they use. Since some of the highest-crime communities are often majority black or brown, police are disproportionately deployed in these areas in a very aggressive manner - often encouraged to, for example, chase down suspects at almost any cost. That's why some reformers say it's necessary to also change how police are deployed and act on the job - not solely to reduce racial biases but to reduce the need to use force in general. (Of course, because of racial biases, the benefits here would largely go to black communities.)\n\nAs Ronald Davis, a former police chief who heads the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, put it to the Washington Post : Police \"need to stop chasing down suspects, hopping fences, and landing on top of someone with a gun. When they do that, they have no choice but to shoot.\"\n\nIt's these types of systemic issues, noted by Franklin and Davis, that are at the root of the problem - and might perpetuate systemic racial disparities even if officers are properly trained in how to deal with implicit bias.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA new study finds that fatal police violence is a leading cause of death for young men in America. The study's lead author tells Vox why that matters.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nThe deaths of unarmed black men and boys like Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice kicked off a national conversation about police violence - particularly, fatal police violence against people of color - five years ago. That attention has fueled demands for police reform and officer accountability and has also led to media- and activist-led efforts to track the number of police shootings across the country.\n\nA new study finds that this attention to police violence is increasingly important, using statistics to argue that police killings are now a leading cause of death for young men in the United States. And researchers argue that policing has become an urgent public health concern with real impacts on communities.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team of researchers from Rutgers University, the University of Michigan, and Washington University in St. Louis, was recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The researchers used data from Fatal Encounters , a journalist-compiled database of fatal interactions with police, to estimate the risk of being killed in a police use of force incident based on race, age, and sex.\n\nUsing data from 2013 to 2018, they found that fatal police violence is the sixth-leading cause of death for men ages 25 to 29 across all racial groups. The study also found that the lifetime risk of dying from police violence is at its highest from ages 20 to 35, and that this applies to men and women of all races.\n\nWhile young men in general face a higher risk of being killed by police violence, the level of risk changes depending on race. Young men of color - specifically black, Latino, and Native American men - face a higher risk of being killed than white men and Asian American and Pacific Islander men (though the numbers suggest that fatal police violence against white Americans is also increasing). The estimated number of killings of young black men means that roughly one in 1,000 black men face fatal police violence - a rate 2.5 times greater than that of white men.\n\nThe overall rate of police killings trails behind car accidents, suicides, homicide, heart disease, and cancer as a leading cause of death. \"Our results show that people of color face a higher likelihood of being killed by police than do white men and women, that risk peaks in young adulthood, and that men of color face a nontrivial lifetime risk of being killed by police,\" the researchers write.\n\nThe study also shows how women experience fatal police violence: While women are killed at a lower rate than men, there are still racial disparities in these deaths. Black women and Native American women, for example, are more likely to be killed by police than white, Latina, and Asian American/Pacific Islander women.\n\nThe data used in the study does not distinguish between fatal incidents that were later found to be justified uses of force and those that were not. ( Data collected by the FBI , which is widely seen as incomplete, has found that 400 to 500 of the roughly 1,000 police shootings that occur each year are determined to be justified.) Instead, the study examined how fatal police use of force more generally affects different groups.\n\nThere's a \"litany of negative consequences for health that this sort of aggressive and violent policing produces,\" says Frank Edwards, the study's lead author and an assistant professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University Newark. \"The time has come for us to take this seriously as a cause of harm to public health.\"\n\nI spoke with Edwards about the study, why there needs to be comprehensive federal data tracking police violence, and the importance of treating police killings as a public health issue. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy did you want to look at the rates of people being killed by police?\n\nWhen we think of other causes of death - things like homicide, suicide, heart disease, cancer - we have really good numbers on who this affects, how often it occurs, how likely you are to die from these diseases over the course of your life. But we have no such data for police violence. We thought that we had a strong opportunity to improve how much we knew about people getting killed by police.\n\nPolice violence often gets portrayed as a problem that is exclusively concentrated on black men living in cities. And that group is disproportionately affected, our research shows that clearly. But there are other groups affected, and incidence of police violence is pretty widespread.\n\nBut there weren't baseline numbers about how often this was occurring. We felt that the availability of unofficial databases like the Fatal Encounters database (which uses a combination of paid researchers, public records requests, and crowdsourced data to track fatal police violence) made the analysis possible - the federal government has failed to produce reliable numbers.\n\nWhat are the biggest takeaways of the study?\n\nPolice violence is incredibly common. We find that among all men in the US, they face about one-in-2,000 odds of being killed by police over the course of their lives.\n\nFor white men, it's about a one-in-2,500 risk of being killed by police, but when we look at black men, it is every one in 1,000. That means that for every 1,000 black boys born in this country, if the risk of police killings stays where it has been over the past five years, then we expect one of those boys to be killed by police at some point of their life.\n\nWe think that's a really striking - and high - number.\n\nWomen have a risk as well - it's about one in 33,000 compared to one in 2,000 for men. But women still have a risk, and when we look at this further, you see that women being killed by police is also unequal across racial and ethnic groups. Black women and Native American women are about 1.5 times more likely than white women to be killed by police.\n\nOur study is really one of the first to provide detailed estimates of the risk faced by Asian American and Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and Latinos and Latinas, across age and race.\n\nI would say that there are a few big takeaways: one, that lifetime risk of fatal police violence, especially for men, is unequal across racial and ethnic groups - people of color are much more likely to be killed by police than white people. The risk of being killed by police is concentrated among the young; from the ages of 20 to 35, and for young men from the peak ages of 25 to 29, police violence is a significant contributor to overall mortality, especially for young men of color. Of all the men who die between the ages of 20 and 29, police are responsible for more than 1 percent of those deaths.\n\nIn the paper, you and your co-authors argue that police violence needs to be looked at as a public health issue. Can you talk to me about why that matters?\n\nWe think the research community has provided ample evidence that the way police operate is harmful to both individual and community health. Think about all the ways that policing affects communities that are less extreme than a killing.\n\nA police killing affects more than the deceased. There's been great research finding that when an unarmed African American man is killed in a state, there is an increase in symptoms of depression among African Americans in that state following the shooting. When a white unarmed man is killed in a state, there's no similar increase in depressive symptoms among white residents. It strongly suggests that black people see police as a distinctive threat to their well-being, and they - I would argue rightly - perceive police as dangerous. It increases their feelings of outsidership, their feelings of dehumanization, and it increases fear in their interactions with police.\n\nWe also know that with policies like stop-and-frisk in New York City , where police aggressively target young men of color, and other policies in other areas as well, the young men who go through this and experience physical searches have increases in PTSD symptoms afterward . They become hypervigilant, and that can have all sorts of cascading negative health consequences as you're inducing these chronic stresses on relatively young people.\n\nHeavily policed neighborhoods also see increases in anxiety, as people are fearful and they deal with the sorts of chronic stress that we know can be especially toxic. The research community has documented a litany of negative consequences for health that this sort of aggressive and violent policing produces. The time has come for us to take this seriously as a cause of harm to public health and something that is particularly expanding health inequality among racial groups.\n\nIt's particularly harming young African American men, but you look at the tragic cases of women like Erica Garner who are exposed to these deaths, and you see how it has an incredible toll on well-being that can lead to early mortality. We think the time is long past for the medical community and health community to not only identify these issues but design interventions that can help.\n\nAny thoughts on what those possible interventions could look like?\n\nAs other researchers have examined, this is likely a problem of policing becoming a sort of catchall solution to every single problem that our society has. We've defunded services that give people alternatives to calling the police when there is a crisis. The defunding of mental health clinics and other kinds of social services means that officers take on these routine roles of responding to problems.\n\nWhen you talk to police officers, they will tell you that they are not mental health professionals, they're not social workers, and that many of the things they are tasked with dealing with they're not trained for and aren't equipped to deal with .\n\nIn the paper, we don't look into particular interventions; our recommendations are based on other research. But we think adequately funding community-based services would almost certainly help reduce violence by providing communities with tools and alternatives to police.\n\nAnother issue is that we don't have official data on policing , and the data we do have is from journalists, not the government itself. We rely on the media, and in my mind it is unacceptable to need them to provide this basic public service and this basic check on police abuse of power.\n\nI'm optimistic that we will get more robust data from the federal government, and universities and nonprofits are building data tracking projects, so hopefully this is a problem that will be solved. But data is essential for building out systems for the public to be able to hold police accountable.\n\nWith this study, you've said that you wanted to answer a basic question about how likely different demographics are to face fatal police violence. After looking at that, are there other questions about police violence you want to look at in future research?\n\nThere are a million things - we're excited and depressed by how much has been unanswered about police violence. A lot of the current research has looked at how much of the issue is due to racism , and we think that is the wrong question to be asking. When you look at these inequalities, it is clear that both structural racism and discrimination in the pattern and practice of policing has to be occurring. We don't see these levels of violence without disparities and distinctions in how communities of color are policed, and a history of segregation and disinvestment in communities of color, especially cities.\n\nThe things that my team is looking at next is the role mental illness and disabilities play in shaping interactions with police , particularly how often people struggling with mental illness, addictions, and physical disabilities interact with and are killed by police. This strikes us as a population where there are easy alternatives to imagine in terms of using police as a form of crisis response.\n\nTraffic is another big area to research. This current study does not look at vehicular deaths, but a lot of people die during high-speed police chases, whether that's civilians involved in collisions during these chases or the suspect driving the car. We don't know a lot about why that is and where that is happening. But we do know that if we include those deaths in the lifetime risk of being killed, the numbers go up a lot, especially for women.\n\nWe also want to look at how different police agencies respond to incidents. There's a lot to be looked with how different police departments and municipalities are shaping risk in certain regions and communities. We're finding that in some regions, 15 to 17 percent of all male homicide deaths are caused by police . That strikes us as extreme and deserving of more attention.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe Bruen decision upended America's gun laws.

ProPublica's Ryan Gabrielson, Ryann Grochowski Jones, and Eric Sagara reported: \"One way of appreciating that stark disparity, ProPublica's analysis shows, is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk.

But national attention to police misconduct has waned.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nIt's been nearly five years since several high-profile incidents of police violence spurred racial justice protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and chants of \"black lives matter!\" began to echo across the country.\n\nThe deaths of several black men and women, including Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile, drew national attention to issues of race and policing and spurred on demands for police reform.\n\nBut recent developments in two high-profile cases raise questions about whether police violence is still a flashpoint issue - or if national attention to the problem has faded.\n\nIn early May, a previously unreleased video recorded by Sandra Bland, the black woman whose 2015 death in a Texas jail cell sparked protests, emerged. The video showed Bland's perspective of the traffic stop that led to her arrest, and it contradicted police claims that she posed a threat to the officer who pulled her over. Bland's family and others have since demanded that the investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death be reopened.\n\nAbout a week later, the disciplinary hearing for Daniel Pantaleo , the NYPD officer accused of recklessly using a department-prohibited chokehold on Eric Garner, kicked off in New York City. Garner, an unarmed black man, died in 2014 shortly after being restrained by Pantaleo, and officers failed to immediately render first aid. Video of his arrest, and his gasps of \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for activists.\n\nPantaleo, who is still employed by the NYPD, was not indicted by a grand jury in 2014, but he's now facing a department trial that could result in him losing his job as an officer. Several new details about the case have been revealed to the public, including the fact that a police lieutenant texted a different NYPD officer that Garner's death was \" not a big deal ,\" and that another officer inflated charges against Garner when filling out an arrest form after the man died.\n\nThe new revelations in both the Bland and Garner cases are striking - yet they arrive at a time where national anger over police violence doesn't seem to be as strong as it was when their deaths occurred.\n\nMore recent police shootings and incidents of police brutality still draw local attention and activist outrage, but they often fail to attract the same level of public attention they did from 2014 to 2016. At the federal level, the Trump administration has halted efforts to enact police accountability measures. And years into racial justice activists' fight for structural reform, many of the systems that shield officers from accountability remain in place. In short, it appears that public interest in these problems is waning, along with the momentum to push for police reform - even as the need for these changes remain.\n\nThe Washington Post has been tracking fatal police encounters since 2015, and for the past four years, the database has found that roughly 1,000 people have died in police shootings each year. So far, 363 people have been killed by police in 2019 alone, according to the Post database.\n\nEven now, these shootings continue to disproportionately affect black Americans. A 2018 article in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health found that while roughly half of police shooting victims are white, young black Americans and Native Americans are disproportionately likely to be killed in a police shooting.\n\nAnd as Vox's Dara Lind and German Lopez have previously reported, significant racial disparities have also been seen in federal data and other media-compiled databases of shootings, like the Guardian's Counted project , which ran from 2015 to 2016.\n\nBlack people are also more likely than whites to be exposed to arrests and traffic stops that could potentially escalate into violent encounters.\n\nBut recent police violence incidents and shootings haven't dominated headlines or spurred calls for federal investigations and demands for national police reform efforts in the same way they did three or four years ago. And while some stories that center on the deaths of unarmed black men - such as the fatal 2018 shooting of 22-year old Stephon Clark in his family's Sacramento, California, backyard - continue to go viral, they tend to fade from public view more quickly, even as activists on the ground continue their protests.\n\n\"Police violence - beatings, Taserings, killings - and criminal justice reform more broadly were arguably the leading domestic news storyline during the final two years of the Obama administration,\" Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery wrote last year. In 2018, he added, \"the issue has all but vanished from the national political conversation.\"\n\nThat trend has been noticed by other writers, like the Week's Bonnie Kristian , who recently wrote that part of the problem may be that public opinion of police has improved among some groups:\n\nIndignation about police misconduct and calls for reform were fading among the white majority by early 2016, as I wrote here at The Week at the time. Polling in late 2015 showed white Americans found police more trustworthy after 18 months of notorious police custody deaths and resultant protests. Already it was becoming evident that cases which once would (and should) have provoked national controversy were increasingly met with desensitization and indifference outside of local protests.\n\nIn 2017, a Gallup poll showed that public confidence in police was back to its historical average, with 57 percent of those polled saying they had \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in police compared to 52 percent in 2015. This was largely driven by shifts among white Americans, with more people expressing confidence in police in the 2015-17 period than from 2012 to 2014 (61 percent to 58 percent). During that same time confidence in police fell among black Americans, going from 35 precent in 2012-14 to 30 percent in 2015-17.\n\nBlack Americans are also significantly less likely to view police \"warmly\" when compared to white Americans.\n\nThere could be several reasons for the change in the national discussion of policing, but one factor stands out in particular: the election of President Donald Trump. Trump's election and presidency has consumed a significant amount of media attention and public discussion, leaving little space for discussions of policy issues like police reform.\n\nThe Trump administration has also effectively halted federal momentum on policing reform. Under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Trump administration announced it would review old police reform agreements between the federal government and police departments and also stop entering into new ones.\n\nIn cities like Baltimore and Chicago, the Justice Department went so far as to attempt to intervene in ongoing reform efforts, arguing that reform agreements would hamper effectiveness and morale of police officers.\n\nIn recent years, several of the most high-profile cases of police violence have ended with officers not facing charges or not being convicted. This is largely due to longstanding legal standards giving officers wide latitude to use force.\n\nIt is possible the continued dismissal of police misconduct cases by police departments or the legal system - especially in incidents caught on video - has created a sense of futility, or discouragement, among some people who were first exposed to police violence incidents back in 2014.\n\nWhile some officers involved in police violence are never indicted, in other cases, like the case of Michael Rosfeld , a former East Pittsburgh officer who fatally shot 17-year-old Antwon Rose in 2018, officers faced trial but were not convicted. Convictions remain very rare in police shooting cases , and officers who are given prison time for their involvement in shootings is rarer still.\n\nIn fact, the only acknowledgement of wrongdoing often comes in the form of settlements given to the families of police-shooting victims. But these settlements, which usually arrive after lawsuits (and in some cases aren't given ), are far from the systemic reform that activists and families of victims have demanded.\n\nAnd because these protections largely hinge on if an officer had a \"reasonable\" belief that he or others were in danger rather than if a threat was actually expressed, the result is that some police misconduct or excessive force is shielded from prosecution. Efforts to change that standard have emerged in states like California , but no laws have yet to be passed.\n\nThere are other longstanding practices within police departments that make accountability for police misconduct, abuse, and fatal shootings a challenge. A 2016 New York Times report and 2017 Washington Post investigation found that officers who were fired from departments for misconduct or criminal behavior often go on to be hired by other departments or are rehired by the same agency that dismissed them. And tracking officer misconduct , or viewing body camera footage of a police shooting, remains difficult for the public.\n\nThough police violence and lack of accountability remains a very real problem, Americans in general simply seem less interested in hearing about it - which makes it more difficult for activists and politicians to push through tangible reforms.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean people have given up. Instead, groups seem to be putting more of an emphasis on pushing for structural change from within.\n\nThe police reform-oriented Campaign Zero and the Movement for Black Lives have outlined detailed policy plans aimed at policing, but they have also demanded changes to education systems and the economy and joined a larger set of groups making up the anti-Trump \"resistance.\"\n\nOther groups are seeking to boost black political engagement in the upcoming election and things like the 2020 census in an effort to force politicians to address black voters' concerns about racism and police accountability.\n\nActivists say their fight for justice is as urgent now as it was five years ago, and that while systemic policy change may still be a work in progress, their movement has had an impact. \"Since we started using the hashtag #blacklivesmatter, since the jump start of this current iteration of the Black Liberation movement, I know the world has transformed,\" Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Network, wrote in a 2018 HuffPost op-ed . \"I know the world is changing.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe Bruen decision upended America's gun laws. Years later, cops and courts are still trying to sort out the mess.\n\nThe Trump administration is freezing the Justice Department's work on police reform.\n\nIt adds to a long and disturbing pattern of police violence toward Black Americans.\n\nElite clerics still hold ultimate power.\n\nFortson's shooting deepens longstanding scrutiny of police violence.\n\nDeescalating conflict around protests was possible, but many colleges turned to law enforcement instead.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Lockhart\n\nStephon Clark, the unarmed black man shot by Sacramento police officers while holding a cellphone in his grandparent's backyard last week, was shot eight times , six of which hit him in the back, according to independent autopsy results released on Friday.\n\nThe autopsy was conducted by Dr. Bennet Omalu, a private medical examiner hired by the lawyer representing the Clark family. According to Omalu, Clark was shot four times in his lower back, twice in his neck, and once under one of his armpits. Another shot hit Clark in the leg. \"His death wasn't instantaneous,\" Omalu told reporters . The findings come one day after a funeral service was held for Clark.\n\n\"These findings from the independent autopsy contradict the police narrative that we've been told,\" Benjamin Crump, the family's lawyer, said in a statement. \"This independent autopsy affirms that Stephon was not a threat to police and was slain in another senseless police killing under increasingly questionable circumstances.\"\n\nThe Sacramento County Coroner's office, which is conducting the official autopsy, has not yet released its findings.\n\nOn March 18, Clark was shot in the backyard of the home he was staying in with his grandparents. The Sacramento Police Department has said the officers were responding to a 911 call that a man was breaking car windows in the area.\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the Sacramento Police Department shortly after the shooting, a helicopter tracking a suspect directed the officers to Clark, who ran towards his house after being confronted by officers. The police department said Clark turned and began to \"advance forward with his arms extended, and holding an object in his hands.\"\n\nThe officers, who are said to have thought the object was a gun, then fired 20 rounds at Clark, eight of which hit him. After the shooting, officers waited several minutes for backup before moving to handcuff Clark and beginning medical treatment. And the only item he turned out to have been carrying was a cellphone.\n\nThe shooting has sparked public outcry both locally and nationally. For more than a week, protesters have taken to the streets in Sacramento, calling for the officers involved in the shooting to be charged for Clark's death and noting that Clark is just the latest black man to be shot by Sacramento police in recent years . On Tuesday, the California Justice Department announced that it would investigate the use of force practices of the Sacramento Police Department.\n\nNearly four years after the death of Michael Brown sparked the rise of Black Lives Matter and brought more attention to racial disparities in police shootings, the Clark case serves as a stark reminder that even as national attention has waned , unarmed black men and women continue to experience deadly encounters with police.\n\nOn March 21, Sacramento police released two audio and three video recordings of the incident , including two videos from the responding officers' body cameras. The footage was shown to Clark's family prior to its release.\n\nIn the first few minutes of the body cam videos, the officers are shown looking for the person suspected of breaking into the cars when they encounter Clark. Halfway through the video, an officer can be heard yelling after spotting movement behind a house. The officer, after seeing a man, then yells \"Show me your hands!\" and follows the man into a backyard.\n\n[WARNING: This video is extremely disturbing.]\n\nA few seconds later, the officer yells at the man to show his hands. The officer then yells \"Gun!\", demands that Clark show his hands once more and both officers then fire several shots. A little over five minutes later, the officers approach and handcuff Clark before beginning medical treatment. The final minutes of the body camera videos are completely silent, as the officers muted their microphones .\n\nThe police officers do not identify themselves as law enforcement in the video.\n\nAfter seeing the videos, Clark's aunt, Saquoia Durham, told the Sacramento Bee that she doesn't believe Clark was given a chance to surrender to police. \"They said 'put your hands up, gun' and then they just let loose on my nephew,\" Durham said.\n\n\"When they shot him down, they knew they messed up,\" she added.\n\nIn a statement, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said that it was too early to reach conclusions about what happened the night Clark was killed. \"Based on the videos alone, I cannot second guess the split-second decisions of our officers and I'm not going to do that,\" he said. \"The investigation must be completed.\"\n\nEven with the release of the body camera footage, what happened immediately before Clark's shooting remains unclear, and his family and community are demanding answers.\n\n\"He was at the wrong place at the wrong time in his own backyard?\" Sequita Thompson, Clark's grandmother, said to the Sacramento Bee on March 20. Thompson also said that though she heard the gunshots, she never heard the police ask Clark to drop what he was holding. Clark's family also said that they were not immediately told that their relative was the man killed in their backyard.\n\nAt a city council meeting in Sacramento on March 20, local activists argued that the police department's multiple statements on the shooting have only added to the confusion.\n\n\"They put one story out that he may have been armed. They put out another that he had a 'tool bar,' whatever that is,\" Tanya Faison, founder of the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter, told reporters . \"Then they put out that he had a wrench, and then they put out that he just had a cellphone. They need to get it together.\"\n\nThe officers who shot Clark have each served in the Sacramento Police Department for less than five years, and were placed on paid leave while the investigation continues.\n\nClark's death follows several high profile police shootings of black men in recent years. According to the Washington Post's Fatal Force database , some 264 people have been shot and killed by police in 2018. 57 of those people were identified as black in news reports.\n\nResearch has shown that there are significant racial disparities in police use of force. While these disparities are most commonly attributed to issues like implicit bias and systemic racism, recent research has also noted that specific factors like high levels of housing segregation and economic inequality also play a role in where police shootings occur and who they affect.\n\n\"It's not just about how individuals interact, but how society is structured,\" Michael Siegel, the author of a recent study examining the relationship between housing segregation and structural inequality to police violence, told the Intercept earlier this month .\n\nAt this point, it is unclear what the results of the police investigation will be, or if the officers will face charges for the shooting. But when police officers shoot civilians, it is rare that these cases lead to prosecution.\n\nAs Vox's German Lopez has noted , police are given wide latitude to use force and only have to reasonably perceive a threat at the time of the shooting for their actions to be legally justified.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

      "text": "Chris Hayes on how police treat black Americans like colonial subjects\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe MSNBC host discusses \"law and order,\" police brutality, and America's two radically unequal criminal justice systems.\n\nby Roge Karma\n\n\"American criminal justice isn't one system with massive racial disparities but two distinct regimes,\" writes MSNBC host Chris Hayes in his book, A Colony in a Nation . \"One (the Nation) is the kind of policing regime you expect in a democracy; the other (the Colony) is the kind you expect in an occupied land.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd's death and the brutal attacks on protesters reveal the bifurcated system Hayes describes. The idea that the US contains two entirely different operating models for policing and criminal justice is on grim display every day on our Twitter feeds, our televisions, and outside our windows.\n\nI spoke with Hayes by phone on Tuesday to discuss the parallels between the policing regime America's founders rebelled against and the one black Americans currently face, why presidents who shout \"law and order\" the loudest are often the most flagrantly unlawful, the role of public humiliation in fomenting social revolution, the militarization of America's police forces, and much more.\n\nA transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.\n\nThe story we're often told about the American founding is one of a rebellion against unjust taxation. You tell a very different story in the book. To what extent were the founding fathers rebelling against a version of police brutality?\n\nObviously the American Revolution was complicated. But I think in the telling of that history we focus on taxation and not the means through which taxes were collected. Taxation then meant tariffs applied to goods that were being imported or exported. And the way that tariffs were collected at the time was customs enforcement, which is essentially policing. Officials would literally search the ships for how much tobacco or whiskey was on board.\n\nThat creates what I call in the book \"the first generation of stop and frisk.\" The British start pulling over every ship. And when they crack down, it's oppressive and tyrannical. That's why in the Declaration of Independence's bill of particulars against the king, you get the line: \"He has sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\" That's basically referring to British cops.\n\nAt one point, the Crown realizes that normal customs officials aren't enough, so they start sending British naval officers. This was a huge deal at the time. It's a reason that we have these protections against search and seizure in the Bill of Rights. There are these huge trials over this. There's tons of looting. Customs officers, when they tried to see the ship, would be met by crowds at the dock. They would grab the officers. They would tar and feather them. They would lock them up. They'd wheelbarrow them through town to beat them up in front of everyone. And those were the police at the time.\n\nRevolutions are complicated, but this slice of it was a rebellion very actively triggered by the brutality and oppressiveness of the crown's policing power. It's something that we aren't often taught, but it is there, plain as day.\n\nIn the book, you distinguish between two very different policing and criminal justice regimes in modern America: \"the Nation,\" which is governed under the logic of democracy and \"the Colony,\" which is governed under the logic of occupation. What exactly is \"the Colony\" in this analysis and what are some of the ways is it governed as such?\n\n\"The Colony\" in some ways is the absence of accountability and consent of the governed, which defines a nation and defines a culture of democratic policing. I keep thinking about this moment on the steps in California during one of the shutdown protests where a bunch of very rowdy protesters are getting in the faces of cops pushing them, yelling in their faces - and the cops just sort of hold their ground.\n\nWhen you see that, what you see is police policing people that are their constituents in one sense and in a grander sense are their \"bosses.\" These are people who are angry, but they are engaged in constitutionally-protected protest, and the police are there to keep the peace but not dominate them. That's the model of democratic policing.\n\nDomination is the model of colonial policing, the model of occupation. It's what happens when you aren't treating the people that you are policing as fundamentally community members or constituents: They're subaltern, they're subjects to the crown - they're subjects to the power of the state, not agents of it.\n\nAnd that means you can basically do what you want to do. Now, I want to be clear: Not every police officer is like that and there are tons of police officers who do police in democratic ways. But fundamentally, police culture, police training, and the legal and institutional frameworks that have grown up around American policing - particularly among predominantly black and brown areas in America - take on this colonial model.\n\nOne place this seems especially relevant is the militarization of the American police force.\n\nExactly. The Department of Justice under Barack Obama did a bunch of very good investigations of various police departments. One of those was a pattern-or-practice investigation of the Cleveland Police Department in the wake of the killing of Tamir Rice. They found in one of the Cleveland Police Department precincts, a sign that refers to it as a \"forward operating base,\" which is the terminology used by deployed service members in Afghanistan, where they're sort of outside the wire and they set up a small forward operating base. That's making the metaphor quite literal: You are a soldier operating in enemy lands. That mentality is toxic, and it is ubiquitous throughout the whole system.\n\nThat is a model of policing in which there is essentially no such thing as the constitutional rights we take for granted. This was the big finding of Judge Shira A. Scheindlin's district court trial on \"stop and frisk\": The Constitution's fundamental protections against search and seizure - largely in place because of precisely the excessive policing powers of the British Crown I mentioned earlier - were totally absent. They did not exist in any actual sense for the citizens of New York City, particularly the black and brown citizens.\n\nOften, I think the presiding assumption in the US is that identical laws and legal structures lead to equal treatment. If the law, as written, applies to all of us, then, in practice, it will apply to all of us. But, I think what you're getting at is that what we're dealing with isn't unequal laws - it's radically unequal enforcement regimes behind those laws.\n\nI think drugs are the place where this becomes most evident. Something I write about in the book is: What would it look like to have a regime of essentially total criminal forbearance of young people with substances? The answer is elite universities. People do a shit ton of drugs. They buy drugs, they sell drugs, and guess what? There's zero police enforcement.\n\nSo there are people selling on the corners of neighborhoods and there are people dealing in the dorms. The same set of general laws apply to both, but they just exist in two different policing regimes.\n\nNow, I don't want to give up on the aspirational power of equal justice under law altogether, but it doesn't exist. The law is what the institutions of law say. And the institutions of law reflect power. So we are protected against unreasonable search and seizure in the Constitution, but that protection isn't functionally present in the lives of millions of our fellow citizens.\n\nSomething that brings up for me is this concept of \"law and order.\" You have a really interesting discussion in the book of how the two are so often in tension - how the American police state's obsession with creating \"order\" in poor, black communities has actually come at the cost of lawfulness. Can you talk about that? In what sense are \"law\" and \"order\" at odds?\n\nThe first thing I'll say is that the two most flagrantly lawless presidents in the last 60, 70 years have both shouted the loudest about \"law and order.\" There are people that are extremely sensitive to the law, but that does not describe Richard Nixon and Donald Trump. Those guys are literally criminals .\n\nThe idea that police are there to maintain order is not totally ludicrous in the sense that there is such a thing like widespread mayhem and disorder that can break out in society. It's just that order is such a malleable concept: It's something a community agrees on - a sort of social fabric and social norm. And particularly in the \"broken windows era\" police have increasingly been tasked with preserving order as opposed to enforcing the law.\n\nThis is really stark when you look at clearance rates. Compared to 20, 30 years ago, most major urban police departments have both more police officers and bigger budgets with less crime. Yet, the clearance rates for crime haven't budged - or have gone down. That makes sense if the role of law enforcement is only to keep order: Stopping people from breaking windows is very different than solving murders.\n\nI think this tension between \"order\" and \"lawfulness\" has become really stark in the past week. As I've watched the countless videos of police officers with flash grenades and SWAT gear brutally attacking peaceful protesters, all I really could think of was a question that you pose in the book: Where the hell is the Constitution in all this? Where are America's founding ideals for that matter?\n\nBut this is what happens when you decide that order is our highest national priority - when maintaining some abstract idea of \"order\" comes above the law, above our ideals, above basic humanity. The result is just terrifying.\n\nI think that's exactly right. We're seeing tactics of policing that are usually used on people that are outside of view: pressure, harassment, and ultimately domination.\n\nI think the word domination is so remarkable. The president has been explicit on this : The goal is domination. And what does domination look like? It looks like a knee on the neck. In fact, a boot to the neck is like the oldest trope we have to represent domination and represent tyranny. What is the flag of the colonies? It's a snake that reads, \"Don't tread on me.\" Do not step on me. Do not place your foot on me. That is domination. And if you do, I will react.\n\nThat is the most essential emotional and conceptual core of freedom and dignity. Self-determination is to not be dominated, to be a free and sovereign person, to not have a boot or a knee on your neck. There is nothing more core to what we say we're about. So for the president to come out and say, we will dominate, it's like he's just coming out and saying. that is the goal here - the exertion of authority for authority's sake.\n\nAnd I think the flip side of domination is humiliation: It's the humiliation of being dominated that makes domination so abhorrent and resistance to it so potent.\n\nMy colleague Matt Yglesias had a really interesting piece pointing out how police killings of unarmed black men have gone down in recent years. That's certainly important, but something your book points out is that these killings themselves are not the whole story - the humiliation of life under an oppressive police regime is a huge piece of this. You go as far as to call humiliation \"the most powerful and most underappreciated force in human affairs.\" Why is that? What role does humiliation play in sparking moments like this one?\n\nWhy is the murder of George Floyd so egregious? Because the boot on the neck is how you treat an animal - not how you treat a human. A human being does not put a foot atop another human being. It's an insult to someone's humanity above and beyond the violence and the sadism and the cruelty and the snuffing of a life.\n\nTo humiliate someone - and humiliation is the fundamental core experience in policing for millions of our fellow citizens - is to robbed of humanity, to be made low. Humiliation is such a powerful emotion because there is nowhere to put it. You take it and you push it down somewhere. It doesn't just go away - it just builds up.\n\nSomething interesting you talk about in the book is that these acts of humiliation aren't restricted to the big obvious ones like George Floyd's killing. You write that \"for subjects of authoritarian rule, humiliation is the permanent state of existence.\" And you talk about how every black individual you talked to in Ferguson experienced instances of humiliation at the hands of police.\n\nEvery person, everywhere. I would say that every black person I know, whether that's friends, colleagues, or people I've interviewed, has a story about being humiliated by the cops. It's such an important part of the story.\n\nLet's even take another example: the Arab Spring. What was the spark of the Arab Spring? It was humiliation at the hands of police officers for a petty infraction - selling fruit from a cart without a vendor's permit - and having the fruit confiscated. Then it was going down to the municipal office, as Mohamed Bouazizi did, to be turned away and essentially be told, \"Get the hell out of here you lowly fruit vendor.\"\n\nThis police officer had been harassing Bouazizi for days and humiliating him. And Bouazizi, who had been making a living doing this since childhood, had no place to put that humiliation. So he lit himself on fire. And that's how it all began: The Arab Spring started as a protest against police harassment. Lots and lots of protests against regimes start that way.\n\nIt really seems like the common pattern here is that one flagrant display of humiliation activates all of the smaller, more subtle forms of humiliation that have been building up over time throughout an entire community.\n\nYes! Because almost everyone's experienced it and everyone's holding it in their bodies as physical memory. Stress and trauma are like paper-cuts that build up in the psyche. It's a cliché metaphor to talk about the \"wound of racism.\" But in a literal, psychological sense, to be humiliated time and time again is to be traumatized without any expressive outlet for it. Other emotions like anger or fear have outlets; humiliation, sort of by its definition, has to be bottled up because in the moment you can't express it.\n\nI remember when I read about the American Revolution never really understanding why the founders would \"tar and feather\" colonial officials. Why was that necessary? But under this framework of humiliation it makes sense: It's a way of turning the humiliation around onto the people who have been causing it.\n\nExactly. You humiliate those who humiliated you. It's easy sitting at home to wonder: Why are people chucking things like water bottles at the cops? That's the reason: You want to humiliate people that humiliated you.\n\nRereading your book has actually really reframed the way I have been looking at these protests over the past few days. I think our mindset in America, based on the way we are taught about recent US history, is to expect disciplined nonviolence from protesters as the norm - and subsequently to find any acts of violence as evidence of illegitimacy.\n\nBut, given the humiliation and fear and violence that is part of everyday life in so many black communities, maybe it's time to revise that expectation. If anything, I am shocked by just how many of the protesters have had the capacity to remain peaceful through all this.\n\nI think you're right that people have this fixed model of how protests are supposed to work. And that's largely because there is one specific protest movement in American life, the 1960s civil rights movement, that has been elevated and celebrated in the national canon.\n\nBut even the particulars of that protest movement are very poorly understood. We talk about the bridge Selma as the most iconic version of disciplined King/Gandhi nonviolence in the face of state violence. But we overlook the fact that those folks were highly trained. They were going to eight-hour meetings in church basements. It took a militant and incredibly organized movement to make that moment happen.\n\nThe folks protesting today are people just coming up the streets - they have no training. You watch protesters trying to enforcers norms, trying to stop people from looting or calling out people that are chucking stuff, whatever it is. But there's no unified voice here.\n\nBy and large, though, what you're seeing is like nonviolent protest. That doesn't mean other things aren't happening - obviously they are. But the majority of what you're seeing is nonviolent. That's remarkable considering not only the sense of humiliation but also the total lack of training and organizing that's happening because these protests are so organic.\n\nIt seems like a pretty smart tactic for those who oppose the aims of a given protest to hold that protest to an essentially impossible-to-meet standard of pure, Gandhian nonviolence.\n\nIt is. When the Hong Kong protests went down, you have people like Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton celebrating the Hong Kong protesters. Meanwhile, the Chinese state is saying these people are looters and rioters and breaking windows. So it's not like the Hong Kong protesters were this perfectly disciplined model of nonviolence - that no one broke windows or lit things on fire or chucked things at the cops. All three of those things did happen. Tahrir was the same way. So, we're very willing to stand on those edges when it comes to certain protests in other places.\n\nNow, I want to be clear: I don't think people should break windows and light things on fire. I'm just saying as a descriptive matter that's what uprisings and unrest looks like. The sort of extremely disciplined, deeply trained King and Gandhian nonviolence is a particular tradition borne of a tremendous amount of work and organizing. It's only one specific slice of what I would call broadly the category of nonviolent protest.\n\nYou wrote A Colony in a Nation about a period of black protest and rebellion in which Barack Obama was the president of the United States. Now, we have Donald Trump.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nSix former police officers tortured two Black men. They're getting sentenced this week.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nSix white former police officers , who pleaded guilty to civil rights offenses related to the assault and torture of two Black men in Mississippi, are being sentenced this week. Their pleas underscore the systemic nature of police abuse, the racism underpinning many incidents of police misconduct, and the urgent need for more accountability.\n\nIn the Mississippi case , the officers, some of whom referred to themselves as the \"Goon Squad,\" entered a home without a warrant and proceeded to physically and verbally assault two Black men - Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker - who were inside.\n\nOver the course of 90 minutes, the officers attacked and tortured the men repeatedly, with one officer shooting Jenkins in the mouth. Additionally, the group tased the two men multiple times, used racial slurs, poured oil, alcohol, and chocolate sauce on them, and planted evidence in the house in a bid to escape responsibility. As part of the encounter, the police warned the men to stay out of Rankin County, Mississippi.\n\nThe officers were reportedly told to go to the house on January 24, 2023, by a Rankin County deputy , who'd received a complaint that the two Black men were in the house with a white woman. Court documents note that Parker was a longtime friend of the woman and aiding in her care, per the Associated Press .\n\nThe Department of Justice previously opened a civil rights investigation and charged the officers with 16 felonies - including civil rights violations, discharge of a firearm during a crime, and obstruction of justice - all of which they pleaded guilty to last year. Additionally, the Mississippi attorney general's office has charged the officers with assault, conspiracy, and obstruction.\n\nIn March, two of the former police officers received sentences for their offenses. Jeffrey Middleton, 46, the head of the \"Goon Squad,\" was sentenced to over 17 years in prison, and Hunter Elward, 31, the officer who shot Jenkins, was sentenced to 20 years. The remaining four officers are expected to be sentenced shortly as well.\n\nThis case is only the latest to illustrate how police can abuse the unique authority they have, and is only one of several highlighting the violence Black Americans can face at the hands of police. The pleas follow the police killings of Jarrell Garris in New Rochelle and Ahmad Abdullah in Detroit, both unarmed Black men, among many others .\n\nLegal protections like qualified immunity - which require proof that an officer has violated a \"clearly established\" right - have typically made it difficult to hold police liable for everything from property damage to fatal violence. Efforts to remake qualified immunity law on the federal level, which were accelerated after a police officer murdered George Floyd, have failed. As have efforts to increase transparent reporting and data collection about police use of force, making it tougher to pursue both investigations and convictions.\n\n\"Departments don't even have to disclose the most basic information about how many people officers kill each year,\" UCLA law professor Joanna Schwartz previously said in an interview. \"That, in itself, is a failure of accountability.\"\n\nThe Mississippi assaults present a rare instance when police have had to deal with legal ramifications for harms they've caused. As recent reports on Albany , Chicago , and Oakland 's police departments have shown, it is far more common that investigations into misconduct don't come to any resolution. The Mississippi case is also a reminder of how ignoring misconduct can lead to further abuses. Infamously, Derek Chauvin, the former officer who killed Floyd, had previously been the subject of multiple complaints concerning excessive use of force .\n\nSimilarly, an AP report linked several of the officers involved in the Mississippi case with four incidents of violence since 2019, including actions that led to the deaths of two Black men. And while the assaults they are accused of took place in January 2023, the officers weren't fired from their jobs or forced to resign until June.\n\nThe guilty pleas and DOJ investigation in this case are extremely important, Harvard Kennedy School professor and police violence expert Desmond Ang tells Vox, though he notes that such accountability is uncommon.\n\n\"That the officers pleaded guilty, instead of going to trial, really demonstrates how clear-cut the evidence was,\" he says. \"At the same time, it's really important to note that this type of behavior had been allowed to persist for way longer than it should.\"\n\nBecause of the opacity when it comes to documenting use of force in police departments, it's tough to track how frequently similar offenses are being confronted in court. One analysis from Bowling Green State University professor Philip Stinson found an uptick in the number of police who were being charged with murder or manslaughter between 2017 to 2021, though they still marked a very small fraction of the reported number of police killings. Seven officers were charged in 2017, 10 in 2018, 12 in 2019, 16 in 2020, and 21 in 2021. In 2021 and the years since, however, there have been more than a thousand police killings per year, according to the Mapping Police Violence database .\n\n\"It makes you wonder how many other cases like this exist that just haven't made the light of day,\" says Ang, while alluding to other potential instances like the Mississippi case.\n\nUpdate, March 20, 10:55 am ET: This story was originally published on August 4, 2023, and has been updated with two of the officers' sentences.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Daunte Wright case: How seemingly minor traffic stops can turn deadly\n\nKim Potter is charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nThe trial of former Brooklyn Center, Minnesota officer Kim Potter in the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright has cast a renewed spotlight on traffic stops, like the one at the center of the case, and their potential to escalate.\n\nNationwide, police pull over more than 50,000 drivers on average each day, amounting to more than 20 million motorists annually, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project .\n\nEven though civilians are killed in just a fraction of the cases, law enforcement researchers and experts say traffic stops can quickly turn into high-intensity, potentially fatal encounters because of the unknowns involved -- who the drivers and passengers are, what weapons they may have or what they're thinking, putting officers on the defensive before they even approach the vehicle.\n\nIn the last five years, police have killed more than 400 people during traffic stops \"who were not wielding a gun or a knife, or under pursuit for a violent crime,\" according to a New York Times investigation. That's more than one person a week.\n\nMost fatal incidents in 2020 began with police responding to suspected non-violent offenses or cases where no crime was reported, Mapping Police Violence , a group that collects data on police killings nationwide, reports.\n\n\"A police officer, making a stop of a motorist, really just does not know what he or she is walking into,\" said Jacinta M. Gau, a criminal justice professor at the University of Central Florida.\n\nAbout 11% of deadly police shootings are related to traffic stops, according to the Washington Post's \"Fatal Force\" database .\n\nAn investigation from NPR found that more than a quarter of fatal shootings against unarmed Black men and women like Wright since 2015 were connected with traffic stops.\n\nChristopher Slobogin, the director of Vanderbilt Law School's criminal justice program, said officers have to take many factors into account when they approach a vehicle. Six officers have been killed during investigative or enforcement efforts this year, meaning they were killed during a drug-related matter, a wanted person investigation or a traffic violation stop in 2021, according to FBI data .\n\n\"Police are trained to watch for sudden movements, and to shoot or take other protective steps whenever they see or think they see a gun in someone's hands,\" Slobogin said. \"If you wait until a gun is pointed at you to shoot, it'll be too late. Police also become more aggressive when people are not immediately compliant with their commands, which may make some motorists even less compliant, especially when they think the commands are unreasonable.\"\n\nThe Wright case\n\nOn April 11, Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was pulled over for an expired registration tab and an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror -- which is illegal in Minnesota -- Brooklyn Center police officer Anthony Luckey testified. He was training with Potter on the day of the incident.\n\nAfter officers discovered that he had an outstanding warrant for a gross misdemeanor weapons charge, officers told Wright he was under arrest, according to police body camera footage. The warrant was for carrying a handgun in a public place without a state permit.\n\nWright followed orders to get out of the car and the officers attempted to take him into custody. But Wright freed himself and got back into his car, according to the body camera footage. The officers and Wright then appeared to scuffle according to the video, with Wright in the driver's seat and Potter warning Wright that she would \"tase\" him.\n\nBut instead of her stun gun, she had drawn her firearm and shot him once in the chest before he drove off, traveling several blocks before his car crashed into another vehicle, according to then-police chief Tim Gannon.\n\nProsecutors argue that not only should she have known the difference between her Taser and gun but also she should not have been reaching for her stun gun at all since it's against department policy to \"tase\" a fleeing suspect.\n\nThe defense says Potter made an innocent mistake, but that she was fully within her right to use deadly force because she believed Wright tried to drive away with a fellow officer, Sgt. Mychal Johnson, hanging out of the car. Johnson, who took the stand in the trial, agreed.\n\nPotter was charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter and has pleaded not guilty.\n\nExperts: prejudice can play a role\n\nMany factors can be connected to the escalation of violence during traffic stops, even during initially non-violent violations, according to law enforcement analysts. Bias, fear, and miscommunication can play a role in making a seemingly simple stop turn deadly.\n\nRace has not been explicitly raised in court regarding the Potter case.\n\nResearch from the Stanford Open Policing Project shows that some officers use discretion when making traffic stops and can be racially biased. Black drivers were about 20% more likely than white drivers to be stopped by law enforcement across the country, according to the Stanford Open Policing Project .\n\nSlobogin said that the sheer frequency of traffic infractions -- the so-called 'three-block' rule presents the opportunity for discrimination because plenty of drivers make mistakes on the road or with their car.\n\n\"Every one of us violates at least one traffic law every three blocks - driving above the speed limit, failing to signal at the proper time, failing to come to a full stop ... the list goes on and on,\" he said.\"This gives police tremendous discretion to stop who and when they want.\"\n\nIn a ABC News analysis of traffic stops in major U.S. cities , almost every location examined shows at least some disparity in traffic stops based on race.\n\nNot only are police officers more likely to stop Black drivers, but there could be a fear of drivers in areas known for high crime, Gau and Rashawn Ray, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute argue.\n\nPotter's defense team said the area where Wright was stopped has a reputation for crime, arguing in court that it adds to why Potter may have been justified in using deadly force.\n\nIn his opening statements, defense attorney Paul Engh told the jury about the potential for danger during a traffic stop, citing an anecdotal estimate by Brooklyn Center officer Anthony Luckey that 40% of people in Brooklyn Center may be carrying guns in their cars.\n\nDuring Luckey's cross-examination, Engh emphasized that where the stop occurred was a \"high crime area for guns... and for drugs.\"\n\nHowever, Luckey, who was at the scene when Wright was fatally shot, said in court that Wright had given officers no reason to believe he had a gun, and said he was respectful and did not threaten officers.\n\nGau, the University of Central Florida professor, argued that crime rates are not \"completely objective\" because research shows that officers often police areas where they expect crime to be happening, thereby inflating the numbers.\n\n\"You only find crime where you're looking for it,\" Gau said. \"And so, if police are continuously targeting these certain areas, or certain groups ... that's where they're going to find the crime. And then that turns into the justification for continuously targeting these groups in these areas. So it becomes this self-perpetuating cycle.\"\n\nFinding a solution\n\nGau and Ray say preventing any kind of escalation is what's key to keeping these encounters orderly. Think \"non-escalation,\" instead \"de-escalation,\" Gau said.\n\n\"The term 'de-escalation' inherently implies the escalation has started to take place,\" said Gau.\n\nDe-escalation training is intended to teach officers how to reduce tension or conflict in any given situation and has proliferated in recent years. However, Gau and Ray say the tension of traffic stops for non-violent offenders can be reduced if officers approach civilians with an open and kind demeanor, even when met with rude or wary drivers.\n\nEven with a misdemeanor warrant, ABC News contributor and law enforcement expert Robert Boyce said officers should \"take control of a situation, but enter calmly and firmly. Be as reasonable as possible. Always maintain your control, but it has to be done so in a firm manner. It's a developed skill.\"\n\nBoyce, a now-retired 35-year veteran of the New York Police Department and former chief of detectives added, \"You're not the same person when you're in a high-charged situation.\"\n\nOnce Potter saw the gun warrant, Boyce believes she may have assumed that there was potential for a weapon in the car. He said the use of a stun gun is justifiable for someone resisting arrest -- however, the use of a firearm is not.\n\n\"She would not be able to use a firearm in his arrest,\" said Boyce. \"It is not a tool for apprehension.\"\n\n\"[Officers should not be] assuming that somebody is a criminal, even if they are being stopped in a high crime area or some kind of area that has a bad reputation for drugs or other sorts of criminal activity ... not treating a motorist with a level of suspicion, not starting the encounter with the assumption that you've just pulled over some high-level criminal offender,\" Gau said.\n\n\"We interviewed hundreds of police officers, we did many hours of ride-alongs and one of the big things that we noticed is that based on the call for service -- where the location was, the cross streets -- officers will go in already expecting something to happen when the call was for something non-violent,\" Ray said. \"Simply the location will lead to them responding a particular way.\"\n\nNew regulations have been imposed on some local police departments across the country to address this issue, including efforts to end the enforcement of certain minor traffic infractions, use technology to enforce the rules or employ more de-escalation training for officers.\n\nSome places, like Brooklyn Center, where Wright was killed, have proposed that traffic enforcement be handed off to an agency other than the police.\n\nOn Dec. 6, the Brooklyn Center city council voted in favor of reducing police funding and shifting funds to support the Public Safety Act -- which will help create the new Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention.\n\nUnder this arrangement, there will be a new team of unarmed, trained medical and mental health professionals and social workers to assist with medical, mental health and disability-related calls, as well as non-violent traffic violations.\n\n\"This is a real landmark moment,\" Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott, who is also a council member, said in an interview with ABC News at the time. \"This is a start, and it is still a big step forward in doing this work.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Why black folks can't breathe\n\n&#151; -- Order rooted in and maintained and restored by fear, intimidation, brutality and incarceration is immoral and untenable. Justice is order's intended soul mate. But serving justice is twice as hard as serving fear.\n\nThe twice-as-hard spirit -- which birthed our melting-pot experiment, envisioned a Fourth Estate informing the masses, unlocked slavery's chains, loosened Jim Crow's grip, and propelled us to the moon and back -- has sadly succumbed, once again, to the predatory nature of greed and lust for power.\n\nAmerica, it appears, lost the resolve to follow the road less traveled, the never-ending, obstacle-ridden path to perfection. Just six short years after a historic election, the promise and hope of President Obama leading the third leg of our racial relay race has been remade into a finish line.\n\nIf so, we lose.\n\nThe recent legal proceedings and maneuverings that sparked unrest in Ferguson and New York and across our nation expose our monumental failure to build on and protect the gains won during the civil rights era.\n\nWe failed to heed Martin Luther King Jr.'s advice. He conceptualized a Poor People's Campaign -- a connection between African-Americans' twice-as-hard journey and the struggle of the working poor -- designed to defend civil-rights gains from inevitable backlash. He visualized the poor, the vulnerable, the working class of all races coming together to uproot the political seeds planted to grow income inequality. He died before his campaign could take hold. Most of us are unaware that the Poor People's Campaign was the essential Phase 2 of the civil rights movement.\n\nWe're even less aware that Barry Goldwater's emphasis -- Law and Order -- formed Phase 1 of the backlash to civil rights.\n\nLaw and Order -- the American political strategy of choice the last 50 years -- did not put Goldwater in the White House in 1964, but Richard Nixon rode it there in '68 and Ronald Reagan used it to move into the California governor's mansion the same year.\n\nL & O justified Nixon's drug war, harsh sentencing guidelines, the demonization of black offenders, and the preference for order rooted in fear and punishment. Law and Order spawned America's mass incarceration.\n\nAs a result, a decade-long era of organized civil disobedience in objection to legalized segregation and inequality produced a handful of useful laws that have been thwarted by a half-century of legalized mass incarceration and inequality.\n\nIt's segregation by incarceration. The great author and law professor Michelle Alexander calls it \"The New Jim Crow.\"\n\nSegregation by incarceration (SBI) has pitted the African-American community vs. the police. Segregation has never been a shadowy, impossible-to-pin-down conspiracy. It's been an American way of life. The people who opposed the civil rights movement and the end of segregation did not hold a news conference, concede defeat and pledge support for racial equality. They hatched a new strategy.\n\nSegregation by incarceration removes the offensive, in-your-face, whites-only signs and replaces them with strategic enforcement of criminal laws that: (1) segregate poor people behind bars; (2) segregate ex-cons and their loved ones outside the traditional pathways to the American dream, aka, upward mobility.\n\nSBI is much worse and more corrosive than Jim Crow.\n\nJim Crow had unintended benefits. It forced blacks to build and rely on their own economic, educational and social systems. SBI is a silent killer with no benefit. It extinguishes hope.\n\nIt's a virus that attacks the un-incarcerated with a ferocity that is nearly equal to its assault on the incarcerated. The media rarely examine and calculate the financial and emotional expenses of supporting the incarcerated. Our discomfort with mass incarceration stops at regret for warehousing more than 2 million human beings. The toll extracted from the roughly 20 million human beings who care about and/or depend on those 2 million doesn't even enter our minds.\n\nNon-offenders suffer the consequences of incarceration, too. The examples of this collateral damage are littered throughout the sports world and our entire society. Derrick Rose and Reggie Bush -- who donned \"I Can't Breathe\" T-shirts supporting Eric Garner's family -- can see, feel and testify to what we in the media have ignored for too long. Yeah, they realized the so-called American dream, but many of the people they love have not.\n\nMaking it financially does not protect you, though. Genetic gifts and a gigantic professional contract do not shield athletes from the effect of damaged childhoods. You think a father in prison didn't contribute to the stunted intellectual evolution that led Adrian Peterson to father multiple children with multiple women and physically abuse at least one of those kids with slavery/prison-style punishment?\n\nThat's just one example. There are millions of unreported and undiagnosed negative repercussions of mass incarceration.\n\nMichael Brown, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice -- God rest their souls -- are symptoms of a far more insidious crime. At this point, Brown, Garner, et al are more media distraction than useful symbols. Capitalism and television can be quite undignified. They routinely transform victims into props, ratings-driving talking points for Bill O'Reilly, Wolf Blitzer, Rachel Maddow and Charles Barkley and megaphones for opportunists masquerading as heirs to Dr. King.\n\nBefore continuing, I must state that the issue of law-enforcement brutality is personal for my family and me. In 2012, Indianapolis sheriffs tasered and killed Anton Butler, the greatest child my family ever produced, while he stood unarmed and posing no threat. To those outside my family, to the people who did not know Anton's backstory, a 28-year-old ex-con got what he deserved. Police allege he died because he had cocaine in his system. To me, to my family, to the people who knew Anton's story in full, a 28-year-old, kindhearted, lovable goofball died brutally on rain-soaked pavement without life ever giving him the chance to properly blossom.\n\nBorn in a different circumstance and zip code, Anton, a natural bookworm, would've been an accountant, an engineer, a doctor, a scientist, a sports columnist. Instead, he dabbled in a neighborhood trade -- hustling -- he had no real qualifications for, showed up one too many times at the wrong place at the wrong time, and was left with little choice but to plead guilty to several serious felony charges related to guns and drugs. The rap sheet with no context made his unwarranted death easy to dismiss for those who learned his story in the local newspaper. The pain is in the details and the context. The pain is immense and inescapable. I loved him. As a child, he and my other little cousins spent summers with me in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAnton's picture sits on my living-room table. I look at it every day.\n\nPolice brutality is a real issue for me and my family, so I don't say what comes next lightly.\n\nThere is no widespread epidemic of cops shooting and/or killing unarmed black men. That's a false flag waved by the uninformed, the lazy and the crowd that needs Ebola and ISIS and disappearing airplanes for traction. Police killing unarmed men of any color is a man-bites-dog tragedy. It's rare, which is what makes the occurrence so television titillating. Of course, every instance is one too many, and as a society we should do everything we can to prevent it. But all this talk about \"the talk\" that black parents must have with their sons about interacting with police is slightly misguided.\n\nHave \"the talk\" with your child about drinking and/or texting while driving, things far more likely to physically harm a child or adult than the police.\n\nIf you want to give additional substance to the activist/protest energy fomenting America, talk to lawmakers about the instructions and priorities they've given to law enforcement.\n\nTalk about the real plague -- segregation by incarceration.\n\nSBI is why the African-American community is distrustful of law enforcement. SBI decimated the black family structure, leaving our communities fatherless and leaderless. SBI fertilized the cultural rot that makes us believe prison culture is African-American culture.\n\nSBI is why black and brown folks feel they can't breathe.\n\nYou grow the jail/prison population from about 400,000 to 2.5 million in a 40-year period and there are bound to be drastic ramifications. You place more black men under government, penal supervision than were enslaved before the Civil War -- as Alexander's groundbreaking book, \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,\" revealed -- and there are bound to be damaging repercussions.\n\nThe marriage of capitalism to incarceration is as destructive as Ike and Tina, as unethical as Bonnie and Clyde, as immoral as Woody and Soon Yi, and as stupid as Bobby and Whitney.\n\nThe front lines of our drug war feel like occupied territories. Citizens are stopped, frisked, followed, profiled and made to feel as inmates locked in their own neighborhoods by a heavily armed occupying force. The tension is thick, palpable and suffocating. Our politicians have authorized rules of engagement that mirror those in Iraq and Afghanistan. That's why grand juries refuse to indict.\n\nThe drug war reconstructed poor neighborhoods and schools into minimum-security prisons and prison yards, governed by the same gangs and no-snitch policies commonplace in penal institutions.\n\nWhy did the proliferation of street gangs accelerate with astonishing quickness in California in the 1970s and '80s? Why was gangsta rap born in Los Angeles?\n\nBecause Ronald Reagan planted the flag of Law and Order and mass incarceration in California first.\n\nThere are millions of unreported and undiagnosed negative ramifications from segregation by incarceration.\n\nEric Garner hustled loose cigarettes/contraband. Our Law and Order culture dictated that correctional officers repeatedly harass and arrest Garner for this minor offense. But Law and Order does not extend to the suburbs, white-collar crimes and Wall Street. The drug war isn't being waged in suburbia, where drugs are used and sold by white kids at the same frequency as people of color.\n\nThe bankers and brokers who fleeced the working class with predatory loans and brought the country to near collapse have never been targeted as Public Enemy No. 1 and tagged as the enemies of a war on corruption. There is no occupying force policing the activities of Wall Street. Bankers and brokers do not get stopped and frisked. They almost never go to jail. They looted 401(k) accounts and burned this country to the ground with impunity.\n\nBut a man lost his life over loose cigarettes. Has one Wall Street thug lost his life at the hands of overzealous law enforcement?\n\nThis dichotomy is at the heart of the criminal-justice cynicism pervasive throughout black culture. The dichotomy is not unintentional. Neither is segregation. The opponents of desegregation anticipated the impact of Law and Order. L & O was Goldwater's sales pitch to white voters afraid of the end of American apartheid. Nixon doubled down on L & O and won the presidency, and three years later labeled the scourge of drugs the biggest threat to American freedom and focused law enforcement on cleaning up the poor communities that rioted in the 1960s.\n\nBill Clinton persuaded Southern whites to vote for him by jumping on the Law and Order bandwagon. The original \"first black president\" instituted draconian three-strikes and mandatory-minimum sentencing guidelines, removing a judge's discretion from our criminal courts.\n\nIt took a bipartisan, power-hungry village to completely erase rehabilitation and compassion from our criminal justice system.\n\nIt happened because Law and Order is evil but brilliant politics. It's the primary tool separating working-class/poor white people and working-class/poor black people. The criminalization and demonization of black people appeal to inherent biases and seduce working-class whites to vote against their self-interest. In matters not involving life or death, racial protectionism trumps self-interest. Poor and working-class whites take one for \"their\" team.\n\nUnfortunately, many African-Americans help their natural allies overlook an abundance of common concerns and interests by framing inequality discussions in the most extreme, distorted and polarizing manner.\n\nDumbed-down, irresponsible Twitter hashtags won't stop segregation by incarceration. They empower it. They keep the national conversation steered away from the real problem and real solutions.\n\nSensitivity training and body cameras for law enforcement treat segregation-by-incarceration symptoms. Body cameras will have no impact on the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar prison industrial complex that recruits new inmates in poor minority zip codes and then swindles an inmate's family and friends with court fees, calling-card fees, commissary fees, clothing fees and fee fees.\n\nWhat do taxpayers get in return? Our prisons spit out men broken and scarred by a barbaric system. We're stuck caring for their abandoned children who have been infected with the virus that makes them predisposed for incarceration. We're stuck with the cultural decay that undermines the integrity necessary to maintain a civilized society.\n\nYou want to curb police brutality? You have to seek order through justice, not fear and punishment. You have to feed the poor hope, not hopelessness.\n\nYou want to curb police brutality? The American media have to prioritize discussing complicated issues in a nuanced, informed and transparent fashion.\n\nOur republic fails without an informed public. We're not informed. We're entertained.\n\nCharles Barkley, whose inflammatory and pandering comments about Ferguson made national news last week, is a too-easy target. Truth is, he's no more or less informed/credible on the issues surrounding Ferguson than most of the other opinion-makers babbling on television. Cable TV demands pandering to a base and irresponsible commentary.\n\nBarkley's labeling of rioters and looters as \"scumbags\" and \"not real black people\" is less offensive than the left-wing intellectuals who condoned the rioting and looting from the comfort of a TV studio. Baiting and/or suggesting to the poor, vulnerable and hopeless that they take risks you would not is cowardly, exploitive and narcissistic. It's a tactic of a demagogue. Demagoguery fuels TV.\n\nIt's unfair to single out television media. Print media gave up analyzing race and culture as a serious endeavor decades ago. Newspapers and magazines used to cover race as a beat. Reporters and editors specialized in the topic. We turned away from that kind of pervasive and measured coverage in the aftermath of the civil rights movement, especially once the best black journalists fled black media outlets to work for mainstream publications. African-Americans gutted their most powerful and effective voice: black-owned newspapers.\n\nAnd as mainstream print publications lost their advertising financial monopolies and became reliant on a handful of major corporations, while the right wing demonized any discussion of race and inequality issues, serious coverage of difficult subjects virtually disappeared from print.\n\nInternet journalism has mostly disappointed so far. Traditional media repurposed for the Internet are trapped between being too concerned with clicks and too fearful of irritating their old base with unsettling content. New Internet media -- although commendably ambitious -- are too reliant on untrained, unseasoned and assimilated millennials whose worldview is shaped by, and whose day-to-day interaction with urban America is limited to, social media and pop culture.\n\nHolistic journalism, the kind that pushes America toward a more perfect union, is a twice-as-hard undertaking. It can be done only with resources, commitment, experience and life-experience-rich diversity. Holistic journalism challenges us to think, re-evaluate and discover our better selves. At its best, America has often overcome its flaws and found the courage to embrace the task of self-evaluation and renewal. We survived the Civil War, the assassination of President Lincoln, the tumultuous 1960s, and the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nOne of the biggest differences between then and now is the quality of the information provided to the masses. The collapsing business model for the institutions that traditionally informed us in a nuanced way has compromised what we're willing to tell the masses. This has led to the goal of true equality being replaced by the impossibility of attaining colorblindness.\n\nColorblindness, in a country with our complex racial history, has nothing to do with equality and everything to do with disregarding the sins of bigotry. Colorblindness is a ploy to avoid the difficulty of pursuing justice.\n\nJustice is blind. America is not.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Families of Botham Jean, Antwon Rose, Danroy Henry partner with NFL, Roc Nation for 'Inspire Change' initiative\n\nThe NFL unveiled a PSA centered around Botham Jean in January 2020.\n\nAngella Henry, Michelle Kenney and Alissa Findley all have one thing in common: young and unarmed black men in their families were shot and killed by police officers.\n\nThe three heartbroken family members, who said they have police in their families, shared their stories on \"The View\" Tuesday and explained why they decided to join the NFL and Jay-Z's Roc Nation for its \"Inspire Change\" initiative.\n\nTheir decision to join comes after the the NFL unveiled an emotional public service announcement as part of its partnership with Roc Nation centered around the story of Botham Jean , Findley's brother.\n\nJean was 26 years old when he was killed in his own Dallas apartment by off-duty police officer Amber Guyger on Sept. 6, 2018. Guyger was returning home after work that night when she claimed she had mistaken Jean's apartment for her's and thought he was a burglar, subsequently shooting him.\n\n\"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin brought up former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick , who stirred up controversy when he began protesting police shootings by taking a knee during the national anthem and hasn't played a professional game since 2016. Hostin asked the families if they felt the NFL was taking on this initiative to \"give themselves cover\" after Kaepernick alleged in a grievance that league owners colluded to ensure he remains unsigned. The lawsuit was settled in February 2019.\n\n\"I think they're using good families to do it,\" Hostin added. \"How do you respond to that?\"\n\n\"I'm a Kaepernick fanatic,\" said Kenney, the mother of Antwon Rose Jr., who was shot by a police officer in 2018. \"I was a Kap fan way before he took the knee, and I will forever be grateful for him opening this conversation.\"\n\n\"But Antwon is my son, so when you get a call from Roc Nation and the NFL and they say, we want to take your platform to the next level, we don't want anything from you, and we have a plan, I have to remember that Antwon is my son,\" Kenney continued. \"So I'm all in.\"\n\nRose, 17, was shot three times in the back by a rookie police officer while running away during a traffic stop in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on June 19, 2018. The officer, Michael Rosfeld , was found not guilty of homicide for the shooting death of Rose. Kenney said the verdict \"wasn't a surprise for her.\"\n\n\"I was more concerned with my daughter and my family members, but I totally understand how the system works and I wasn't shocked at all,\" Kenney said on \"The View\" Tuesday. \"I held that close to the vest, though, because I wanted to protect my daughter and my mother, but I wasn't surprised. It's the way the system works.\"\n\nAngella Henry, the mother of Danroy \"Danny\" Henry, who was shot and killed by a police officer on Oct. 17, 2010, while sitting a in car after celebrating a college football game in Mount Pleasant, New York, told \"The View\" her and Kaepernick are both trying to spread awareness of police brutality.\n\n\"We're doing the same thing, and with the reach of both the NFL and Roc Nation, and being here on 'The View,' we're reaching even more people that may not know our stories,\" Angella Henry said, \"and now they do.\"\n\nOf her son's death, she said that she was \"grateful\" that another officer who was there on the night of her son's fatal shooting came forward to tell her what happened.\n\n\"[Danroy] was told to move. He was in a fire lane and the police officer tapped on his window and asked him to move,\" Henry said the officer told her.\n\nShe said he also told her that the officer who shot her son said he \"thought he heard someone say 'stop'\" before shooting Danroy Henry in the car.\n\n\"The other police officer came forward and said that the only threat that night was the officer that killed our son,\" Henry said. \"Our son wasn't doing anything wrong. He wasn't speeding. He wasn't disobeying an order.\"\n\nFindley, meanwhile, said the partnership with the NFL and Roc Nation is the next step in an ongoing conversation.\n\n\"I look at it as Kaepernick started the conversation, and with Roc Nation and the NFL, they're now taking another step,\" Findley said. \"It doesn't end here with Roc Nation and the NFL. We're looking for anyone with a platform to keep this conversation going so that we can come up with the resolution.\"\n\nFindley also spoke about the moment she learned her brother had died. After Jean was rushed to a hospital, she said a social worker called her to ask her to identify a body that could be her brother's.\n\n\"I asked her, 'Is he alive?' And she said, 'I'm sorry to have to tell you, he succumbed to his injuries,'\" Findley said. \"At that point I was in shock.\"\n\nThe three family members also had a chance to sit down with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell . They spoke highly about their time together while he listened to their stories.\n\n\"You can't fake empathy, especially when you're a parent,\" Kenney said of Goodell. \"I watched his facial gestures. I listened to every word he said. He cried when I cried. He didn't rush us. He didn't ask us to leave. He was the kindest man.\"\n\n\"That man -- that man shed tears for my son,\" Kenney added.\n\n\"It's an opportunity that we had to share personally our stories with him because maybe he hears them from a distance,\" Angella Henry said. \"But this is a chance for him to meet the families, and truly get to know us and understand what we're trying to do.\"\n\nEvery episode of ABC's award-winning talk show \"The View\" is now available as a podcast!

      "text": "Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, reflects on her son's legacy a decade after his death\n\n\"I still have a hole in my heart,\" Fulton told \"GMA.\"\n\nOver the past decade, the Black Lives Matter movement has brought attention to racism and injustice in America through the stories of hundreds of Black men, women and children, but it all started with a hashtag that went viral in the wake of the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on Feb. 26, 2012.\n\nMartin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, has been unyielding in her fight for social justice, becoming one of the most prominent activists nationwide and a leader in the \"Mothers of the Movement\" - a group of women whose Black children have been killed by police officers or gun violence.\n\nTen years after her son's death, Fulton reflected on the fight for social justice and how she is keeping her son's legacy alive in an exclusive interview with \" Good Morning America .\"\n\n\"My chest still hurts. I still have a hole in my heart,\" Fulton said.\n\nMartin was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer named George Zimmerman, who deemed him \"suspicious\" as he walked back from a convenience store to his father's fiancée's home in Sanford, Florida, wearing a hoodie and carrying a bag of Skittles candy, according to police.\n\nThe hoodie and the Skittles became symbols of the fight for social justice as the Black Lives Matter movement grew to an international movement.\n\n\"I never lose sight that that was my baby,\" Fulton said when asked how she reconciles her memory of her son with the symbol for justice that his name has become.\n\n\"By the same token, I know that Trayvon Martin is a symbol for other Trayvon Martins that you don't know, that you have not said their name ... He was just a vessel that represents so many others.\"\n\nIn \"Trayvon: Ten Years Later: A Mother's Essay,\" which was published by Amazon Original Stories on Feb. 1, Fulton reflects on love, loss and shares lessons with a new generation from her fight for social justice over the past 10 years.\n\n\"I absolutely think that change is happening; it's just going a little slow,\" Fulton said when asked if she feels that we are at a turning point in the fight for social justice.\n\nMartin was shot and killed by Zimmerman, who called 911 from his vehicle and was told by a police dispatcher not to follow the teenager.\n\nSoon after, a physical altercation between Martin and Zimmerman ensued, and Martin was shot and killed, according to investigators.\n\nZimmerman claimed the shooting took place in self-defense. He was eventually arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He was found not guilty by a jury in July 2013.\n\nMartin would have turned 27 this year on Feb. 5.\n\n\"You can't help but to wonder what he would have become [and] what he would have achieved in the last 10 years,\" Fulton said.\n\nShe said that when she sees his younger brother, Jahvaris Fulton, attend college, she always thinks about the path Trayvon would have taken. She often reflects on this when she visits an airport because of Trayvon's interest in aviation.\n\n\"The airport also reminds me of Trayvon,\" she said. \"I always think about if he was going to fix the plane, [or] fly the planes because he wasn't really sure.\"\n\nFulton said that she wants her son's story to be a reminder of the lack of accountability in America's criminal justice system.\n\n\"I want the world to know that my son was unarmed and he was 17 years old,\" Fulton said. \"He wasn't committing any crime. Trayvon's only crime was the color of his skin ... which is not a crime.\"\n\nFulton said that while guilty verdicts in the cases of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery are a sign of progress, the killings of those unarmed Black men are also an indication that \"we take two steps forward and two steps back.\"\n\n\"When I look at the case of George Floyd and I look at the case of Ahmaud Arbery and the people that killed them all were convicted and that they are going to be going to jail for the rest of their lives,\" she said. \"But by the same token, we had to lose lives in order to get to that point ... why did we have to lose those lives in order for us to move the country forward?\"\n\nFloyd, an unarmed Black man, died in May 2020 after police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against his neck for more than 9 minutes. Chauvin was convicted in Floyd's death and was sentenced in June 2021 to 22 and a half years in prison .\n\nArbery, an unarmed Black, was chased and gunned down while jogging in February 2020. Three men who were convicted in Arbery's shooting were found guilty in November 2021 and were each sentenced last month to life in prison .\n\nBoth cases gained national attention and became rallying cries in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nFulton said that she is hopeful that the next generation of activists will bring about lasting change and while she \"can't change the world,\" by herself, she wants to do her part to \"make a difference in this world.\"\n\n\"My purpose is to continue to bring awareness to senseless gun violence. My purpose is the circle of mothers - helping other mothers to cope with the loss of a child,\" she said. \"My purpose is to try to change laws.\"\n\nIn her essay, \"Trayvon: Ten Years Later,\" Fulton reflects on how the past 10 years have changed her and how racism has shaped the fight for justice in her son's name:\n\n\"How am I different today? If I am not picking myself up and becoming more than I was last year, then I am no good to anyone. There is a part of me that died along with my son, so I became who I had to become in that moment. I didn't pray to become the mother of a movement. I was happy being the mother of Trayvon Martin and Jahvaris Fulton. I became the mother of a movement out of necessity. Sometimes you have to step into roles you did not ask for and that you do not want. You can find the strength from within if you are willing to live in your purpose. Believe in your strength from within. That's a Word,\" she writes in the essay.\n\n\"While nothing compares emotionally to the loss of a child due to senseless, racially tinged violence, the on- and offline smear campaign was its own sort of shock. It wasn't enough that it took law enforcement far too long to take Trayvon's killer into custody, right-wing conservatives and members of law enforcement started to attack my son's character, as if any mistakes he made as a child could justify his untimely death. I had never seen such a negative frenzy with the media weaponized against the actual victim. We, my family and I, strove to channel our energy in a positive and productive way, but there were times back then when I felt like it was all in vain. It was shameful and undue to see a victim slandered in such a public way. The words' Trayvon Martin' had become clickbait and a hot topic, with celebrities, influencers, and politicians all taking part. While many seized the moment to speak truth to power and take a stand for Black lives, others were far less altruistic and merely saw it as an opportunity to garner attention and increase the reach of their brand in the most toxic of ways. According to an article in the Miami Herald, my son's name was tweeted over two million times in the short period of thirty days.\"\n\nABC News' Amanda McMaster and Taylor Rhodes contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What the Justice Department Review Means for the Eric Garner Case\n\nGarner died on July 17, 2014, after being placed in a chokehold.\n\n&#151; -- The federal investigation into the death of Eric Garner is under new scrutiny two years after the Department of Justice announced that it was launching a civil rights probe.\n\nThe DOJ's Civil Rights Division in Washington, D.C ., is reviewing the case, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The case has been primarily handled by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\"This is kind of like doing due diligence on the investigation,\" said Richard Frankel, an ABC contributor and former FBI agent who oversaw the federal Garner investigation when the feds first came in.\n\nGarner died on July 17, 2014, after being placed in a chokehold by Officer David Pantaleo during an arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes in New York City.\n\nThe incident, which was caught on video, was one of a number of high-profile incidents of unarmed black men killed by white police officers that have sparked outrage and protests across the country and a flashpoint in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"I can't breathe,\" which Garner can be heard saying in the video, became one of the movement's rallying cries.\n\nThe New York Police Department said today that its own investigation into the incident is ongoing, but that at the request of DOJ, it is waiting to move ahead with administrative proceedings.\n\n\"We are continuing to watch the situation, standing by on what we will do, and we are waiting to hear from them [federal prosecutors] at this point,\" said Deputy NYPD Commissioner Larry Byrne.\n\nOne possibility is that federal prosecutors closest to the investigation don't believe there is enough evidence to bring charges, but are being pushed by DOJ in Washington, D.C., to continue the investigation and bring a case forward, according to civil rights attorneys who spoke to ABC News.\n\nEven if the Justice Department decides to bring charges, a grand jury still needs to indict for the case to move ahead.\n\nAnother concern may be that the federal prosecutors in New York could be too close to the issue and people involved to impartially evaluate the case.\n\nEarlier this week, The New York Times reported that disagreements over whether to bring charges had caused a shake-up among the prosecution team.\n\nIf someone wants there to be a trial, a shuffle within the prosecution team indicates that this is more likely, according to Barry Friedman, professor of law at New York University.\n\nHowever, it's possible that other factors resulted in an additional review.\n\n\"Reasonable minds could easily differ in a case like this because of the nature of the legal standard,\" said Daniel Richman, professor of law at Columbia Law School.\n\nThe Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the case.\n\nWhen former Attorney General Eric Holder announced the launch of the civil rights investigation, he said, \"We must seek to heal the breakdown in trust that we have seen.\"\n\nLast year, Garner's family settled with New York City for $5.9 million, but so far criminal charges have been stalled.\n\nIn 2014, a grand jury on Staten Island decided not indict Pantaleo in connection to the death of Garner. That decision meant that the only potential criminal charges would come from the pending federal investigation.\n\nAt that point, FBI agents in New York, NYPD investigators and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office formed a team to begin the civil rights investigation, according to Frankel.\n\n\"Two years is long, but not unheard of,\" for a case like this, he said.\n\nA review by DOJ could be a way of \"dotting the I's and crossing the T's,\" he added.\n\nIn order to convict in the federal civil rights case, prosecutors need to show that officers willfully violated Garner's constitutional rights.\n\nBut stepping over the line of appropriate behavior doesn't necessarily mean a willful violation, according to attorneys familiar with case law.\n\nThe video helped the investigation, but it's not conclusive, according to Frankel. \"The problem with video is you never see everything,\" he said.\n\nPantaleo's attorney, Stuart London, told ABC News that the DOJ should accept the recommendation not to indict Pantaleo \"rather than impair the integrity of the investigation by allowing politics to replace the rule of law.\"\n\n\"This matter has been thoroughly investigated by a state grand jury as well as experienced FBI agents and assistant U.S. attorneys. The recommendation is apparently that there was no civil rights violation. It is unprecedented to continue shopping for new FBI agents who support a predetermined result,\" he said in a statement.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "An 'eerie' parallel of two knees: George Floyd's death renews debate on Kaepernick protest\n\nThe quarterback sparked a movement by taking a knee to protest police brutality.\n\nProtests against the deaths of unarmed black men and women at the hands of law enforcement have often revived conversations surrounding Colin Kaepernick, but the killing last week of George Floyd has brought Kaepernick back into the debate in a stark way.\n\nThe images of a police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck as the Minnesota man called out that he can't breathe have sparked advocates, athletes and celebrities to draw a direct visual parallel to Kaepernick's kneeling protest against police brutality, with side-by-side photos going viral on social media.\n\nLeBron James was among those to share the parallel images on Instagram, topped with the words, \"This ... is why.\"\n\n\"Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you??\" the Los Angeles Lakers star wrote in the caption. Printouts of that same image have also been held up during protests around the country.\n\nKaepernick, a former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, became the first NFL player to take a knee on the football field during the playing of the national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality.\n\n\"It's this sort of eerie similarity in the position that Kaepernick physically took, and the position that the officer had assumed on the neck and the head of George Floyd,\" Marc Lamont Hill, an activist and professor of media studies and urban education at Temple University, told ABC News.\n\n\"It was almost like the flip side of it, that Kaepernick was taking a knee for justice and this man was taking a knee in ending the life of a black man in the very fashion that Colin Kaepernick was protesting and trying to put a spotlight on,\" he said.\n\nAmid the unrest, even some police officers and top brass have taken a knee in the streets alongside protesters in solidarity against the killings of unarmed black people.\n\nFloyd was apprehended by police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last Monday. According to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office, Floyd's death was a homicide caused by \"a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).\"\n\nAn independent autopsy ordered by George Floyd's family found his death was a \"homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain,\" according to early findings from the examination released Monday.\n\nDerek Chauvin, who was fired from the Minneapolis Police following the incident, has been charged with third-degree murder in connection with Floyd's death. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, including about three minutes while Floyd was unresponsive, according to court documents.\n\nThree other officers who were on the scene -- Thomas Lane, J.A. Kueng and Tou Thao -- have not been charged but an investigation is still ongoing, according to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.\n\n\"You can't stop thinking about that,\" said sports journalist and ABC News contributor Christine Brennan. \"The side-by-side visuals are everything, and because we are such a visual society, because photos and video matters so much to us ... that then brings Colin Kaepernick back into the conversation in a big way. If people had forgotten him or pushed him out of their memory, [Kaepernick] has come flooding back because of the visual, and then because he was right.\"\n\nKaepernick, who hasn't played in the NFL since 2016, sparked a movement after first taking a knee on the field in August 2016, with several other athletes following his example -- the first of which was then-teammate Eric Reid. It is widely viewed that Kaepernick was blacklisted from the NFL due to his on-field protest.\n\nOver the past couple of seasons, on-field protests have waned, but Reid -- along with players Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson -- has continued to take a knee.\n\nBrennan said we \"don't know\" whether this wave of protests will have an impact on the football field this coming season, but she is \"stunned\" the NFL has not signed Kaepernick. \"One would think that a team would want to sign him if only for the symbolism of the message that would be set, especially to young people,\" she said.\n\nKaepernick filed a grievance against league owners in 2017 alleging that they colluded to ensure that he remained unsigned. The lawsuit has been settled.\n\nThe NFL on Saturday released a statement from commissioner Roger Goodell, who offered condolences to the family of George Floyd and said that the league was \"greatly saddened by the tragic events\" amid nationwide protests.\n\n\"The protesters' reactions to these incidents reflect the pain, anger and frustration that so many of us feel,\" Goodell wrote, adding that the protests \"underscore\" that \"there remains much more to do as a country and as a league.\"\n\nHill noted that the statement \"didn't offer any criticism, any outrage\" and did not mention \"the killing of anybody\" or words like \"racism\" or \"police violence.\"\n\nReid, who is now a free agent, and Stills both criticized the statement, with Reid appearing to mock the NFL's social change initiative, which was launched in January 2019 amid mounting backlash over Kaepernick's absence.\n\nThrough the initiative, the NFL partnered with the Players Coalition and other organizations, including Jay-Z's Roc Nation, on social justice campaigns.\n\nBut with Kaepernick still unsigned, those efforts have been viewed as an effort to save face by activists and players who have continued to take a knee.\n\nHill said the NFL's statement during the protests is in \"sharp contrast\" to how Kaepernick has been treated.\n\n\"He became persona non grata in the NFL. He was treated as an enemy of the state, and I mean that quite literally when you look at the response of Donald Trump to him,\" Hill said. \"Donald Trump had more words of outrage for Kaepernick than he did for the killer, the killer of George Floyd.\"\n\nAsked about the criticism, a spokesperson for the NFL told ABC News on Tuesday that league is \"in daily contact with our national social justice partners to listen, understand and generate new ideas of how we can help use the platform of the NFL to help improve relations with law enforcement. We are working closely with the clubs and players to provide more grants and programs that can be adapted in local communities.\"\n\n\"Our clubs and players have worked extensively to provide training sessions, community gatherings and ride-alongs with players and local police departments, as well as team-facilitated volunteer programs that involve police officers and underserved youth,\" the spokesperson added. \"We are committed to working with players, clubs and partners to make positive change in our communities.\"\n\nKaepernick, who founded his own social justice organization, has spoken out in support of activists and started a legal defense fund to provide legal representation to those protesting in Minneapolis.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has been silent on Kaepernick and the NFL's handling of the protests for more than a year, clearly took a side in this divisive debate by repeatedly lambasting players who took a knee in a years-long feud with the NFL.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Bill Whitaker is the correspondent. Marc Lieberman and Michael Kaplan, producers.\n\nLast September in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a brief encounter between a black man, Terence Crutcher, and a white police officer, Betty Shelby, ended with Terence Crutcher's death.  He was shot by Officer Shelby who goes on trial in May for manslaughter.  She faces four years to life in prison. The shooting was caught on videotape and inflamed the debate about race and policing that's been roiling the nation since Ferguson. It's very likely you have seen video of similar police shootings before. But it's very rare to hear from the officer who pulled the trigger before a jury does.\n\nTonight, Betty Shelby tells us why she shot and killed an unarmed black man and why she says almost any police officer in her situation would have done the same.\n\nBill Whitaker: You remember pulling the trigger?\n\nBetty Shelby: I do. It's like slow motion of me bringing my gun up, my finger coming in and then letting off. And he stopped and then he just slowly fell to the ground.\n\nThe shooting took place at dusk on this two-lane road in North Tulsa, in a predominantly African-American area.  Police cameras captured the climax of the encounter between 42-year-old police officer Betty Shelby and 40-year-old Terence Crutcher. That's Crutcher in the white shirt, walking with his hands up.  Shelby, a 10-year veteran of law enforcement, is right behind him with her gun drawn.  Just two minutes after they came face-to-face on this road, Shelby fired her gun.\n\nIt's hard to see the actual shot on videotape but, from the chopper, you can see Crutcher fall to the ground from the shot to his side.\n\nBetty Shelby: Shots fired!\n\nPolice dispatch:  Adam 331 we have shots fired, we have one suspect down.\n\nBill Whitaker: So tell me what I'm not seeing in the video. Up until the time of the shooting, it does appear that he's got his hands in the air?\n\nBetty Shelby: He does have his hands in the air.\n\nBut Shelby says the video doesn't tell the whole story.  It all started 10 minutes earlier.  She was on her way to a domestic-violence call when she says she saw a man she later would learn was Terence Crutcher standing in the road. She noticed his size, about 6 feet, 240 pounds, and his demeanor.\n\nBetty Shelby:  His hands are just dropped beside him. His chin is resting on his chest. And he's standing there motionless. And I thought, \"Hmmm. I wonder if he's on PCP.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: Why did that cross your mind first?\n\nBetty Shelby: Because it was an odd behavior.  Zombie-like, I-- I-- it's the best I can-\n\nBill Whitaker: Zombie-like?\n\nBetty Shelby:  Zombie-like.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did you consider him a threat at that time?\n\nBetty Shelby: No. Not at that time.\n\nSo Shelby drove past him and continued on to her call.\n\nAbout 500 feet beyond where she first saw Crutcher, she came upon an abandoned SUV here in the middle of the road.  She didn't activate her dashboard camera because she thought this was just a broken-down vehicle.  But when she got out of her patrol car, she noticed the motor of the SUV was running.\n\nBetty Shelby: I work in a high-crime area where every day, we get calls of shots fired. I don't think this is just an abandoned vehicle. So I walk on up to the driver's side. I glance in. I don't see anyone. And I notice the windows are down.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did you see any weapons?\n\nBetty Shelby: I wasn't looking for any.  I was glancing to see if there was someone hurt.\n\nThen she says she noticed the man she had seen just moments before walking toward her and the abandoned vehicle.\n\nBetty Shelby: And I say, \"Hey, man, is this your vehicle?\" And he mumbles something. And I can't understand him.  And he starts putting his hands in his pocket. I say, \"Hey, man, take your hands outta your pockets. I'm trying to find out is this your vehicle?\"  And when I tell him to take his hands out of his pockets, he just immediately puts 'em in the air.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what's going through your mind?\n\nBetty Shelby:  Well, what's goin' through my mind is what I've experienced before. I've encountered people putting their hands in their pockets, and I find a loaded gun in their pocket.\n\nNone of the early encounter was recorded on video but Shelby says her training taught her that people on PCP could turn violent and she says Crutcher kept reaching into his pocket.\n\nBetty Shelby:  That's when I get on the radio and say I've got a subject that's not showing me his hands.  And it was at that point that I drew my weapon in a ready position. It would just be a motion like this if you need to.\n\nBill Whitaker: Was he being belligerent?\n\nBetty Shelby: No.\n\nBill Whitaker: Was he showing any aggression?\n\nBetty Shelby: No.\n\nBill Whitaker: Is it possible that you saw him as more dangerous because he was a large black man?\n\nBetty Shelby: No. What I based everything on was his actions, his behaviors.  Race had nothing to do with my decision making.\n\nShelby says Crutcher kept ignoring her commands, kept walking toward the SUV even though she had drawn her gun, and had ordered him to get on his knees.\n\nBetty Shelby:  And he's not doing it. I'm hollering at him, \"Stop. Stop now.  And he has now put his hands back up in the air. And he's looking at his vehicle, back at me.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: And you're thinking?\n\nBetty Shelby: I'm thinking he's calculating how he can get to his vehicle to get whatever weapon it is that he's going to get because he didn't find it in his pocket.\n\nTyler Turnbough: I was literally a quarter mile away, so I got in the car and drove to the scene quickly.\n\nOfficer Tyler Turnbough responded to Officer Shelby's radio call.  His siren was on so his dashboard camera was running.  The ground-level video of the shooting was recorded from his car.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what'd you see when you got there?\n\nTyler Turnbough: The first thing I saw when I got there was Mr. Crutcher walking away with his hands up, Betty has him at gunpoint, and I got out of the car and I can hear her giving him commands. \"Stop. Get on the ground. Don't go back to your car.\"\n\nNatsound:  Alright Betty Jo, where you at?\n\nAt the same time, a police helicopter swooped in with two officers on board:  A pilot and a spotter who, that day, happened to be Officer Betty Shelby's husband.\n\nNatsound:  He's got his hands up there for her now.\n\nDavid Shelby says he could see his wife had a weapon drawn.  The pilot saw something else .\n\nNatsound:  That looks like a bad dude too.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did you think he looked like a \"bad dude\"?\n\nDavid Shelby: What I-- what I saw was, an individual that was being noncompliant and apparently and obviously refusing to obey the commands of the officer.\n\nAs Officer Turnbough ran to assist, he saw that Betty Shelby had drawn her gun.  So he grabbed his Taser.\n\nTyler Turnbough: If the roles had been reversed and she had her Taser out, then I would've had my gun out.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did you assess the situation as being dangerous?\n\nTyler Turnbough: Yes. It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. I don't know what this guy's doing. Why is he-- why is he walking away from her? What are his intentions? Why doesn't he just stop?\n\nBill Whitaker: So, we see his arms are up and you're behind him?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.\n\nWe asked Betty Shelby to look at the video and show us what she saw before the fatal shot.\n\nBetty Shelby: I'm feeling that his intent is to do me harm and I keep thinking, \"Don't do this. Please don't do this. Don't make this happen.\" And then right there he's looking back at me. That's what we call \"targeting.\" So he's getting my position, my last-known location to retrieve and then shoot.\n\nBill Whitaker: You think he's sizing up the situation to see where you are, how close, if he were to grab a weapon, he would know exactly where to turn to shoot? That's what you're thinking?\n\nBetty Shelby: That-- yes.\n\nIt's unclear what happened in the final moments of Crutcher's life. Officers Shelby and Turnbough were in front of the dashboard camera and the helicopter was too far away.  But Betty Shelby says, what's hard to see on the video tape, is what she saw.  She says Crutcher dropped his arms and reached into the car.\n\nBetty Shelby: His shoulders drop, his arm drops, and he's reaching in. And it's fast. Just that would tell any officer that that man's going for a weapon.\n\nBill Whitaker: You see this on the video?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker:  That's what you say is Mr. Crutcher reaching into the car?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.  I say with a louder, more intense voice, \"Stop. Stop! Stop!\" and he didn't. And that's when I took aim.\n\nNatsound: Betty Shelby: Shots Fired!\n\nTiffany Crutcher: I don't know what Officer Shelby was thinking when she pulled that trigger.\n\nTiffany Crutcher is Terence Crutcher's twin sister. She says the tape shows her brother was not being aggressive, not being threatening.\n\nBill Whitaker: There is a frame that seems to show that his hands were lowered. And that's what she says alarmed her and made her fear for her life.\n\nTiffany Crutcher: Of course, she's saying everything that she's supposed to say to defend herself. What we saw on that video is what my dad always taught us to do if we were pulled over by a police officer. Put your hands in the air and put your hands on the car. And my brother did what my father taught us.\n\nBill Whitaker: Was this a case of \"Hands up, don't shoot\"?\n\nTiffany Crutcher: Absolutely. It absolutely was.\n\nBut Officer Shelby says it was a case of a noncompliant subject who she perceived was threatening her life. That's why she says she pulled the trigger. Officer Turnbough says he saw the same threat and fired his Taser at the same moment.  It was the first time Betty Shelby had discharged her gun in the line of duty.\n\nBill Whitaker: If things had worked out differently, he would go before a judge, have his day in court.\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: But as it turns out, you're judge, jury, and executioner on the spot.\n\nBetty Shelby: No. I saw a threat and I used the force I felt necessary to stop a threat.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you think, \"I could shoot him in the leg, I could shoot him in the foot\"? Is there nothing else you could've done?\n\nBetty Shelby: No. And I'm not trained to shoot someone in the foot. We don't train to be cowboys and to be like what they show on the movies.\n\nTerence Crutcher lay bleeding in the street for about two minutes before officers moved in to check him for weapons and administer first aid. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. A vial of PCP was found in the driver's side-door pocket. But police found no weapons on his body or in his car.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you have any regrets about this?\n\nBetty Shelby: I have sorrow that this happened that this man lost his life but he caused the situation to occur. So in the end, he caused his own.\n\nBill Whitaker: He caused his death?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: Officer Shelby says that your brother's actions caused his own death.  What do you say to that?\n\nTiffany Crutcher: My brother's dead because she didn't pause.  And because she didn't pause, my family, we've had to pause. We've had to stop. We've had to lay down every single night with tears in our eyes. There was absolutely no justification whatsoever, with all the backup, for Officer Shelby to pull that trigger. No justification whatsoever.\n\nBetty Shelby: If I wait to find out if he had a gun or not, I could very well be dead. There's something that we always say. \"I'd rather be tried by 12 than carried by six.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: But as it turned out, he did not have a gun.\n\nBetty Shelby: No, he did not.\n\nBill Whitaker: And because of your action, a man is dead.\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: How do you come to terms with that?\n\nBetty Shelby: It's very difficult.\n\nBill Whitaker: Still?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes. I never wanted to be in that spot. His actions dictated my actions.\n\nBill Whitaker: You can take your time.\n\nBetty Shelby: I never wanted to kill anyone.\n\nBetty Shelby says she acted out of fear for her life. But many in Tulsa's black community say her fears were unfounded and influenced by race. That part of the story when we come back.\n\nAfter Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby shot and killed Terence Crutcher on a two-lane road last September, video of the incident ricocheted around the country.  It's unsettling and, at the moment the shot is fired, it's unclear. Where some may see a threatening and noncompliant subject, others may see a nonaggressive man shot with his hands up.  How 12 jurors see it when the trial begins in May will determine Betty Shelby's fate.  Black Tulsans tell us they'll be watching.  It's a tale they say they have seen too many times before.\n\nBill Whitaker:  There are people in black communities all across the United States who think that white officers overreact when it comes to dealing with black men in general, and they view this through that lens. What do you say to those folks?\n\nBetty Shelby: My incident is not a racist incident. I am not racist. Race had no factor in what happened.\n\nRay Owens: Race had everything to do with her pulling the trigger that day.\n\nRay Owens has been pastor of Metropolitan Baptist Church -- Tulsa's largest predominantly black congregation -- for 11 years. Pastor Owens saw police bias in the video and heard it in the words of the pilot.\n\nPilot: That looks like a bad dude, too.\n\nRay Owens: I think the statement represents the same bias against African-American males that caused Betty Shelby to pull the trigger.\n\nBill Whitaker: What do you mean?\n\nRay Owens: Betty Shelby very likely viewed Terence Crutcher as a \"bad dude.\"  Is she a racist? Does she, you know, have some ill will toward black people? I doubt it. But if she is like so many people in our nation, she assumes too quickly that a black male, especially out on the streets at night, is a threat and not a citizen.  Is a suspect and not-a decent human being.\n\nBill Whitaker: You don't think a white citizen of Tulsa would have been treated the same way?\n\nRay Owens: I don't think that a young white male would be dead today.\n\nThese are the final moments of Terence Crutcher's life. You can see him here, walking. His hands are up.  Officer Shelby says she thought he was walking back to his car to retrieve a gun.  When he got to the driver's side window, she says he reached in and she fired. It turned out Crutcher did not have a weapon.\n\nTiffany Crutcher:  Nobody went to check on him. He laid there. They let him lay there like an animal.\n\nTerence Crutcher's twin sister, Tiffany, says her brother's death fits a tragic narrative of police shooting unarmed black men.\n\nTiffany Crutcher:  I saw Trayvon Martin. I saw Mike Brown. I saw Philando Castile. You know, I saw Tamir Rice.  But never in a thousand years would my family, would we have thought that we would be on their side of it.  And my brother now, according to social media, is another hashtag.\n\nBill Whitaker: Who was he?\n\nTiffany Crutcher: He would be deemed in our household the gentle giant. Terence was laid back, calm, cool. Gospel music was his love.\n\nHis family says Terence was a devoted father of four young children, but they admit he struggled with drug use.  He spent four years in prison for selling five grams of crack cocaine.  Officer Shelby didn't know any of this when she encountered him on that road, but she says she did suspect he was on drugs.  His autopsy showed he had PCP in his system.\n\nTiffany Crutcher:  Maybe he needed some help. Yes, he needed some help. But he ended up with a fatal gunshot wound to the chest. I've had people tweet and say, \"Your brother deserved to die. Your brother, you know, is a thug. Your brother should've complied or he would still be alive.\" You know, \"Why didn't he do what the officer asked him to do?\"\n\nBill Whitaker: What do you say to that question that he should've complied?\n\nTiffany Crutcher: You know, why did she want him to comply? I'm-- I-- I'm still curious. What crime was he committing? Why were you on the scene?\n\nBill Whitaker: She noticed a car in the middle of the road.\n\nTiffany Crutcher: So she wasn't called to the scene because Terence was committing a crime, she just noticed a car in the middle of the road, and the outcome was my brother was murdered. Wow.\n\nTulsa leaders feared many citizens would have the same reaction.  Dewey Bartlett was mayor at the time. He remembers the call he got from Police Chief Chuck Jordan.\n\nDewey Bartlett: He said that there was a shooting and it could've been one of those situations where they had their hands in the air.\n\nBill Whitaker: This is the police chief talking to you shortly after getting to the scene?\n\nDewey Bartlett: Yes. At that point I went, \"Oh boy, this is not good.\"\n\nBill Whitaker: Were you concerned that this might trigger civil unrest?\n\nDewey Bartlett: Oh sure, sure. Because we'd seen it before several times, when this type of-- of event happens, when it's captured on video.\n\nFour days after the Crutcher shooting...\n\nNatsound: He's not going to do anything to you guys.\n\nPolice in Charlotte shot a black man. That city erupted.\n\nIgniting fears in Tulsa that this same thing could happen. So, the mayor and police chief called Pastor Owens and other religious and community leaders together to show them the video and to help brace the city for the storm they feared was coming.\n\nBill Whitaker: What was the mood in the room? What was the reaction to the video--\n\nDewey Bartlett: When it showed the gentleman shot and falling down there was an audible.\n\nBill Whitaker: A gasp.\n\nDewey Bartlett: Absolutely. It was. It was very difficult to watch.\n\nRay Owens:  The gasp actually filled the room.  We couldn't believe it.\n\nBill Whitaker: Was your reaction the general reaction of the people in the room?\n\nRay Owens: Oh, very much so. We were all really angry.\n\nThe video added to already tense relations between Tulsa police and the black community.\n\nNatsound: Hands up! Don't shoot!\n\nRay Owens: There's a strong current of an us or them mentality.\n\nBill Whitaker: Really?\n\nRay Owens: I do hear that, especially from young men, African-American men, who will still tell me, \"I'm afraid when a police officer-- comes up behind me or drives-- behind me.\"  That's a problem.\n\nA long-standing problem in Tulsa.  In 1921, this city saw the worst racial violence in American history.  It started when an armed white mob gathered to lynch a black man accused of assaulting a white woman.  As many as 300 black Tulsans were killed, and an estimated 10,000 left homeless. Time has not healed all wounds. The mayor told us he thought the best response to the Crutcher shooting was complete transparency.  The police chief rushed to release the video to the public.  He also released Betty Shelby's name.\n\nChief Chuck Jordan: I want to assure our community and I want to assure all of you, and people across the nation who are going to be looking at this, we will achieve justice. Period.\n\nAnd they asked black pastors to appeal for peace.\n\nRodney Goss:  I think I reserve the right to be angry and upset at being a black man in an untimely time as this.\n\nMore than 1,000 people of all races came to a vigil at Metropolitan Baptist Church.\n\nRay Owens: It was our attempt to give people a place to say, \"I'm mad. I'm hurting. I'm tired of this. No more.\"  And that was the same sentiment that I think was in the minds and hearts of the people who were breaking glass windows in Charlotte. They were saying, \"I'm mad.\"\n\nIn Tulsa, there were no broken windows - no violence at all. Six days after the shooting, District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler filed charges against Betty Shelby. He accused her of overreacting when she shot Terence Crutcher. But the charges were filed before the police investigation of the shooting was complete.\n\nNatsound:  I've never been so scared.\n\nThe lead detective told us he would have found Shelby's actions justified. Shelby was placed on unpaid leave.  When her name was made public, she says she felt as if the whole town had turned on her.\n\nNatsound: And we're telling them to fire Betty! Fire Betty! Fire Betty!\n\nOfficer Shelby believes she was sacrificed to keep the peace in Tulsa.\n\nBetty Shelby:  My situation was no different than-- I don't know whether I should say this-- than a lynch mob coming after me. And I had those very threats. So much that--\n\nBill Whitaker: You've been threatened?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: Death threats?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.  I had to leave my home. I had to grab up my family, and leave, and go to a safe place.\n\nBetty Shelby told us she became a police officer to help people and she wants to get back to the job she loves.\n\nNatsound: You gonna go after some bad guys?\n\nWhile she awaits trial, she finds comfort playing with her grandson. She faces four years to life for the killing of Terence Crutcher.  Betty Shelby's husband, Officer David Shelby, recorded the video from the air.\n\nNatsound:  Shots Fired!\n\nHowever you perceive this video, it's an American tragedy.\n\nDavid Shelby: To some extent, I think, well, there were two victims that day. I think Terence Crutcher and Betty Shelby.\n\nBill Whitaker: And Betty's a victim of what?\n\nDavid Shelby: The social and political climate in our country right now, it's almost like there is a war on police. And I think that that's what's happened to Betty.\n\nTiffany Crutcher: We need our men and women in blue. But at the end of the day, they're not warriors. They're supposed to be our guardians.\n\nBill Whitaker: She believes there was a rush to judgment?\n\nTiffany Crutcher: The video showed everything.  It doesn't have a political affiliation, it's not red, it's not blue. It's not black, it's not white. It is what it is. And what we saw was my brother with his hands up. And he was Tased and shot simultaneously.\n\nBill Whitaker:  Officer Shelby was charged with manslaughter. Are you satisfied with those charges?\n\nTiffany Crutcher: I am. I don't believe she woke up that morning and said, \"I'm gonna go and kill Terence Crutcher.\"  I believe that she choked and she pulled the trigger and she killed him.\n\nBill Whitaker: Overreacted?\n\nTiffany Crutcher: Absolutely.\n\nBill Whitaker: Was Terence Crutcher's an avoidable death?\n\nBetty Shelby: Yes.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did this have to play out the way it did?\n\nBetty Shelby: No.\n\nBill Whitaker: What would've changed things?\n\nBetty Shelby: If he would've complied.  If he would have communicated with me, if he would've just done as I asked him to do we would not be here. You and I would never have met and no one would ever know my name.\n\nBill Whitaker is an award-winning journalist and 60 Minutes correspondent who has covered major news stories, domestically and across the globe, for more than four decades with CBS News.\n\n© 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Controversial killings by police\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJuly 11, 2016 / 5:33 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nSo far in 2016, more than 500 people in the U.S. have been shot and killed by police, according to data compiled by the Washington Post. While only a fraction of those deaths are considered questionable, the recent killings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota have once again reignited a national debate about law enforcement tactics and race in America.\n\nHere's a look back at some of the most controversial police-involved deaths in recent years.\n\nOn July 5, 2016, police confronted Alton Sterling outside a convenience store after receiving a call saying he'd threatened someone with a gun. Cellphone videos show Sterling, who possessed a gun but didn't appear to be brandishing it at the time, being pinned down by two officers before being shot and killed. \"You [expletive] move, I swear to God,\" said one officer. Footage of the incident flooded the media and caused outrage nationwide. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the incident.\n\nOn July 6, 2016, Philando Castile was shot in his vehicle after being pulled over at a traffic stop. According to his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who began live-streaming video on Facebook just after he was shot, Castile told the officer he had a concealed weapon, along with a permit for it. As he was reaching for his wallet, he was shot, she said. Video shows the officer continuing to point a gun at Castile even as he slumps over bleeding. The incident sparked a furor and demonstrations nationwide.\n\nIn November 2015, Jamar Clark was shot in a confrontation with the police, who'd been called in after paramedics said he was interfering with treatment of an assault victim. Accounts of the incident differ: some protesters said he was handcuffed at the time of the shooting, though forensic experts said he wasn't handcuffed and had his hand on an officer's gun. His death set off weeks of protests in Minneapolis. The two officers involved in the incident faced no charges.\n\nIn November 2015, 6-year-old Jeremy Mardis was shot five times as two deputy city marshals pursued his father. His father had previously fled an attempt to serve a warrant but is shown holding his hands up in footage of the incident. The child, who was autistic, was shot in the head and chest. Both marshals, Derrick Stafford and Norris Greenhouse Jr., were charged with second-degree murder.\n\nIn July 2015, Samuel DuBose was shot by a University of Cincinnati police officer who stopped his car for missing a front license plate. The officer's body camera captured footage of shooting. Demonstrations took place at the local courthouse soon after, demanding justice for DuBose's family. The officer, Ray Tensing, was fired and charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter ; he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nDuBose's family reached a $5.3 million settlement with the university.\n\nIn April 2015, police arrested Freddie Gray \"without force or incident,\" according to his arrest report. Police said he was carrying an illegal switchblade at the time, though prosecutors have said the knife was legal. He was placed in the back of a police van, but was not properly seat belted, and sustained critical neck and spine injuries during the subsequent ride. According to Baltimore State's Attorney, Gray indicated that he needed medical attention several times but was denied immediate assistance. He died of his injuries five days later.\n\nThe incident sparked a national outcry and debate about police brutality toward black people and minorities. Thousands gathered in cities around the country to protest Gray's death, in some cases shutting down roads and clashing with police. So far, three of the officers have been tried, with two being acquitted and one ending in mistrial. The latter case will be retried and trials of three other officers are still pending.\n\nIn April 2015, Walter Scott was shot eight times in the back by a policeman while fleeing from a traffic stop. He was unarmed at the time. The officer, Michael Slager, has been charged with murder in the shooting.\n\nIn March 2015, 19-year-old Tony Robinson , who was black, was shot and killed in his apartment by white police officer Matt Kenny, who'd responded to calls about a disturbance. Robinson, who was unarmed at the time, was shot after he knocked Kenny down with a blow to the head, police said.\n\nRobinson's death sparked protests over the string of incidences in which unarmed black men were shot by white officers. Kenny did not face criminal charges.\n\nIn March 2015, Anthony Hill, a mentally ill veteran , was shot and killed during what his family described as a psychiatric episode in which he stripped naked. Robert Olsen, the officer responding to the call, said he'd gotten reports of a man behaving erratically and when he got to the scene, Hill lunged at him. Witnesses say Hill was unarmed at the time. His girlfriend said Hill suffered from bi-polar disorder and had been experiencing PTSD after his deployment to Afghanistan. Olsen has since been indicted for felony murder and pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn an October 2014 encounter with the police, 17-year-old Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times. He was carrying a knife and police accounts allege he'd lunged at an officer. However, video footage released more than a year later shows McDonald walking away from police when they began shooting. The shooting continues even after McDonald had fallen to the ground. The event set off protests in Chicago and prompted a deeper investigation of police culture in the city. Jason Van Dyke, the officer who shot McDonald, has been charged with murder.\n\nIn November 2014, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot outside the Cudell Recreation Center while drawing what turned out to be a pellet gun. He died the following day. According to Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty, it was \"indisputable\" that the boy was pulling the toy gun from his waistband, either to hand it to police or show them that it was a toy, but it was impossible for police to know that. Protesters took to the streets of Cleveland and New York following the event. The officer who shot Rice will not face criminal charges.\n\nThis photos shows images from the night of the event.\n\nIn August 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police while walking on a street near his home. He was unarmed at the time. News of his death sparked national outrage and days of protests in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, where police used rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the masses. Protests got so unruly that the Missouri National Guard was deployed. The incident fueled the national Black Lives Matter movement, calling for an end to police brutality against the black community.\n\nFollowing Brown's death, the FBI opened an inquiry into the shooting. Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, was not charged.\n\nThe Department of Justice conducted its own investigation , discovering clear patterns of discrimination within the Ferguson justice system.\n\nIn July 2014, Eric Garner died while being arrested for illegally selling cigarettes. Police said Garner died of a heart attack, but footage of the incident showed police putting Garner in a chokehold while he repeatedly said, \"I can't breathe.\" The officer was not indicted.\n\nThe incident sparked outrage and fueled the Black Lives Matter movement with \"I can't breathe\" becoming one of its slogans.\n\nIn March 2014, a graphic video showing police shooting James Boyd , a homeless black man, in Albuquerque surfaced. Police said Boyd was carrying knives and threatened officers, but footage of the incident shows him turning away before they began shooting. The video prompted hundreds of online responses and a protest in the city.\n\nIn July 2011, Kelly Thomas , a homeless man diagnosed with schizophrenia, was beaten to death by six officers after failing to follow their commands. The incident was recorded by a surveillance camera, sparking controversy about police handling of the mentally ill. The city of Fullerton settled the case in November 2015, with Thomas' father receiving a $4.9 million settlement.\n\nIn January 2009, 22-year-old Oscar Grant was pulled off the BART train by transit police after a reported fight, thrown on the ground and shot. Grant was unarmed. Witnesses recorded the incident on their cellphones and the event caused an outcry in the city. Johannes Mehserle, the officer who shot Grant, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, admitting he intended to fire his Taser, not his gun. He served less than a year in jail. A film based on the shooting, Fruitvale Station , came out in 2013.\n\nIn 2006, Sean Bell was leaving a strip club with his friends after his bachelor party when police officers shot his car 50 times, thinking one of the men had been armed. None of them were. Bell became a symbol of police brutality against the black community. The officers involved were acquitted of all charges, including one of manslaughter.\n\nBell is pictured here with his fiancee, who he was scheduled to marry just hours after the shooting.\n\nIn February 1999, New York police shot Amadou Diallo 41 times on the stoop of his building, having mistakenly thought that he was carrying a gun. He was simply holding his wallet. The four officers involved in the shooting were acquitted of charges including second-degree murder, criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment of bystanders.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Protests After Unarmed Black Man, 19, Killed By Wis. Police\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMarch 7, 2015 / 10:50 AM CST / CBS Minnesota\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - A 19-year-old black man who died after being shot by a police officer was unarmed, the Madison police chief said Saturday, assuring protesters who earlier in the day renewed the refrain of \"Black Lives Matter\" that his department would defend their rights to gather while imploring the community to express their anger with \"responsibility and restraint.\"\n\nTony Robinson was shot Friday night after assaulting Officer Matt Kenny, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. Kenny was injured, Koval said, but didn't provide details. It wasn't clear whether Robinson, who died at a hospital, was alone in the apartment.\n\n\"He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, for the public to accept,\" Koval said during a news conference. Police department spokesman Joel DeSpain said Kenny would not have been wearing a body camera.\n\nSeveral dozen protesters gathered earlier Saturday outside of the Dane County Public Safety Building holding signs that read \"Black Lives Matter\" - a slogan adopted by activists and protesters around the nation after recent officer-involved deaths of unarmed black men - before walking toward the neighborhood where the shooting took place. Protesters also shouted the slogan Friday night.\n\nKoval, who struck a conciliatory tone during Saturday afternoon's news conference, said he understood the anger and distrust taking hold in the community, and said that \"for those who do want to take to the street and protest,\" his department would be there to \"defend, facilitate, foster those first amendment rights of assembly and freedom of speech.\"\n\nHe also asked protesters to follow what he said was the lead of Robinson's family at the scene in asking for peaceful demonstrations that are \"nondestructive to others\" and \"falls within the boundaries of tolerance for one another as we all move through a grieving process and a coping process.\"\n\nA 2014 Wisconsin law requires police departments to have outside agencies probe officer-involved deaths. State Attorney General Brad Schimel said the department will not share details of the investigation until it is finished.\n\n\"We are resolved that the result of that investigation will be one in which the public can have confidence,\" he added.\n\nKenny has more than 12 years of experience, Koval said, and was involved in a 2007 shooting but was cleared of any wrongdoing because it was a \"suicide by cop-type\" situation. He has been placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation by the state's Division of Criminal Investigation and the Dane County District Attorney's review of that investigation.\n\nThe shooting came days after the U.S. Justice Department cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson, Missouri, officer who shot Michael Brown, of federal civil rights charges in the death of the 18-year-old, who was black and unarmed. A second report found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the St. Louis suburb.\n\nMadison, about 80 miles west of Milwaukee, is the state capital and home to the University of Wisconsin's flagship campus. About 7 percent of the city's 243,000 residents are black.\n\nNeighbors said Robinson's apartment is in a two-story gray house on the block of Williamson Street, known to many as Willy Street. Many walked to nearby restaurants and cafés on Saturday.\n\nKoval said police responded to a call about 6:30 p.m. Friday of a person jumping into traffic. A second call to police said the man was \"responsible for a battery,\" Koval said.\n\nKenny went to an apartment and forced his way inside after hearing a disturbance. Koval said the officer was assaulted by Robinson, and then fired at him; Koval couldn't say how many shots were fired because it is part of the investigation.\n\nGrant Zimmerman, a neighbor of Robinson's, said Robinson would run between his apartment and his roommate's mother's house across the street \"all the time, even in the middle of traffic.\"\n\n\"My son has never been a violent person. And to die in such a violent, violent way, it baffles me,\" said Andrea Irwin, who told WKOW-TV on Friday night she is Robinson's mother.\n\nRobinson, a 2014 graduate of Sun Prairie High School, was well-liked, according to Olga Ennis, a neighbor and family friend. \"He was a beautiful kid,\" Ennis said. \"He wouldn't hurt a fly.\"\n\nShe said many in the community don't trust police officers. \"We're afraid of the cops,\" she said. \"Who do you call for help now?\"\n\nMayor Paul Soglin called the shooting \"a tragedy beyond description\" in a statement.\n\n\"I hope as the pain eases that something constructive will come of this,\" he told the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nKoval expressed his sympathy during Saturday's news conference, saying he went to Robinson's mother's house overnight and spoke with Robinson's grandparents. He said he asked if he could speak with Robinson's mother, but that they \"thought that based on the dynamics of what was occurring it would not be an appropriate time.\"\n\nHe then added, \"19 years old is too young.\"\n\nDemonstrators March To House Where Man Was Shot By Officer\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - Dozens of demonstrators gathered in downtown Madison where they blocked traffic and protested the fatal shooting of a 19-year-old man by a police officer.\n\nProtesters gathered outside the Dane County Public Safety Building and marched through the downtown streets Saturday afternoon. Some made a human barricade across one street where cars stopped and drove the opposite way on the one-way road.\n\nDemonstrators chanted \"Who can you trust? Not the police\" and carried signs that said \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nThe young black man who was shot and killed is identified by family members as Tony Robinson. Police say he was shot by an officer who had an altercation with him at an apartment Friday night.\n\nProtesters marched toward that apartment on Saturday.\n\nNAACP Dane County Calls For Calm In Light Of Shooting\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - The Dane County NAACP is calling for calm in the aftermath of that fatal shooting of a 19-year-old black man in Madison by a police officer.\n\nPolice say 19-year-old Tony Robinson was shot in an altercation with Officer Matt Kenny Friday night at an apartment. Robinson was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nThe Dane County NAACP issued a statement Saturday urging law enforcement to be transparent as the shooting is investigated.\n\nThe NAACP called for \"calm and vigilant monitoring of events as they unfold.\"\n\n(© Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Amid protests, black police officers straddle line between race and duty\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nDecember 10, 2014 / 8:04 PM EST / AP\n\nJorge \"Jinho\" Ferreira feels the tension between being black and carrying a badge every day as a sheriff's deputy in Alameda County, California.\n\n\"I feel like you have to prove yourself on every level,\" said Ferreira, 39, who patrols about 30 miles east of San Francisco. \"You have to prove yourself to the black community, you have to prove yourself to all of your co-workers, you have to prove yourself to society.\"\n\nWith the nation roiled by two grand juries' recent decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of unarmed black men, some black officers say that as they enforce the law, they also wonder whether the system they're sworn to uphold is stacked against black men.\n\nIn interviews conducted by Associated Press reporters across the nation, retired and active black officers expressed concern about how black men are treated by the largely white police forces in the United States, an issue that has led to protests alleging police brutality.\n\nThe officers say they want change just as much as anyone else, and advocate for it where they can because they, too, have something to lose.\n\n\"A lot of us have sons, and we want to make sure our colleagues are treating our young boys with dignity and respect,\" said Oakland Police Lt. LeRonne Armstrong, a 16-year veteran.\n\nSince the summertime deaths of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri , and Eric Garner, 43, who gasped \"I can't breathe\" while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in New York, thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest their deaths, the grand juries' decisions - and the nation's police forces.\n\nCaught in the middle are blacks working in law enforcement. There were an estimated 55,267 African-Americans in local police departments and an additional 15,500 in sheriff's departments in 2007, the latest information available from the Justice Department.\n\n\"We're called things like Uncle Toms and traitors to our community, in spite of the fact that we sympathize or we agree with the anger that our community holds, because we feel that same anger,\" said Noel Leader, a retired New York City police sergeant who in 1995 co-founded an advocacy group, 100 Blacks In Law Enforcement Who Care.\n\nBlack officers point out that they contend with many of the same racial issues as black civilians, such as stereotypes, racism on the job and even confrontations with the police. Black plainclothes or undercover police officers have been shot by their white counterparts, as in the 2009 death of NYPD Officer Omar J. Edwards, who was killed while he was chasing a man who had broken into his car.\n\n\"I understand that when I am given directions from the police, I am very cautious and careful to comply with their demands or commands until it could be understood what is really going on,\" said Michael Williams, a 15-year veteran and president of the police union Memphis Police Association. \"We have to take responsibility for our actions, even in the black community, and we can avoid a whole lot of this.\"\n\nKevin A. Minor, a St. Louis County Police recruitment officer and field training officer, remembers being followed around a discount store by a security officer while trying to shop. \"If that's what makes him feel like he's doing his job, oh well,\" Minor said. \"Because I know why I'm there, and I'm going to leave there with what I'm going to buy and that's it.\"\n\nTask forces and commissions around the nation are being formed to study ways to improve relations between police forces and minorities. Three high-ranking House Democrats on Tuesday pressed for congressional hearings on police tactics and race, and President Barack Obama told Black Entertainment Television, in an interview aired Monday, that a variety of factors, from training to subconscious racial fears, have combined to create \"a national problem that's going to require a national solution.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the rage felt by communities that feel persecuted by the police, some of the black officers were not quick to blame race for some of the deadly encounters.\n\n\"I believe that some of these incidents could have been prevented if you comply with the law,\" Williams said. \"If someone says put your hands up, put your hands up.\"\n\nFerreira says he felt inspired to become a law enforcement officer after attending a rally decrying Oscar Grant's shooting death at the hands of a white transit police officer in Oakland 2009. But he also says there often is nothing racial about how officers operate.\n\n\"There are two people involved that decide the outcome: It's the cop and the suspect,\" Ferreira said. \"Both of them contribute to the outcome of the interaction. It's not going to be the color of one's skin.\"\n\nBlack officers say they can help quell some of the hostility between police and the communities they patrol. \"I think law enforcement leaders have to recognize that minority officers can be that bridge to build trust because they understand where the mistrust comes from,\" Armstrong said.\n\n© 2014 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Obama: \"The moment is now\" for law enforcement reforms\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMarch 2, 2015 / 3:56 PM EST / AP\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said Monday the deaths of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York show that law enforcement needs to change practices to build trust in minority communities, as a White House task force called for independent, outside investigations when police use deadly force.\n\nThe president said last year's deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri , and Eric Garner in New York City exposed \"deep rooted frustration in many communities of color around the need for fair and just law enforcement.\" He said a policing task force that he appointed found it's important for law enforcement to improve training, data collection and cooperation with the communities they cover.\n\n\"The moment is now for us to make these changes,\" Obama said from the White House during a meeting with members of the task force, who worked for three months to develop the recommendations. \"We have a great opportunity coming out of some great conflict and tragedy to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel - rather than being embattled - feel fully supported. We need to seize that opportunity.\"\n\nThe task force made 63 recommendations after holding seven public hearings across the country that included testimony from more than 100 people. The panel also met with leaders of groups advocating for the rights of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, veterans, gays, the disabled and others.\n\nObama said the task force found the need for more police training to reduce bias and help officers deal with stressful situations. He recognized a particularly controversial recommendation would be the need for independent investigations in fatal police shootings.\n\n\"The importance of making sure that there's a sense of accountability when in fact law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that I think communities across the board are going to be considering,\" Obama said.\n\nSpecifically, the task force recommended external independent criminal investigations and review by outside prosecutors when police use force that results in death or anyone dies in police custody, instead of the internal investigations that are the policy of some law enforcement agencies. The task force suggested either a multi-agency probe involving state and local investigators, referring an investigation to neighboring jurisdictions or the next higher level of government. \"But in order to restore and maintain trust, this independence is crucial,\" the report said.\n\nBill Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, said an outside investigation of a police-involved shooting may make sense in limited circumstances when a police department has few resources. But in the vast majority of cases, he said, it is unnecessary and perhaps even counterproductive.\n\n\"I think it helps to drive a wedge between a local police department and the community it serves - which is exactly contrary to what the intent of this police task force was supposed to be,\" said Johnson, whose organization is an umbrella group of police unions. \"I think it sends a message that your local police can't be trusted.\"\n\nThe task force echoed calls from officials including Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director James Comey for more complete record-keeping about the numbers of police-involved shootings across the country. Such data is currently reported by local law enforcement on a voluntary basis, and there is no central or reliable repository for those statistics.\n\n\"There's no reason for us not to have this data available,\" said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, a task force co-chair, who said he was surprised to learn that there were no reliable records kept. \"Now that we know that this does not exist, it is our responsibility to do everything we can to develop that information.\"\n\nRamsey also pointed out that the task force recommended decoupling immigration from local law enforcement to help improve police relationship with immigrant communities where residents may fear calling for help if they or someone in their family is in the country illegally. He said information on immigrant felons would remain available under the panel's recommendations.\n\nObama earlier had called for Congress to help fund the purchase of 50,000 body cameras for police to wear and record their interactions with the public . But the task force found that the cameras raise extraordinarily complex legal and privacy issues.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about body cameras as a silver bullet or a solution,\" Obama said. \"I think the task force concluded that there is a role for technology to play in building additional trust and accountability but it's not a panacea. It has to be embedded in a broader change in culture and a legal framework that ensures that people's privacy is respected.\"\n\nLaurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and co-chair of the task force, told reporters the type of community-police relations envisioned by the report does not happen quickly.\n\n\"It takes time, it takes relationship-building and it doesn't happen overnight,\" she said.\n\n© 2015 The Associated Press.

This is America,\" said a protester.\n\nMore than 100 protesters filled midtown Sacramento's streets. The marchers were made up of different ages and ethnicities.\n\n\"Because all our lives matter,\" said a protester.\n\nThey joined folks across the nation in conjunction with the \"Millions March,' protesting police killings. All the while, they marched and chanted for justice.\n\n\"It's obvious that people that are supposed to protect us are using our tax money and using it to kill us,\" said Maile Hampton, a protester.\n\nFor some, this was their first time taking a stance and asking for change.\n\n\"Never been arrested...never been in trouble, but this has got to stop,\" said Reggie, a protester.\n\nReggie says the killings of black youth like Michael Brown and Eric Gardner have become personal.\n\n\"Any of us at any time can fit the description. All I'm saying is we have to be aware, be careful,\" he said.\n\nMany gathered and listened, holding their message up high. Some even wrote on the ground with chalk.\n\n\"If you have a fear of the cops, don't be afraid to speak out,\" said Braevayuan Mays, a protester.\n\nAnd for Reggie, passing along that message to his children and grand kids has become his mission, and reminds them to do things peacefully.\n\n\"Don't burn, don't loot, don't destroy businesses. But just show up,\" said Reggie.\n\nThings ended peacefully and no arrests were made. Protesters say they would be back soon.\n\nIn San Francisco, the Embarcadero was shut down temporarily as protesters marched to City Hall. By early afternoon protesters gathered at Civic Center Plaza.\n\nThe protests caused major gridlock across The City. There were major backups around 7th Street and in the Mission. Motorists were advised to steer clear of the demonstrations.\n\nIn the East Bay, police helicopters hovered in the sky as demonstrators made their way from Berkeley to a \"Millions March\" to Oakland. By afternoon, several hundred protesters had gathered on the steps of the Alameda County Courthouse. The group said they are calling attention to violence against communities of color.\n\nIn New York City, tens of thousands of people marched up Fifth Avenue in Midtown after gathering at Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, CBS New York reported. They are demanding justice for 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Staten Island father Eric Garner, who died in July after an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold, and Akai Gurley, the unarmed man fatally shot by police in a stairwell in East New York last month. They also want special prosecutors appointed to hand cases of alleged police brutality.\n\nFamily members of people killed in New York City police encounters going back decades also were among the demonstrators. They included Iris Baez, whose son Anthony Baez died after he apparently was placed in a chokehold in 1994.\n\nDonna Carter, 54, marched with her boyfriend, whose teenage son was shot and killed by police in the 1990s while carrying a toy gun.\n\n\"It's good to see people of all colors here to say enough is enough,\" said Carter, who is black. \"I'm a parent and every child that's killed feels like my child.\"\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a crowd gathered in Freedom Plaza before marching down Pennsylvania Avenue and past the White House, carrying signs reading \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Who do you protect?

The 25-year-old Bloomington man was convicted in February on assault and riot charges for shooting the five men at a Black Lives Matter protest encampment outside a north Minneapolis police station following the fatal police shooting of a black man, Jamar Clark, in 2015.\n\n\"I recognize the severity of the events of November 23rd, 2015,\" Scarsella said as he stood before Hennepin County District Judge Hilary Caligiuri. He said the shootings were not what he wanted to happen that night when he and three friends went to the protest, where demonstrators chased them away because they were wearing masks. \"I'll live with the consequences the rest of my life.\"\n\nProsecutor Chris Freeman dismissed self-defense claims that Scarsella made during his trial. He called the crime, \"five unarmed black men gunned down in what can only be described as a mass shooting\" by a man whose numerous racist texts to friends made his motivations clear to the jury.\n\nDefense attorney Laura Heinrich argued for the minimum sentence under the guidelines of just more than six years in prison, telling the judge that if Scarsella could change what happened, he would. She said he feels \"deeply sorry\" about the harm to the victims and has come to understand how hurtful the language he once used might be to others. She declined to comment after the hearing but said they plan to appeal.\n\nJudge Caligiuri said she didn't claim to understand why Scarsella did what he did or where he got his \"repugnant, racist ideas.\" She said the only saving grace in the events of that night was that none of the victims died.\n\nThe hearing and the aftermath highlighted how emotions remain raw over Clark's death. The only victim who testified at the sentencing was Clark's cousin, Cameron Clark, who was shot in the foot and leg. He suggested that Scarsella got a break that a black man would not have gotten.\n\n\"If that had been me I would have been looking at 25 to 30 (years) for shooting five white people,\" Cameron Clark said.\n\nClark and his grandfather James Clark - Jamar Clark's father - kept up their criticism afterward of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. Freeman last year decided not to charge the white officers involved in the killing of Jamar Clark.\n\nCameron Clark said Scarsella should have been charged with attempted murder. Instead, the most serious charge he faced was first-degree assault resulting in great bodily harm, which Freeman had said earlier was the most serious charge the evidence allowed.\n\nFollow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook\n\n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

They also want special prosecutors appointed to hand cases of alleged police brutality.\n\nThe noisy march through the heart of Manhattan swelled to at least 25,000 people, police said. As evening fell, thousands of people rallied outside NYPD headquarters as officers stood guard at the entrance to One Police Plaza.\n\n\"There is a systematic murder of people of color in this country and it's institutionalized racism. The people are here to convince the people in power to legislate against this,\" a man at the rally, who didn't want to give his name, told CBS radio station WINS-AM in New York.\n\nAlthough the protests remained mainly peaceful, a press conference late Saturday night, Chief of Department James P. O'Neill said two officers were assaulted on the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nCBS New York reported two police saw a man attempting to throw a garbage can onto the roadway and attempted to make an arrest. The officers were then reportedly assaulted, kicked in the face and head by numerous other protesters, according to authorities.\n\nDuring that incident, O'Neill said police found a bag containing what appeared to be newly-purchased hammers and a black mask.\n\n\"This is where we have to step in and make arrests. We cannot have our officers assaulted,\" O'Neill said. One person was arrested for disorderly conduct. The officers' injuries were not life-threatening, authorities said.\n\nO'Neill also said there were numerous reports of fireworks being set off on Madison Avenue and the Brooklyn Bridge. Authorities also say a rear window was smashed in an incident on Madison Avenue.\n\n\"I don't know what's the next step. That's why I'm taking this one,\" a protester named Shannon told CBS New York earlier Saturday. \"I know that my voice being heard is one step that I can take.\"\n\n\"America is supposed to value all of its citizens. We're supposed to have justice for all,\" Jamelia, a Westchester resident, said. \"But clearly that's not what's going on. So we have to fight for what's right.\"\n\nRich Alexandro, 47, carried a handmade sign with dozens of names of people who died in encounters with police who were never charged.\n\n\"It just seems like the cops are Teflon,\" Alexandro said. \"There's no justice.\"\n\nFamily members of people killed in New York City police encounters going back decades also were among the demonstrators. They included Iris Baez, whose son Anthony Baez died after he apparently was placed in a chokehold in 1994.\n\nDonna Carter, 54, marched with her boyfriend, whose teenage son was shot and killed by police in the 1990s while carrying a toy gun.\n\n\"It's good to see people of all colors here to say enough is enough,\" said Carter, who is black. \"I'm a parent and every child that's killed feels like my child.\"\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a crowd gathered in Freedom Plaza before marching down Pennsylvania Avenue and past the White House, carrying signs reading \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Who do you protect? Who do you serve?\"\n\n\"Let's keep it strong, long and meaningful,\" Esaw Garner, Eric Garner's widow, told the crowd.\n\n\"I appreciate everyone that's out there marching for my husband because had it not been for the tape, for the people, for Reverend Al (Sharpton) putting it out there he would've just been another black man killed, and it would've been over,\" she said during an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" last week. \"This way, his name will be remembered.\"\n\nGarner's mother, Gwen Carr, called Saturday's demonstration a \"history-making moment.\"\n\n\"It's just so overwhelming to see all who have come to stand with us today,\" she said. \"I mean, look at the masses. Black, white, all races, all religion.... We need to stand like this at all times.\"\n\nOrganizers had predicted 5,000 people at the Washington march , but the crowd appeared to far outnumber that. They later said they believed as many as 25,000 had shown up. It was not possible to verify the numbers; Washington police do not release crowd estimates.\n\n\"What a sea of people,\" said Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, told the protesters. \"If they don't see this and make a change, then I don't know what we got to do. Thank you for having my back.\"\n\nAlso speaking were Sharpton, the civil rights leader, family members of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old shot and killed by a Cleveland, Ohio, police officer in November as he played with a pellet gun in a park.\n\n\"Members of Congress, beware we're serious...,\" Sharpton said. \"When you get a ring-ding on Christmas, it might not be Santa. It may be Rev. Al coming to your house.\"\n\nSeveral speakers asked the crowd to chant, \"I can't breathe.\" Garner, 43, had gasped those words before his death while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Some protesters also wore those words on shirts.\n\nOther speakers called for a chant of \"Hands up, don't shoot.\"\n\nThe rally was interrupted briefly by more than a dozen protesters who took the stage with a bullhorn. They announced that they were from St. Louis and Ferguson and demanded to speak.\n\nLarge numbers of protesters on the ground supported the group, some chanting, \"Let them speak.\"\n\nUltimately, rally organizers allowed Johnetta Elzie of St. Louis to address the crowd. \"This movement was started by the young people,\" she said. The group, mostly in their 20s, left the stage after she spoke.\n\nOrganizers called the interruption unnecessarily divisive. But some in the Missouri group said they were disappointed and found the rally staid and ineffective.\n\n\"I thought there was going to be actions, not a show. This is a show,\" Elzie said.\n\nProtests -- some violent -- have occurred around the nation since grand juries last month declined to indict the officers involved in the deaths of Brown and Garner.\n\nBefore the crowd started marching, Sharpton directed, \"Don't let no provocateurs get you out of line. ... We are not here to play big shot. We are here to win.\"\n\nThen, blocks of tightly packed people moved through the city. D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier mingled with the crowd and said she wanted to show solidarity with the marchers.\n\n\"This is one of the most well-organized events I've seen,\" Lanier said.\n\nPoliticians and others have talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system.\n\nTerry Baisden, 52, of Baltimore said she is \"hopeful change is coming\" and that the movement is not part of a fleeting flash of anger.\n\nShe said she hasn't protested before but felt compelled to because \"changes in action, changes in belief, happen in numbers.\"\n\nMurry Edwards said he made the trip to Washington from St. Louis because he wants to make sure the momentum from the movement in Ferguson reaches a national stage.\n\n\"This is the national march,\" Edwards said. \"We have to get behind the national movement.\"\n\nSheryce Holloway, a recent graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, attended a smaller gathering outside Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington ahead of the main rally. She said she also has been participating in protests at her alma mater.\n\nHolloway said the goal of the protests is \"ending blue-on-black crime. Black lives do matter.\"\n\nSaturday's march in Washington was organized in part by the National Action Network, the Urban League and the NAACP.\n\nGroups including Ferguson Action were conducting similar \"Day of Resistance\" movements all around the country.\n\nIn Boston, hundreds of demonstrators marched from the Massachusetts Statehouse chanting \"Black Lives Matter,\" according to CBS Boston .\n\nOrganizer Brandy Artez told CBS Boston that protesters want to see body cameras worn on all police officers, a topic that has brought mixed reaction around the state and country.\n\nNear the Nashua Street Jail, demonstrators staged a 20-minute \"die-in\" as prisoners watched from the windows. They also marched to TD Garden, where the Boston Bruins were playing.\n\nPolice said 23 protesters were arrested after scuffling with officers blocking an on-ramp to Interstate 93. The 15 men and eight women faced disorderly conduct charges. Officers were dismissed around 5 p.m. as the crowds broke up.\n\nRallies caused gridlock across San Francisco, CBS station KPIX reported . The Embarcadero was shut down temporarily as protesters marched to City Hall.\n\nIn the East Bay, demonstrators made their way from Berkeley to Oakland, where several hundred protesters gathered on the steps of the Alameda County Courthouse.\n\nSaturday morning, three cardboard cutouts of black men were found hanging by nooses on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, according to KPIX .\n\n\"These images are very upsetting,\" said campus spokeswoman Claire Holmes, who said the school and police were trying to determine who was responsible.\n\nThe life-sized photographs included names of actual past lynching victims and the dates of their death. At least one effigy had \"I Can't Breathe\" printed on the front.  Two were removed by police and a student took down the third.\n\n\"Clearly those are words that are being used as part of the protest today against police violence,\" Holmes told KPIX. \"But this could also potentially have been racially motivated.\"\n\nOrganizers of the Berkeley protest said they were also unaware of who put up the effigies.\n\n\"We hope that it's someone who wanted to bring attention to the issue,\" said Spencer Pritchard, 21, a UC Berkeley student and an organizer of the Berkeley protest, which was peaceful and attended by about 200 people.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, the Bay Area demonstrations remained peaceful with no reports of violence or arrests. Earlier in the week, several protests in Berkeley and Oakland turned violent after dark.\n\nOn Wednesday, a plainclothes California Highway Patrol officer pulled his gun on demonstrators in Oakland after another officer was injured.\n\n© 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Report: Unarmed black man shot by white cop in stolen car case\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nDecember 9, 2014 / 3:46 PM EST / CBS News\n\nORLANDO, Fla. - An unarmed black man in a stolen car was shot and critically wounded by a white Orange County, Fla. sheriff's deputy early Monday, according to CBS affiliate WKMG .\n\nOfficials said sheriff's Sgt. Robert McCarthy shot Cedric Bartee after deputies found the car that had been reported stolen and confronted two men inside, later identified as Bartee and Henry Lee Chaney, both 28, according to the station.\n\nThe announcement came at a time when the country is roiled by protests surrounding the killing of unarmed black men and youths by police . In recent weeks, grand juries failed to indict police officers in the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, N.Y.\n\nHolding a news conference on Monday, Sheriff Jerry Demings said that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement would be investigating the shooting of Bartee, in light of other police shootings that have happened recently, according to WKMG.\n\n\"I want to ensure that we have transparency as well as accountability for the actions of all of my staff that's involved,\" said Demings.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told reporters that Chaney had complied with the deputies' commands, but that Bartee had \"extensive furtive movements,\" causing McCarthy to fear for his safety and open fire.\n\nOne witness questioned why shots had been fired, saying both of the alleged suspects had been complying with the commands.\n\n\"You could see right in the car. Both of them had their hands up and they still shot at the car,\" Ernest Miles Jr., told WKMG, adding that he had to take cover in his second-floor apartment.\n\nSheriff Demings told reporters that witness statements appear to conflict as to whether Bartee had his hands up.\n\nAfter the shooting, Bartee was taken to a local hospital to undergo surgery. He was reportedly in stable, but critical, condition, officials said. Chaney was not hurt, and was not arrested, the Orlando Sentinel reported .\n\nThe newspaper also reported Bartee was behind the wheel when deputies say they blocked the stolen car, and that, according to police, Bartee kept moving his hands in and out of view.\n\nThe deputies involved in the shooting were not injured. McCarthy, who has been with the Orange County Sheriff's Office since May 2007, was placed on administrative duty -- standard procedure after shootings, WKMG reported.\n\nThe station also said that the lead investigator is former Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who was fired from that post after the investigation into Trayvon Martin's death . The Florida Department of Law Enforcement says it is a routine assignment in Lee's new role.\n\nInvestigators are asking for any witnesses in the case to call 407-245-0801.\n\n© 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "This haunting song features the last words of unarmed black men\n\nOver the contemplative chords of a piano, a violin sighs. Quietly, as if in disbelief, swells of voices emerge:\n\n\"Officers, why do you have your guns out?\"\n\nLater, they scream as one:\n\n\"I don't have a gun. Stop!\"\n\nAnd finally, a strangled, fading plea:\n\n\"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThese are the last words uttered by unarmed black men before they were shot and killed by police, before their names became a rallying cry, a line in a history book, a prayer: Kenneth Chamberlain. Michael Brown. Eric Garner.\n\nFive years ago, a young black composer named Joel Thompson sat alone and pondered these last words. The fruits of his grief became the \" Seven Last Words of the Unarmed ,\" a haunting choral work that sets to music the final words of seven black men and boys: Kenneth Chamberlain, Trayvon Martin, Amadou Diallo, Michael Brown, Oscar Grant, John Crawford and Eric Garner. Almost all of them were killed in confrontations with police.\n\n\"After Michael Brown and Eric Garner were killed in 2014, I wrote it as a way to process my feelings,\" Thompson said. \"No piece I've ever written since will be as vulnerable, because I didn't expect anyone to see it.\"\n\nThe piece caused a stir when it premiered in 2015, back when the Black Lives Matter movement was a new and controversial idea. Now, the phrase is painted on major streets across America and printed on countless protest signs as the country contends with yet another litany of black lives lost to police violence. A lot has changed. And yet, the fact the work still resonates shows how much has stayed the same.\n\nWhen the 20-minute work premiered in 2015, it was occasionally met with anger. At one performance, people ripped up their programs and stormed out of the theater. Classical music patrons and faculty at the University of Michigan, where the piece was first performed, were abuzz with indignation.\n\nWhy, they mused, would you combine something as seemingly at odds as traditional choral music and the Black Lives Matter movement?\n\nHere's the secret: Thompson didn't write it for attention, or even to make a political statement. He didn't think it would be performed at all.\n\nIt began, simply, as a private expression of his grief.\n\nHe thought of the Seven Last Words of Christ, a liturgical structure that represents the final phrases  Jesus uttered before dying on the cross. They're intensely human: \"My God, why have you forsaken me?\" \"I'm thirsty.\" \"It is finished.\"\n\nIn this parallel, Thompson saw the humanity of these seven people. He saw the confusion of 68-year-old Kenneth Chamberlain saying \"Officers, why do you have your guns out?\" as police burst through his front door in 2011.  He saw the hopefulness of Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo, who left a voice mail saying \"Mom' I'm going to college,\" minutes before he was shot by plainclothes police officers in 1999.\n\nAs he put their words to music, he interjected an old, medieval melody, L'homme armé, \"The Armed Man.\"\n\nL'homme armé doibt on doubter.\n\nThe armed man should be feared.\n\nThompson finished the piece in the first weeks of 2015 and put it away, \"like I did the rest of my pieces,\" he said.\n\nThat could have been the end of it. But a few months later, Freddie Gray died in the back of a police car in Baltimore , and the words came rushing back.\n\n\"It was the same feelings all over again,\" Thompson said. \"And I figured, maybe if I perform it, maybe I would feel like I am doing something about this crisis.\"\n\nUsually, when a composer has a piece they would like to put out to the masses, they need connections to make it happen. They need a patron, musicians, a venue, and the time and money to pull it off.\n\nFor Thompson, this opportunity came in the form of Dr. Eugene Rogers, the Grammy Award-winning director of choral activities at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance\n\nAn acquaintance sent him the piece, and at first, Rogers tried to ignore it. The subject matter was too raw, and since some people could see it as divisive, he knew it would be a hard sell.\n\nOne listen changed his mind.\n\n\"It moved me so personally, as an African-American man,\" said Rogers, who was the director of the legendary U-M Men's Glee Club at the time. \"I knew I had to present this piece.\"\n\nAlthough some were hard to convince at first, he got others at the university to support the project by appealing to the same thing Thompson tried to convey in his music: The universal humanity of the men it honors.\n\nEventually, the school produced a documentary about the piece that told the stories of the men in greater detail and featured several of their families.\n\nThe U-M Men's Glee Blub performed it. An orchestral accompaniment was commissioned. Rogers took the piece on tour, and versions were performed by the Tallahassee Symphony and the  Morehouse Men's Glee Club.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rogers and Thompson have been overwhelmed by renewed interest.\n\nLegendary institutions like Carnegie Hall have featured videos of the work, and some have reached out to organize their own performances.\n\n\"It really has become classical music's response to this,\" Rogers says.\n\nHe thinks people are moved by it for the same reason people were moved by the death of George Floyd: The sheer humanity of it. You can't look away. You can't stop hearing those last words in your head. That dying man could have been your father, your friend, your teacher. It could have been you.\n\n\"This is the reason that this piece is resonating now. It's because people are seeing beyond the headlines and the narratives. It's a universal cry from all ages, all races. They are seeing these men as human beings who deserve to be treated as more.\"\n\nThompson is more reserved about the attention. He worries that, in some cases, it may be more performative than substantial.\n\n\"I find more hope in hearing what individual people have to say about it, and what emotions they had, rather than the powers-that-be promoting it,\" he says.\n\nAfter all, classical music has its own shortcomings to answer for.\n\nBeing a young black man in the world of classical music is to be outnumbered on several fronts.\n\nIn his career, Thompson has experienced a lot of the institutional prejudice that has kept the genre so exclusive for so long. He favors choral performance and composition, but almost gave up on composing altogether after he was laughed at on stage during a music festival by a white conductor.\n\nAfter the release of \"Seven Last Words of the Unarmed,\" Thompson, who is a very private person, was shielded from the worst of the criticism.\n\n\"But from what I gather,\" he said, \"There was this idea of classical music not being an appropriate space to convey such a political message.\"\n\nThat statement should infuriate any classical music lover.\n\nThough traditionally old, white and Eurocentric, classical music as a broad genre has been a tool of resistance and political criticism for as long as hands have plucked strings and mouths have sung.\n\nFrom a defiant Holocaust-era production of Verdi's Requiem in the ghetto of Terezín , to Russian composers persecuted and forced into exile for their commentary on Stalin's reign, all the way back to subversive lutenists in the courts of Europe, there has never been a time when some composer, somewhere, wasn't challenging power or upending the status quo.\n\n\"There's so much potential for classical music to be as universal as many of its strongest proponents claim,\" Thompson says. \"I have to hold on to that belief.\"\n\nSurveying the state of the genre now, he's encouraged by what he sees: People of all races and cultures adding their voices to the age-old classical conversation.\n\n\"There's a lot of energy among these young people, and a lot of inspiration about using this genre of music that we love so much to speak to present day issues,\" he says. \"They are using this music as a way to address their present circumstance.\"\n\nThough Thompson and Rogers are heartened by the amount of attention the piece is getting now, there is also something deeply disheartening about the fact it still feels so relevant.\n\n\"After we initially performed it, it was [Thompson's] dream that he never had to perform this piece again,\" Rodgers says.\n\nInstead, Thompson muses he could have easily written several more collections of \"Last Words\" since 2015, for all of the black lives that continue to be snuffed out by prejudice and police violence.\n\nIt's not lost on him, either, that six years after Eric Garner's dying phrase became a cry for justice, George Floyd uttered the same exact words as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck: \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThompson won't revisit the project that has become such a unique touchstone in these difficult times. He could never recreate the private and complex emotions that led to its conception. In fact, it's painful when people ask.\n\nInstead, he's focusing on other works that he hopes illuminate black humanity in a different way. Perhaps, he says, he can introduce some joy to mitigate all the darkness.\n\n\"I want to create music that allows everyone to access their humanity,\" he says. \"When music allows you to see yourself, when music allows you to listen to yourself, I think there's a common thread.\"\n\nIt's that common thread he holds on to, in hopes that when united by music, people can come together and sing a different tune.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man in Tulsa now teaches a course on how other cops can 'survive' controversial shootings\n\nBetty Shelby left the police department in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after she was acquitted of manslaughter in the 2016 fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man.\n\nShe returned Tuesday, and a lot of people weren't happy about it.\n\nShelby, now working for a sheriff's office in a nearby county, came back to Tulsa to teach a course on helping police officers \"survive\" the aftermath of controversial shootings such as the one in which she was involved.\n\n\"Participants will be exposed to many of the legal, financial, physical, and emotional challenges which may result from a critical incident in an effort to prepare (law enforcement officers) for the aftermath,\" reads the course description on the website for the state Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training.\n\nShelby has said she'll teach fellow officers how to deal with what she calls the \"Ferguson effect,\" a reference to the 2014 shooting and subsequent unrest surrounding the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nShe told CNN affiliate KTUL the Ferguson effect is \"When a police officer is victimized by anti-police groups and tried in the court of public opinion.\"\n\nShelby's teaching of the course - \"Surviving the Aftermath of a Critical Incident\" - sparked a protest Monday from those who say it's insensitive and an insult for her to teach it, especially in Tulsa, where she, as a police officer, shot and killed Terence Crutcher during a September 2016 traffic stop.\n\n\"We believe the choice to have Betty Shelby lead a class on 'how to survive the aftermath of a critical incident' lacks empathy, is disrespectful to the Crutcher Family, and is intentionally divisive,\" says a Facebook post from Aware Tulsa, a community group that coordinated the protest Monday in front of the courthouse in downtown Tulsa. \"We are saddened that the Crutcher Family has not been given time to heal, and we want to continue to show our gratitude and respect for this wonderful family.\"\n\nBut other officers can learn from what Shelby, now a patrol officer with the Rogers County Sheriff's Office, went through, Rogers County Sheriff Scott Walton told CNN affiliate KJRH .\n\n\"It's not about tactics. It's not about when to shoot, when not to shoot. It's about what she endured, what her family went through for the next eight months after her critical incident,\" he told the TV station.\n\nThat line of thinking doesn't work for the dozens of demonstrators who showed up to protest.\n\n\"It's just sad for them to use a person as polarizing as Betty Shelby to, in fact, teach a critical incident class,\" local pastor Rodney Goss told KJRH. \"We know that the reality is she was the aggressor and that Terence Crutcher was the victim.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the Rogers County Sheriff's Office for comment from Shelby and is waiting to hear back.\n\nChuck Gerhart, the law enforcement council's interim director, told CNN in an email that the course is not sponsored by his agency but is \"provided by an outside source.\"\n\nCrutcher's death was one of a number of police shootings of unarmed black men across the United States in recent years that spurred debate about use of force.\n\nThe shooting happened after Crutcher's SUV was found stalled in the middle of a street. A witness called 911 and said a man was running away from the vehicle, warning it was going to blow up.\n\nShelby arrived and approached the vehicle and cleared it, not seeing anyone inside. As she turned back to her patrol car, she saw Crutcher walking toward her.

      "text": "Bodycam video released after jury acquits ex-cop of murder\n\nFormer Mesa, Arizona officer Philip \"Mitch\" Brailsford was found not guilty of second-degree murder and reckless manslaughter\n\n'That's an execution pure and simple,' an attorney for the victim's widow says of the January 2016 shooting\n\nNew body camera footage captures the tense moments before an Arizona police officer shot an unarmed man dead last year, as the man begged officers not to fire.\n\nPolice in Mesa, Arizona released the footage last week, after a jury acquitted former Mesa officer Philip \"Mitch\" Brailsford of second-degree murder and reckless manslaughter charges related to the January 2016 shooting of Daniel Shaver, of Texas.\n\nBrailsford shot Shaver after police responded to a call saying a man was pointing a rifle out of the window of a La Quinta Inn. The former officer testified he believed Shaver was reaching for a gun in his waistband as he moved toward officers, CNN affiliate KTRK/KPHO reported. No weapon was found.\n\nAn attorney for Shaver's widow said the footage shows the shooting was unjustified, while Brailsford's lawyer said his client's actions were consistent with his police training.\n\n\"That's an execution, pure and simple. The Justice system miserably failed Daniel and his family,\" Mark Geragos, the attorney for Shaver's widow, Laney Sweet, said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview last week with CNN, Brailsford's attorney, Mike Piccarreta, said jurors heard six weeks of testimony and watched the body camera footage several times before acquitting the former officer.\n\n\"While it's a compete tragedy, he's comforted by the fact that his response was in view with the way he was trained,\" Piccarreta said.\n\nThe graphic footage prompted anger on social media.\n\nBlack Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson tweeted: \"I keep thinking about how effortlessly that police officer killed #DanielShaver in that hotel hallway. And how the officer was acquitted. The only person to fear in that entire situation was the officer himself.\"\n\nWe talk about the disproportionate violence of the police towards people of color because it's true. It's also true that the police kill white citizens too. Police violence is everyone's problem. #DanielShaver should be alive.\n\n\"God bless #DanielShaver,\" director and producer Ava DuVernay tweeted.\n\nWhen police arrived at La Quinta, they ordered Shaver and a woman to come out of a room on the fifth floor, KTRK/KPHO reported.\n\nThe body camera footage shows Shaver on his knees in the hotel hallway, a few feet away from the barrel of a police officer's gun.\n\n\"Hands up in the air,\" an officer says.\n\nShaver puts his hands on the floor, then behind his back, then moves them forward again before an officer yells \"Hands up in the air!\" Shaver moves his hands up above his head.\n\n\"You do that again, we're shooting you, do you understand?\" the officer said.\n\n\"Please, do not shoot me,\" Shaver said.\n\n\"Then listen to my instructions,\" the officer said.\n\n\"I'm trying to just do what you say,\" Shaver said.\n\n\"Do not put your hands down for any reason!\" the officer later says to Shaver. \"You think you're going to fall, you better fall on your face. Your hands go back in the small of your back or down, we are going to shoot you! Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Shaver says, sobbing.\n\nAn officer then orders Shaver to crawl toward him. As Shaver crawls, he appears to reach behind him with his right hand.\n\nThat's when Brailsford fired five rounds, killing him.\n\nAfter the shooting, several witnesses and hotel employees told police Shaver was drunk. An autopsy revealed Shaver's blood alcohol level was .29, more than three times the local definition of intoxication, KTRK/KPHO reported.\n\nWitnesses later told police Shaver was showing them an air rifle he had used in his job as a pest exterminator.\n\nBrailsford was fired because of the pending second-degree murder charge and for having the words You're F***** engraved on a part of his personal, department-approved AR-15, Mesa police spokeswoman Sgt. Diana Williams told CNN.\n\nBen Meiselas, an attorney with Geragos' firm, confirmed that the AR-15 that Brailsford used in the shooting had an expletive etched into it. But the judge did not allow the AR-15 into evidence because he ruled it \"too prejudicial\" and \"not sufficiently relevant,\" he told CNN.\n\nBrailsford had worked for the department for two years, KTRK/KPHO reported.\n\nDuring the trial, Brailsford told jurors he was trained to deal with a threat.\n\n\"I was doing what I needed to do to protect my fellow men and the woman we had just taken into custody,\" Brailsford testified, according to CNN affiliate KTRK/KPHO .\n\nBrailsford testified Shaver disobeyed orders not to put his hands behind him on several occasions, the station reported.\n\n\"For some reason, he placed his hands behind his back,\" Brailsford said. \"For one, I don't know why he did that.\"\n\nThe grand jury handed down the verdict on the same day a federal judge sentenced Michael Slager , a white former North Charleston, South Carolina, police officer, to 20 years in prison for fatally shooting Walter Scott , a 50-year-old unarmed black man, in the back as Scott ran away.\n\nScott's death, one of several recent killings of unarmed black men by police , was captured in a bystander's cell phone video.\n\nCNN's Polo Sandoval, Samira Said and Laura Diaz-Zuniga contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Tulsa officer on trial tells of killing unarmed black man\n\nBetty Shelby is on trial for manslaughter after killing Terence Crutcher in 2016\n\nPolice: Crutcher defied orders, and officers thought he might be reaching for weapon\n\nA white Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer who last year shot and killed an unarmed black motorist testified Monday that she opened fire because she feared for her life when the motorist reached into his vehicle to get what could have been a gun.\n\nOfficer Betty Shelby took the witness stand in her own defense, as her felony manslaughter trial entered its second week. The decision to shoot Terence Crutcher, 40, who was acting bizarrely and failed to obey commands, stemmed from her police training, she said.\n\nHer law enforcement training had taught \"if a suspect reaches their hands inside of a car, don't let them pull them out.\"\n\n\"We're not trained to see what comes out of a car,\" Shelby told a jury in a Tulsa courtroom. \"We're trained to stop a threat and by all indications, he was a threat.\"\n\nShelby gave her account of the fatal encounter, mirroring much of what she said in an April \"60 Minutes\" interview on CBS and previous statements by her attorney.\n\nIf convicted, Shelby could face between four years and life in prison in the death of Crutcher, a father of four girls who was unarmed.\n\nThe deadly encounter started when Crutcher's SUV broke down on September 16, 2016. Two other drivers called 911, reporting a man running away from the SUV and saying it was going to blow up.\n\nPolice helicopter footage later showed Crutcher with his hands in the air as he walked toward his broken-down SUV. As Crutcher nears the driver's side door, part of the camera's view is obscured.\n\nBy the end of the video, Crutcher is on the ground with a large bloodstain on the front of his T-shirt.\n\nThe shooting has sparked investigations by the Justice Department and state authorities.\n\nDuring her testimony, Shelby said she was driving to assist an officer with a domestic dispute when she saw Crutcher standing in the middle of the highway with his head down on his chest. He appeared dazed and confused but moved to the side of the road, she said.\n\nShe continued to the call but saw an SUV with the engine running parked in the middle of the roadway, she testified.\n\nAfter calling dispatch to send another officer to that initial domestic call, she approached the vehicle, and glanced in the window but saw no one, she said.\n\nAs she turned around to walk to her patrol car, she noticed Crutcher walking towards her, she testified.\n\nCrutcher alternated between putting his hands in his pocket and putting them in the air, she said.\n\nShe told him: \"Show me your hands,\" she testified, adding that he didn't comply.\n\nCrutcher was sweating heavily, and smelled of PCP chemicals as they stood looking at each other from a few feet away, she said.\n\nCrutcher's twin sister, Tiffany shook her head in the courtroom after hearing Shelby's description of her brother.\n\nAn autopsy found Phencyclidine, or PCP, in Crutcher's system at the time of his fatal shooting, according to the toxicology report released with his autopsy by the Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner's Office. The report did not indicate when the drug had entered his system.\n\nShelby testified that she called for backup and ordered Crutcher to get on his knees.\n\nCrutcher ignored her order  - and also ignored orders from her and another officer, Tyler Turnbough, who arrived on the scene, Shelby said.\n\nShe said Crutcher put his hands on the SUV and then moved to reach into the vehicle. Shelby fired one shot from her weapon while Turnbough fired his Taser, she testified.\n\nAn attorney for Crutcher's family has said that Crutcher's window was rolled up, making it unlikely he was reaching into the car.\n\nRelated article Officer: Crutcher's death had nothing to do with race\n\nDuring cross examination, Assistant Tulsa County District Attorney Kevin Gray asked Shelby why she didn't use her Taser.\n\nShelby said she believed her gun was an appropriate level of force. She said she \"thought he [Crutcher] had a gun\" because he repeatedly put his hands in and out of his pockets and reached inside of his car window. Shelby said she \"didn't have time to pull out her Taser.\"\n\n\"But you had time to pull out a gun,\" Gray said.\n\nAt one point, Gray asked: \"Is Terence Crutcher's death his fault?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Shelby replied.\n\nGray asked Shelby why she didn't initially mention in her interrogation interview that Crutcher smelled like chemicals associated with PCP. She acknowledge it was an important detail, but she said she had forgotten.\n\nCrutcher's death rekindled chants of \"Black Lives Matter\" after he became the latest in a series of unarmed black men killed by police across the US in recent years.\n\n'Black Lives Matter' cases: When controversial killings lead to change\n\nA racial division was evident in the Tulsa courtroom. African-American and Latino supporters, some wearing green ribbons with a purple trim, sat on the left side with Crutcher's family. White supporters sat on the right side with Shelby's family.\n\nJurors will hear from additional witnesses on Tuesday. The 12-member jury consists of three African-American jurors after an African-American alternate juror replaced an Asian juror who fell ill on Monday.\n\nJustin Gamble reported from Tulsa, and Holly Yan and Darran Simon reported and wrote from Atlanta.

      "text": "I'm black and I'm afraid of black men\n\nEditor's Note: Issac Bailey has been a journalist in South Carolina for two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey . The views expressed are his own.\n\nIssac Bailey: I have feared black men, despite being black and growing up with black family members\n\nHe says because he's aware of his one implicit bias, he knows that even \"good\" cops can kill unarmed black men\n\nBailey: One can't think or pray away bias. It needs deliberative, purposeful action that becomes second nature\n\nI've been afraid of black men.\n\nI've braced myself in the presence of unknown black men, felt myself ready for a potential attack even as all they threw my way was a head bob and a \"What's up, brother?\"\n\nThat's why I attended the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., in 1995. I needed to immerse myself in a sea of black men gathered for a cause of uplift so that I could alleviate dark thoughts I'd secretly harbored about men who wear dark skin - because I've been afraid of black men.\n\nBecause I'm a man who has feared black men, despite the gaggle of black brothers and cousins and black father and stepfather who lived in the same house I did and loved me - despite the dark skin I've worn since birth.\n\nThat's why I know that the skin color of the police officer who killed Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte in a still-disputed shooting is largely irrelevant, just as it is in most such incidents, no matter what media critics such as Howard Kurtz think.\n\n\"Since the anger in North Carolina's largest city is driven by outrage over a high-profile series of deaths of black men in confrontations with white officers, this would seem to be a highly relevant part of the story,\" Kurtz wrote .\n\nI know Kurtz is mistaken because I've battled an irrational fear of black men that has, misleadingly, been only attributed to white or other non-black people: Scott was in fact killed by a black officer in Charlotte last week. And a couple of days of violent protests in Milwaukee followed the August shooting of a black man by a black cop in that city.\n\nRelated article Injustice, not Kaepernick, is the problem\n\nMy own score on the I mplicit Association test (a test developed by researchers to test for unconscious racial bias) showed that I found it slightly easier to associate negative things with dark skin - like nearly 90% of white people and almost half of black people.\n\nThis is a key aspect of our ongoing national discussion about race that is too frequently ignored.\n\nBut it is because I'm aware of my own fear that I know that even \"good\" cops can kill unarmed black men and millions of non-deplorable people can find ways to rationalize every such shooting. Because the kind of bias that is most pernicious is the subconscious kind. It can seduce us into believing t hat as long as we think the right thing or try to do the right thing or be the right kind of person, our actions would never be negatively influenced by racist stereotypes.\n\nI'm not a racist. I love people who wear dark skin like I do. I'm married to a black woman who chopped off her long dreadlocks for a short natural hair look, and am the father of a 14-year-old black son and a 12-year-old black daughter. I've studied the ugly history of race in this country to teach others. I've unflinchingly stood against bigotry and bias and racism in all their forms.\n\nAnd, still, I've struggled with this self-knowledge.\n\nThat's why I know it isn't something you can pray away or think away or effectively corral without deliberative, purposeful action that must become second nature.\n\nAnything less means that this type of bias won't be defeated and will continue playing an important role in ugly confrontations between black people and police, no matter how perfectly the black man complies with commands or how closely the cop follows strict training guidelines.\n\nRelated article In a violent, angry America, a plea for peace\n\nOur country was founded in part on the belief that dark skin denoted inferiority and danger, a message with roots that are now centuries deep. Without systemic reforms designed to specifically combat implicit bias we will continue running in these circles, forever lamenting our fate.\n\nAirbnb, though it is far from the finish line, is beginning to take such steps to fight the bias among some hosts that participate in the home-sharing service. The company is restructuring the way reservations are made and requests accepted. Orchestras combated gender bias in a similar way by switching to blind auditions.\n\nRelated video Subconscious racial bias in children\n\nAnd Drexel University Professor Adam Benforado in \"Unfair: The New Science of Criminal Injustice\" laid out a series of reforms needed in the criminal justice system that could root out the implicit bias that has helped lead to racial disparities in convictions and sentencing.\n\nEach of those efforts is being designed to make it harder for our brains to automatically rely upon the racist stereotypes floating through our minds that we often aren't even aware of or pretend don't exist.\n\nBut maybe the most important step is first acknowledging that an individual's goodness isn't enough to correct racial wrongs or prevent future injustices.\n\nBecause if implicit bias can affect a good black man like me, it can affect anyone - and corrupt every system upon which we rely despite our best intentions.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Maxine Waters, D-California, reading excerpts from a letter members later presented to Attorney General Loretta Lynch decrying violence.\n\n\"We will not continue to ask our constituents to be patient without any hope for change,\" she added. \"Madame Attorney General, you have the unique opportunity and constitutional responsibility to change this narrative.\"\n\nCaucus Chair G.

The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.\n\n\"He posed no threat. He had no weapon.

Joyce Beatty told CNN's John Berman that lawmakers \"can't be silent.\"\n\n\"I think transparency is of the utmost. I understand the legalities. I understand that you have to have a full investigation,\" she said on \"At This Hour.\"\n\n\"We want to make sure that the US Department of Justice is engaged. We want to have independent investigators going into these communities so we take away all doubt or perceptions of the biases,\" the Ohio Democrat said. \"We're losing too many lives.\"\n\nBoth presidential candidates have spoken out this week about the need to improve the relationship between black communities and law enforcement.\n\nHillary Clinton, who the Black Caucus' political action committee endorsed, addressed the shootings in a speech Wednesday in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\"There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,\" Clinton said. \"It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\"\n\nAnd Donald Trump said Wednesday he was \"very troubled\" by the fatal police shooting in Tulsa and suggested the officer in question \"got scared\" or was \"choking,\" a slang term for failing under pressure.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Police shootings: Trials, convictions are rare for officers\n\nFew police officers ever face trial for shooting deaths, let alone are convicted.\n\nIn recent years, fatal shootings of unarmed black men across the United States have sparked outrage and concerns over police use of lethal force. Despite several high-profile cases and increased video evidence, convictions have been rare.\n\nOne researcher reported that there are about 1,000 police shootings each year in the United States.\n\nBetween 2005 and April 2017, 80 officers had been arrested on murder or manslaughter charges for on-duty shootings. During that 12-year span, 35% were convicted, while the rest were pending or not convicted, according to work by Philip Stinson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.\n\nHere's a look at some recent police shooting cases involving African-American victims and the outcomes:\n\nLamar Anthony Smith\n\nThen-St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley shot and killed Smith in December 2011, after Stockley and his partner, Brian Bianchi, witnessed a suspected drug transaction and Smith allegedly fled the scene. After the police chase ended, Stockley exited the SUV with his department-issued handgun and a personal AK-47 pistol, a violation of department policy, according to a criminal complaint. Stockley fired five times into Smith's vehicle.\n\nOutcome: Stockley was acquitted after St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson said the state failed to prove that Stockley did not act in self-defense.\n\nSylville Smith\n\nThe 23-year old man was shot after a brief chase by then-Milwaukee officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown in August 2016. The shooting after a traffic stop sparked days of unrest in Milwaukee.\n\nOutcome: Jury found Heaggan-Brown not guilty of first-degree reckless homicide in June 2017.\n\nPhilando Castile\n\nThe 32-year-old Minnesota man was fatally shot during a traffic stop by police officer, Jeronimo Yanez, in July 2016. Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, live-streamed the aftermath of the confrontation and said Castile was reaching for his identification when he was shot.\n\nOutcome: Jury found Yanez not guilty of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Castile. His family in June 2017 reached a $3 million settlement with the city of St. Anthony, Minnesota. St. Anthony and the city of Roseville settled with Reynolds in November 2017 for $800,000.\n\nTerence Crutcher\n\nThe 40-year-old man was shot in September 2016 by Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby after Crutcher's SUV was found stalled in the middle of the street. Shelby testified that she opened fire because she feared for her life. Videos of the shooting showed Crutcher walking on the road with his arms in the air before being shot.\n\nOutcome: Jury found Shelby not guilty of felony manslaughter in May 2017.\n\nFreddie Gray\n\nThe 25-year-old man was arrested by Baltimore Police after he was found with a knife in his pocket in April 2015. Gray died after suffering a neck injury while in police custody. A Baltimore grand jury indicted six police officers on a range of charges from involuntary manslaughter to reckless endangerment.\n\nOutcome: Three were found not guilty, three officers had their charges dropped. Baltimore officials in September 2015 approved a $6.4 million settlement with Gray's family for all civil claims tied to his death.\n\nSamuel DuBose\n\nThe 43-year-old who was pulled over for a missing front license plate was shot in the head in a July 2015 incident captured on body-camera video. The officer, Ray Tensing, was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter. Tensing testified that he was being dragged by the left arm when he reached up and shot DuBose, while prosecutors said he wasn't being pulled by the car and didn't need to fire at DuBose.\n\nOutcome: A mistrial was declared in 2016 . A second mistrial was declared in 2017 after juries deadlocked over a verdict.\n\nWalter Scott\n\nThe 50-year-old man driving with a broken brake light was shot while running away from North Charleston police officer, Michael Slager. Slager was charged with first-degree murder after a cell-phone video of the April 2015 incident was released. He pleaded guilty in May 2017 to the federal charge of violation of civil rights by acting under the color of law.\n\nOutcome: Slager's 2016 state murder trial ended in a mistrial. US District Court Judge David Norton ruled in 2017 that the underlying offense to a civil rights charge was second-degree murder and sentenced Slager to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nAkai Gurley\n\nThe 28-year-old man was fatally shot in a New York housing project. Police officer Peter Liang, who had been on the job 18 months, was on patrol in the dark stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project in November 2014 when he fired his gun. He testified that it was an accidental discharge. The bullet ricocheted off a wall and struck Gurley in the chest.\n\nOutcome: Liang was found guilty of second-degree manslaughter and official misconduct. A State Supreme Court justice in Brooklyn reportedly spared Liang jail time , ordering him to serve five years probation, 800 hours of community service and three years probation. The justice, Danny Chun, also reduced Liang's second-degree manslaughter charge to criminally negligent homicide, ruling Liang failed to perceive the risk that his actions would lead to Gurley's death.\n\nSupporters said that Liang, a Chinese-American, was singled out for prosecution.\n\nEric Courtney Harris\n\nThe 44-year-old man was shot in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by Robert Bates, a volunteer reserve sheriff's deputy for the county sheriff's office in April 2015. Officers were conducting a sting operation to try to catch Harris illegally selling a gun and had pursued, then tackled him when Bates fired his pistol into Harris' back. Bates, 74, said he had meant to use his Taser, not his revolver.\n\nOutcome: Bates was found guilty of second-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced in June 2016 to four years in prison, with credit for time served; he was released in October 2017, court documents show .\n\nEric Garner\n\nThe 43-year-old man died after being tackled to the ground and held in a chokehold by New York City police officers on July 17, 2014, for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. Garner, who has asthma, said, \"I can't breathe,\" as the incident was captured on cell-phone video and died later that day.\n\nOutcome: Grand jury decided not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo. The city settled with Garner's estate for $5.9 million.\n\nMichael Brown\n\nThe unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot after a struggle with a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, 2014. Documents show that Officer Darren Wilson fired his gun 12 times.\n\nOutcome: Grand jury decided not to indict Wilson , leading to renewed protests. Brown's family reached a civil settlement with the city in June 2017.\n\nTamir Rice\n\nThe 12-year-old Cleveland teenager was shot by a police officer, who was responding to a 911 call claiming a person was pointing \"a pistol\" at people. An officer in training, Timothy Loehmann, shot at Rice, who was carrying an air pistol, within moments of arriving at the scene in November 2014.\n\nOutcome: A grand jury decided not to indict Loehmann or the officer who was with him, Frank Garmback. Loehmann was fired in May 2017 for being untruthful on his job application, and Garmback was suspended for 10 days for violating tactical rules relating to how he drove to the shooting scene. A dispatcher was suspended for eight days in March 2017 for failing to relay a citizen's 911 report that Rice was \"probably a juvenile\" and that his gun was \"probably fake,\" and another officer was suspended for two days at that time for working a second job near the shooting scene without permission.\n\nSandra Bland\n\nThe 28-year-old woman was found dead in her cell three days after being arrested in Waller County, Texas, for allegedly failing to use her turn signal in July 2015.\n\nOutcome: Grand jury decided not to indict any of the county jail employees.\n\nAlton Sterling\n\nThe 37-year-old Louisiana man was fatally shot after being pinned to the ground by officers outside a Baton Rouge convenience store in July 2016. Police said he was reaching for a gun.\n\nOutcome: No federal civil rights or state charges were filed against the officers.\n\nCNN's Michelle Krupa and Lindsey Knight contributed to this story.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The outcome of the Freddie Gray case is a cautionary tale for prosecutors in the George Floyd case\n\n\"I can't breathe,\" George Floyd said to Minneapolis Police officers on Memorial Day while in custody, with an officer's knee pressing on his neck. Minutes later the 46-year-old Black man was unresponsive, pronounced dead later that afternoon. Video of the incident then went viral.\n\nFive years earlier and over a thousand miles away in Baltimore, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, uttered those same words, \"I can't breathe,\" while in police custody, according to trial testimony. Gray died from his injuries one week later.\n\nMany legal experts, including the Hennepin County attorney who prosecutes cases in Minneapolis, drew the comparison between the Gray case and the Floyd case. At the most basic level, in both cases, a Black man was arrested for a minor offense and became unresponsive while in custody. Their encounters both turned out to be fatal.\n\nProtesters demanding justice filled streets across the country for days, and within ten days of their deaths the officers involved were arrested.\n\nThe Gray case turned out to be a failed prosecution: None of the six Baltimore officers arrested were convicted.\n\nThe trial for the four now former Minneapolis police officers, Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng , is scheduled for March 8, 2021. While none of the officers have entered formal pleas, Lane's attorney has entered a motion to dismiss the case against his client and Kueng's attorney says his client intends to plead not guilty.\n\nAs discovery will now begin with legal motions filed and responded to from both sides, CNN asked two attorneys who have already walked this road in Baltimore and other legal experts to offer lessons learned and words of caution.\n\nOn April 12, 2015, Gray was arrested for illegal possession of a switchblade and loaded into a police van that drove him around the city for roughly 40 minutes before arriving at a Baltimore police station. When police went to take him out of the van, he was unresponsive.\n\nDoctors determined Gray's neck had been broken in a severe spinal cord injury. He died seven days later.\n\nRelated article 'People go to protests to be heard': Reflections on the '60s and today\n\nGray's death became a symbol of the Baltimore community's mistrust of police: They blamed the six police officers responsible for his care, custody and control.\n\nOn the day of Gray's funeral on April 27, after several days of peaceful protests, unrest erupted around the city.\n\nOne week after the protests broke out, Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore City State's Attorney, charged the six officers with felonies that, if convicted, could have put some of the officers behind bars for decades.\n\nIn defending her office's actions, Mosby told CNN last month what the message was then: The same as it is now.\n\n\"That power of justice is what everyone is screaming for,\" Mosby said. \"Treat police the same way you would treat anyone else regardless of race, sex and religion, and that's your obligation.\"\n\nDefense attorney Michael Belsky, who represented the highest ranking officer charged in Baltimore, Lt. Brian Rice, tells CNN it was \"inconceivable that an investigation of this magnitude could be conducted so quickly in a careful and prudent manner.\"\n\nThree days after Floyd's last breath, under immense pressure to charge the Minneapolis officers involved, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman was of the same mindset, saying prosecutors in Minnesota did not want to make the mistake that Baltimore did by charging too quickly.\n\nRelated article This haunting song features the last words of unarmed black men\n\n\"I will just point to you the comparison to what happened in Baltimore and the Gray case,\" Freeman told reporters at a press conference. \"There was a rush to charge, it was a rush to justice... I will not rush to justice. I'm going to do this right.\"\n\nThe next day, Freeman would announce Chauvin's arrest, but Mosby took issue with his take.\n\n\"Saying that there was a 'rush to charge, a rush to justice' in the Freddie Gray case is demonstrably false,\" Mosby said in a statement.\n\nWhile there are similarities, legal experts point to one obvious difference between the Floyd case and the Gray case which they say could lead to the conviction of at least one of the former Minneapolis police officers: the dramatic video.\n\nCell phone video captured then-Officer Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was on the ground outside a police vehicle. Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe and was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\n\"The video is a tremendous difference obviously because we can all look at the video and make reasonable assumptions,\" Belsky said. \"The biggest difference between the Minneapolis case and the Freddie Gray case is that in the Freddie Gray case there was no video, which led people to speculate both ways.\"\n\nBut from experience Belsky issues a word of caution: The Floyd case is not a slam dunk.\n\n\"Every use of force case is different,\" Belsky said. \"They are not monolithic cases. Every one is different and has its own set of circumstances.\"\n\nEach of the six officers arrested in the Gray case faced at least three charges at trial. All of them pleaded not guilty to every charge.\n\nBelsky's client, Rice, was charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office.\n\nWhen she announced the arrests, Mosby stood on the courthouse steps, telling the community \"no one is above the law.\"\n\nPeter Moskos, former Baltimore Police officer and associate professor in the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, believes Mosby \"heard the cry for justice\" five years ago and arrested the officers \"to placate the protesters and rioters.\"\n\nMoskos says the prosecutor \"never showed crime happened.\"\n\n\"It was a tragedy but it was a civil issue,\" he said.\n\nRelated article New police body camera footage reveals George Floyd's last words were 'I can't breathe'\n\nIn Minneapolis, ex-officer Chauvin was arrested the day after prosecutor Freeman's news conference and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. In the days after Chauvin's arrest, protests ramped up as the probe continued into the three other officers.\n\nFive days after Chauvin's initial arrest, those officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. And Chauvin was additionally charged with second-degree murder.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who had been tapped by the governor to be lead prosecutor, told the Minneapolis community, \"I did not allow public pressure to impact our decision making process.\"\n\n\"We made these decisions based on the facts that we gathered...and made these changes based on the law that we think applies,\" Ellison said.\n\nBecause of the lack of video inside the police van there was always a mystery as to what actually happened to Gray's neck and spinal cord.\n\nRelated article Crime is surging in US cities. Some say defunding the police will actually make it fall\n\nProsecutors asserted it was because Officer Caesar Goodson was driving the van erratically at a reckless speed. But defense attorney Catherine Flynn, who represented Officer Garrett Miller, says the evidence never supported the prosecution's theory \"that he was killed because of a rough ride. There was never a shred of evidence to support that theory throughout all of the litigation.\"\n\nThat opened up the door for the defense to claim that by intentionally thrusting his head on the van's walls and by standing up in a moving vehicle Gray himself caused his fatal injuries.\n\nAs far as lessons learned from Baltimore, Belsky says Minneapolis prosecutors need to make sure they have a rock solid case.\n\n\"The Chauvin case may well be the case where it is more than warranted to charge and secure a conviction. But on the flip side there are cases like the one we had in Baltimore that do not deserve to be charged and where the facts do not support a conviction ...The lesson learned is that facts matter and each case is different.\"\n\nThe presiding judge for all of the Baltimore officer trials was Barry Williams, a former prosecutor who investigated police misconduct cases for the US Justice Department.\n\nIn three separate bench trials, Judge Williams acquitted Rice and Officers Goodson and Edward Nero on all charges, stating as part of the record that the prosecution had \"failed to meet its burden to show that the actions of the defendant rose above mere civil negligence.\"\n\nFlynn agreed with the judge's legal determination.\n\n\"The judge was extremely thorough and the state's legal theory simply didn't hold water,\" Flynn said. \"They were just wrong.\"\n\nOfficer William Porter's trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors announced they would re-try his case but then decided to drop all charges against Porter and the two other officers, Miller and Sgt. Alicia White.\n\n\"You don't charge people just to charge them. You charge because you believe a crime has been committed,\" said Belsky, Rice's lawyer. \"You want to make sure you do a thorough investigation so that ultimately you can get a conviction.\"\n\nMosby told CNN prosecutors were hindered because Baltimore police \"were working against us,\" and that \"search and seizure warrants weren't executed.\" Baltimore Police have not responded to her claims.\n\nRelated article Taking 'Black Lives Matter' from slogan to reality\n\nMosby said that regardless of the outcome of the criminal cases in Baltimore , much good came from the prosecutions.\n\n\"We have tangible reforms that have come about as a result of those charges,\" Mosby said. \"Police officers are mandated to seat belt all prisoners. They're mandated to call a medic when requested. There is an affirmative duty and responsibility for colleagues if someone crossed the line, for them to go and inform folks about that.\"\n\nAnd as far as advice to the Minnesota defense attorneys who are beginning their journey as the Baltimore attorneys did five years ago, Belsky says: \"You have to recognize that there is a community that is legitimately hurt and distrustful of the police and you have to understand that and appreciate that.\n\n\"Don't try to change a community's perception based on a case. Worry about the facts of the case.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

      "text": "Chants of 'I can't breathe!' erupt as the officer in the Eric Garner case won't face federal charges\n\nFive years ago today, Eric Garner's final words \"I can't breathe\" sparked a nationwide rallying cry to demand more police accountability in the deaths of unarmed black men.\n\nBut on the eve of the anniversary, Garner's family was grieving again - this time because the Justice Department announced Tuesday it was declining to bring federal charges against the New York police officer accused of using a chokehold on the 43-year-old father of six.\n\nDaughter Emerald Garner led supporters at a vigil in New York on Tuesday night, chanting \"I can't breathe!\" 11 times before releasing balloons in her father's memory.\n\nGarner's mother, Gwen Carr, said the Department of Justice had failed them.\n\n\"Five years ago, my son said 'I can't breathe' 11 times,\" Carr said. \"And today we can't breathe, because they let us down.\"\n\nFederal authorities had a deadline of Wednesday - five years since Garner's death - to decide whether to bring charges against NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo.\n\nIn a cell phone video, the officer appeared to have Garner in a chokehold shortly before Garner died. Pantaleo denies that he used a chokehold.\n\nRelated article 'Black Lives Matter' cases: What happened after controversial police killings\n\nThe city medical examiner's office ruled Garner's death a homicide . The medical examiner testified that Pantaleo's alleged chokehold caused an asthma attack and was \"part of the lethal cascade of events.\"\n\nBut US Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said on Tuesday that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Pantaleo acted \"willfully\" in violation of the federal criminal civil rights act.\n\n\"There is nothing in the video to suggest that Officer Pantaleo intended or attempted to place Mr. Garner in a chokehold,\" Donoghue said.\n\nAttorney General William Barr made the decision to not bring charges against Pantaleo, siding with a Justice Department team from New York over the Civil Rights Division in Washington.\n\nThe decision stemmed from concerns that prosecutors could not successfully prove the officer acted willfully, a senior Justice Department official said.\n\n\"While willfulness may be inferred from blatantly wrongful conduct, such as a gratuitous kick to the head, an officer's mistake, fear, misperception, or even poor judgment does not constitute willful conduct under federal criminal civil rights law,\" Donoghue said.\n\nFederal investigators have been examining the circumstances of Garner's death since 2014, after a grand jury in New York declined to indict the Staten Island officer. The city of New York settled with Garner's estate for $5.9 million in 2015 .\n\nMembers of Garner's family, the Rev. Al Sharpton and several others met with federal prosecutors Tuesday to learn of the decision.\n\n\"They came in that room and they gave condolences,\" daughter Emerald Garner said. \"I don't want no condolences. I want my father.\"\n\nGarner's death happened three weeks before the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri .\n\nTheir deaths reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and renewed demands for police accountability in the deaths of unarmed black men.\n\nThe \"I can't breathe\" phrase reflected the frustration with what activists said was a lack of police accountability after police killings of unarmed black men.\n\nThe phrase was widely seen and heard at protests . Athletes like NBA star LeBron James bore the message on T-shirts in support of the cause.\n\nHalf a decade later, the debate over whether Pantaleo used a chokehold continues.\n\nGarner died on July 17, 2014, after police attempted to arrest Garner, who was allegedly selling loose cigarettes illegally on Staten Island, a crime he had been arrested for previously.\n\nGarner's friend, Ramsey Orta, recorded the confrontation on his cell phone as it quickly escalated.\n\nIn the video, Pantaleo can be seen wrapping one arm around Garner's shoulder and the other around his neck before jerking him back and pulling him to the ground.\n\nAs Pantaleo forces Garner's head into the sidewalk, Garner can be heard saying, \"I can't breathe. I can't breathe.\"\n\nPolice union officials and Pantaleo's attorney blamed Garner's death on his poor health.\n\nRelated article Police shootings: Trials, convictions are rare for officers\n\n\"Mr. Garner died from being morbidly obese\" and having other health issues, attorney Stuart London said earlier this year. \"He was a ticking time bomb and set these facts in motion by resisting arrest.\"\n\nLondon says his client is different from other officers he's represented in his almost 22 years defending cops. The other officers were aggressive, young police officers, he said.\n\n\"(Pantaleo) has been characterized as an overly aggressive officer with a history of this sort of behavior, and nothing can be further from the truth,\" London said. \"This was a regular patrolman doing regular police work.\"\n\nWhile Pantaleo will not face any criminal charges related to Garner's death, he still faces departmental charges.\n\nRelated article With his career on the line, NYPD police officer accused of fatally choking Eric Garner declines to testify\n\nThe NYPD has brought departmental charges against Pantaleo. If found guilty of using the chokehold and restricting Garner's breathing, he could face discipline ranging from loss of vacation days to the loss of his job.\n\nActivists and lawyers for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city agency charged with overseeing the NYPD, said Pantaleo used an illegal chokehold, which is banned by the department.\n\nBut union officials and lawyers for Daniel Pantaleo call it a \"seatbelt hold,\" a takedown maneuver that is taught to rookies while at the academy.\n\nPantaleo's disciplinary trial ended last month. NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill will make a decision after he receives a report and recommendation from the deputy commissioner of trials, Deputy Commissioner Phillip Walzak said.\n\nMeanwhile, Garner's mother said the loss of Pantaleo's job wouldn't fix anything, though it would be welcome.\n\n\"It doesn't do a lot. It's just that we must have some type of accountability, some type of responsibility, where the police officers are held accountable and pay for their misconduct,\" Carr said.\n\n\"If we just sit aside on the sidelines and let it go, it's going to keep on happening.\"\n\nCNN's Eric Levenson, Shimon Procupecz, Evan Perez, Laura Ly and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

A grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, and federal authorities declined to bring civil rights charges.\n\nO'Neill said in a news conference Monday afternoon that he fired Pantaleo on the recommendation of a department disciplinary judge, calling Garner's death an \" irreversible tragedy\" that \"must have a consequence.\"\n\nPantaleo \"can no longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer,\" he said.\n\n\"None of us can take back our decisions, especially when they lead to the death of another human being,\" O'Neill said.\n\nO'Neill's decision to fire Pantaleo comes after years of activists and politicians calling for Pantaleo to lose his job.\n\nNew York City mayor Bill de Blasio has been criticized over his handling of the case , but has promised \"justice\" for Garner's family.\n\nThe president of the police union, Patrick Lynch said after Pantaleo's firing that O'Neill chose \"politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead.\"\n\nHe said in a statement to AP that police officers should \"proceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed 'reckless' just for doing their job.\"\n\nGarner, 43, died on Staten Island after New York police officers approached him on suspicion of selling single, or \"loosie\" cigarettes.\n\nIn footage filmed by a bystander, Pataleo initially tried two approved restraints, but then wrapped his arms around Garner's neck, according to AP.\n\nGarner, who was 6-foot-2 and 400-pounds, cried out \"I can't breathe\" at least 11 times before falling unconscious.\n\nNYPD has banned the use of chokeholds for more than 25 years. The department defines a chokehold as  \"any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air,\" according to The New York Times .\n\nThe New York City medical examiner determined at the time that Garner died from a chokehold and compression on his chest.\n\nHis death came amid a growing outcry over police use of force and the deaths of unarmed black men.

And on Tuesday, police near San Diego fatally shot another unarmed black man within minutes of responding to a mental-health-related call.\n\nWith this subject in mind, we bring you this story of what an ordinary black family can face when they need the police.\n\nTake for example this series of tweets from by Tristan Riddell , who is best known for his Nerd Party network podcasts The Senate Floor and Nerd Nuptial . For his day job, he works as a videographer/video editor at Northwestern University.\n\n\"One of my favorite students had his car stolen last night. He's a 17 year old black male. Thought it would be a good idea to call the cops.\n\nGroceries in hand he checks his LoJack app first and can see that its moving down the road. Cops arrive and immediately frisk him.\n\nThey ask him if he's on drugs. He tries to tell them that he just wants his car back.\n\nHe shows them on his phone exactly where his car is. They don't believe him so they put him in the squad car and take him in. They process him and take his fingerprints.\n\nHe gets to call his mom and she raises hell. After a long time they let him go.\n\nThey then allow him to go get his car and the window is broken in. It was exactly where the app said.\n\nThis never would have happened to me because I'm white. He called the cops asking for help and got treated like a criminal.\n\nJust because he's black and could afford a fancy car.\"\n\nWe reached out to the student who has, so far, not responded to our questions. Riddell has not revealed his identity nor said what city and police department where this occurred, except to reveal that it happened in Illinois.\n\nAlthough Riddell's tweets mention LoJack by name, if the story is true then the subject was probably using some other app instead, as LoJack does not have a consumer app for tracking stolen vehicles.\n\nNorthwestern is located in the Chicago suburb of Evanston however the Evanston police have confirmed to Business Insider that this incident did not occur in Evanston.\n\nJump to"

He took a pair of their shoes onto the platform when he did his salute.\n\nPuma is launching a collection of shoes called \"Power Through Peace\" on Oct. 16, with the proceeds going to charity.\n\nGulden said Smith was a trailblazer for other athletes like Kaepernick, who could not find a job for the 2017 season and is still without a team. Smith never competed again after 1968, received death threats and struggled to make a living for years.\n\n\"What he did then ... was the bravest thing an athlete has ever done when you think about the consequences,\" Gulden said.\n\nNike sales jumped after the Kaepernick campaign, but its shares fell late last month when that did not feed through to an increase in the company's full-year forecast.\n\nBoth Puma and German rival Adidas have been taking share from Nike in its home market in the last couple of years, helped by the popularity of their retro fashion styles.\n\nRETURN TO BASKETBALL\n\nCEO since 2013, Gulden has rebuilt Puma's flagging business by putting a big focus on soccer and running, while partnerships with celebrities like singers Rihanna and Selena Gomez have revived its popularity among women.\n\nIt is now making a drive to widen its appeal in the U.S. market by returning to basketball, naming Jay-Z as its creative director for the sport and signing sponsorships with four top picks in the National Basketball Association (NBA) draft.\n\n\"We are doing it not only to sell basketball shoes ... but to sell more soccer shoes, to sell more training and running shoes in America to that kid who then perceives us a performance brand,\" Gulden said.\n\n\"Doing basketball is a real commitment to the American market and a necessary one to be a successful global company in the long-term.\"\n\nPuma's global marketing head Adam Petrick said basketball had a tradition of supporting social justice, with the NBA backing those who speak out such as Puma athlete Skylar Diggins-Smith, who is fighting unequal pay for female players.\n\n\"If we're going to participate in the basketball culture, then we have to participate in all aspects of that,\" he said.\n\nPuma's core consumers aged between 14 and 30 have shown an increased interest in activism since the financial crisis in 2008, and Trump's election in 2016.\n\n\"As a brand we can't be worthy of their business unless we are sensitive to that,\" Petrick said.\n\nAdidas faced brief boycott calls in May after the rapper Kanye West, who makes its Yeezy brand, described slavery as a choice and praised Trump.\n\nApart from that, it has not ventured into race politics in the same way as Nike and Puma, although it has scored with consumers with an environmental conscience, who have snapped up its \"Parley\" shoes made out of recycled ocean plastic.\n\nMatt Powell, a senior adviser with market research firm NPD, said the sports industry was ahead in seeking to align with the values of its consumers, with Puma's rivals like Patagonia and Vans-owner VF Corp putting a focus on sustainability.\n\nHe predicts Puma's \"fist-raising\" campaign will bring only a limited boost to sales but will help the brand longer term.\n\n\"The consumer ... wants brands to take visible and vocal stands on social issues,\" he said. \"There are many more people who would respond positively than negatively.\"\n\nPuma saw second-quarter sales jump almost 19 percent in the United States, after stripping out currency effects. Gulden declined to comment on current trading ahead of third-quarter figures on Oct. 25.\n\nAnalysts expect the focus on the United States will help boost profitability, which lags well behind Adidas and Nike, as Puma currently lacks scale and distribution muscle in the world's biggest market for sportswear.\n\nPuma's shares, which dipped in January when former French parent Kering said it would spin off the brand, have since rallied on an upbeat 2018 outlook and are trading up almost a third in the last year.\n\n(Reporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nJump to"

Rosfeld shot Rose three times last summer, after the teenager fled from a traffic stop .\n\n\"It will have to be challenged, in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. It will have to continue to be challenged on a federal level,\" S. Lee Merritt, the Rose family's attorney, said Friday .\n\n\"Antwon Rose was shot in his back,\" Merritt continued. \"He was unarmed, and he did not pose a threat to the officer or to the community, and the verdict today says that is OK, that is acceptable behavior from a police officer.\"\n\nMerritt also condemned the verdict in a tweet: \"Everything has to change,\" he wrote.\n\nRose is just one of many unarmed black men that have died at the hands of white police officers, a phenomenon that spawned the #BlackLivesMatter movement . According to the Washington Post, there were 17 such deaths in the US in 2018 . In these cases, officers are rarely convicted .\n\n\"This case had nothing to do with race, absolutely nothing to do with race,\" Patrick Thomassey, Mr. Rosfeld's lawyer, said after the verdict, as reported by the New York Times . \"And some people in this city have made it that way and it's sad.

And it had nothing to do with the color of anyone he was arresting.\"\n\nThe shooting of Rose was captured on video by bystanders and posted online, triggering a series of protests in the Pittsburgh area last year. When the verdict was announced on Friday, more protests erupted outside the courthouse.\n\n\"I hope that man never sleeps at night,\" Rose's mother, Michelle Kenney, said of Rosfeld . \"I hope he gets as much sleep as I do, which is none.\"\n\nRosfeld testified that he pulled over the car - a gold Chevrolet Cruze, driven by then-17-year-old Zaijuan Hester, in which Rose was the front seat passenger - because it matched the description of a car involved in a drive-by shooting 20 minutes earlier.\n\nHe also testified that he thought he'd seen a gun in Rose's hand, contradicting earlier statements that he gave to police . Rosfeld then shot Rose in the back, arm and side of the face as he ran away.\n\n\"It happened very quickly,\" he said during the trial, as reported by the New York Times . \"My intent was to end the threat that was made against me.\"\n\nFollow INSIDER on Facebook .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "US Soccer apologized to Megan Rapinoe 4 years after she was criticized for being one of the first athletes to kneel in support of Colin Kaepernick\n\nMegan Rapinoe was one of the first athletes to kneel during the national anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick.\n\nAnd now that the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery have prompted a reckoning with race relations and police brutality across America, many are seeing Rapinoe's gesture in a whole new light.\n\nThe US Soccer Federation is among them.\n\nIn an interview with former USWNT star Julie Foudy on her ESPN podcast \"Laughter Permitted with Julie Foudy,\" Rapinoe said she received a phone call from newly-minted US Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone - who is also a former USWNT player - to apologize for how the federation responded to her decision to kneel.\n\n\"The initial call with Cindy [Parlow Cone], while I personally - it's a little bit of a weird position because I don't want thanks for doing this or I don't need an apology for doing that,\" Rapinoe told Foudy. \"But it's just an institutional taking of responsibility. That's the most important thing.\"\n\n\"I think that there was a need for taking that responsibility, a need for putting your hand up and saying 'it was wrong at the time and this is why and we know that and we take responsibility and there's nothing that can really take that back, but we will work to do this work in the future. We will work to break this down in the future,'\" Rapinoe added. \"And I think, while I would've loved for them to have reacted differently in the moment and the NFL to react differently and the whole country to react differently, we do need to allow people to take the first step. I think that that's acknowledging and recognizing your mistakes and, first and foremost, believing Black people.\"\n\nThe US Women's National Team superstar first took a knee during the national anthem before a game with the Seattle Reign in September of 2016 , just four days after Kaepernick kneeled for the very first time with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nLater that month, Rapinoe knelt before a USWNT friendly against Thailand - a decision the US Soccer Federation publicly disagreed with at the time.\n\n\"The playing of our national anthem is an opportunity for our Men's and Women's National Team players and coaches to reflect upon the liberties and freedom we all appreciate in this country,\" US Soccer wrote in a statement released during the game. \"As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played.\"\n\nAt the time, Sunil Gulati was President of US Soccer. Months after Rapinoe kneeled, Gulati oversaw the institution of a policy that required national team players \"to stand respectfully during the playing of national anthems at any event in which the federation is represented.\"\n\n\"What they were doing to me, and it was echoing what the NFL did to Colin, was to try to silence Colin and, in effect, try to silence Black people,\" Rapinoe said. \"They were silencing me and in effect silencing or working to silence any other player - particularly any other Black player - who would have tried to kneel. So if they're going to treat me the way that they did, what does that say to AD or Crystal or Lynn or Christen Press. What does it say to those players?\"\n\nThe federation has changed leadership twice since, with Parlow Cone taking over the helm in March of this year after former President Carlos Cordeiro resigned over USWNT equal pay lawsuit backlash . And even though the February 2017 policy was passed well before her tenure, Parlow Cone encouraged US Soccer's board of governors to reconsider the group's stance and took responsibility for the federation's past actions in her call with Rapinoe.\n\n\"All of that means to me that people are starting to believe what Colin [Kaepernick] was saying,\" Rapinoe said. \"And they're starting to believe Black people in this country. They're starting to believe the collective experience of Black and brown people in this country, of people of color in this country, when it comes to police brutality, when it comes to the killing of unarmed Black men and women in this county, when it comes to the terrorizing of communities, when it comes to even the less violent, the microaggressions and the off-hand comments.\"\n\nRapinoe further explained that it was clear to her back in 2016 that the federation - and the public at large - had not internalized the meaning behind Kaepernick's silent protest.\n\n\"Even in the moment four years ago, when US Soccer originally came out with their statement, it essentially said all of our players and coaches should show respect and stand for the national anthem because it's a time to reflect on all of the liberties that we all possess,\" she said. \"That, in the moment, the only thing it said to me was 'you don't believe what Colin is saying,' because if you did, you would know that when Colin or someone like Colin or Black people or whoever it is, look at the flag, they don't see the respect, they don't feel the respect, they don't have all of their liberties.\"\n\nWhen Foudy commended Rapinoe for being \"ahead of the curve\" on the kneeling demonstration, the pink-haired striker was quick to add that she was \"ahead of the curve for white people\" before reflecting on why she felt the urge and confidence to involve herself in what was then a quite controversial movement.\n\n\"I'm sure part of it is just my personality. I don't know,\" Rapinoe said. \"I also feel like it is my responsibility. I really do feel like that. I mean, I think growing up on the women's national team ... we know what, at least in some part, what discrimination feels like. We know that just because we're women, we were treated differently, paid differently, resourced differently, looked at differently, marketed differently. And less. ... And then being gay and understanding, you know, at times I've looked at the flag and not had all my rights protected by that flag and had to come out and knowing that I've asked people to stand by me and to fight for my rights.\"\n\n\"I just have a personal belief that everybody has a responsibility to make the world a better place in whatever way they can be most effective,\" she added. \"I just happen to have a big platform. I happen to be playing on the women's national team. I happen to be an athlete in a country that glorifies athletes and asks them to be role models and to stand up for what's right and to do the right thing.\"\n\nThat said, Rapinoe didn't expect to be such a major focal point of the movement when she first decided to kneel. She assumed other athletes would kneel as well and that public opinion would be more understanding of her and Kaepernick's perspective.\n\n\"That was very naive of me, I guess - I thought it was so clear. It seemed so clear to me,\" Rapinoe said. \"We just went through that summer, in 2016, I think there was like five very high-profile murders of Black men at the hands of the police. Five police officers in Dallas were shot. Police officers in Louisiana were shot. And so, I was like, well very clearly this is happening. Very clearly, I could look back at the history of this country - what we were founded on - and think yes, this is very understandable how we are here, so what can we do to break that down.\"\n\n\"What goes on in me that says 'jump into the fire,' I don't know,\" she added, laughing. \"I also know if you want something done, you should do it, or you should help, or you should try. ... What do we have to lose? I'm already in the discriminated group or whatever. So I'm like, whatever, what do I have to lose?\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A Rochester police officer wrote 'make him a suspect' on an incident report about Daniel Prude's death as city officials tried to delay the release of body camera footage, documents show\n\nA Rochester police officer wrote \"make him a suspect\" on an incident report about the department's fatal encounter with Daniel Prude, and it was just one of many ways officials tried to keep information on what happened from going public, according to emails and documents released as part of the city's internal investigation into what happened.\n\nDaniel Prude died in March, one week after police put him in a \"spit hood\" and held him down until he became unconscious. Prude's brother had called 911 saying Prude was experiencing a mental health crisis.\n\nRochester Mayor Lovely A. Warren fired the city's police chief on Monday, days after the chief said he had plans to retire. Several other police officers have been suspended.\n\nThe city's internal investigation report, also released on Monday, found city officials, including police officers, may have engaged in conduct that suppressed video footage of the encounter with Prude and attempted to mislead others about what happened.\n\n\"This initial look has shown what so many have suspected, that we have a pervasive problem in the Rochester Police Department,\" Warren said of the internal investigation . \"One that views everything through the eyes of the badge and not the citizens we serve. It shows that Mr. Prude's death was not taken as seriously as it should have been by those who reviewed the case throughout City government at every level.\"\n\nThe report seen by Insider includes 325 pages of documents and emails in which officers discussed a concern of \"blow back\" in the community over Prude's death, as well as multiple attempts to control the narrative.\n\nIn one document, first flagged by The New York Times , a police officer circled Prude's name, and wrote the words: \"Make him a suspect.\"\n\nThe comment was written after another officer had listed Prude as an \"individual\" in a document's \"victim type.\" According to The Times, police believed Prude had broken a window at a store the night of the fatal encounter.\n\nIn other documents released as part of the investigation, city officials tried withholding body camera footage of the incident, attempted to influence Prude's autopsy, and failed to respond to requests made by the attorney representing Prude's family in a timely manner.\n\nOne email shows Deputy Police Chief Mark Simmons, who is now the city's acting police chief , telling then-Chief La'Ron Singletary in June: \"We certainly do not want people to misinterpret the officers' actions and conflate this incident with any recent killings of unarmed Black men by law enforcement nationally. That would simply be a false narrative, and could create animosity and potentially violent blow back in this community as a result.\"\n\nThe documents were released amid ongoing Black Lives Matter protests in Rochester, in which demonstrators have accused local officials of misconduct in Prude's death.\n\nIn her report on the internal investigation , Mayor Warren said she was not aware of body camera footage of Prude's fatal encounter with police until August 4.\n\n\"It is hard to rationalize how anyone who saw the video of Mr. Prude's encounter with the RPD did not fully equate these events beyond a few mentions of bad publicity, politics, process or a 'false narrative,'\" Warren said in her report.\n\n\"These incidents reveal that the culture of acceptance and insularity is more pervasive than we realized, which is why I am recommending the U.S. Department of Justice conduct its investigation.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll says he regrets not signing Colin Kaepernick in 2017\n\nThe death of George Floyd and our collective reckoning with race relations in America has shined a new light on Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protests back in 2016.\n\nAnd at least one prominent NFL coach regrets not signing the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback when he had the chance.\n\nIn a video conference on Thursday, Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll admitted that, in hindsight, he wishes he and his team had added Kaepernick into their ranks when they had a visit in 2017.\n\n\"I regret that we weren't the one way back when that just did it just to do it,\" Carroll said. \"Even though I thought that it wasn't the right fit necessarily for us at the time.\"\n\n\"I wish we would have contributed to it because the guy deserved to play,\" he added.\n\nThe 11-year Seattle head coach further explained that while he greatly admired Kaepernick's abilities, he expected his former division rival to compete for a starting role at quarterback. Since the Seahawks already had seven-time Pro Bowler Russell Wilson under center, Carroll figured there were better landing spots for Kaepernick out there.\n\n\"It wasn't going to be the open competitive situation that I like to think all of our spots are because Russ was such a dominant figure,\" Carroll said.\n\n\"I held [Kaepernick] in such a high regard I didn't see him as a backup quarterback, and I didn't want to put him in that situation with Russ,\" Carroll said. \"It just didn't feel like it would fit right. That's the way I felt about it. So I just wish it would happen, and I wish we would have been a part of it when the time was available then.\"\n\n\"The fact that it didn't work out for us, I figured he was going to wind up starting somewhere for sure,\" Carroll added. \"And it just didn't happen.\"\n\nOf course, Kaepernick famously - and quite controversially - did not wind up with another team. The quarterback kneeled in protest of police brutality during the playing of the national anthem before NFL games when he played for the 49ers. Naysayers widely interpreted the gesture as a rejection of the American flag and an offense to military members. Still, Kaepernick repeatedly said he kneeled to shine a light on the disproportionate killings of unarmed black men by white police officers across the country.\n\nStill, Kaepernick became an incredibly divisive figure and even drew the ire of President Donald Trump. NFL franchises - many of which are owned by Trump supporters and donors - were reluctant to sign the quarterback as a result. He and former teammate Eric Reid - who also kneeled during the anthem - settled with the league after suing for collusion. Kaepernick has not played in the league since.\n\n\"He was right on it,\" Carroll said Thursday. \"He was right on the topics about police brutality and inequality, and he was right on the subject matter at the time. That's so obvious now where maybe all of the flak that flew about not honoring the flag and all the other things that were not even a part of the demonstration or what his intent was at all, that just skewed the whole discussion, I don't think that's around now. It's different at this time frame.\"\n\nCarroll was presumably referring to the all-consuming reaction to the death of Floyd late last month.\n\nProtests have cropped up across the country since, helping the Black Lives Matter movement gain momentum to a level never before seen in the United States. Floyd's death has had ripple effects in the world of sports and has served as a moment of reflection - and regret - regarding Kaepernick's treatment in the NFL.\n\nWhen it comes to Kaepernick potentially returning to the league once and for all, Carroll said he thinks there's some momentum working in the quarterback's favor.\n\n\"After all of the time, the years that have passed, I never received a phone call about it,\" Carroll said. \"I never talked to another head coach about it. I never talked to anyone about it until today. I got a phone call today. I won't tell you who it was, but I got a phone call today asking inquiring about the situation, so I know somebody is interested. So we'll see what happens with that.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "New evidence emerges that Russia infiltrated Facebook to sow political chaos in the US\n\nA series of developments Wednesday shed new light on the lengths Russia went to exploit social media, and Facebook in particular, to spread disinformation and generate political division among the American public before last year's US election.\n\nIt emerged earlier this month that fake accounts linked to Russian entities used Facebook to spread misinformation and bought $100,000 worth of inflammatory ads leading up to the election.\n\nThe company still does not know the extent of Russia's purchases or whether the unidentified ad buys remain on the site. Facebook has since said Russia-linked groups did more than buy ads and post memes - they tried to organize anti-immigrant, anti-Hillary Clinton rallies in Texas and Idaho .\n\nWednesday's developments indicate that Kremlin-backed entities went even further than what was previously reported.\n\nIn one instance, The Daily Beast learned , operatives supported by the Russian government created a Facebook group impersonating a California-based Muslim organization, called United Muslims of America, to sow anti-US sentiment among American Muslims by targeting politicians across the spectrum.\n\nThe report said pro-Kremlin trolls used the group to push fabricated stories, like one claiming Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, admitted that the US \"created, funded, and armed\" Al Qaeda and ISIS and another saying Sen. John McCain of Arizona was the true founder of ISIS, the terrorist group also known as the Islamic State. Both Clinton and McCain are frequent and vocal critics of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn addition to spreading disinformation about Democratic and Republican politicians, the group's creators also reportedly used Twitter and Instagram to spread divisive memes and messages.\n\n\"Russia knows no ends and no limits to which groups they would masquerade as to carry out their objectives,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThose objectives at times seemed to go beyond bolstering Trump's candidacy - a main goal identified by US intelligence agencies. The impostor Facebook group's biggest swell in activity, according to the report, came after Trump as president ordered a missile strike on a Syrian military airfield in April . Trump made the decision after a deadly chemical attack blamed on Syrian President Bashar Assad killed scores of civilians in a northwest province of the country.\n\nRussia is a staunch ally of Assad and repeatedly warned the US against taking aggressive action following the chemical attack. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the US missile strike constituted \"aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law.\"\n\nOn April 9, three days after the strike, the fake UMA Facebook account posted a meme signaling its opposition to the move, according to The Daily Beast. The $93 million that the strike cost, the social-media posting said, \"could have founded Meals on Wheels until 2029\" (the group presumably meant \"funded\"). The group posted more than a dozen memes afterward - both on Facebook and on Instagram - opposing US intervention in Syria.\n\nOf the real United Muslims of America organization, Swalwell told The Daily Beast \"they seek harmony between the US and the Muslim world.\"\n\n\"Many of these individuals I have heard first-hand denounce terrorist attacks across the world, including those carried out by Muslims,\" Swalwell said. \"To see their name hijacked by the Russians, if true, and carrying out Russian goals of undermining the US is disturbing and not who they are.\"\n\nThe fake UMA group reportedly organized several real-life events, though it's unclear whether it successfully drew an audience. Fifty-nine people were marked as having attended one event in September 2016, while 20 were marked as having attended another in June this year, though The Daily Beast said there's no evidence that anyone showed up.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, CNN followed up with a separate report with details about a Facebook ad bought by Russians during last year's election that was centered on the Black Lives Matter movement and targeted specifically the cities of Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nThe ad was bought by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll factory based in St. Petersburg.\n\nFerguson and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015 were the sites of killings by the police of young, unarmed black men that sparked nationwide protests against the police and elevated the Black Lives Matter movement's profile.\n\nThe Russian-backed Facebook ad appeared in late 2015 or early 2016, sources told CNN, and though it was meant to appear supportive of Black Lives Matter, it may also have conveyed the group as threatening to some residents of those cities.\n\n\"This is consistent with the overall goal of creating discord inside the body politic here in the United States, and really across the West,\" former CIA officer Steve Hall told CNN. \"It shows the level of sophistication of their targeting. They are able to sow discord in a very granular nature, target certain communities and link them up with certain issues.\"\n\nThe Internet Research Agency, the Russian company that bought the ad, is known for its activities in the informational space.\n\nFrom his research on the company last year, the journalist Adrian Chen discovered that Russian internet trolls - paid by the Kremlin to spread false information on the internet - were behind numerous \"highly coordinated campaigns\" to deceive the American public.\n\nIt's a brand of information warfare, known as \"dezinformatsiya,\" that has been used by Russia since at least the Cold War. The disinformation campaigns, as described by Michael Weiss, a senior editor at The Daily Beast who also edits the Russia-focused journal The Interpreter, are only one \"active measure\" tool used by Russian intelligence to \"sow discord among,\" and within, allies perceived hostile to Russia.\n\nFrom interviews with former trolls employed by Russia, Chen gathered that the point of their jobs \"was to weave propaganda seamlessly into what appeared to be the nonpolitical musings of an everyday person.\"\n\nIndeed, \"the Russians generally look at cyberwarfare as a way to support informational goals, like shaping an election,\" Paulo Shakarian, the CEO of Cyr3con, a cybersecurity threat-intelligence firm, told Business Insider in July . The belief is rooted primarily in Putin's long-held view that cyberwar is a way to influence the informational battlefield.\n\nRussia's efforts were also most likely bolstered - intentionally or not - by Trump himself.\n\n\"Part of the reasons active measures have worked in the US election is because the commander-in-chief has used Russian active measures at times against his opponents,\" a former FBI special agent named Clint Watts told the Senate Intelligence Committee in May, pointing to Trump's citations of fake-news stories pushed out by Russian-linked entities last year.\n\nTrump \"denies the intel from the United States about Russia, and he claimed the election could be rigged - that was the number one claim pushed by RT, Sputnik News, all the way up until the election,\" Watts said. \"Part of the reasons Russian active measures work is because they parrot the same lines.\"\n\nFacebook, for its part, appears to have been slow to act in the wake of Russia's actions.\n\nPresident Barack Obama tried to warn the platform's CEO and cofounder, Mark Zuckerberg, about the threat of fake news and its possible effect on the 2016 election less than two weeks after Trump won the presidency, The Washington Post reported on Sunday.\n\nNine days before he reportedly spoke with Obama, Zuckerberg struck down the notion that Facebook could sway public opinion as a \"crazy idea\" that \"surely had no impact\" on the end result.\n\nFollowing the president's warning, Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem but said fake news wasn't widespread on Facebook, according to The Post. He added at the time that there was no easy solution to the issue, The Post said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nJump to"

Cory Booker Sen. Kamala Harris, both African American, dropped out of the Democratic presidential race, nary a word has been said by the remaining candidates about an issue critical to African American voters: the police shootings of unarmed black men.\n\nData from a range of sources indicate that 2019 was another disturbing year for officer-involved killings of African American males. According to Statista, an online statistics portal, blacks make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, but were the victims in 31 percent of police shootings last year. Two-hundred-and-five black people were shot by police in 2019, while 149 Hispanics and 312 non-Hispanic whites were.\n\nAdditionally, The Washington Post, which began documenting police shootings after Michael Brown was killed by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, found that 21 percent of the African Americans slain by police were unarmed and that blacks are three times more likely to be shot by cops than whites. The Post reports there were 1,004 total police shootings in 2019, up from 992 in 2018.\n\nYet it has not been a consistent talking point on the Democratic presidential campaign trail.\n\n\"Over all, the attention paid to these issues during this campaign cycle has been disappointing,\" Kailee Scales, the managing director of Black Lives Matter Global Network, told NBC News. \"(We have) been working consistently to center the conversation of racism, unjust systems, and the resulting police violence against unarmed black men-and women and youth-throughout this entire campaign cycle, with every candidate.\"\n\n\"Current candidates must do a better job at addressing these racially biased systems, and creating policies to transform our communities,\" Scales said.\n\nBlack Lives Matter surveyed its supporters in January, asking if the candidates were addressing issues most important to black Americans, including police shootings. \"The results were unsurprising,\" Scales said.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of participants said that none of the candidates talked enough about police shootings, and 83 percent said they wanted to hear more about the candidates' plans on criminal justice reform and racial injustice.\n\n\"Sadly, whenever the topic comes up about police officers unlawfully shooting black people,\" Mario Williams, a civil rights attorney in Atlanta, said, \"some people make ignorant reference to black-on-black crime rates, ignoring the issue at hand: the near 100 percent success rate of officers escaping liability for patently unlawful shootings of black people.\"\n\nWilliams added: \"When the conduct of the officer is patently unlawful, anger also sets in, along with a feeling of disbelief that without video, no matter that all the circumstantial evidence demonstrates an unlawful shooting, the officer escapes accountability.\"\n\nRhanda Dormeus, whose 23-year-old daughter Korryn Gaines was shot and killed by police officers near Baltimore in 2016, said the experience was \"devastating.\"\n\n\"You're broken,\" he said. \"It's unimaginable, made more difficult when no one is held accountable.\"\n\nHarris and Booker, who dropped out of the race in December and January, respectively, routinely raised the issue of police shootings of black men as part of their platforms. Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and the only remaining African American in the Democratic race, has been less vocal about the issue and is polling at less than 1 percent.\n\n\"The black vote is either ignored or assumed,\" Williams said. \"Trump is a good example. He puts out a commercial, , out of context, about a black woman who should have never been put in jail and, suddenly, black people should vote for him?\" he added, referring to a commercial the president's re-election campaign ran during the Super Bowl featuring Alice Marie Johnson, who was freed after 21 years in prison when her life sentence on a nonviolent drug conviction was commuted by Trump in 2018 .\n\n\"There has never been a sustained commitment to the black vote with respect to serious discussion and action that increases opportunities for black people. Legislation and actions almost always center around control of public image and self-centered political desires,\" Williams said,\n\nBlack voters have traditionally played a significant role in determining the Democratic presidential nominee, and this year is shaping up as no different. Biden supporters say his support among African Americans will help him in the later primaries in states more diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire, while the other front-runners in the polls, particularly Buttigieg, have struggled to attract black support.\n\nThe reasons for those struggles are obvious to many black activists.\n\n\"We need candidates who will see the connections between racism and poverty, housing access, poor education, prisons,\" said Karlene Griffiths Sekou, leader of the Boston branch of Black Lives Matter. \"And black deaths.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Lynda Williams, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, was reported to have confronted Barr in a closed-door meeting over his remarks last month.\n\nMany studies and real-life accounts from Black Americans dispute Barr's claims.\n\nThe Washington Post created a massive, real-time police shooting database following the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. An analysis of the data published five years later, in August 2019, found that Black Americans account for 36 percent of unarmed police shooting victims even though they are just 13 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nA Stanford University study released last year revealed that there is a clear pattern of racial disparities in traffic stops. The study analyzed 100 million police traffic stops, the largest such dataset ever collected.\n\nThe results show that police stopped and searched Black and Latino drivers on the basis of less evidence than they used in stopping white drivers, who are searched less often but are more likely to be found with illegal items. It also found that the difference in traffic stops drops by up to 10 percent at night, when it's harder for police to see the race of a driver.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and alerts\n\nA recent study by the American Civil Liberties Union of marijuana possession arrests from 2010 to 2018 concluded that even though the drug has been legalized or decriminalized in many states, \"stark racial disparities\" remain. The study said a Black person is, on average, nearly four times more likely to be arrested for possession than a white person, even though both groups use the drug at similar rates.\n\nDartunorro Clark covered national politics, including the Covid-19 recovery, for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Their deaths, along with many other similar cases, are once again highlighting concerns about whether law enforcement is equipped to handle such crises.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 people fatally shot by police have mental illnesses, according to a Washington Post database of fatal U.S. shootings by on-duty police officers. Since 2015, when The Post launched its database, police have fatally shot more than 1,400 people with mental illnesses.\n\nAngela Kimball, national director of advocacy and public policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said she believes the numbers are so high because people in mental health crises do not always respond in ways officers want them to.\n\n\"Police are trained to respond to a situation with a goal of protecting public safety and their own safety,\" she said. \"They are used to using interventions that are designed to contain somebody that is perceived as a danger.\"\n\nJuan Rios, an assistant professor who directs the master of social work program at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, said the statistics are higher for Black men than for other major demographics.\n\nLast month the journal Annals of Epidemiology said in an analysis that police are more likely to shoot and kill unarmed Black men who show signs of mental illness than white men who exhibit similar behaviors.\n\nRios said that is partly because Black men are least likely to get treatment for active mental health diagnoses among major demographics. Men ages 18 to 27 are also less likely to be treated, he said.\n\n\"You intersect all of those factors and you have Black young men who are most at risk who may not be in treatment,\" Rios said. \"And the reality is also Black men are more likely to be deemed as a threat than any other demographic.\"\n\nKimball said that during mental health crises, the presence of police officers, coupled with the uniforms and shouting, is quite often \"counterintuitive\" and that it can lead to tragedy.\n\nAngelo Quinto died in December, days after an incident involving Antioch, California, officers. His family had called the police for help because he was experiencing an episode of paranoia, according to a wrongful death claim .\n\nBy the time officers arrived, Quinto's mother had been able to calm him down. She was holding him in her arms when the officers took him away from her and laid him on his stomach, the complaint says.\n\nOne officer crossed Quinto's leg behind him, while the other placed his knee on Quinto's neck for more than 4 minutes, according to the complaint. Quinto \"became lifeless\" and was taken to a hospital, where he died Dec. 26.\n\nAntioch Police Chief Tammany Brooks has denied that officers used a knee or anything else to put pressure on his neck.\n\nQuinto's mother, Maria Quinto-Collins, told reporters that police handling of the situation was \"absolutely unnecessary.\"\n\n\"I trusted the police, because I thought they knew what they were doing, but he was actually passive and visibly not dangerous or a threat,\" she said at a news conference in February.\n\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, police fatally shot Ricardo Muñoz in September after his sister called for help, saying he had become aggressive.\n\nIn the audio of a 911 call played at a news conference, Muñoz's sister told the dispatcher that he was schizophrenic and bipolar and asked that officials take him to a hospital.\n\nWhen an officer arrived at the home, Muñoz exited with what authorities described as a hunting knife.\n\nLancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said at a news conference that Muñoz \"immediately, and without warning, charged the officer.\" The officer \"ran for his life\" and fired 4 seconds later, killing Muñoz.\n\nThe officer was cleared; Adams said he responded as he had been trained and met \"deadly force with deadly force.\"\n\nMuñoz's sister has questioned why police did not have a different standard for people suffering mental health crises.\n\n\"The right person should have been there,\" Rulennis Muñoz has said. \"The first responder needs to be someone like a caseworker, someone who knows how to deal with this situation so the cops wouldn't be the first person to approach.\"\n\nMuñoz's death echoes the killing in October of Walter Wallace Jr., 27, who was fatally shot by Philadelphia police responding to a call about a mental health crisis.\n\nAnthony Fitzhugh, Wallace's cousin, has said the family knew how to pacify Wallace when he was having an episode.\n\nBut on Oct. 26, they called 911 to request an ambulance in the hope that Wallace, who was bipolar, would receive medical intervention . A police officer arrived first.\n\nThe incident was recorded on cellphone and police body camera video , which showed Wallace, a father of eight children, being fatally shot in front of his mother and neighbors.\n\nIn the police video, an officer yells for Wallace to \"put the knife down now\" as he walks down his front steps with an object in his hand. As Wallace walks across the street still holding what appeared to be a knife, the officer fires multiple rounds.\n\nPolice have said that Wallace was ordered \"several times\" to drop the knife but that he continued to \"advance towards\" them. Officers fired \"multiple times,\" hitting Wallace in the chest and a shoulder, the police department said.\n\nWallace, who was Black, was pronounced dead at a hospital. The officers have been reassigned to restrictive duty pending an investigation, the police department said.\n\nWallace's family has denounced police for using deadly force, saying his wife had relayed his mental health struggles to police at the scene before he was shot. The family's attorney, Shaka Johnson, criticized the officers' handling of a mental health call.\n\nMany law enforcement agencies use the \"Memphis Model\" for crisis intervention training, or CIT. According to the CIT Center at the University of Memphis in Tennessee, it was developed in 1987 after Memphis police fatally shot a man who was threatening people with a knife. The man, who was Black, had a history of mental illness.\n\nThe death sparked outrage in Memphis and calls for a better way to intervene when someone is in a mental health episode.\n\nKimball said the program requires about 40 hours of training in mental health diagnoses, drug use issues and de-escalation tactics. There are more than 2,700 crisis intervention training sites around the country.\n\n\"It's really more of a concept of community engagement. Part of it is about law enforcement developing those connections with homeless shelters and with community mental health systems like hospitals so that everybody is working together,\" Kimball said.\n\nWhile the training is crucial for law enforcement officers, it is \"a workaround for a system that shouldn't be sending law enforcement to a call for a mental health crisis,\" she said.\n\nRios of Seton Hall said he agrees.\n\n\"When we look at why folks are ... more likely to die at the hands of police officers, it's that their training focuses more on marksmanship than it does on mental health support or crisis work,\" he said. \"A badge and gun should not be the first one to address a nonviolent mental health crisis call.\"\n\nRios and his colleague Tom Shea, a former police officer who is director of the Police Graduate Studies Program, are trying to counter that by working with communities on 911 divergence so that in nonviolent situations, people can call mental health professionals before they call police.\n\nRios said they will provide community-based training in deconstructing stigmas.\n\n\"Oftentimes what happens is our own implicit bias says that if there's a Black man who's in distress or in crisis, he must be on drugs, versus a white person who is in distress or in crisis needs help,\" he said. \"So we're looking to educate the community on being more cognitively flexible about who is in distress, who needs help and how to access resources.\"\n\nRios and Shea are working with communities in South Orange, New Jersey, with plans to expand their project elsewhere.\n\nLast year, the Federal Communications Commission formally designated 988 as a nationwide number for mental health crisis and suicide prevention services. The number is set to go live in July 2022.\n\nThe FCC said making 988 the go-to number for suicide prevention and mental health crisis calls \"will make it easier for Americans in crisis to access the help they need.\"\n\nKimball of the National Alliance on Mental Illness said the number will be a good alternative to 911 because \"there's a mobile crisis team of behavioral health professionals who can help defuse the situation, connect people to treatment and get them on a path to recovery.\"\n\nMinyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Speakers urged the marchers to remain peaceful.\n\nAbout 25 demonstrators in front of Oly city hall. Yelling:No justice, no peace. Live update at noon. @KING5Seattle pic.twitter.com/vH30qfCxDt\n\nOlympia Police Chief Ronnie Roberts said at a news conference Thursday afternoon that he understood the sensitivity of the case in light of police shootings of unarmed African-Americans in several cities across the country. But he said there was no indication that race played a factor in the confrontation early Thursday near a grocery store where the men had allegedly tried to steal beer.\n\nThe men were identified as stepbrothers Andre Thompson, 24, and Bryson Chaplin, 21, both of Olympia. Thompson was listed stable in serious critical condition Thursday night, while Chaplin was described as critical. Both are expected to survive, police said.\n\nRoberts said one of the men assaulted the officer, Ryan Donald, 35, who responded to a shoplifting call about 1:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. ET). Donald wasn't injured.\n\nIn audio of Donald's communications with a dispatcher during the incident, he is asked whether the men are armed. He replies: \"No. He just assaulted me with a skateboard. I tried to, uh, grab his friend. They're very aggressive, just so you know.\"\n\nListen to Excerpt of Police Audio\n\nDonald shot the man, who fled into the woods with his stepbrother, Roberts said. They then came back out of the woods, and \"the officer felt threatened and discharged his firearm\" again, hitting the other man multiple times in the torso, he said.\n\nDonald was put on administrative leave pending an internal investigation and a separate probe by the Critical Incident Team, a cooperative of investigators from five local law enforcement agencies under supervision of the Thurston County Sheriff's Office.\n\nPolice records indicate the incident is the first officer-related shooting in Olympia in at least three years. Mayor Stephen Buxbaum called it \"a tragic event\" and said he had coordinated with local churches and colleges to set aside time and locations for community gatherings.\n\n\"Let's not be reactive,\" he said. \"Let's take the path of consciously addressing our questions of what happened as best we can - seek justice and healing.\"\n\nThe shooting follows a string of high-profile killings of unarmed black men by police , including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri , and Eric Garner in New York City , which set off weeks of protests and a national \"Black Lives Matter\" movement that has gained momentum across the country.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAlex Johnson has been a reporter and editor for NBC News since 2000.

Janelle Bynum, even took a smiling selfie with the sheriff's deputy who responded and received an apology from the woman who called 911 - but the incident just added to a growing list of the police being called on black people doing ordinary, nonthreatening things.\n\nLike barbecuing in Oakland , California; selling water in San Francisco ; golfing in Pennsylvania ; mowing a lawn in Ohio ; swimming in a public pool in South Carolina ; swimming in a private pool in North Carolina ; inspecting a home in Tennessee ; shopping at a T-Mobile in Northern California ; moving out of an Airbnb rental in Southern California ; or waiting inside a Starbucks in Philadelphia .\n\nWhile the incidents have provoked outrage among African-Americans, they have also proven frustrating for police, who warn that calling 911 and tying up officers on frivolous calls may take them away from more serious situations.\n\nWhat happened to Bynum \"just took it over the top for me - you can't even go door to door without having police called,\" said Clarence Cox III, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or Noble, which advocates for justice in policing.\n\nWhile that misunderstanding was cleared up quickly, it's \"not a case of all's well that ends well,\" Cox said.\n\nWhile some police departments are now using these cases as models for their officers in how to best handle calls rooted in perceived bias, Cox said it's also imperative that dispatchers, police and citizens become more aware of how these complaints differ from actual criminal activity and to prevent them from escalating into something far worse.\n\n\"We've got to get back to talking to our neighbors and having real dialogue with one another,\" Cox said. \"If we continue going down the path that we're going, we're going to be one shot away from a civil war.\"\n\nThe people who have called 911 have often been identified as white, although not always (Bynum said she didn't know the race of her caller). Cox's organization has called for mandated implicit bias training at police agencies across the country in light of the high-profile cases of police-involved shootings of unarmed black men.\n\nHe said dispatchers need to be adequately trained to gather information from people about the circumstances and intent of a call so that they can relay to an officer whether the event is truly life-threatening.\n\n\"The officer has to have the info to know it's not a hot call,\" Cox said, referring to a situation involving an active crime scene. He added that officers, when they arrive at the scene, also need to be trained in how to best mediate during a tense situation.\n\nHe added that it's important for people - before they dial 911 - to think about why they're doing it and if the situation can be resolved with a simple conversation.\n\nPaul Butler, a Georgetown law professor and author of \"Chokehold: Policing Black Men,\" said encounters of police being called on black people go back long before Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested by police on his own front porch in 2009 after a neighbor mistakenly reported he was trespassing. (President Barack Obama called the incident a \"teachable moment.\")\n\nThese incidents are often captured and shared on cellphones, helping to spread people's stories, and Butler said that might be a good thing.\n\n\"If anything, hopefully the videos are educating everyone about the problem of calling 911 on people of color, and deterring people from doing so when there is no emergency,\" he said.\n\nA cellphone video of police officers in Abbeville, Louisiana, has been viewed on Facebook more than 384,000 times since it was posted June 23. Police found themselves in a delicate position when they were called to remove a group of black patrons from the parking lot of a Chili's restaurant.\n\nThe customers tried to explain how they were simply talking outside during closing time but that one of the employees thought they were trying to intimidate the staff. One of the members of the group wrote on Facebook that they had complained about poor service and cold food before leaving.\n\n\"They called me here to prevent an altercation with you guys,\" an officer told the group in the video.\n\n\"Why? Why?\" one of the men asked. \"Because we're black people in Abbeville it's [an] altercation.\"\n\n\"What did we do? All we did was pay and leave,\" someone else said.\n\nAs some voices were raised, the officer kept calm. \"I have a job to do,\" he said. \"They called me to do my job.\"\n\nIn the end, no arrests were made and the group left the parking lot. Chili's later put out a statement saying it regretted what occurred.\n\nAbbeville Police Chief Bill Spearman told NBC News that he was pleased with how his officers reacted, and that the incident has prompted one policy change: Businesses must ask people to leave their property first before calling police to get involved.\n\n\"The officers didn't have to make an arrest,\" Spearman said. \"I'm actually proud that with things going on in our nation that's how they responded.\"\n\nMark Bentzel, the police chief of the Northern York County Regional Police Department in Pennsylvania, said he's using an incident in April as a \"learning tool\" for best practices after his officers were called about a group of black women who were accused of golfing too slowly at a golf club.\n\nHe said his officers are trained to immediately determine whether an actual crime was committed, and if the answer is no, to defuse such a situation.\n\nIn the case of the women at the golf club, they wanted police there as well to get their side of the story. That worked in the officers' favor, Bentzel added.\n\n\"This is the tough part for law enforcement - we've always been used to help mediate these type of situations. It doesn't matter if it's a golf club or a restaurant or a bar,\" he said. \"With just a slight twist of decision-making one way or another, things might turn out worse.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Citing attacks on police following the 2014 shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown by a white officer, the assessment notes \"it is very likely Black Identity Extremist perceptions of police brutality against African-Americans\" have caused an increase in violence against law enforcement.\n\nIn October, the Congressional Black Caucus sent a letter to FBI director Christopher Wray seeking answers related to the assessment given the Bureau's \"troubling history\" of utilizing its broad investigatory powers to target black citizens.\n\n\"It's the craziest report because it says that because you identify as black you are threat, which is outlandish and offensive and reminiscent of the FBI's COINTELPRO operation, which targeted Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil rights leaders,\" said CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond, in an email to NBC News.\n\nThe 49-member Caucus requested a meeting with the FBI for information about the origins of the assessment and how it will be used. A CBC spokesperson told NBC News the Bureau responded, and the caucus is working with them to schedule a meeting.\n\nWhen asked about the report, a spokesperson for the FBI told NBC News the FBI does not comment on intelligence products.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, the FBI said, in part, \"Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and other criminal acts. Furthermore, the FBI does not and will not police ideology. When an individual takes violent action based on belief or ideology and breaks the law, the FBI will enforce the rule of law.\"\n\nSome in the activist community worry the report might lead to a modern day \"Black List.\"\n\n\"The 'Black Identity Extremists' designation continues a long-standing intelligence community tradition of seeing a national security `boogie man' every time black communities organize in their own interests,\" said Lawrence Grandpre, Director of Research at Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, a grassroots think tank in Baltimore.\n\n\"I know that they are watching us.\"\n\nThe millennial-led group was active in peaceful protests following the April 2015 police custody death of Freddie Gray . Grandpre believes the FBI's designation \"shows the national security establishment's willingness to ignore a more salient threat from white anti-government extremists to chase the manufactured threat of black violent extremism.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter activist, DeRay Mckesson, also had strong feelings about the assessment. The educator joined protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the fatal police shooting of Brown.\n\n\"I know that they are watching us,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI says it only investigates crimes or actions that threaten national security and the agency doesn't launch investigations based on race.\n\nThe assessment does not name current social activism groups or advocacy organizations, but mentions the Black Liberation Army, an underground militant group from the 70's that was behind several police shootings during that era.\n\nMichael German, a former FBI agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program, says \"Black Identity Extremist\" is a new term, but not a novel concept.\n\n\"Basically what they're trying to do is suggest that unconnected acts of violence are somehow part of a larger movement that doesn't actually exist in real form,\" German said. \"Using a term like \"Black Identity Extremist\" and the way they define it could cover a lot of political advocacy groups, and certainly anyone associated with the Black Lives Matter Movement, to suggest these acts of violence are attributed to those movements.\"\n\nOne problem with the report, German said, is that it \"seems to promote this concept that there is a war on the police\" and that those purportedly linked to the so-called \"Black Identity Extremist\" movement are behind it.\n\n\"People attacking police aren't just black, the far-right movement has targeted law enforcement,\" German said. \"It would be a mistake for law enforcement to believe that the threat only comes from one direction.\"\n\nGrandpre said the \"real threat\" of the FBI assessment is that \"the wide spectrum of Black political action and formations can now be more easily demonized by attempts to link activists to a few violent extremists.\" He and others said the real goal of surveillance seems to be deterrence.\n\n\"The Black activist community has been having conversations around government surveillance for a long time and has undoubtedly been under surveillance for years,\" he said. \"The only thing which this really changes is that the threat of government surveillance has been made more public.\"\n\n\"People attacking police aren't just black, the far-right movement has targeted law enforcement.\"\n\nMckesson echoed a similar sentiment. \"I am mindful of safety and trust while knowing that part of their strategy is to make us too afraid to continuing doing the work,\" Mckesson said. \"I've had my phone hacked, have received numerous death threats, and have had the FBI visit my house. I am not deterred.\"\n\nAs tensions and mistrust continue between African-American communities and those sworn to protect them and all Americans, German said the FBI assessment further complicates the situation.\n\n\"This a longstanding problem that affects not just one community, but all communities,\" he said. \"It's important that we don't just let the FBI withdraw this one report, but instead demand more transparency and accountability around the intelligence products the FBI produces.\"\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram\n\nChandelis R.

L'Jean McKneely.\n\nRelated: White Suspect Arrested in Killings of Black Men, Police Say Likely 'Racially Motivated'\n\nEast Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore said his office could seek the death penalty.\n\n\"It appears to be cold, calculated, planned (against) people who were unarmed and defenseless,\" he said. \"We don't need to prove motive. There are a lot of things that are unanswered.\"\n\nNo one was injured when Gleason fired multiple times into the home of a black family in his neighborhood, authorities said. It's not clear if Gleason knew the family.\n\nIn the other shootings, Gleason fired from his car then walked up to the victims as they were lying on the ground and fired again multiple times, police said. Neither victim had any prior relationship with Gleason.\n\nThe first fatal shooting occurred Sept. 12 when 59-year-old Bruce Cofield, who was homeless, was shot to death. The second happened last Thursday night when 49-year-old Donald Smart was gunned down while walking to his job as a dishwasher at a cafe popular with Louisiana State University students.\n\nRelated: Man Questioned About Killings of Black Men is Freed From Jail\n\nPolice initially arrested Gleason over the weekend on drug charges, but he was bailed out of jail late Sunday even though authorities considered him a \"person of interest.\"\n\nThe attacks came at a time when Louisiana's capital already was in the grips of a surge in violence. The number of homicides in East Baton Rouge Parish has already surpassed last year's total of 62, The Advocate newspaper reported earlier this month.\n\n\"Baton Rouge has been through a lot of turmoil in the last year. Has there not been a swift conclusion to this case, I feel confident that this killer probably would have killed again,\" the police chief said. \"He could have potentially created a tear in the fabric that holds this community together.\"\n\nGleason didn't appear to have any active social media profiles. A spokesman at Louisiana State University said a student by that name attended the university from the fall of 2013 to the fall of 2014 before withdrawing. He had transferred to LSU from Baton Rouge Community College.\n\nDuring the search of Gleason's home, authorities also found 9 grams of marijuana and vials of human growth hormone, according to a police document.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

I'm unarmed, he's an autistic guy. He got a toy truck in his hand,'\" Kinsey said, restating what could be heard on the video.\n\nThe shooting itself is not seen in the footage, although at least one of the three officers at the scene did fire, striking Kinsey in the leg.\n\n\"It was like a mosquito bite, and when it hit me, I'm like, I still got my hands in the air, and I said, 'No I just got shot!' And I'm saying, 'Sir, why did you shoot me?'\" Kinsey recalled, \"and his words to me, he said, 'I don't know.'\"\n\nRelated: In Death of Black Men and Police, A Light On Hard Truths\n\nKinsey's attorney, Hilton Napoleon, said his client heard another officer ask why he opened fire.\n\n\"The shooting officer said he didn't know why he shot him,\" Napoleon said, according to NBC Miami .\n\nThe officer who fired his weapon was not identified, but was placed on administrative leave amid an investigation.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday, North Miami Police Chief Gary Eugenedid not detail who was involved or how many shots were fired. He confirmed that no gun was found.\n\n\"At my request, as of yesterday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is taking over this investigation,\" he said. \"The State Attorney's Office is also looking at the case.\"\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch also said Thursday that the Justice Department was familiar with the incident and was working with local officials to gather more information.\n\nThe shooting, while not fatal, is being scrutinized as another example of excessive use of force by police against unarmed black men.\n\n\"There is no justification, heightened alert or not, to shoot an unarmed man laying on the ground with his hands in the air who is telling you that no one has a gun and the person here is autistic,\" Napoleon added.\n\nHe is also outraged that Kinsey was handcuffed and was left on the road until paramedics arrived about 20 minutes later, he said. (A Miami Dade Fire Rescue log says it took about 31 minutes from when the EMS call was received to when paramedics arrived with Kinsey at the hospital.)\n\nKinsey, who works at the MacTown Panther Group Homes, said the man with autism ran away, and he was attempting to calm him when the police encounter unfolded.\n\n\"I was really more worried about him than myself,\" Kinsey told the local affiliate. \"I was thinking as long as I have my hands up ... they're not going to shoot me. This is what I'm thinking, they're not going to shoot me. Wow, was I wrong.\"\n\nAfter the police news conference, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson said the video shows Kinsey being \"rational,\" begging the question why he was still shot.\n\nI am extremely shocked and angered by the shooting of #CharlesKinsey , who was unarmed. Like everyone else I have one question: Why?\n\nKinsey's wife, Joyce, told the local affiliate that her husband is lucky he will be OK.\n\n\"Right now, I am just grateful that he is alive,\" she said, \"and he is able to tell his story.\"\n\nErik Ortiz is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital focusing on racial injustice and social inequality.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "George Floyd: From aspiring rapper to symbol of police violence against black men\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nBefore his name became a rallying cry for Americans fed up with the police killings of unarmed black men, he was an aspiring Houston rapper nicknamed \"Big Floyd\" whose lines were steeped in the lore of his beloved Third Ward neighborhood.\n\nGeorge Floyd was part of an influential hip-hop collective called the Screwed Up Click that emerged in the 1990s with a distinct slowed-down sound that some say moved at the pace of the steamy city on a hot summer night.\n\nHis deep-voiced drawl was featured on at least a dozen mixtapes created by the group's leader, Robert Earl Davis Jr., aka DJ Screw . And always, the focus of Floyd's freestyling was on the things that mattered most to him: hanging with friends, dreaming about making his mark, home.\n\nBut when Floyd died on May 25, beneath the knee of a Minneapolis police officer , he was five years and more than a thousand miles removed from the historic center of African American culture in Houston where he grew up in the Cuney Homes housing project.\n\nAnd when Floyd returns home to Houston on Monday for a public memorial, it will be in a coffin.\n\n\"It's going to be a big deal for our city to bring him home,\" said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo.\n\nHouston may have been home, but Floyd was born 46 years ago in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and moved to Texas as a child. At 6-foot-6, Floyd towered over his classmates at Yates High School, where he was a star tight end and a basketball player.\n\nDonnell Cooper, a former classmate, told The Associated Press that Floyd may have been fearless on the field, but he was reserved off it.\n\n\"Quiet personality but a beautiful spirit,\" Cooper said.\n\nOne of his friends from the neighborhood was former NBA player Stephen Jackson , who nicknamed Floyd \"Twin\" after noticing a resemblance.\n\n\"The first question we asked: 'Who's your daddy, Who's your daddy?' And it went from there,\" he said. \"We always hung together, every time I went to Houston, it was my first stop to pick him up.\"\n\nFloyd attended South Florida Community College (now South Florida State College) for 1993 to 1995 and played on the school's basketball team. But he returned home to Houston before graduating.\n\nA childhood friend, Christopher Harris, convinced Floyd to move to Minneapolis around 2014 and start a new life. They had mutual friends there and Floyd quickly found a job working as a security guard at a downtown Salvation Army store.\n\nLater, Floyd juggled two jobs, as a truck driver and a bouncer at the Conga Latin Bistro .\n\n\"He's more than an employee, he's a close friend,\" bistro co-owner Jovanni Thunstrom said. \"He's like a brother to me.\"\n\nBecause of the pandemic and the economic shutdown, Floyd was out of work the day he died.\n\nThe owner of Minneapolis Cup Foods, a grocery store that Floyd sometimes shopped at, called the police to report that Floyd had used a phony $20 bill.\n\nFloyd \"may not have even known that the bill was counterfeit,\" store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC's Gabe Gutierrez.\n\nFloyd was standing outside the store when the police arrived.\n\nThe most recently released video appears to show that four Minneapolis officers struggled with Floyd in the back of a patrol car before Officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the ground by kneeling on his neck.\n\nState charging documents allege that Chauvin had his knee on George Floyd's neck for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd became nonresponsive, based on law enforcement review of body-worn camera video.\n\nIn total, the complaint says Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, and \"police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous.\"\n\nA witness captured video that went viral on social media, showing Floyd on the pavement pleading with Chauvin.\n\n\"Please, please, please, I can't breathe,\" the man repeatedly said. \"My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I can't breathe.\"\n\nBut Chauvin did not budge .\n\nOutrage over the incident has sparked nationwide protests.\n\nAuthorities in Minnesota said Monday that George Floyd's death was a homicide that occurred while he was being restrained by law enforcement.\n\nThe Hennepin County medical examiner said an autopsy listed Floyd's cause of death on May 25 as \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.\"\n\nPathologists hired by Floyd's family said Monday that they had concluded that he died after blood and air flow was cut off to his brain , causing him to die by mechanical asphyxia.\n\nCiting court records, The Houston Chronicle reported that Floyd had several brushes with the law, starting with a 1997 drug charge in Houston. His last case was an aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon charge in 2007, which resulted in a conviction and a five-year prison sentence.\n\nFloyd's survivors include a 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, who lives in Houston with her mother, Roxie Washington, The Houston Chronicle reported. He also had another daughter from an earlier relationship.\n\n\"He was a gentle giant,\" Washington told the newspaper. \"People mistake him because he was so big that they thought he was always a fighting person, but he was a loving person.... and he loved his daughter.\"\n\nCorky Siemaszko is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Price later died at a hospital.\n\nLucas, 22, was arrested on Monday and remains in jail on a $1 million bond. His attorney, Richard Rogers, said Price did not appear to be an \"uninvolved, innocent party\" when Lucas arrived at the scene and resisted efforts to detain him.\n\n\"Officer Lucas only discharged his weapon in accordance with Texas law when he was confronted with an aggressive assailant who was attempting to take his taser,\" Rogers said in an emailed statement.\n\nWolfe, with a population of 1,500, could become the latest flashpoint in a national uprising over racism and police brutality set off by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\n\n\"We've never had a case like this here in Hunt County,\" Walker told Reuters.\n\nDominique Alexander, president of Next Generation Action Network, a Dallas activist group, said 300 to 400 people attended a vigil on Monday night close to where Price was shot. Dozens of demonstrators also gathered in Los Angeles and New York City, according to media reports.\n\n\"Everyone in this community will echo that this shouldn't have happened to Jonathan, because of the character that he had,\" civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who is representing the Price family, told a news conference on Monday . \"However, this shouldn't happen to anybody and it happens far too often to unarmed Black men, particularly in North Texas.\"\n\nAlexander, who is helping advocate for Price's family, said Wolfe's mayor told the family there is body cam footage, as well as video from the gas station and a nearby fire station.\n\nAlexander said Price had been trying to stop a man from striking a woman when Lucas arrived and mistook him for the instigator. He said Price had been working for the city in a maintenance job and was a pillar of his community and a standout athlete.\n\nOne of Price's friends, former Boston Red Sox infielder Will Middlebrooks, started an online fundraising drive that has so far raised more than $90,000 in donations.\n\n\"Jonathan was a hometown hero. Somebody that everyone knew,\" Alexander said.\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Foster stopped. The pair exchanged words before Foster, who was on community supervision for a car theft conviction a month earlier, fled, eventually ditching the bicycle. McMahon caught up with Foster and jumped on top of him. The two struggled. McMahon, a rookie on the force, used a Taser on the father of two and struck him several times with his department-issued flashlight. Gunfire erupted - seven shots total. When it was over, Foster, 33, lay dying in the bushes in a darkened courtyard near an apartment complex.\n\nSolano County District Attorney Krishna Abrams declined to bring charges against McMahon, who is white, saying the February 2018 fatal shooting of Foster, who was Black and unarmed, was justified. In a Jan. 31, 2020, letter to the Vallejo police chief, Abrams said that Foster \"posed an immediate and extreme threat\" to McMahon and that it was \"objectively reasonable for Officer McMahon to defend himself and open fire on Foster.\"\n\nRonell Foster was fatally shot by Vallejo, Calif., police Officer Ryan McMahon in 2018 after being stopped for riding his bicycle without a light. Foster was unarmed. Foster family hide caption\n\nRonell Foster was fatally shot by Vallejo, Calif., police Officer Ryan McMahon in 2018 after being stopped for riding his bicycle without a light. Foster was unarmed.\n\nA year later, he shot again.\n\nThis time, the slain man was aspiring Black rapper Willie McCoy, who was asleep in his silver Mercedes CLS500 outside a Taco Bell shortly before 11 p.m. on Feb. 9, 2019. An employee called 911 to report that McCoy was slumped over the steering wheel and blocking the drive-through. When McMahon and other officers arrived - six in all - one of them spotted a semiautomatic pistol in McCoy's lap. As McCoy slowly awoke, he moved his hand to scratch his chest, according to a report by an expert the city hired to review the shooting. Officers believed he was reaching for the gun, so they fired 55 shots in 3.5 seconds. McMahon said he fired after believing that the officers and residents were in \"imminent danger.\" Officials cleared him over his role in that killing, too, but he was fired in September 2020 for violating department policy during the shooting \"by engaging in unsafe conduct and neglect for basic firearm safety,\" a department official said.\n\n\"It's a very sad situation,\" McMahon said in a brief interview with NPR. \"It's something I'm still dealing with. It hasn't gone away.\"\n\nThe deadly shootings of unarmed Black men and women by police officers in the U.S. have increasingly garnered worldwide attention over the last few years. The 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., sparked a week of protests that catapulted the Black Lives Matter movement into the national spotlight. Since then, tens of thousands of people across the country have taken to the streets to protest police brutality of Blacks by mostly white officers.\n\nSince 2015, police officers have fatally shot at least 135 unarmed Black men and women nationwide, an NPR investigation has found. NPR reviewed police, court and other records to examine the details of the cases. At least 75% of the officers were white. The latest one happened this month in Killeen, Texas, when Patrick Warren Sr., 52, was fatally shot by an officer responding to a mental health call.\n\nFor at least 15 of the officers, such as McMahon, the shootings were not their first - or their last, NPR found. They have been involved in two - sometimes three or more - shootings, often deadly and without consequences.\n\nThose who study deadly force by police say it's unusual for officers to be involved in any shootings.\n\n\"Many officers will go their entire career without shooting - sometimes without pulling their gun out at all,\" said Peter Scharf, a criminologist and professor in the School of Public Health at Louisiana State University and co-author of The Badge and the Bullet: Police Use of Deadly Force. \"It's rare.\"\n\nNot every law enforcement agency releases detailed information about police shootings. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Kansas City, Mo., Police Department, for example, refused to release specifics such as officer names or their race, citing open investigations.\n\nStill, NPR reviewed thousands of pages of job applications, personnel records, use-of-force reports, citizen complaints, court records, lawsuits, news releases, witness statements and local and state police investigative reports to examine the backgrounds of the officers and analyze details of each shooting. We also interviewed use of force experts, criminologists, police, lawyers, prosecutors and relatives of victims.\n\nAmong NPR's other findings:\n\nNineteen of the officers involved in deadly shootings were rookies, with less than a year on the force. One was on the job for four hours, another for four days. More than a quarter of the killings occurred during traffic stops, and 24 of the dead - 18% - suffered from mental illness. The youngest person shot was a 15-year-old Balch Springs, Texas, high school freshman who played on the football team. The oldest was a 62-year-old man killed in his Los Angeles County home. Nearly 60% of the shootings occurred in the South, with more than a quarter in Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, NPR found.\n\nThe killings have led to at least 30 judgments and settlements totaling more than $142 million, records show. Dozens of lawsuits and claims are pending.\n\nCharmaine Edwards (left) speaks to supporters during a protest outside a courthouse in Dallas in 2017.

Her stepson, Jordan Edwards, was a 15-year-old in Balch Springs, Texas, when he was shot and killed by police.\n\nAn examination of individual cases reveals the myriad ways that law enforcement agencies fail to hold officers accountable and allow them to be in a position to shoot again. In many instances, the criminal justice system refuses to prosecute, often resulting in departments putting officers back on the street instead of desk jobs where they have little contact with the public. Other times, police unions protect officers from accountability. And sometimes, departments are so desperate to recruit officers that they ignore warning signs such as an officer's troubled past and hire them anyway.\n\n\"Why do they get passes on killing people?\" asked Paula McGowan, Foster's mother. \"If the system was right ... they would hold these people accountable.\"\n\n\"Unnecessary and unreasonable\"\n\nNathaniel Pickett II was walking back to his $18-a-night room at the El Rancho, a seen-better-days bungalow motel along historic Route 66 in Barstow, Calif. It was shortly after 9 p.m. on Nov. 19, 2015, and Nate, as his family called him, often took evening walks. As the 29-year-old former engineering student crossed the street, he caught the eye of Kyle Woods, a San Bernardino sheriff's deputy. Woods made a U-turn into the motel parking lot, jumped out of his cruiser and approached Pickett, police records show.\n\nHe demanded Pickett's name and birthdate. Pickett complied. In fact, he did everything Woods asked of him, including taking his hands out of his pockets. When Woods asked him if he lived at the motel and where he was from, Pickett said he didn't know. When Pickett asked if he had done something wrong, the deputy said he just wanted to talk to him.\n\n\"What's the problem?\" Pickett asked Woods nine times as the deputy peppered him with questions about whether he had ever been arrested (yes), if he had lived in Barstow all of his life and where he was going.\n\n\"There is no problem,\" Woods responded.\n\nPickett asked if he could go to his room where he had lived since moving to Barstow seven weeks earlier. Woods would later admit under oath that he knew he had no probable cause to arrest him and that Pickett had the right to walk away. But when he tried, Woods grabbed him and told him to \"stop resisting.\" Woods threatened to use a Taser on him. Pickett put his arms up and was running toward his room - Room 45 - when he tripped and fell in the breezeway. As he scooted backward from Woods, the deputy caught him. The two scuffled while a male citizen volunteer on patrol with Woods watched from a few feet away. Woods punched Pickett 15 to 20 times before pulling out his service weapon and threatening to shoot him. He fired, hitting Pickett twice in the chest - once with the barrel of the gun pressed against the man's chest.\n\nNathaniel Pickett II (right), who suffered from mental illness, was shot to death by a San Bernardino County, Calif., sheriff's deputy in 2015 after he was stopped while walking to a motel where he lived. Pickett was unarmed. His father (left) and mother sued the county and were awarded $33.5 million. Nathaniel Pickett Sr. hide caption\n\nNathaniel Pickett II (right), who suffered from mental illness, was shot to death by a San Bernardino County, Calif., sheriff's deputy in 2015 after he was stopped while walking to a motel where he lived. Pickett was unarmed. His father (left) and mother sued the county and were awarded $33.5 million.\n\n\"Ow,\" Pickett moaned. One of the bullets pierced his heart and left lung. Pickett was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nWoods, on the force for two years at the time but on the street for just a few months, said he shot him because he feared for his life.\n\nWoods, who is Black, didn't give a statement to police about the incident for 28 days. And when he did, he said that he stopped Pickett after seeing him hop the motel fence. He thought Pickett was trespassing, and he was fidgety, like he might be under the influence, Woods said. Pickett had marijuana in his system, and his blood alcohol level was 0.01%, far below the level to be considered legally impaired, records show.\n\nThe deputy never faced criminal charges in Pickett's death, but the victim's family filed civil charges. And when he testified under oath at the civil trial, Woods told a different story: He said he never saw Pickett jump over the fence and that the gate actually was open. He also said it never occurred to him that Pickett could be mentally ill. Pickett was diagnosed with mental illness during his freshman year at Hampton University in Virginia and had been treated through the Mental Health Court in San Bernardino in 2012 after a conviction for resisting a peace officer and \"false personation,\" records show.\n\nScott DeFoe, who spent two decades with the Los Angeles Police Department, testified as an expert witness at the civil trial. He said that Woods' use of force was \"unnecessary and unreasonable.\"\n\n\"This is probably one of the worst cases I have looked at because of the mental health component,\" DeFoe testified. \"There was no crime. ... He ran as he had a lawful right to do.\"\n\nThe jury in the civil trial was unanimous. Jurors agreed that Woods had no right to detain Pickett; used unreasonable or excessive force against him, which caused his death; and delayed getting him medical care. They awarded Pickett's family $33.5 million, one of the largest amounts ever in an officer-involved shooting case.\n\nNathaniel Pickett Sr., 65, said that Nate was the only child he had with Dominic Archibald, a two-time combat veteran and retired Army colonel. After their divorce in 1990 when Nate was not quite 5, the boy went to live with his mom. He became a Boy Scout and fancied Frank Sinatra music, art and sports - except football because he didn't like getting dirty. Archibald eventually enrolled him at the Fork Union Military Academy, an all-boys college preparatory boarding school in Virginia. She agreed to let him transfer in his senior year to Woodrow Wilson High School, a public school in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We just wanted him to be happy,\" Pickett said.\n\nLess than three years after Pickett's death, Woods was involved in a second on-duty shooting of another unarmed man.\n\nMinutes after starting his 7 p.m.-7 a.m. shift on Jan. 14, 2018, Woods noticed the man, Ryan Martinez, driving his black Jeep in Barstow without an illuminated license plate. He activated his lights and siren, and hit the gas. During the pursuit, Martinez lost control of the car and ran off the road into a drainage ditch, police records show. The car flipped. Woods said he ordered Martinez to show his hands. He refused. Woods fired two shots at him but missed. Afraid that Martinez might have a gun, Woods used a Taser on him unsuccessfully before drive-stunning him in his leg. Woods then shot him in the chest and hand when he said the man \"reached for his waistband area.\" Martinez, 27, survived. No gun was found at the scene, according to police records.\n\nWoods was not wearing a body camera. Martinez did not respond to a request through his mother for an interview.\n\n\"He was shot 3\" times, his mother, Kathy Searcy, said in a Facebook message to NPR that included photos of his bullet wounds. \"Plus, he was being tased at the same time.\"\n\nMichael Ramos, the San Bernardino County district attorney at the time of both shootings, declined to charge Woods, saying the deputy was justified in shooting both men. He said in a recent phone interview with NPR that he doesn't remember the cases but said he always adhered to the law when deciding whether to charge an officer with killing someone.\n\nThen-San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael Ramos speaks during a press conference in 2018. In an interview with NPR, Ramos, now a former prosecutor, defended officers, saying that they have an impossible job. Stan Lim/The Press-Enterprise Group via Getty Images hide caption\n\nThen-San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael Ramos speaks during a press conference in 2018. In an interview with NPR, Ramos, now a former prosecutor, defended officers, saying that they have an impossible job.\n\n\"Each case is different,\" said Ramos, who was the district attorney from 2003 to 2018, when he lost his reelection bid for a fifth term. \"But when you apply the facts to the law, that's what you look at.\"\n\nRamos defended officers, saying that they have an impossible job.\n\n\"Taking someone's life is not easy,\" he said. \"It's not something they brag about or high-five each other about. It's the last thing they want to do.\"\n\nWhen asked if officers who kill unarmed people should be taken off the street, Ramos said that decision should remain with the departments.\n\n\"They should be given the resources, counseling and time off, but it's up to the chiefs,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities said that Woods \"reasonably believed he had to use deadly force to protect his own life.\" He was placed on paid administrative leave for at least three days after each shooting, which is routine for officers involved in deadly force, said sheriff's department spokeswoman Jodi Miller.\n\nWoods, 28, could not be reached for comment.\n\nVincent Ewing, the attorney who represented Woods and the county in the Pickett lawsuit, declined to comment on the record.\n\nPickett's father said he remains haunted by his son's killing.\n\n\"It doesn't ease with time,\" he said. \"It still bothers me.\"\n\nThe most difficult time, he said, is when he occasionally sees Woods at the courthouse in Victorville, where the deputy is now assigned.\n\n\"He didn't show no remorse,\" Pickett said. \"If he was remorseful, he would have said, 'Hey, I'm sorry.' \"\n\nLittle accountability\n\nThe decision not to charge Woods is common. Authorities failed to charge officers in more than 80 cases, records show.\n\nOf the officers involved in the deadly shootings of unarmed Black people over the last five years, 13 were charged with murder. Two were found guilty.\n\nThree others charged with murder were acquitted, and one was found not guilty of murder but guilty of aggravated assault, false statements and violation of his oath of office. Seven murder cases are pending.\n\nOf seven officers charged with manslaughter, two were found guilty.\n\nIn 33 shootings, officers were fired or resigned. At least three got their jobs back, and five went on to work for other law enforcement agencies, records show.\n\nPhilip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio and former police officer in Virginia and New Hampshire, said it's difficult to prosecute officers charged with murder or manslaughter from an on-duty shooting because juries often sympathize with them.\n\n\"The courts are very reluctant to second-guess the split-second decisions of police officers in potentially violent street encounters that might be life-or-death situations,\" Stinson said. \"They somehow seem to take everything that's been presented in the case, in the trial, and just disregard the legal standard.\"\n\nRonald C. Machen Jr., the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia for more than five years during the Obama administration, said that prosecuting police officers who gun down unarmed Black men and women will continue to be challenging until there are more \"minorities in the system.\"\n\n\"This is why you need Black prosecutors and Blacks on juries - to hold people accountable,\" Machen said. \"For police officers to have the credibility to do their jobs, they have to be held accountable.\"\n\nOne officer, five shootings\n\nThe decision not to hold officers accountable doesn't rest solely with prosecutors. Police unions often make it all but impossible to remove an officer from the force despite repeated shootings and other infractions.\n\nJerold Blanding was involved in five shootings - two off-duty and three on duty - during his 24-year career with the Detroit Police Department, a review of more than 1,700 pages of agency records shows. One was fatal. He also shot a pigeon and was investigated over assaults on police officers, improper conduct, harassment, excessive use of force, domestic violence and threats. Yet he kept his job.\n\nKnown for having a temper, Blanding started having trouble three years after his March 1994 hiring when he shot a man while off-duty at a Detroit nightclub, police records show. The victim survived. A year later, he was involved in another off-duty, nonfatal shooting at an ATM after a man who was confused mistakenly tried to get into Blanding's car. Blanding was exonerated in both cases.\n\nJerold Blanding was involved in five shootings - two off-duty and three on duty - during his 24-year career with the Detroit Police Department, agency records show. One was fatal. Michigan Department of Corrections hide caption\n\nJerold Blanding was involved in five shootings - two off-duty and three on duty - during his 24-year career with the Detroit Police Department, agency records show. One was fatal.\n\nAn internal affairs investigation in 2001 found that he displayed improper conduct after assaulting a female cop he was dating at the time. In 2002, Blanding was accused of making threats, and a year later, internal affairs launched another investigation - this time, into his excessive use of force. He had a third shooting in 2004 while working in drug enforcement. That man survived.\n\nIn August 2015, Blanding fired 16 shots at a man inside a car during a domestic dispute. The man, DeMar Parker, had gone to the home of his ex-girlfriend, with whom he had a young daughter. An argument erupted, and a Detroit police officer, her son's father, was called. He then called for another officer to meet him at the house. That officer brought along Blanding. When Blanding and the other officer arrived, Parker jumped in his silver Cadillac and sped off. He returned minutes later waving a pistol, police records show. Blanding saw the gun and opened fire on Parker's car, claiming he thought Parker was going to shoot one of the other officers or run him over. The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office declined to bring criminal charges against Blanding, though the department found he violated policy. Parker sued and settled with the city for $97,750, according to the city attorney's office.\n\nIn February 2017, in the backyard of an abandoned home, Blanding, who is Black, fatally shot 19-year-old Raynard Burton.\n\nBlanding and his partner were patrolling a neighborhood of mostly burned-out and boarded-up houses and overgrown lots on Detroit's west side when a green Pontiac Bonneville whizzed past. The car spun out of control and crashed into a building. Burton, the driver, ran. When Blanding eventually caught him, he claimed he saw the teen \"grab at his waist as if he had a weapon,\" records show. Blanding grabbed Burton with one hand while holding his department-issued weapon in the other. The pair struggled, and Blanding shot him once in the chest before yelling for his partner and calling for a supervisor - and his union steward. Burton, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was unarmed.\n\nBlanding was not charged in that case either and returned to his job.\n\n\"I don't think there's an excuse for keeping people like that,\" said Geoffrey Alpert, a police use-of-force expert and criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, after hearing the details of Blanding's case from NPR. \"That's just ridiculous.\"\n\nAlpert said that retaining troubled police officers is risky and \"has enormous consequences.\"\n\n\"The point is you want to get good cops and not fill your coffers with these questionable cops,\" he said. \"Because in the long run, they're going to cost you more money.\"\n\nRichard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said police unions play a major role in shielding officers.\n\n\"The most immediate obstacle is the union contract,\" Rosenfeld said. \"The unions, all in the name of due process, have made it difficult to remove officers whose records indicate they engaged in serious misconduct.\"\n\nIsaiah McKinnon, Detroit's police chief from 1994 to 1998, agreed. He said that city officials and police supervisors involved in negotiating the contracts also are to blame for a department's inability to get rid of officers who repeatedly violate policy.\n\n\"You terminate them and see if they will fight their way back, and most do because of the union contract,\" said McKinnon, who also served as the city's deputy mayor. \"The unions are there to protect officers, but often they're contributing to what the officers are doing.\"\n\nBlanding's troubles continued to mount without consequences, records show. In December 2017, he was accused of being intoxicated on the job and having his gun taken from his lap while he allegedly slept. The weapon was returned \"without further action.\" Two days before Christmas in 2017, he called 911 after a domestic violence incident. He told the dispatcher that he was carrying a gun and to \"send someone before he is back on the news.\"\n\nBut in early 2018, while out on stress leave and ordered not to carry a gun, Blanding showed up at the scene of a pedestrian accident and refused to answer questions about who he was or comply with orders given by other officers, records show. He reeked of alcohol and had slurred speech, one officer said. A preliminary breath test indicated Blanding's blood alcohol content was 0.18%, more than twice the legal limit in Michigan. They found two weapons on him along with his department identification card indicating he had \"no gun status,\" records show. He cursed at officers, called them rookies, was handcuffed and put in the back of a squad car. They arrested him for possession of a weapon while intoxicated and violating the concealed pistol license.\n\nBlanding was charged with eight counts of assaulting, resisting and obstructing, eight counts of felony firearm and three counts of possession of firearms while under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded guilty to one felony count of assaulting, resisting and obstructing. He was fined, given probation and ordered to do community service and attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, according to Chris Gautz, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections. Blanding retired in September 2018 with a full pension, according to a police department spokesman.\n\nWhen reached at his home recently, Blanding, 51, declined a request for an interview.\n\n\"I'm still seeking therapy,\" he said.\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig declined through a spokeswoman to discuss Blanding or why he allowed him to stay on the force after multiple shootings.\n\n\"Unions have got to understand that they can't continue to have people over and over again who are doing these things continue to be police officers,\" said McKinnon, the former chief.\n\n\"He just wasn't the best pick\"\n\nZechariah Presley wanted to be a police officer because it offered him a chance at a career where he could \"make a difference.\" So, in May 2016, he applied to the St. Marys Police Department, a 32-member force in a town of 18,500 residents in southeastern Georgia, not far from the Florida state line.\n\nOfficials found that he \"did not respond truthfully\" to several questions during a truth verification exam and did poorly during candidate interviews, internal reports show. Department officials rejected him, saying he was \"not a good candidate\" and \"very weak.\" He also acknowledged he lost a conditional job offer with a law enforcement agency in Texas after making a \"sexual innuendo,\" records show.\n\n\"He just wasn't the best pick,\" Timothy Hatch, who was St. Marys police chief at the time, said in an interview with NPR. \"He didn't come across in our interview process as someone who needed to be behind the badge.\"\n\nPresley went 8 miles to the next town over and applied at the 40-member Kingsland Police Department a year later. He acknowledged on his background questionnaire of being involved in domestic violence, assault, buying or selling drugs, and other incidents. An internal report found Presley had 10 red flags and recommended officials review them before deciding whether to hire him.\n\nThey hired Presley anyway in July 2017.\n\nWithin months, residents filed complaints about him.\n\nIn a complaint, one 43-year-old Black man wrote that one day after he'd complained to the chief about the officer's conduct, Presley came and parked in front of his house. \"I'm living in fear of my life,\" the man wrote, because of the abuse of power and constant harassment on traffic stops.\n\nFormer Kingsland, Ga., police Officer Zechariah Presley was found not guilty of manslaughter in the 2018 shooting death of Anthony Green, who was Black and unarmed. The officer was hired on the force despite numerous red flags, including a rejection from another police department in a neighboring town. Kingsland, Ga., Police Department via AP hide caption\n\nFormer Kingsland, Ga., police Officer Zechariah Presley was found not guilty of manslaughter in the 2018 shooting death of Anthony Green, who was Black and unarmed. The officer was hired on the force despite numerous red flags, including a rejection from another police department in a neighboring town.\n\nA Black female resident wrote that Presley followed her for about a mile and then stopped her for failing to use a turn signal when she changed lanes. She alleged that Presley racially profiled her. Presley is white.\n\nPresley had seven use-of-force incidents in six months, three involving Tasers, records show. He once used a stun gun on a substitute teacher at the county Board of Education office. He was investigated internally twice within two days for misconduct. He received departmental warnings about violating policies and was suspended without pay for a day.\n\nYet he stayed on the force.\n\nWhile on patrol one night in June 2018, Presley pulled into a convenience store parking lot and spotted a white Chrysler Pacifica and a man he recognized, Anthony Green. The two had a previous run-in, and he knew Green didn't have a valid license. As Green drove off, Presley followed him. Green ran his car onto the shoulder, prompting Presley to activate his blue lights. Green and a passenger jumped out and ran, but Green left his phone and went back to retrieve it, law enforcement records show. He took off running with Presley in tow, who unsuccessfully used a Taser on Green. When Green pushed him, Presley fired eight shots from his .40-caliber Glock, striking the 33-year-old Black man at least five times, including in his chest and back, according to records from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which handled the case. Green died at the scene.\n\nPresley was charged with voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and fired from the department. A jury of 11 whites and one Hispanic found him not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of violating the oath of public office in October 2019. A judge sentenced him to one year in prison and four years' probation, and ordered him to pay a $1,500 fine. Presley was released in May after serving seven months in prison.\n\nPresley, 29, did not return phone calls seeking comment.\n\n\"The hiring of Zechariah Presley probably would not have taken place in my administration given the information I have,\" said Kingsland Police Chief Robert Jones, who took over the department in 2019.\n\nTony White holds a sign showing a photo of his slain cousin, Anthony Green, outside Kingsland City Hall in the southeastern Georgia town.

Authorities say Green was fatally shot in 2018, while he fled Presley, then a Kingsland police officer.\n\nJones and others acknowledged that departments often hire officers such as Presley because they're desperate to recruit and are willing to ignore red flags.\n\n\"We need bodies,\" Jones said. \"Some places have been willing to lower the standards and bring bodies in, and it's a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nRosenfeld, the criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said that departments, mostly small ones that lack resources, are \"more willing to look past misdeeds.\"\n\n\"Small departments that are strapped for officers take them where they can find them,\" he said.\n\nGreen's death has prompted changes in the Kingsland department, including mental health treatment for officers and a hiring board to review candidates, Jones said.\n\n\"It's more important for us to move forward, train properly and to show that the stigma of what happened with Presley will not be tolerated,\" he said.\n\nLaMaurice Gardner, a police psychologist in Detroit, said the toll that one shooting - or more - takes on a police officer can be devastating.\n\n\"People don't realize the psychological effects a shooting takes on an officer and their family,\" said Gardner, who has worked as a reserve officer for 26 years in suburban Detroit. \"You're investigated like you're a perpetrator. You can't work on the street. You can't get overtime. Your peer support is pulled away.\"\n\nGardner acknowledged that departments face difficult issues now with police shootings, including of unarmed Black men and women.\n\n\"Are there bad cops out there? Hell, yeah, there are,\" he said. \"Policies need to be changed.\"\n\nNPR's Emine Yücel contributed to this report.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Thompson\n\nAn NPR investigation found that police have shot and killed 135 unarmed Black people since 2015 - with some officers involved in more than one shooting.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: An NPR investigation has found that police killed 135 unarmed Black men and women since 2015. And for at least 15 officers, the shooting was not their first or last. All this in the years since the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., galvanized nationwide protests against police brutality toward Black people. Cheryl W. Thompson, of NPR's investigations unit, is here to talk about her findings. Hi, Cheryl. CHERYL W THOMPSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: Beyond the top-line findings that I just described, what else did you learn and what patterns were you able to find in the data that you collected? THOMPSON: So I - some of the things I found - I looked at, like, the race of officers, how long they had been on the force, how these people were killed and what kind - in what instance and whether they were mentally ill or suffered from mental illness. And what I found was that 75% of the officers who shot were white and 19 of them were rookies with less than a year on the force. One actually was on the job for four hours before he fatally shot someone and another for four days and a third for a week. And then traffic stops, I found, were really - about a quarter of the people killed were killed during traffic stops. And about 18%, which is 24 or so people, of the victims suffered from mental illness. SHAPIRO: Wow. Where did you get this data and how did you go about collecting it? THOMPSON: It's like pulling teeth sometimes. But I filed lots of Freedom of Information Act request, right? But so the information came from thousands of pages of police reports and personnel records and use-of-force documents and police investigative files and court testimony and other court records. And also, I watched countless police dashcam and other kinds of videos. SHAPIRO: Now, I mentioned that for several of these officers, they had more than one shooting. Explain how that happens. I mean, many police officers will never fire their weapon in their entire career. How does somebody shoot an unarmed person more than once? THOMPSON: You know, Ari, it is unusual for officers to shoot, but it happens. And it happens - you know, if someone shoots and they're not disciplined, they're not prosecuted or they're not - you know, no action is taken against them and they're put back on the street, that gives - they're put back in a position to do it again. But a vast majority of the police officers go their entire careers without shooting. SHAPIRO: You mentioned discipline and prosecution. Were there efforts to hold these officers accountable? THOMPSON: There are some efforts. But in terms of being convicted, rarely. I found - I did find, like, 33 officers got fired or resigned, but at least three of them fought to get their jobs back and were successful. And then five others went on to work for other law enforcement agencies. In terms of officers being charged with murder, 13 were charged with murder, two were found guilty, three were acquitted, one was found not guilty of murder, but of a lesser charge and then seven murder cases are pending.

SHAPIRO: Beyond the top-line findings that I just described, what else did you learn and what patterns were you able to find in the data that you collected? THOMPSON: So I - some of the things I found - I looked at, like, the race of officers, how long they had been on the force, how these people were killed and what kind - in what instance and whether they were mentally ill or suffered from mental illness. And what I found was that 75% of the officers who shot were white and 19 of them were rookies with less than a year on the force. One actually was on the job for four hours before he fatally shot someone and another for four days and a third for a week. And then traffic stops, I found, were really - about a quarter of the people killed were killed during traffic stops. And about 18%, which is 24 or so people, of the victims suffered from mental illness. SHAPIRO: Wow. Where did you get this data and how did you go about collecting it? THOMPSON: It's like pulling teeth sometimes. But I filed lots of Freedom of Information Act request, right? But so the information came from thousands of pages of police reports and personnel records and use-of-force documents and police investigative files and court testimony and other court records. And also, I watched countless police dashcam and other kinds of videos. SHAPIRO: Now, I mentioned that for several of these officers, they had more than one shooting. Explain how that happens. I mean, many police officers will never fire their weapon in their entire career. How does somebody shoot an unarmed person more than once? THOMPSON: You know, Ari, it is unusual for officers to shoot, but it happens. And it happens - you know, if someone shoots and they're not disciplined, they're not prosecuted or they're not - you know, no action is taken against them and they're put back on the street, that gives - they're put back in a position to do it again. But a vast majority of the police officers go their entire careers without shooting. SHAPIRO: You mentioned discipline and prosecution. Were there efforts to hold these officers accountable? THOMPSON: There are some efforts. But in terms of being convicted, rarely. I found - I did find, like, 33 officers got fired or resigned, but at least three of them fought to get their jobs back and were successful. And then five others went on to work for other law enforcement agencies. In terms of officers being charged with murder, 13 were charged with murder, two were found guilty, three were acquitted, one was found not guilty of murder, but of a lesser charge and then seven murder cases are pending.

NPR's Michel Martin talks with study co-author Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now we're going to talk about a subject that has become one of this country's flashpoints - police shootings of unarmed black men. It happened again last Tuesday in Pittsburgh, where Antwon Rose Jr. was shot three times as he ran away from police during a traffic stop. A neighbor caught it all on camera. The video was widely shared and inspired three straight days of protests in Pittsburgh. But the negative effects of that shooting won't end whenever the demonstrations stop or the reporting ends - this according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal. That study looked specifically at states that had a police killing of an unarmed black man in the three months leading up to the survey. And it found that these violent encounters have a direct effect on the mental health of black Americans living in communities that have experienced police violence. The telephone survey asked respondents how many days their mental health was not good. Black respondents in states with recent police shootings were found to have significantly more of those not good days. Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani is one of the study's authors. He's an assistant professor in medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. He joined me from member station WBUR in Boston, and I started our conversation by asking him why he and his fellow researchers wanted to look into the link between police killings and mental health. ATHEENDAR VENKATARAMANI: My co-authors and I were very struck by the images of police killings of unarmed black Americans, and we had seen in some small, local studies, as well as through our social networks and on social media, the kinds of things that black Americans who weren't directly part of the event but had heard about it or read about it or seen it through the videos that were released - the kinds of things they were saying about how they felt - what it made them feel and what their mental state was after viewing or hearing about such an event. And for us, it made us wonder do events like this cross the line from just being upsetting to being something that make us sick? And that's what really motivated our study. MARTIN: The facts are that black Americans, as you point out in the study, are nearly three times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police. They are five times more likely than are white Americans to be killed unarmed. I just think that's important to point out because it's important to note that white Americans are also killed by the police, but it is far more likely that an African-American male particularly will be unarmed when that occurs. So part of the reason that I raised that is to ask whether you saw any similar effects of other groups? Like, did, for example, killings of white Americans stimulate a similar effect? Do we have any comparison that we can draw upon? VENKATARAMANI: Absolutely. So we looked at the police killings of armed black Americans and the police killings of unarmed white Americans, which don't necessarily have that same kind of salience to people as far as their relationship to structural racism. And when we looked at the impacts of those kinds of events, we didn't find any impact on mental health nor did we find any impact on mental health of white Americans who were exposed to police killings of unarmed black Americans. MARTIN: And you know, the survey focused on people and communities where these shootings occurred. But we live in a time when many of these deaths were caught on camera. They've been widely shared. Do you feel comfortable extrapolating that this effect may be broader than the people who actually lived in the places where these incidents occurred? VENKATARAMANI: Yeah, I think we do. And so for example, Eric Garner's killing was seen by everybody in the country. And for the purposes of our statistical design, we considered people in New York State exposed. So one of the things we think is striking is that we find these large population-level effects even when we know that we are likely to be underestimating the true burden. MARTIN: The summary says that, you know, the interpretation is that, you know, police killings of unarmed black Americans have adverse effects on mental health among black American adults and the general population. And it suggests that programs should be implemented to decrease the frequency of police killings and to mitigate adverse mental health effects. What would that look like? I mean, what do you hope people will do as a result of this study which validates what, frankly, has been sort of widely discussed informally among many people for some time? VENKATARAMANI: We don't believe we're telling people in the black American communities something that they don't know. I think what this study does is provides a public health rationale to further try to understand why police killings occur of unarmed black Americans. And it further motivates policies and programs that would try to reduce those events. And from the clinical side, as a physician, these events really kind of show you that when something happens in a community that there is a trauma that is a pathology, meaning it's a true illness, and that health systems - community health centers, public health organizations - can try to rally around people to make sure that people are OK and that we're treating the burden of disease that's there. So I think that's why it's useful to put numbers around something that many people have noted anecdotally because it sharpens the case for action, and it also lets us know the scope of the problem and potentially how we would need to address it. MARTIN: That's Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani. He's one of the authors of a study published in The Lancet which looked at the mental health effects of police shootings on black Americans. Thanks so much for speaking with us. VENKATARAMANI: Thank you. MARTIN: I also want to mention that the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

And when we looked at the impacts of those kinds of events, we didn't find any impact on mental health nor did we find any impact on mental health of white Americans who were exposed to police killings of unarmed black Americans. MARTIN: And you know, the survey focused on people and communities where these shootings occurred. But we live in a time when many of these deaths were caught on camera. They've been widely shared. Do you feel comfortable extrapolating that this effect may be broader than the people who actually lived in the places where these incidents occurred? VENKATARAMANI: Yeah, I think we do. And so for example, Eric Garner's killing was seen by everybody in the country. And for the purposes of our statistical design, we considered people in New York State exposed. So one of the things we think is striking is that we find these large population-level effects even when we know that we are likely to be underestimating the true burden. MARTIN: The summary says that, you know, the interpretation is that, you know, police killings of unarmed black Americans have adverse effects on mental health among black American adults and the general population. And it suggests that programs should be implemented to decrease the frequency of police killings and to mitigate adverse mental health effects. What would that look like? I mean, what do you hope people will do as a result of this study which validates what, frankly, has been sort of widely discussed informally among many people for some time? VENKATARAMANI: We don't believe we're telling people in the black American communities something that they don't know. I think what this study does is provides a public health rationale to further try to understand why police killings occur of unarmed black Americans. And it further motivates policies and programs that would try to reduce those events. And from the clinical side, as a physician, these events really kind of show you that when something happens in a community that there is a trauma that is a pathology, meaning it's a true illness, and that health systems - community health centers, public health organizations - can try to rally around people to make sure that people are OK and that we're treating the burden of disease that's there. So I think that's why it's useful to put numbers around something that many people have noted anecdotally because it sharpens the case for action, and it also lets us know the scope of the problem and potentially how we would need to address it. MARTIN: That's Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani. He's one of the authors of a study published in The Lancet which looked at the mental health effects of police shootings on black Americans. Thanks so much for speaking with us. VENKATARAMANI: Thank you. MARTIN: I also want to mention that the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

That study looked specifically at states that had a police killing of an unarmed black man in the three months leading up to the survey. And it found that these violent encounters have a direct effect on the mental health of black Americans living in communities that have experienced police violence. The telephone survey asked respondents how many days their mental health was not good. Black respondents in states with recent police shootings were found to have significantly more of those not good days. Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani is one of the study's authors. He's an assistant professor in medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. He joined me from member station WBUR in Boston, and I started our conversation by asking him why he and his fellow researchers wanted to look into the link between police killings and mental health. ATHEENDAR VENKATARAMANI: My co-authors and I were very struck by the images of police killings of unarmed black Americans, and we had seen in some small, local studies, as well as through our social networks and on social media, the kinds of things that black Americans who weren't directly part of the event but had heard about it or read about it or seen it through the videos that were released - the kinds of things they were saying about how they felt - what it made them feel and what their mental state was after viewing or hearing about such an event. And for us, it made us wonder do events like this cross the line from just being upsetting to being something that make us sick? And that's what really motivated our study. MARTIN: The facts are that black Americans, as you point out in the study, are nearly three times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police. They are five times more likely than are white Americans to be killed unarmed. I just think that's important to point out because it's important to note that white Americans are also killed by the police, but it is far more likely that an African-American male particularly will be unarmed when that occurs. So part of the reason that I raised that is to ask whether you saw any similar effects of other groups? Like, did, for example, killings of white Americans stimulate a similar effect? Do we have any comparison that we can draw upon? VENKATARAMANI: Absolutely. So we looked at the police killings of armed black Americans and the police killings of unarmed white Americans, which don't necessarily have that same kind of salience to people as far as their relationship to structural racism. And when we looked at the impacts of those kinds of events, we didn't find any impact on mental health nor did we find any impact on mental health of white Americans who were exposed to police killings of unarmed black Americans.

And from the clinical side, as a physician, these events really kind of show you that when something happens in a community that there is a trauma that is a pathology, meaning it's a true illness, and that health systems - community health centers, public health organizations - can try to rally around people to make sure that people are OK and that we're treating the burden of disease that's there. So I think that's why it's useful to put numbers around something that many people have noted anecdotally because it sharpens the case for action, and it also lets us know the scope of the problem and potentially how we would need to address it. MARTIN: That's Dr. Atheendar Venkataramani. He's one of the authors of a study published in The Lancet which looked at the mental health effects of police shootings on black Americans. Thanks so much for speaking with us. VENKATARAMANI: Thank you. MARTIN: I also want to mention that the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nSo part of the reason that I raised that is to ask whether you saw any similar effects of other groups? Like, did, for example, killings of white Americans stimulate a similar effect? Do we have any comparison that we can draw upon? VENKATARAMANI: Absolutely. So we looked at the police killings of armed black Americans and the police killings of unarmed white Americans, which don't necessarily have that same kind of salience to people as far as their relationship to structural racism. And when we looked at the impacts of those kinds of events, we didn't find any impact on mental health nor did we find any impact on mental health of white Americans who were exposed to police killings of unarmed black Americans. MARTIN: And you know, the survey focused on people and communities where these shootings occurred. But we live in a time when many of these deaths were caught on camera. They've been widely shared. Do you feel comfortable extrapolating that this effect may be broader than the people who actually lived in the places where these incidents occurred? VENKATARAMANI: Yeah, I think we do. And so for example, Eric Garner's killing was seen by everybody in the country. And for the purposes of our statistical design, we considered people in New York State exposed. So one of the things we think is striking is that we find these large population-level effects even when we know that we are likely to be underestimating the true burden. MARTIN: The summary says that, you know, the interpretation is that, you know, police killings of unarmed black Americans have adverse effects on mental health among black American adults and the general population. And it suggests that programs should be implemented to decrease the frequency of police killings and to mitigate adverse mental health effects. What would that look like? I mean, what do you hope people will do as a result of this study which validates what, frankly, has been sort of widely discussed informally among many people for some time? VENKATARAMANI: We don't believe we're telling people in the black American communities something that they don't know.

Hansi Lo Wang/NPR hide caption\n\nLauren Lattimore (left), Wi-Moto Nyoka, Edmund Alyn Jones and Courtney Harge rehearse a scene from Blue-Eyed Black Boy , a play about lynching that was written around 1930.\n\nAn obscure but riveting genre of theater is being revived in New York City.\n\nThey're called \"anti-lynching plays.\" Most were written by black playwrights during the early 1900s to show how lynchings devastated African-American families.\n\nInspired by the recent deaths of unarmed black men by police , a theater company in Brooklyn, N.Y., is staging a series of new readings of these plays , including Georgia Douglas Johnson's Blue-Eyed Black Boy.\n\n\"I think the revival of these plays that happen a long time ago give us enough distance to say, 'Oh, wait a minute! That looks a lot like what's happening right now.' \"\n\nEdmund Alyn Jones, actor in 'Blue-Eyed Black Boy'\n\n\"It's not a play where we re-enact a lynching. The focus is not the gory details,\" says Wi-Moto Nyoka, an actress featured in the readings. \"This is a human take on our shared history.\"\n\nLynchings were a common part of Southern life when these one-act plays were written. Magazines for the black community often published them so they could be performed in churches and schools or read aloud in homes, according to Koritha Mitchell, an English literature professor at Ohio State University who wrote about the plays in Living with Lynching .\n\n\"These plays were interested in saying, 'Well, we're being told every day that we are hunted because we're a race of criminals, but in fact, the real reason that our neighbor was lynched was because he had land that whites wanted to take,' \" Mitchell explains.\n\nShe adds that white mobs also targeted African-Americans with successful businesses or families.\n\n\"Being able to tell the truth about why communities are under siege was a really important counterpoint to a society that's always telling you that you deserve whatever you get,\" Mitchell says.\n\nIn Blue-Eyed Black Boy , Lattimore, Nyoka and Jones play characters who try to stop the lynching of a young black man, after he's put in jail for brushing up against a white woman on the street. Hansi Lo Wang/NPR hide caption\n\nIn Blue-Eyed Black Boy , Lattimore, Nyoka and Jones play characters who try to stop the lynching of a young black man, after he's put in jail for brushing up against a white woman on the street.\n\nEdmund Alyn Jones, an actor in Blue-Eyed Black Boy , says he hopes modern-day audiences who come to the readings will get a better sense of both history and current events.\n\n\"I think the revival of these plays that happen a long time ago give us enough distance to say, 'Oh! That's awful! Oh, wait a minute! That looks a lot like what's happening right now. Oh! I see,' \" he says.\n\nIn Blue-Eyed Black Boy , a young black man is thrown in jail for brushing up against a white woman on the street - a theme Jones says he sees playing out today.\n\n\"A young man now, if he's dressed a certain way or he's in a neighborhood that he doesn't belong in - that is the modern-day equivalent of bumping into that white lady,\" he says.\n\nWalter Scott, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and other unarmed black men killed by police have been on the mind of Courtney Harge as she has prepared to direct this series of monthly play readings, which began in February. She says she sees parallels between the recent killings and the lynching of thousands of African-Americans after the Civil War .\n\n\"Someday you encounter the wrong person, and your life is over. And that kind of idea feels very relevant to the world we, particularly as black people, are living in,\" says Harge, who also serves as the artistic director of Colloquy Collective, a theater company.\n\nAfter Sunday's reading of Blue-Eyed Black Boy at JACK, a Brooklyn community arts center, rehearsals will begin for the next play in the series, Johnson's Safe , which is scheduled for May. It's about an African-American woman who makes a tragic choice after giving birth to a baby boy. Just before he's born, she sees a young black man being lynched outside her home.\n\n\"[She] asks herself, 'How do I bring a child into this world and try to keep them safe when they're looked at as threats just by existing?' \" Harge explains. \"'Is it cruel in some way to bring a child into this world that way?' And it's an answer I don't have.\"\n\nBut they're questions in a play written around 1929 that, Harge says, are just as pressing almost 90 years later.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

The original police report claimed Floyd resisted arrest.\n\nFour Minneapolis Police Department officers involved in Floyd's death have been fired, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced Tuesday night. An FBI investigation is now underway.\n\nFrey also referenced a widely circulated video showing the aftermath of the arrest where an officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the ground. In the 10-minute video, Floyd, who is handcuffed and on his chest, repeatedly begs for relief and cries out, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nHis weeps of \"I can't breathe\" echo the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was also videotaped gasping for air and yelling \"I can't breathe\" as NYPD police officer Daniel Pantaleo held him in an illegal chokehold.\n\nEmerald Garner, Eric Garner's youngest daughter, didn't watch the video of her father's death for years. She says she's seen still frames from the Floyd video - eerily similar to her dad's - but hasn't watched the footage.\n\n\"I know that Mr. Floyd's family is devastated right now,\" she says. \"And I just know that they're gonna be going through a hard time right now.\"\n\nShe's \"sure\" the officers involved have witnessed the video Garner gasping for air.\n\n\"Obviously 500 pounds of pressure on somebody is the problem,\" she says. \"The medical examiner stated that my father's neck was crushed. I'm pretty sure that when the medical examiner comes out with his report for George Floyd, it will be the same exact cause of death.\"\n\nShe says she's \"happy\" that the mayor fired the officers within 24 hours of Floyd's death, but even one day was \"too long.\"\n\nSimilar to her father's case in New York, the Floyd family is calling for the Minneapolis officers to be charged with murder.\n\n\"They treated him worse than they treat animals,\" Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd told CNN on Tuesday. \"They took a life - they deserve life. I don't feel sorry for them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs protesters take to the streets and anger mounts, Emerald Garner says she feels for the Floyd family.\n\n\"There's nothing that you can really say to anybody to help them navigate this,\" she says. \"There are going to be days where they don't even want to get out of bed.\"\n\nMarcelle Hutchins produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Peter O'Dowd .

I'm Rachel Martin. Protesters filled the streets in Washington, D.C. yesterday to speak out against the police killings of unarmed black men. Gene Demby of NPR's Code Switch team was on the ground in the nation's capital. And he says that there was a clear and sometimes contentious generational divide among the protesters. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: The activism that galvanized this movement online and in real life has been spearheaded by young people. So it didn't go unnoticed that many of the people on the stages at Saturday's march were decidedly not young. That rally was organized by Al Sharpton's National Action Network, so he was the nominal leader. But Sharpton's marching days started decades ago. And that was true of most of the other speakers on the podium. But the new generation of activists didn't wait for the old guard to pass the mic. They were ready to take it. At one point some young protesters from Ferguson bumrushed the stage. After the official organizers cut their mics, chants of let them speak rose up from pockets of the crowd competing with other chants of get off the stage. Official organizers tried to retake control cautioning the young people to show the proper respect to the families of the slain victims. But that didn't fly with Johnetta Elzie, a young protester from Ferguson. JOHNETTA ELZIE: This movement was started by the young people. We started this. It should be young people all over this stage. It should be young people all up here. DEMBY: This nascent movement has been compared to the Civil Rights Movement, often unfavorably, by people who remember the Weekly Reader version of that struggle. In the retelling, the Civil Rights Movement has become a noble, nonviolent consensus. Of course, that was never true. In fact, the Civil Rights Movement was marked by fierce debates over tactics and turf and who would be the face of those campaigns. In many ways, that too was a young people's movement. But that movement had discrete policy goals, like the Civil Rights Act, while Saturday's rallies mostly avoided any specific calls to action. That could be in large part because many of the problems the protesters say they're trying to address don't have obvious policy fixes. The Federal Government mandated desegregation of the 1960s. But what can the Federal Government do about ingrained, systemic and unconscious biased - the kind that makes people see unarmed black men as inherently dangerous? It's a dilemma that's deeply rooted that no generation of activists has been able to figure out yet. Gene Demby, NPR News. Copyright © 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That rally was organized by Al Sharpton's National Action Network, so he was the nominal leader. But Sharpton's marching days started decades ago. And that was true of most of the other speakers on the podium. But the new generation of activists didn't wait for the old guard to pass the mic. They were ready to take it. At one point some young protesters from Ferguson bumrushed the stage. After the official organizers cut their mics, chants of let them speak rose up from pockets of the crowd competing with other chants of get off the stage. Official organizers tried to retake control cautioning the young people to show the proper respect to the families of the slain victims. But that didn't fly with Johnetta Elzie, a young protester from Ferguson. JOHNETTA ELZIE: This movement was started by the young people. We started this. It should be young people all over this stage. It should be young people all up here. DEMBY: This nascent movement has been compared to the Civil Rights Movement, often unfavorably, by people who remember the Weekly Reader version of that struggle. In the retelling, the Civil Rights Movement has become a noble, nonviolent consensus. Of course, that was never true. In fact, the Civil Rights Movement was marked by fierce debates over tactics and turf and who would be the face of those campaigns. In many ways, that too was a young people's movement. But that movement had discrete policy goals, like the Civil Rights Act, while Saturday's rallies mostly avoided any specific calls to action. That could be in large part because many of the problems the protesters say they're trying to address don't have obvious policy fixes. The Federal Government mandated desegregation of the 1960s. But what can the Federal Government do about ingrained, systemic and unconscious biased - the kind that makes people see unarmed black men as inherently dangerous? It's a dilemma that's deeply rooted that no generation of activists has been able to figure out yet. Gene Demby, NPR News. Copyright © 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

      "text": "Running While Black: Ahmaud Arbery's Death Highlights Shared Fears Of Racial Profiling\n\nAdvertisement\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"124\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://player.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/05/11/running-while-black-ahmaud-arbery\"></iframe>\n\nLast week, two men were charged with the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed in February while on a run in his hometown of Brunswick, Georgia. He was unarmed at the time.\n\nArbery's death has united runners across the country who took to the streets for virtual runs on what would have been Arbery's 26th birthday last Friday. Taking selfies and posting messages on social media using the #IRunWithMaud, runners and activists alike used the moment to protest Arbery's death.\n\nHis killing is also prompting black runners to reflect on fears of being attacked or racially profiled while running.\n\nJames Ravenell II is one of those runners. Co-founder of Black Runners Connection , Ravenell says the run for Arbery last Friday was \"painful.\"\n\n\"It's a big deal for African American men to make it to age 25, and it's kind of like, 'Wow, I finally made it,' \" he says. \"And then for him to be struck down that way, it's sad. It's angering. And it's really exhausting that this keeps happening to us.\"\n\nRavenell, who has been running for six years, says he has to make constant adjustments when going for a run as a black man. Sometimes he says he will even run in the street or cross to the other side \"to avoid even making anyone feel uncomfortable by my presence.\"\n\n\"I know, unfortunately, that my blackness represents a threat to many people, so ... sometimes as runners, we may come up on someone very quickly, but we don't have the benefit of people thinking that we're just doing a normal thing. Sometimes I will make noise to let someone know that I'm coming,\" Ravenell says. \"I can't really remember a time where I was not thinking about myself as a potential threat in the minds of other people.\"\n\nFor many, the act of running transcends exercise. Ravenell says running is his \"meditation,\" but especially since Arbery's murder, \"it feels like we can't even do that.\"\n\n\"We are all exhausted. We just want to live. We're not thinking about doing anything to anyone,\" he says. \"Our blackness, it's not a threat to anyone, but here we are again and again and again.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the spate of recent shootings of unarmed black men, Ravenell says Arbery's death feels particularly personal for him. He says this has inspired him, along with Black Runners Connection, to mobilize people to create tangible change for black Americans.\n\n\"We should not have to live in fear and we won't,\" he says. \"We're not going to tuck our tails and run because people cannot find a rationale on their side to not be afraid of us for nothing.\"\n\nCristina Kim produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Tinku Ray . Samantha Raphelson adapted it for the web.\n\nThis segment aired on May 11, 2020.\n\nTonya Mosley was the LA-based co-host of Here & Now.\n\nSamantha Raphelson is an associate producer for Here & Now, based at NPR in Washington, D.C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "How Policing Has Changed For 3 Generations Of Black Police Officers\n\nBy\n\nDenise Guerra\n\n,\n\nMichel Martin\n\nFor three generations, members of the White family have served as police officers in the Indianapolis Police Department. Pictured are Clarence Sr. (from left), Clarence Jr., Rodney Sr., Keith, LeEtta, Rodney Jr., Christopher and Thomas White. Courtesy of the White Family hide caption\n\nFor three generations, members of the White family have served as police officers in the Indianapolis Police Department. Pictured are Clarence Sr. (from left), Clarence Jr., Rodney Sr., Keith, LeEtta, Rodney Jr., Christopher and Thomas White.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Clarence White was a rookie policeman with the Indianapolis Police Department, and being African-American, there were rules he needed to follow. He says the department had a gentleman's agreement where black cops could not arrest white people.\n\nWhite is the patriarch of three generations of African-American police officers in the Indianapolis Police Department. It was a career he initially did not want.\n\nWhen officers Clarence White Sr. (left) and Albert Finnell joined the Indianapolis Police Department in the 1950s, they had to ride in either Car 27, or Car 29, which told the public African-American officers were in those cars. Courtesy of the White Family hide caption\n\n\"I was sort of forced into this,\" says White. \"I tried to join the fire department three times, turned down three times because they said I didn't pass the test.\"\n\nWhite credits his persistent uncle, who was already on the police force, for getting him to take the police exam. White said it was the same questions as the fire department test. He passed with a 99 percent.\n\nDuring that time, White was only allowed to ride in two police cars - Car 27 and Car 29. Those numbers let the public know African-American police officers were inside.\n\nThe Indianapolis department had African-American police officers dating back to the 1890s, but White, now 90, was part of the first generation of African-Americans to make rank. He ascended to captain before retiring in 1974.\n\nDespite his role in desegregating the department, he made every effort to keep his sons from following in his footsteps. In the mornings, he says he would throw on an overcoat to keep his sons from seeing his police uniform.\n\nBut when his oldest son, Clarence White Jr., now 66, joined the force in 1975, his father kept his reservations to himself.\n\nWhite Jr., said he started his career on the force during the end of the hippie revolution, when police officers were not well-liked. Public opinion grew worse when the department became embroiled in national scandals involving excessive use of force and the shootings of unarmed black men.\n\nToday, White Jr., thinks police shootings of unarmed black people continues, in part, because of racism in the department.\n\n\"I've been involved in a situation where a white officer ... I felt his big issue in working in the community was his dislike of black people. It exists. It will always exist and is something that we have to continually work toward making better,\" he says.\n\nHis nephew Rodney White, 41, also says it will take some work, but these issues can be fixed.\n\nRodney is still active in the Indianapolis Police Department. Growing up, he was surrounded by police officers, including his mother and father.\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with police shootings of unarmed black people. He said it will require more training, and a focus on recruiting more officers from the community.\n\n\"If you don't grow up in a specific location, and you're not used to dealing with the African-American culture and some of the mannerisms and the way that we speak and the way that we carry ourselves ... You have to actually be around it to really kind of understand,\" Rodney says.\n\nClarence White Sr. joined the Indianapolis Police Department during the 1950s. He says he did so with the encouragement of his uncle, who was also a police officer. Courtesy of Clarence White Sr. hide caption\n\nDespite efforts by police departments nationwide to employ more people of color into the force, African-Americans still hold a more unfavorable view of police than their white counterparts, according to Pew Research.\n\nClarence White Sr., says this point of view is an issue African-American officers still have to navigate while they're in the field.\n\n\"Black men and women in the street - when they confront a white officer, it's with the sense that what they say or how they say it, they're going to jail. And the black officers, the same thing happens,\" he says. \"We put on a uniform, and the black community says you represent the white establishment. So we have a problem trying to win them over.\"\n\nBut White Sr. has an approach he used before he retired.\n\n\"When I approached a white perpetrator or a black perpetrator, I whispered to him what I was going to do,\" says White. Sr. \"I didn't force anybody - punch him, anything.\"\n\nHe says it's how he would have liked to be treated.\n\nA caption in a previous version of this story incorrectly identified members of the White family. They are pictured from left to right: Clarence Sr., Clarence Jr., Rodney Sr., Keith, LeEtta, Rodney Jr., Christopher and Thomas White. In addition, Christopher White's name was misspelled in the same caption.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

People marched in New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Hands up, don't shoot. Hands up, don't shoot. Hands up, don't shoot. MARTIN: Here in Washington, protesters of all ages began their march at Freedom Plaza near the White House. NPR's Laura Sullivan followed demonstrators as the march got underway. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) PROTESTERS: (Chanting) I can't breathe. I can't breathe. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Thousands of people have flooded onto Pennsylvania Avenue here in Washington, D.C. to march from the White House to the U.S. Capitol about a mile here up the road to protest what they believe is excessive police violence. There are hundreds of posters with the names of unarmed black men that have died in altercations with police. And even more posters that say black lives matter. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) PROTESTERS: (Chanting) ...No justice, no peace, don't trust the police. They shot Mike Brown in the middle of the street. No justice, no peace... SHENICA ODOM: This is a group of kids from Brooklyn, New York. They're from two high schools. SULLIVAN: Shenica Odom came down from New York with these 21 high schoolers. ODOM: And they're ready. These chants that they're saying are chants that they came up in their group because it resonates with them. And it's not just rhetoric for them, this is the life that they live. This is the next generation of civil rights and social justice activists. SULLIVAN: For as many young marchers like these students as there were, there were just as many older marchers - men and women, black and white. Some said they want Congress to act, others said they want the Justice Department to investigate. Many said they want to ensure police treat black men the same as white men. The protest comes just weeks after several high-profile incidents - police shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in a park in Cleveland who was holding an air gun, and after police fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 19-year-old in Ferguson, and killed Eric Garner, an unarmed man in New York. Millions have watched the video of Garner in a chokehold saying over and over, I can't breathe, before he died. Just in front of the students were two Vietnam War veterans - John Taylor from Miami and Berley Hanna from Somerset, New Jersey. BERLEY HANNA: What brought me down is I don't want to see my kids keep - they're all my children, doesn't matter what color they are. So I came out to support everyone. SULLIVAN: Hanna said it filled him with pride to see young people like the students from New York chanting behind him, marching and protesting, believing in a cause just as he and Taylor did decades ago. HANNA: It's been a long time, so something needs to be done. And it seems like the youth of today wants it to stop, and I'm here with them. SULLIVAN: The day's events were organized by Al Sharpton and his National Action Network. And many civil rights activists took to the stage along with some of the parents and children and relatives of those who died. Dawn Caldart is a white woman from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who was in the audience holding a sign that said white silence equals white consent. Her daughter is African-American and was devastated when a grand jury did not indict the officer in Eric Garner's death. DAWN CALDART: I came home the day that the grand jury decision came out for Eric. And my daughter, who's 12, was sitting on the couch and she had tears streaming down her face. And she was watching the news and she said to me, another one mom, another one. And it just hit me in that moment. I was filled with this rage and I can't sit by anymore and not try to make change.

The protest comes just weeks after several high-profile incidents - police shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in a park in Cleveland who was holding an air gun, and after police fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 19-year-old in Ferguson, and killed Eric Garner, an unarmed man in New York. Millions have watched the video of Garner in a chokehold saying over and over, I can't breathe, before he died. Just in front of the students were two Vietnam War veterans - John Taylor from Miami and Berley Hanna from Somerset, New Jersey. BERLEY HANNA: What brought me down is I don't want to see my kids keep - they're all my children, doesn't matter what color they are. So I came out to support everyone. SULLIVAN: Hanna said it filled him with pride to see young people like the students from New York chanting behind him, marching and protesting, believing in a cause just as he and Taylor did decades ago. HANNA: It's been a long time, so something needs to be done. And it seems like the youth of today wants it to stop, and I'm here with them. SULLIVAN: The day's events were organized by Al Sharpton and his National Action Network. And many civil rights activists took to the stage along with some of the parents and children and relatives of those who died. Dawn Caldart is a white woman from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who was in the audience holding a sign that said white silence equals white consent. Her daughter is African-American and was devastated when a grand jury did not indict the officer in Eric Garner's death. DAWN CALDART: I came home the day that the grand jury decision came out for Eric. And my daughter, who's 12, was sitting on the couch and she had tears streaming down her face. And she was watching the news and she said to me, another one mom, another one. And it just hit me in that moment. I was filled with this rage and I can't sit by anymore and not try to make change.

SULLIVAN: Shenica Odom came down from New York with these 21 high schoolers. ODOM: And they're ready. These chants that they're saying are chants that they came up in their group because it resonates with them. And it's not just rhetoric for them, this is the life that they live. This is the next generation of civil rights and social justice activists. SULLIVAN: For as many young marchers like these students as there were, there were just as many older marchers - men and women, black and white. Some said they want Congress to act, others said they want the Justice Department to investigate. Many said they want to ensure police treat black men the same as white men. The protest comes just weeks after several high-profile incidents - police shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in a park in Cleveland who was holding an air gun, and after police fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 19-year-old in Ferguson, and killed Eric Garner, an unarmed man in New York. Millions have watched the video of Garner in a chokehold saying over and over, I can't breathe, before he died. Just in front of the students were two Vietnam War veterans - John Taylor from Miami and Berley Hanna from Somerset, New Jersey. BERLEY HANNA: What brought me down is I don't want to see my kids keep - they're all my children, doesn't matter what color they are. So I came out to support everyone. SULLIVAN: Hanna said it filled him with pride to see young people like the students from New York chanting behind him, marching and protesting, believing in a cause just as he and Taylor did decades ago. HANNA: It's been a long time, so something needs to be done. And it seems like the youth of today wants it to stop, and I'm here with them. SULLIVAN: The day's events were organized by Al Sharpton and his National Action Network. And many civil rights activists took to the stage along with some of the parents and children and relatives of those who died. Dawn Caldart is a white woman from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who was in the audience holding a sign that said white silence equals white consent. Her daughter is African-American and was devastated when a grand jury did not indict the officer in Eric Garner's death. DAWN CALDART: I came home the day that the grand jury decision came out for Eric. And my daughter, who's 12, was sitting on the couch and she had tears streaming down her face. And she was watching the news and she said to me, another one mom, another one. And it just hit me in that moment. I was filled with this rage and I can't sit by anymore and not try to make change. SULLIVAN: Thousands of other marchers weren't sitting either. Laura Sullivan, NPR News, Washington. Copyright © 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

DAWN CALDART: I came home the day that the grand jury decision came out for Eric. And my daughter, who's 12, was sitting on the couch and she had tears streaming down her face.

Some said they want Congress to act, others said they want the Justice Department to investigate. Many said they want to ensure police treat black men the same as white men. The protest comes just weeks after several high-profile incidents - police shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy in a park in Cleveland who was holding an air gun, and after police fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 19-year-old in Ferguson, and killed Eric Garner, an unarmed man in New York. Millions have watched the video of Garner in a chokehold saying over and over, I can't breathe, before he died. Just in front of the students were two Vietnam War veterans - John Taylor from Miami and Berley Hanna from Somerset, New Jersey. BERLEY HANNA: What brought me down is I don't want to see my kids keep - they're all my children, doesn't matter what color they are. So I came out to support everyone. SULLIVAN: Hanna said it filled him with pride to see young people like the students from New York chanting behind him, marching and protesting, believing in a cause just as he and Taylor did decades ago. HANNA: It's been a long time, so something needs to be done. And it seems like the youth of today wants it to stop, and I'm here with them. SULLIVAN: The day's events were organized by Al Sharpton and his National Action Network.

      "text": "Family of Dreasjon Reed, Black Man Killed by Indianapolis Police Officer, File Lawsuit Against City's Police Department\n\nT he family of Dreasjon \"Sean\" Reed , the 21-year-old Black man who was killed by a police officer in Indianapolis in May, have filed a lawsuit against the department for using \"excessive and deadly force\" in his killing.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed on June 16, Reed's birthday, alleges that the Indianapolis Police Department (IMPD), as well as the City of Indianapolis, did not correctly train officers in civilian engagement and de-escalation.\n\n\"The IMPD and the City of Indianapolis had a duty but failed to implement and/or enforce policies, practices, and procedures for IMPD officers that respected Reed's constitutional rights to assistance and protection,\" the lawsuit said .\n\n\"This fight is not over. His life is not over. And don't forget who my son is because you can't see him,\" Reed's mother Demetree Wynn said during a Tuesday press conference. \"We talked about how this day was supposed to go. But I can't stand here with him because he was taken away from me.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid widespread protests and outrage over police-involved shootings and killings of unarmed Black men and women across the country .\n\nOn May 6, police officers responded to reports of Reed allegedly driving dangerously on an Indianapolis Interstate. They began to chase his vehicle. Reed shared video footage of the chase live on Facebook while he was driving, and was believed to be speaking directly to viewers as he streamed. As he parked his car, he tells the viewers his address and is heard saying, \"please come get me.\"\n\nAccording to police, Reed ignored the commands of officers to stop as he got out of his car, though no such commands were heard in Reed's video. As he's seen running, someone is heard in the background yelling for him to stop. Shortly afterward, gunshots are heard. At the time of the incident, police said there \"was an exchange of gunfire between the driver and the officer.\" (The lawsuit makes a different claim, and says that Reed can be seen instead carrying two cellphones and a white T-shirt.) Reed was shot and killed, but the officer was not hit.\n\nThe officer who chased him, named as De'joure Marquise Mercer in the lawsuit, fired his taser at Reed, the lawsuit said, and Reed began to convulse on the ground. Officer Mercer then \"began firing multiple shots at Reed with his firearm,\" the lawsuit continues. \"Reed died instantly.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that Mercer never told Reed to drop a weapon, or warn him that he was going to shoot.\n\nAfter the shooting, a conversation between officers responding to the scene is heard on the livestream video. A male voice, who the suit named as Officer Steven Scott, says, \"I think it's going to be a closed casket homie.\"\n\nThe suit references these comments, calling them \"callous disregard for the life of Reed.\" IMPD Chief Randal Taylor said at the time of the incident that officer Scott would face disciplinary action and called the comments \"unacceptable.\"\n\nThe IMPD did not immediately respond for TIME's request for comment on what action(s) have since been undertaken, or to offer a response to the Reed family's lawsuit.\n\nDuring the press conference, Fatima Johnson, an attorney for Reed's family, says that the department needs to be held accountable.\n\n\"It is a shame that we've had to do all of this just to get the transparency that we were promised,\" Johnson said at the presser. \"But we are willing to do this and more in order to get answers and in order to get justice for Dreasjon today.\"\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com"

      "text": "How To Change Our Split-Second Views on Black Men and Police\n\nA s a young black man, a certain chill runs down my spine every time I cross paths with a police officer on the streets of New York City. Police officers seem to select my backpack for random search on the subway, and requests that I do simple things like cross the street are often accompanied by the threat of arrest or worse. Pedestrians often aren't much better and cross the street late at night to avoid crossing my path.\n\nSome of this should probably be attributed to outright racism. But there's also a subtler cause at work. Many Americans, black and white, are primed to view black men as violent and dangerous. Priming is a process in which experiences or memories lead people to connect two things. Of course, most people wouldn't admit that feeling, but the instinct is there, lurking in the subconscious, a remnant of centuries-old entrenched prejudice.\n\nWhat would it take to turn that around? Can the recent, non-stop coverage of incidents of police brutality against black men change the way the public is primed to view police, black men and the fraught relationship between the groups?\n\nFor the last two decades, the Implicit Association Test has tried to measure the sort of bias that comes with split-second decisions by asking participants to quickly sort faces as well adjectives. It turns out it's a lot easier to group white people and positive adjectives together than black people with the same words. Some 75% of test takers have some bias towards whites over blacks, the research has found.\n\n\"The media presentations of blacks typically emphasize criminality and other kinds of negative depictions,\" said John Dovidio, a Yale psychology professor. \"When you grow up with repeated exposure like that you begin to form these associations, these stereotypes.\"\n\nYet in the cases of the deaths of Freddie Gray, Walter Scott, Tamir Rice and so many other unarmed black men, the media has portrayed police officers as incompetent at best and cold-blooded killers at worst. Dovido, who leads an interdisciplinary lab on diversity, told me that the repetition of incidents of police misconduct makes humans more likely to observe and comprehend a pattern.\n\n\"It's occurred repeatedly. It's been very vivid. It's happened in very geographically diverse areas. As a logical human being, when things are repeated you logically begin to associate these characteristics with the group.\"\n\nPolling seems to back up Dovido's point. A majority of white Americans, 56% to be precise, saw the August death of Michael Brown in Ferguson as an isolated incident. Only 36% said the same thing after the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore in April.\n\nBut even if police misconduct is in the public consciousness today, that doesn't mean it will stay there when the news fades from the headlines. In fact, academics debate the permanence of such memories. Dovido argues that the different perceptions combine and create more nuanced, perhaps more accurate, understandings of reality. Instead of discarding one view, people make them fit together, he said.\n\nThat's comforting. I don't like a world where I'm assumed to be a criminal, but I'm also frightened by the possibility of the public assuming police are always in the wrong. That world seems dangerous, and, indeed statistics suggest that it may be. Cities that have experienced media events surrounding incidents of alleged police brutality in recent months, such as Baltimore and New York City, have seen a dramatic drop in arrests and police stops. There's also been a spike in violent crime. Baltimore, for example, saw more murders last month than any month in 40 years.\n\nBut some, like Rice University emeritus psychology professor David Schneider, don't think people are likely to internalize the news at all. It takes more than six months of bad news coverage to reverse perceptions that have built up over a lifetime, they say. \"Public opinion is ephemeral,\" said Schneider, the author of a book on the psychology behind stereotyping. \"People's attitudes change very quickly but often regress to where they were before.\"\n\nLet's say that these incidents really have changed the way the average American thinks about law enforcement and the treatment of black men. At the end of the day, it may not mean all that much in practical terms for victims of police brutality.\n\n\"If you're African American, there's no priming from the media,\" said Travis Dixon, an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"There's just the reality that police treat you differently, that police suspect that you are engaging in criminal behavior when you're walking down the street, when you're driving, when you're existing, and that is just totally reality.\"\n\nDixon is right, of course. But then I think about a scene I witnessed a few weeks ago-a black man in the hands of the cops and a crowd of mostly white onlookers demanding the officers explain their actions. When I asked one onlooker what he'd seen, he said the police had swooped in and thrown the man against the wall, providing no reason for the arrest. The crowd demanded the officers give their badge numbers, and they told the man they'd follow up. I don't know what prompted the arrest, or what eventually happened to the man, but the split-second decision to look after one another can never be a bad thing.\n\nWrite to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com"

      "text": "These Two Stats Show the Big Problem With Policing in America\n\nT here are two sets of numbers that tell us a lot about the state of policing in America. This week, the FBI released the latest tally of cops killed in the line of duty. The grim toll in 2014 was 51 law enforcement officers who were killed while doing their jobs (the figure does not include those who died in work-related accidents). That's an 89% rise from the year before, but still below the average of 64 deaths from 1980 to 2014.\n\nWe have those comparisons because the FBI database is considered complete and updated every year. What we don't know is the corollary number: how many people die as a result of encounters with the police. The FBI does compile a list- the latest shows there were 461 suspects killed in 2013 by police officers, up from 397 in 2010-but it is in no way a comprehensive account because the information is provided voluntarily and only some of the nation's almost 18,000 police departments contribute. Plus, the FBI's list is short on details and only specifies the type of weapon used in fatal incidents. Numbers compiled by advocacy groups suggest that the number of people killed by police is much higher , although lower than it once was. According to the New York Times , for example, 91 people were shot and killed by police officers in New York City in 1971 compared with eight in 2013, which was a record low.\n\nThe lack of a reliable, comprehensive database has become a flashpoint in the debate over policing following a string of high-profile fatal incidents involving white officers and unarmed black men. These deaths have led to sometimes violent protests and a renewed focus on police use of force against minorities. And the public response helped prompt FBI director James Comey to call for better data in a speech on law enforcement and race . \"The first step to understanding what is really going on in our communities and in our country is to gather more and better data related to those we arrest, those we confront for breaking the law and jeopardizing public safety, and those who confront us,\" Comey said.\n\nAs the FBI's new data on officer deaths shows, those confrontations can sometimes be fatal. The most common incident leading to an officer's death came from answering a disturbance call (11), followed by involvement in car chases or traffic stops (10) and ambushes (8). Others were killed while involved in investigations, tactical situations or dealing with drug-related issues.\n\n\"There are certainly cases in the last year that have been directly related to the rise in tensions between police and minority communities,\" says Marquette University criminology professor Meghan Stroshine, referring to incidents like one in New York City in December, in which two NYPD officers were deliberately targeted and shot \"execution-style\" apparently as retribution for police-related deaths of unarmed black men. \"We have some cases clearly that were of a retaliatory nature or in the name of correcting perceived past wrongs.\"\n\nJust within the last two weeks, several officers have died on duty. The first NYPD officer to be killed in the line of duty since December died on May 4 after being shot by a gunman in Queens. And last week, two officers in Hattiesburg, Miss., were killed during a traffic stop. Four suspects have been charged .\n\nFeb. 26, 2012 Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman fatally shoots unarmed 17-yearold Trayvon Martin after an altercation in a Sanford, Fla., subdivision. The incident sparked a national conversation about race and prompted President Obama to say that were he to have a son, \"he'd look like Trayvon.\" Zimmerman, who argued that he acted in self-defense, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in July 2013.\n\nFeb. 9, 2014 Ernest Satterwhite, 68, is shot and killed in his driveway by a white public-safety officer in North Augusta, S.C., following a slow-speed car chase. Justin Craven fired multiple rounds through the driver-side door of the vehicle. The officer alleges that Satterwhite reached for his weapon; Satterwhite's family disputes the allegation. Craven was charged with a felony for discharging his gun into an occupied vehicle on April 7, the same day Michael Slager was charged with murdering Walter Scott. He faces up to 10 years in prison.\n\nApril 30, 2014 Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney fatally shoots Dontre Hamilton, an unarmed 31-year-old African American with a history of mental illness, in a downtown park. Manney alleged that Hamilton, who appeared to be homeless, attempted to grab his baton during a pat down. Manney says he shot Hamilton 14 times in self-defense. Manney was fired in October but was not charged in the shooting.\n\nJuly 17, 2014 Eric Garner, 43, dies after being wrestled to the ground as New York City police attempted to arrest him for selling illegal cigarettes. In a cell-phone video recorded by a bystander, Garner can be heard repeatedly saying, \"I can't breathe.\" The phrase was soon adopted as a rallying cry by protesters. On Dec. 3, a grand jury decided not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's death.\n\nAug. 5, 2014 John Crawford III, 22, is shot inside a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, after picking up an air rifle from the shelf. While police say they repeatedly asked Crawford, who was black, to drop the gun, surveillance video shows that police shot the man soon after approaching him.\n\nAug. 9, 2014 Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson, Mo., police officer, fatally shoots unarmed 18-yearold Michael Brown, setting off months of unrest in the St. Louis area. Protests erupted nationwide in November, when Wilson was not indicted in Brown's death. But the shooting prompted a Justice Department investigation of the Ferguson Police Department. In March, after the scathing report found instances of overt racism among officers and a pattern of arrests targeting black residents, Ferguson's police chief and city manager resigned.\n\nSept. 4, 2014 Levar Jones, 35, is shot multiple times by 31-year-old Sean Groubert, a white South Carolina state trooper, seconds after being stopped for a seat-belt violation, all of which was caught on the officer's dash cam. Jones, who was black and unarmed, survived and can be heard on a video asking, \"Why did you shoot me?\" Groubert was later fired and charged with assault and battery, which carries a sentence of 20 years in prison. A verdict is expected later this year.\n\nNov. 22, 2014 Tamir Rice, 12, is fatally shot and killed in a Cleveland park after police responded to a 911 call reporting a person with a gun. The caller warned that the gun may have been fake, but the officers say they didn't know that. Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Rice within seconds of arriving on the scene. Rice's gun turned out to have been a toy. A group of political and religious leaders have called for criminal charges to be brought against the officers involved, and a grand jury plans to hear evidence in the case.\n\nDec. 2, 2014 Rumain Brisbon, 34, is shot and killed by a Phoenix police officer following a drug-related traffic stop in which Brisbon, who was black, fled, refused arrest and appeared to be reaching for a weapon. Brisbon was shot by Mark Rine, a 30-year-old white officer. The incident set off several demonstrations in downtown Phoenix. On April 1, a Maricopa County attorney announced that criminal charges would not be brought against Rine.\n\nMarch 1, 2015 Los Angeles police officers shoot and kill a black homeless man named Charly \"Africa\" Leundeu Keunang, following a confrontation in the city's Skid Row, an area with a heavy concentration of homeless people. Officers said the man attempted to take one of their guns.\n\nMarch 6, 2015 Naeschylus Vinzant, a 37-yearold unarmed black man, is shot in the chest and killed by Paul Jerothe, a police officer in Aurora, Colo. At the time of the shooting, Vinzant was violating his parole and had removed his ankle bracelet. He also had a violent criminal history but was unarmed as officers tried to arrest him. Jerothe, a SWAT team medic officer, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nMarch 6, 2015 Tony Robinson, a 19-year-old biracial man, is shot by a white Madison, Wis., police officer after Robinson was allegedly jumping in and out of traffic. Matt Kenny, a 45-year-old officer who was exonerated in a 2007 shooting of an African-American man, got into an altercation with Robinson when he entered an apartment in which Robinson was reportedly acting aggressively. Kenny, who says he was attacked by Robinson, was placed on administrative leave with pay pending the results of an investigation.\n\nMarch 9, 2015 Anthony Hill, a black 27-yearold Air Force veteran, is shot and killed in Chamblee, Ga., by Robert Olsen, a white DeKalb County Police Department officer. Hill was naked and unarmed at the time of the incident and was apparently knocking on multiple apartment doors inside a housing complex. Olsen has been placed on leave. An investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is currently under way.\n\nApril 4, 2015 Walter Scott, a 50-year-old black man, is shot and killed as he's apparently fleeing North Charleston officer Michael Slager, 33. Slager, who is white, alleges that Scott reached for his Taser. A video recorded by a bystander appears to show Scott running away from the officer as he's shot in the back eight times.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Protesters Rallying for Racial Justice in Washington See a Watershed Moment\n\nI t started with a tweet. Philomena Wankenge, 22, wanted to organize a protest following George Floyd's death . \"Let's make some noise,\" she wrote on May 28, with a solidarity-fist emoji. She started a group chat, and those who were active on it became the board of directors for Freedom Fighters DC, a group that is less than two weeks old but has helped mobilize thousands of new voices into a renewed push for racial justice in the nation's capital.\n\nWith a megaphone tucked under her arm and a Black Lives Matter fist buzzed onto the back of her head, Wankenge was among the organizers who led thousands of people in Washington to march against police brutality on June 6. They gathered on Capitol Hill and streamed past the National Museum of African American History and Culture, where they took a knee, then past President Donald Trump's backyard. She was followed by thousands of chanting protesters chanting \"No Justice, No Peace, Defund the Police\" and \"F-ck Trump,\" while listening to songs like Childish Gambino's \"This is America.\" Most wore face masks despite the heat.\n\n\"The level of aggression that the police invokes on people is inappropriate regardless of the race,\" says Wakenenge. \"But it's just that it's easier for them to bully black people and no one really says anything.\"\n\nMore people are speaking out now. Floyd's death has prompted an uprising against systemic injustice on a massive scale. From New York to Los Angeles, demonstrators continue to fill the streets to protest against racial injustice. In Washington, a long stream of thousands of people carried signs reminding the world - again - that black lives matter.\n\nTo many it felt like a watershed moment. The coalition of supporters is broadening, protesters say, and the coronavirus pandemic has made it harder to ignore systemic inequality in America.\n\n\"This changes everything because the whole world is involved and watching,\" says Carmen Jordan, 39, a D.C. resident standing in the protest area near the White House. Around her was a summer festival atmosphere, with people handing out free T-shirts and food and drinks, blowing bubbles, and holding signs. Though in recent days the area surrounding the White House has become a flashpoint between law enforcement and protesters, on Saturday it was jovial.\n\nThe demonstrators' demands go beyond justice for Floyd to ending racially discriminatory policing practices and dismantling systemic racism. In Washington, protesters called for reducing the police budget, blocking the addition of a new jail, banning stop and frisk tactics and investing in communities.\n\n\"I don't think that police need to be operating on such a large budget. I don't think they need to have militarized weapons,\" says Taylor Jenkins, 29, holding a sign calling for defunding the police with military vehicles parked a couple of blocks away. Jenkins expressed optimism that defunding the police was achievable, noting that several major cities are already looking at slashing police department budgets.\n\nActivists say the national outcry that's come since Floyd's death is finally making more white Americans see the ongoing racial inequities around them. \"We've gotten a reaction I've never seen before,\" says Alex Hagans, 30, of Mitchellville, Md. \"We're not alone anymore.\"\n\nHagans, who works in tech and is studying business at University of Maryland, remembers going into the office after Eric Garner died following a police chokehold in July 2014 and feeling like he was the only one around him struggling with the news. \"While you're sitting there in the office and that's all you think about, everyone else is having a regular day like nothing happened. A lot of times it's kids that this is happening to, that are dying, and you just feel it when you think that could have been you,\" says Hagans. \"Corporations are now speaking out internally and externally. It's a big deal.\"\n\nMany protesters also see signs that the coalition around Black Lives Matter is broadening. Protesters point to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell admitting the NFL was wrong in how it handled players' peaceful protests. Polls bear out the idea that the cause has broadened: in a Monmouth survey released this week, 76% of Americans said racial and ethnic discrimination is a problem in the U.S., up from 51% in January of 2015.\n\nSome who came out to protest on Saturday were guarded against expecting too much. They've been here before. Racial inequality was one of the biggest stories in America before Donald Trump's election, sparking sustained protests but limited change.\n\n\"My hope is it's not going to be a flash in the pan moment. We had so many black men - unarmed black men - killed unjustly,\" says Chad Jackson, 49, a train conductor from Severn, Md., standing on a street in front of the White House that was painted with the words \"Black Lives Matter\" on the orders of Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser. Jackson served in the Army, as a cavalry scout and a drill sergeant, and he held a large yellow poster board that read: \"When will this be the Land of the Free for me?\"\n\nProtesters are demanding more than symbolic gestures. Activists criticized Bowser's \"Black Lives Matter\" mural and \"Black Lives Matter Plaza\" street sign, noting that her proposed budget doesn't address their concerns and had cuts to community-focused initiatives but increases for the police department. Later in the day, protesters reportedly added the demand \"Defund the Police\" in yellow paint by the street mural. Organizers rebuked those who cheered at a recent protest when police took a knee, reminding them that Floyd had died because a police officer had knelt on his neck. \"Why the f-ck would we cheer for police kneeling?\" one protester asked the crowd.\n\nBut often, the mood was joyous, a marked change from recent days. As thousands of protestors marched up 17th Street NW, past the same gates that National Guard trucks had driven through on Monday before officers violently cleared protestors, the drivers of orange city trucks parked along the road blared their horns in support. Cheers went up. It may have been loud enough for President Trump to hear inside the White House on the other side of the gates.\n\nWrite to Lissandra Villa/Washington at lissandra.villa@time.com"

A friend of Robinson's initially called 9-1-1 just before 6:30 p.m., concerned about Robinson's erratic behavior. The friend said Robinson was \"tweaking\" after he took hallucinogenic mushrooms, the Wisconsin State Journal reports . Other emergency callers said a man fitting Robinson's description had punched multiple pedestrians in the area.\n\nWhen Kenny arrived on the scene minutes later, Robinson was in his friend's apartment. According to Kenny's account, Ozanne said, Robinson immediately punched Kenny in the face. Kenny then fatally shot Robinson seven times within three seconds, with all of the bullets striking the teen.\n\nRobinson's death sparked days of large protests within Madison. It was another death in a string of highly publicized killings of unarmed black men around the country that have become a cultural and political flashpoint since the shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last August. This year, police officers involved in killings of black men in North Charleston, S.C., and Baltimore were dealt murder charges.\n\nIn the wake of recent riots tied to police killings of unarmed black men by white officers, Ozanne urged Madison residents to maintain peace following Tuesday's announcement. As the first black district attorney in Wisconsin, he said he \"understands the pain\" of unjustified racial profiling. But he also said his decision was based on the facts that were presented to him, not emotion.\n\n\"My decision will not bring Tony Robinson Jr. back,\" Ozanne said. \"My decision will not end the racial disparities that exist in the justice system, in our justice system.\"\n\nRead next: These Two Stats Show the Big Problem With Policing in America\n\nFeb. 26, 2012 Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman fatally shoots unarmed 17-yearold Trayvon Martin after an altercation in a Sanford, Fla., subdivision.

The views of non-Hispanic whites, however, remained virtually unchanged. Almost 60% said they rated cops' ethical standards as very high or high.\n\n( MORE: Why the Road to Ferguson Was a Freeway )\n\nThe drop among nonwhites helped bring overall honesty ratings for all Americans down to 48%, the lowest since 1995.\n\nAs crime rates have dropped over the last couple decades, Americans have generally viewed officers positively, according to Gallup. The highest ratings came, unsurprisingly, after 9/11, when 68% of Americans viewed cops' ethics and honesty ratings as high, as they watched police officers in New York and elsewhere respond to the terrorist attacks on the country.\n\nBut the recent events in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island, where white officers were involved in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed black men, appear to have dramatically sunk those positive views among communities of color.\n\nGrand juries declined to indict both officers-Ferguson's Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department and New York City's Daniel Pantaleo-in the deaths, respectively, of Brown and Garner. Those decisions have sparked widespread demonstrations in major cities against police brutality.\n\nAmericans' views of officers' ethics and honesty are not as low as they were in the 1970s, however, at a time when crime was a much bigger problem around the U.S., especially for inner cities.

Other Facebook pages have reposted the video, adding to its viewership.\n\nKirk uses this figure while arguing that systemic racism does not exist within law enforcement. He did not mention in the video that Black Americans make up 13% of the population \"but are killed by police at more than twice the rate of white Americans,\" as the Post reported. He also did not mention, as explained by Naomi Zack in her book on racial profiling and police homicide that \"when 4.4 million random stop and frisks were conducted in New York City, during the period from 2004 [to] 2012, even though Blacks were disproportionately singled out , the incidence of further police action was less for Blacks than for whites.\"\n\nKirk's claim that police killed eight unarmed Black men in 2019 is incorrect for several reasons.\n\nKirk cites the Post's database, which includes only people shot by police, not killed through other means like beating or tasering. He also cites a database that is incomplete. The number of unarmed Black men fatally shot by police is likely higher than the Post's count due to a lack of comprehensive police records, which Kirk does not acknowledge. Despite these issues, the Post's database shows police fatally shot 13 unarmed black men in 2019, not eight.\n\nThe Post's database documents fatal police shootings that have happened since Jan. 1, 2015. The Post said its team relies \"primarily on news accounts, social media postings and police reports\" in addition to its own reporting.\n\nThis data does not include \"deaths of people in police custody, fatal shootings by off-duty officers or non-shooting deaths.\"\n\nThe Post's data shows police fatally shot 13 unarmed Black men in 2019, five more people than Kirk claimed. Also, police fatally shot an unarmed Black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, 28, on Oct. 12 in Fort Worth Texas. But the Post's database covers only shootings. It does not include deaths caused by beating, tasering or vehicles. George Floyd's died in police custody after a police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes, which would not have been included in the Post's data set.\n\nThe Post regularly updates the database as information about cases is released, so it's possible it showed eight unarmed Black male deaths instead of 13 at the time Kirk posted the video. It's also possible the number will continue to rise as more information about deaths in 2019 comes to light.\n\nMapping Police Violence , a crowdsourced database that includes deaths by vehicle, tasering or beating in addition to shootings, estimates 25 police killings of unarmed Black men in 2019.\n\nThe 2019 deaths include 28-year-old Michael Dean , who police killed in Texas on Dec. 2; 31-year-old Christopher Whitfield , who police killed in Louisiana on Oct. 14; 54-year-old Melvin Watkins , who police killed in Louisiana on Sept. 14; and 33-year-old Channara Tom Pheap , who police killed on Aug. 26 in Tennessee.\n\nThe Post's analysis found police have killed around the same number of people each year - about 1,000 - since it began collecting the data. The data for 2020 appear on par with previous years.\n\nMany academics using data on the number of police killings acknowledge a lack of data, resulting in underreporting.\n\nTwo systems collect information on police shootings: The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which collects data from more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Vital Statistics System, which compiles death certificate data.\n\nAccording to research by criminologists published in the National Library of Medicine, the NVSS underestimates police homicides because it \"misclassifies cases as homicides, rather than justifiable homicides committed by police officers, because certifiers fail to mention police involvement.\"\n\nThe researchers found the FBI's system, which does not gather data from all law enforcement agencies, similarly \"misses cases because some jurisdictions fail to file reports or omit justifiable homicides committed by police officers.\"\n\nPBS reported in August that the lack of sound information surrounding police shootings is so widespread that \"a decade ago, the Department of Justice stopped collecting data on deaths tied to police violence because the numbers were unreliable ... Reporting these cases was voluntary, and there were virtually no incentives for police departments to submit this information to the federal government.\"\n\nExamples of questionable reporting of the causes of police shootings are many.\n\nWhen police shot 39-year-old Tommy Smith outside his mother's house in Illinois, authorities declared his death a \"suicide by cop\" despite lacking evidence.\n\n\"Suicide by cop\" is a vague term that the Guardian - a publication that also created its own police fatality database - reported contradicts the National Association of Medical Examiners' guidelines for determining cause of death.\n\nThe Guardian reported in 2015 that the police killings of Eric Garner , Tamir Rice and John Crawford , all of whom were unarmed when they died, were \"missing from the federal government's official record of homicides by officers because most departments refuse to submit data.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics, a unit within the Department of Justice, released in 2016 a redesigned study using reports from media outlets, surveys of law enforcement agencies, medical examiners' and coroners' offices to produce an improved estimate of arrest-related deaths between June 1, 2015, and March 31, 2016.\n\nThe bureau found 1,348 potential arrest-related deaths during that time frame. Of those, nearly two-thirds were homicides, one-fifth were suicides and a one-tenth were accidents. The revised estimate is on par with the Post and the Guardian's estimates.\n\nThe Post's database counts only police shootings, not other forms of police interaction that resulted in fatalities, so Kirk incorrectly attributed the number of all police killings in 2019 to a database that only records deaths by shooting.\n\nBut even though data on fatalities at the hands of police is underreported and the actual number is likely higher, the Washington Post's database has reported 13 instances of police shooting and killing unarmed Black men (plus one instance of police shooting and killing an unarmed Black woman) in 2019. That is five more deaths of unarmed Black men than Kirk's claim in his Facebook video. This claim is, therefore, rated FALSE because it is not supported by our research.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

      "text": "There is no epidemic of fatal police shootings against unarmed Black Americans\n\nThe video of George Floyd's tragic death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has led many to ask whether it represents the tip of an iceberg of police brutality. For centuries, United States law enforcement was interwoven with slavery and segregation, and that memory cannot be easily erased. But the evidence does not support the charge that biased police are systematically killing Black Americans in fatal shootings.\n\nMuch of modern policing is driven by crime data and community demands for help. The African American community tends to be policed more heavily , because that is where people are disproportionately hurt by violent street crime. In New York City in 2018, 73% of shooting victims were Black, though Black residents comprise only 24% of the city's population .\n\nNationally, African Americans between the ages of 10 and 34 die from homicide at 13 times the rate of white Americans, according to researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Justice Department.\n\nCommunity requests also determine police deployment, and the most urgent requests often come from law-abiding residents of high-crime neighborhoods.\n\nAn elderly resident in the Mount Hope neighborhood of the Bronx once described to me her fear of entering her building lobby, since it was so often occupied by trespassing youth hanging out and selling drugs. The only time she felt safe was when law enforcement was around: As long as she saw the police, she told me , everything is OK. You can come down and get your mail and talk to decent people.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed in the dozens of police community meetings I've attended. Though they also want improved quality of policing, the percentage of Black respondents in a 2015 Gallup poll who wanted more police in their community was more than twice as high as the percentage of white respondents who said the same. Activists who seek to disband police departments will have to explain to these law-abiding residents that they will in essence just have to fend for themselves.\n\nSuch self defense may be understandable if the police were engaging in an epidemic of shooting unarmed Black men and women, as we now hear daily - but there is no such epidemic. For the last five years, the police have fatally shot about 1,000 civilians annually , the vast majority of whom were armed or otherwise dangerous. Black people account for about 23% of those shot and killed by police; they are about 13% of the U.S. population.\n\nAs of the June 22 update, the Washington Post's database of fatal police shootings showed 14 unarmed Black victims and 25 unarmed white victims in 2019. The database does not include those killed by other means, like George Floyd.\n\nThe number of unarmed Black shooting victims is down 63% from 2015, when the database began. There are about 7,300 Black homicide victims a year. The 14 unarmed victims in fatal police shootings would comprise only 0.2% of that total.\n\nIdeally, officers would never take anyone's life in the course of their duties. But given the number of arrests they make each year ( around 10 million ) and the number of deadly-weapons attacks on officers ( an average of 27 per day in just two-thirds of the nation's police departments, according to a 2014 analysis), it is not clear that these 1,000 civilian shooting deaths suggest that law enforcement is out of control.\n\nNevertheless, we can do better. Cops are desperate for more hands-on tactical training, de-escalation practice, and techniques to control stress. Federal support should focus on such practical training to ensure that officers are prepared for the difficult encounters they face daily.\n\nReducing police resources will ultimately result in poorer service to the law-abiding residents of high-crime areas. Officers without back-up will be more stressed and at higher risk of poor judgment. Response times will increase. Cash-starved agencies will train less, not more, while lower pay scales will result in less qualified recruits.\n\nA reduced police presence in minority neighborhoods will claim more Black lives. When officers back off of proactive policing under accusations of racism, violence shoots up. That was the case in cities recently examined by Harvard economists. After investigations opened up into a media-grabbing instance of police use of deadly force in Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Ferguson, Missouri, and Riverside, California, there were almost 900 excess homicides and almost 34,000 excess felonies, their study found.\n\nCops pulled back from discretionary activity - questioning a suspicious person on a known drug corner, for example - and simply drove on by. Such stops are voluntary; cops are not mandated to make them.\n\nIn Chicago, the Harvard economists found , the number of police-civilian interactions decreased by almost 90% in the month after the investigation into deadly force was announced. In Riverside, interactions decreased 54%. In St. Louis, self-initiated police activities declined by 46%.\n\nBy contrast, in cities where incidents of police use of deadly force were under investigation, but did not go viral or grab national attention, homicides and total crime went down. Police officers were not afraid to continue policing.\n\nThis year, on Sunday, May 31, Chicago had its deadliest day in 60 years . Over the course of that weekend, 25 people were killed and another 85 shot. The reason: An overmatched police force was overwhelmed by the rampant looting and upheavals and had little deterrent presence on the ground. \"There's suddenly this vacuum that opens up,\" said Max Kapustin, the senior research director at a local crime lab, and \"you see an absurd amount of carnage.\"\n\nBad cops of all races must be removed. But the overwhelming majority of officers are in their jobs because of people like that Mount Hope resident who looks out her window hoping to see the police nearby. It is these vulnerable residents who will be most hurt if the \"defund police\" activists have their way.\n\nHeather Mac Donald is the Thomas W.

      "text": "'False narrative': AG Barr rejects claims of an 'epidemic' of police shootings of unarmed Black suspects\n\nAttorney General William Barr on Wednesday rejected assertions that police shootings of unarmed Black suspects had become an American epidemic, casting such claims as a \"false narrative.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there are two justice systems,\" Barr said in an interview with CNN. \"I think the narrative that police are in some epidemic of shooting unarmed Black men is simply a false narrative.\"\n\nThe attorney general's comments come a day after he accompanied President Donald Trump to Kenosha, Wisconsin , where the president offered support for law enforcement in the contentious days after local police shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back, leaving him paralyzed.\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, Barr also appeared to stoke Trump's claims that mail-in voting could be vulnerable to fraud and that extremists were traveling from city to city to incite violence at demonstrations against police abuse.\n\n\"This is playing with fire,\" Barr said, referring to the mail-in ballot campaign waged in the wake of the risk posed by the deadly coronavirus to in-person voting.\n\nLast week, U.S. intelligence officials said that they had \"not seen\" coordinated efforts to manipulate mail-in balloting, despite Trump's ominous warnings about the prospect of massive fraud.\n\n\"We have not seen a coordinated voter fraud effort,\" a senior law enforcement official told reporters during an election security briefing.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen, speaking at a separate event last week, appeared to echo the security assessment.\n\n\"We have yet to see any activity intended to prevent voting or change votes,\" Rosen said during an online conference hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, adding that it would be difficult for foreign actors to do so.\n\nOn Wednesday, the attorney general supported the president's contentions, suggesting that voting by mail was vulnerable to \"fraud and coercion.\"\n\nRelying on such a system in a politically divided country, Barr said, was \"reckless and dangerous.\"\n\nBarr also said federal authorities were tracking the movements of demonstrators who, the attorney general claimed, have been traveling to cities throughout the United States to foment violence.\n\nThe attorney general said investigators were responding to \"multiple reports,\" suggesting a coordinated infiltration of social justice protests sparked by the the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump promoted an unsubstantiated theory that he was alerted to a plane carrying extremists dressed in dark uniforms, suggesting that they were part of an organized group promoting violence at local demonstrations.\n\nAsked about Trump's claim Wednesday, Barr said: \"I don't know what the president is referring to.\""

      "text": "'He's going to kill someone': Tempe officer again accused of use of force against unarmed Black man\n\nTrevonyae Cumpian waited on his knees with his hands up. The hot ground burned through the fabric of his work uniform. It was 103 that day.\n\nHe stared back at the gun pointed at him and a few feet away, the Tempe police officer behind it. As he waited and wondered if he was going to die, he thought about the numerous other unarmed Black men killed by law enforcement across the country.\n\nHe repeatedly explained to the officer that he was an employee of the Hawthorn Suites and not the armed white man the officer was looking for. He repeatedly asked the officer to put his gun down.\n\n\"You going to shoot me? Am I going to be another person on the news?\" Cumpian can be seen asking the officer in body camera footage.\n\n\"Shut the f--- up with that s---,\" the officer replied.\n\nMinutes passed and, eventually, Officer Ronald Kerzaya let Cumpian go. Kerzaya, who is white, would later be seen in surveillance and body camera footage walking through the halls of the hotel, gun pointed and shouting.\n\nKerzaya is the same officer at the center of a June 2019 use of force case where Ivaugh Oakry - another unarmed Black man - was shocked with a stun gun multiple times while holding his 1-year-old child in his own home. Department officials said after the Oakry incident, Kerzaya underwent mandatory re-training in contact communication, defense tactics and enhanced de-escalation techniques.\n\nCumpian says he questions the effectiveness of that training, given his own encounter with Kerzaya.\n\n\"What I'm scared of is someone is going to lose their life because of him in the near future,\" Cumpian said. \"He's going to kill someone.\"\n\nKerzaya was moved to an administrative role pending an internal investigation after the most recent incident, according to Tempe police officials.\n\n\"Our initial review indicates that this incident was not handled in accordance with the professionalism and respectful behavior that we, and the public, have for our officers,\" spokesman Detective Greg Bacon said in a statement about the incident with Cumpian.\n\nTempe Mayor Corey Woods called the incident \"disturbing and disappointing\" in a statement Thursday.\n\nShawn Hoover, Cumpian's boss and the general manager of Hawthorn Suites, first called the non-emergency line at Tempe police Aug. 30 to have two people suspected of conducting illegal activities kicked off the property.\n\nBefore police arrived, Cumpian and Hoover encountered a white couple smoking something in a stairwell with the door to the exit propped open. The woman left after Hoover told them to leave, but Hoover said the man pulled out a gun. Hoover told the man to put the gun away and leave, which he did. Cumpian, who works the front desk, followed the man to another floor to ensure he left.\n\nBody camera footage provided to The Arizona Republic shows Kerzaya speaking to Hoover after responding to the call. Kerzaya repeatedly asks whether the armed man is Black or white.\n\nHoover says he offered to show Kerzaya the surveillance footage of the armed man. However, Kerzaya headed toward an exit on the east side of the building, alone, without looking at the video, Hoover said.\n\nKerzaya encounters two white individuals sitting outside and orders them to get inside while still pointing his weapon. The footage shows Kerzaya standing outside a door, as he communicates on his radio. Cumpian, who is Black, then exits wearing a Hawthorn Suites polo.\n\nCumpian says he didn't know police arrived and went to the exit on the west side of the building to kick out a rock propping open the door on the opposite end of the building where the armed white man was last seen.\n\nThe footage shows Kerzaya pointing his gun at Cumpian, who immediately his hands up when ordered to do so. Cumpian explains that he works at the hotel.\n\n\"Hey! Listen! I am responding to somebody with a firearm who matches your description,\" Kerzaya shouts.\n\nCumpian again attempts to explain he works there. His hands remain up as Kerzaya asks for his ID.\n\n\"You going to shoot me? Am I going to be another person on the news?\" Cumpian asks, urging Kerzaya to put his gun down.\n\n\"Shut the f--- up with that s---,\" Kerzaya replies.\n\nKerzaya orders Cumpian to his knees and to place his belongings, which include a phone and keys, on the ground. As Cumpian complies, he continues to repeat that he works there and to just ask his manager.\n\n\"Stop telling me what to do!\" Kerzaya says.\n\nAfter Cumpian gives his name, Kerzaya asks someone on the radio to verify he works there. Cumpian asks him repeatedly to put the gun down.\n\n\"When I'm responding to somebody with a firearm, I can do what I need to to stay safe and go home to my family,\" Kerzaya said.\n\nCumpian can be seen asking for another person off-camera to record what's happening.\n\n\"Think I dress like this for no reason?\" Cumpian asks, referring to his work uniform.\n\nAt least three minutes pass before Kerzaya tells Cumpian he can go. Tempe police officials said Kerzaya released him after confirming he was an employee.\n\nCumpian asks for Kerzaya's name and badge number. Kerzaya said he would give it to him later. After he returned to the front office, Cumpian shakily recounted what happened to Hoover.\n\nThey then heard a commotion coming from the west side of the building.\n\nKerzaya's body-worn camera shows him communicating on the radio as other officers arrive.\n\nA Black man holding a bike and wearing a white T-shirt and shorts attempts to leave the building, the footage shows. Kerzaya again draws his weapon and moves through the open door, yelling for the man to \"Get his a-- out here now.\"\n\nKerzaya then moves into the stairwell and begins yelling at another Black man in a black T-shirt, asking where the Black man in the white T-shirt went. His gun is still drawn as the man explains he has nothing to do with this.\n\n\"Get the f--- out of my way!\" Kerzaya says. \"Go!\"\n\nHoover can be seen peeking around a corner as Kerzaya turns, keeping his weapon drawn. Kerzaya asks Hoover where the original armed suspect went. Hoover says the armed man was now outside.\n\nAt this point, other officers arrive. Kerzaya then returns to the lobby, footage shows. Hoover said he questions why he drew a weapon on Cumpian.\n\n\"He looked like he's unstable and it just seemed like he was playing a video game,\" Cumpian said after seeing the surveillance footage.\n\nKerzaya appears to turn off his body camera after leaving, as he talks to another officer outside the building.\n\nNeither of the men saw Kerzaya again as other officers step in to clear the scene. The armed man was never found.\n\nThis is the second time Kerzaya's actions have come under question. In November 2018, advocacy groups released body camera video showing Kerzaya and others using stun guns on 32-year-old Oakry.\n\nKerzaya and other officers responded to the Tempe apartment on a domestic violence call to the department's non-emergency line.\n\nOn the video, Kerzaya enters Oakry's apartment and threatens to stun the man within seconds of knocking on his door. Oakry points out that it's his apartment and the officer doesn't have permission to enter before picking up his child.\n\n\"Put the baby down and put your hands on top of your head,\" Kerzaya says. \"This is really simple, my man.\"\n\nMore officers entered the apartment and at least three pointed Tasers at Oakry, who refused to put down the baby. Officers struck Oakry with stun guns, causing him to fall forward onto a pile of clothing in trash bags with the child still in his hands.\n\nOakry was later taken into custody and the charges were ultimately dropped. The department said Kerzaya's actions were within policy and he underwent mandatory re-training. Bacon explained that training covered de-escalation tactics, \"including appropriate response planning, listening and communication with citizens and responding officers and the availability of various tactical options such as time and use of cover for situational awareness.\"\n\nHeather Hamel, Oakry's attorney, said the second incident was almost inevitable as the department failed to properly discipline him after the Oakry incident, instead opting to send him through training.\n\n\"They sent an implicit message that what he did was OK,\" Hamel said. \"And you know what he did with that message? He went out and did it again.\"\n\nBacon said Kerzaya does not have any other use-of-force complaints.\n\nA lawsuit has been filed against Kerzaya and the city of Tempe in the Oakry case. The notice of claim, which serves as a precursor to a lawsuit, specifically questioned Tempe police's tactics and use-of-force training, describing them as \"fear-based\" training that creates a culture where officers are taught \"use force without hesitation,\" instead of utilizing de-escalation tactics.\n\nIt's not clear how the incident was first brought to the attention of the department. Hoover and Cumpian said they reached out multiple times in an attempt to get Kerzaya's name and badge number. They were ultimately provided it by a member of the Professional Standard Bureau after speaking to Tempe Mayor Corey Woods.\n\nCumpian said after he learned of the Oakry case and Kerzaya's role, he felt lucky he made it out of the encounter alive, knowing Kerzaya's history.\n\n\"He shouldn't be in the field,\" Cumpian said.\n\nAccording to a statement from the department, \"key members\" of the department became concerned about Kerzaya's actions. He was moved to an administrative role and an internal investigation is being conducted.\n\nTempe police Chief Sylvia Moir was scheduled to meet with Cumpian and Hoover Thursday evening to discuss the incident and show them footage from Kerzaya's body-worn camera.\n\nWoods issued his own statement Thursday, saying that he was dissatisfied after watching the footage.\n\n\"We all can imagine the horrible feelings - the humiliation and fear - that the employee felt during the incident and since,\" Woods said.\n\nWoods, who is Black, said he is working with city staff to examine recent incidents as they draft a plan to address \"these challenges.\" Incidents like these speak to the need for a community-based public safety advisory board, which was slated to start in September, he said.\n\n\"Hiring, training, policies and accountability must be examined and proactively addressed to ensure that every person is respected while the community is protected,\" Woods said. \"We expect, and will accept, nothing less.\"\n\nReach public safety reporter Bree Burkitt at bburkitt@republicmedia.com or at 602-444-8515.

      "text": "What do the statistics, not the stereotypes, about killings by the police tell us?\n\nANOTHER VIEW: Research on police actions was misrepresented\n\nDuring my civil rights career,  I was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream that people be judged by the content of their character. Now, however, when it comes to the police, that ideal is discarded.\n\nConsider the following propositions:\n\nOn July 7, 2016, Micah Johnson, a Black man, shot dead five white Dallas police officers . This \"proves\" that Black men are violent, racist individuals who seek out and kill white police officers.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, a white Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd , a handcuffed Black man, until he died. A second white officer and a Black officer immobilized Floyd . An Asian American police officer stood by . This \"proves\" that police officers are violent, racist individuals who seek out and kill Black people.\n\nBoth of the above propositions are stereotypes. Stereotypes, preconceptions that describe a group, are never true for the group as a whole, and often are true for only a tiny percentage of that group.\n\nStereotypes are used to justify discrimination and violence. Michael Johnson wanted to kill white officers because of police killings of Black people, law enforcement officials alleged.\n\nWhile no serious person believes the first stereotype, we are being told that the second one is true. A Black CNN commentator indicated that if a detained Black man does not fight the police \"we die.\" Sen. Cory Booker claimed that \"many\" \"mostly unarmed\" Black men were \"being murdered by police officers.\"\n\nIs it true?\n\nA 2016 Harvard researcher's study found that Black people are no more likely to be killed by police officers than are white people. A 2019 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found \"no evidence of anti-Black ... disparities across\" fatal shootings by police. Both white and Black people are far more likely to be murdered by an acquaintance of their own race than they are to be shot dead by the police.\n\nTO READERS: After this essay was published, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study referenced in the paragraph above was retracted .\n\nThere are millions of interactions between Black people and police annually, including about 2 million arrests.\n\nIn 2019, 1,004 people, mostly white, were shot dead by the police , according to the Washington Post.  Assuming that an average of one police officer is involved per killing, then 1,004 police officers, or fourteen-hundredths of 1% of America's 700,000 police officers , were involved in fatal police shootings. Obviously, the typical police officer will never kill anyone in his career.\n\nA Washington Post database shows that 14 Black and 25 white \"unarmed\" Americans were shot dead by police in 2019. An analysis that was broadcast on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" of 10 of the \"unarmed\" Black decedents showed that for five of these persons, calling them unarmed is misleading: two had cars, one had a stun gun, and two others had guns, authorities said. In those two cases where the decedents had guns, which were the only cases where the weapons were not used to assault police, the officers faced homicide charges.\n\nEven if the remaining deaths were criminal, they do not add up to a narrative of numerous police officers indiscriminately murdering unarmed Black men. Neither do all Black detainees die unless they resist arrest. Indeed, the odds of any unarmed person being shot dead by police are less than their odds of being struck by lightning.\n\nDonald W.

      "text": "Police shootings aren't just a 'local matter'\n\nIn the space of 10 days, two more unarmed black men died at the hands of police - one in Sacramento, another in Houston - and two Baton Rouge police officers escaped being charged in the 2016 shooting death of another black man.\n\nThe incidents have revived outrage over an issue that nationwide protests shined a spotlight on in 2014: the disproportionate number of unarmed black men killed by police.\n\nThe earlier shootings energized the Black Lives Matter movement. President Obama and his Justice Department helped defuse tensions by investigating some of the shootings and finding systemic racial bias in police departments in cities from Ferguson, Mo., to Baltimore to Chicago. And for a time, Americans sat up and paid attention.\n\nBut promises made back then have mostly fallen by the wayside. And it is as tragic as it is inexcusable that so little has changed.\n\nStephon Clark was buried Thursday in Sacramento, 11 days after he was killed by city police who pursued him after reports of a man vandalizing vehicles in Clark's neighborhood. Within seconds of shouting, \"Show me your hands. Gun! Gun! Gun!\" two officers fired 20 shots . Twenty shots.\n\nOnly there was no gun - just  a cellphone found by the body of the father of two, who was killed in his grandmother's backyard. Timothy Davis, president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association, asserted that \" the shooting was legally justified \" and that Clark \"took a shooting stance and pointed an object at the police officers.\"\n\nActually, the shooting is still under investigation, and no conclusions have been reached. One of the officers commented minutes after the shooting that Clark \"kind of approached us hands out and then fell down.\" Nothing about a \"shooting stance.\" Another question: Why did body cam audio go mute minutes after the shooting?\n\nClark's death is no singular event. Days later in Houston, another unarmed black man, who'd been standing in a busy intersection with his pants down, was shot by an officer seconds later. No body cam this time. But the man's family reported that he'd been depressed since his two children drowned.\n\nThis year already, 263 people have been fatally shot by police nationally. That's about three per day and on track to repeat the death toll - nearly 1,000 annually - in recent years, according to a Washington Post database, which does not attempt to distinguish between justified and unjustified shootings.\n\nEven for those viewed as unjustified, few police officers are ever held accountable. Since 2005, just 85 officers have been charged with a crime. Less than 40% have been convicted, some on lesser charges.\n\nNews organizations are far ahead of the government when it comes to tracking this important issue. The federal government can tell you that 72 \"non-juvenile spotted owls\" were identified in a 2016 survey. But the FBI can't say how many people died at the hands of police.\n\nDespite community and national outrage, President Trump's spokeswoman made his stance clear Wednesday: Such shootings are a \"local matter.\"\n\nThey are anything but. Such shootings taint all honorable, hard-working police officers and put them in more danger. More broadly, civil rights - including the right to live - are a national matter. If minorities are being killed disproportionately, the federal government has a duty to help hold those responsible to account and to end this scourge.\n\nNo longer should black families cry out in anguish, as Clark's grandmother did this week, and have to beg, \"Please give us justice.\"\n\nIf you can't see the below poll, please refresh your story page."

      "text": "No punishment for police who kill unarmed black men\n\nWASHINGTON - Watch the video. Walter Scott, unarmed and slow of foot, tries to run away. Police officer Michael Slager calmly fires five rounds into Scott's back. Later, Slager approaches Scott's body, not to give first aid but apparently to plant evidence of a struggle that never took place.\n\nNow tell me: How cheap is black life in these United States of America?\n\nA jury in North Charleston, South Carolina, could not agree that Slager committed a crime, forcing the judge in the case to declare a mistrial. Prosecutors quickly announced they will try Slager again. In the optimistic view, this week's stunning result, or non-result, means justice deferred rather than justice denied. I'm trying to be an optimist, but at the moment it's not easy.\n\nTell me: What does it take to get a police officer punished for killing an unarmed black man in cold blood?\n\nThe whole thing is on video, people. A passerby named Feidin Santana used his mobile phone to capture Scott's final minutes. An immigrant from the Dominican Republic, Santana gave lengthy testimony at Slager's trial.\n\n\"You ask yourself, what if there was no video? What if I wasn't there? Would we have gotten this far in this trial?\" Santana asked in an ABC News interview after the mistrial was announced. \"That's the way justice is over here, and we have to understand it. But it's a little bit disappointing.\"\n\nSantana's phrase \"over here\" refers to the nation that fancies itself a beacon of freedom and equality.\n\nThe fatal encounter took place April 4, 2015, when Slager, who is white, pulled Scott over for having a busted brake light. African-Americans and Hispanics are used to such petty, harassing traffic stops. White Americans, perhaps not so much.\n\nSlager testified that he feared for his life; Scott, he claimed, had wrestled away his Taser and was trying to use it on him. But Santana, who saw the whole thing, said there was no struggle -- and the video appears to show Slager placing the Taser next to Scott's body, as if it had been in the dead man's possession. If he did stage the crime scene, the officer demonstrated full awareness of his own culpability. Again, I ask, what does it take?\n\nEven if you want to believe Slager's unsupported account of a struggle, no one can dispute the fact that Scott was running away when Slager gunned him down. A heavyset 50-year-old with no weapons, running as if through molasses, is hardly a clear and present danger to society. Having a broken light on one's car is hardly a capital offense. Yet Slager shot Scott five times. In the back.\n\nNearly half the population of North Charleston is black; Slager's jury included 11 whites and just one African-American. Notes from the jury to the judge, who is African-American, suggest there may have been one lone holdout who would not vote to convict Slager of murder or manslaughter. That's how the system works, and the outcome of Slager's next trial may be different. But still.\n\nOne miscarriage of justice, caused by one stubborn juror, would be easier to swallow if not for all the rest. Eric Garner, approached by police on Staten Island for selling loose cigarettes, was choked to death -- again on video -- but none of the officers involved has been charged. Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy, was playing with a toy gun; a police officer shot him dead within seconds of arriving on scene but faced no charges. Michael Brown was unarmed when a police officer stopped him in Ferguson, Missouri; the officer fired his weapon 12 times, killing Brown, but a grand jury failed to indict him.\n\nNo one should wonder why the Black Lives Matter movement is so relevant and necessary. It will remain so until black lives do, in fact, matter. And conservatives who claim to champion individual liberty against abusive state power should be the movement's most avid supporters.\n\nSlager also faces federal charges for allegedly violating Scott's civil rights. That prosecution was delayed pending the completion of the state trial; now that there is to be a second state trial, presumably the federal case will be put off once again.\n\nSo it will likely fall to Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. - President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general -- to decide whether to move forward with a trial in federal court. Sessions was once denied a federal judgeship because of racist remarks he had made; friends and supporters say that's all ancient history. We shall see.\n\nEugene Robinson's email address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com."

      "text": "FACTBOX-U.S. police officers who kill unarmed black men often avoid criminal liability\n\nManage your account\n\nJuly 16 (Reuters) - A New York City policeman became the latest example of a law enforcement officer to face no criminal liability for killing an unarmed black man when the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday it would not prosecute him in the July 17, 2014 killing of Eric Garner with a prohibited chokehold. Garner, 43, died after Daniel Pantaleo, a white police officer, used a chokehold as police attempted to arrest him on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on a sidewalk. The following are outcomes of some other highly publicized cases in recent years: TERENCE CRUTCHER Betty Shelby, a white police officer, was captured on video fatally shooting a 40-year-old black man, Terence Crutcher, as he stood near his car on Sept. 16, 2016, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Shelby said she feared Crutcher was reaching for a gun but he had no weapon. A jury acquitted Shelby of first-degree manslaughter the following year, and she resigned. PHILANDO CASTILE Officer Jeronimo Yanez shot a 32-year-old black man, Philando Castile, five times during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, on July 6, 2016. The officer said he had feared for his life when Castile said he was carrying a firearm and reached for his wallet when Yanez asked to see identification. Yanez was acquitted of manslaughter in 2017. SAMUEL DUBOSE University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing fatally shot black motorist Samuel DuBose, 43, after stopping him for a missing front license plate in July 2015. Tensing, who is white, said he feared for his life during the traffic stop when DuBose refused to leave his vehicle, which started rolling forward slowly. Tensing pulled his gun and fired once. A state jury was unable to reach a verdict on murder and manslaughter charges in November 2016 and a retrial in 2017 also ended in a hung jury. MICHAEL BROWN Darren Wilson, a white police officer, shot Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9, 2014. The killing sparked nearly two weeks of protests and rioting that subsided at the family's urging just before Brown's funeral. A state grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute him. Wilson is no longer with the police force. FREDDIE GRAY In Baltimore, a 25-year-old black man, Freddie Gray, was arrested on April 12, 2015 after police said he fled the scene unprovoked in a high crime area while in possession of an illegal switchblade. After being transported in a police van, Gray was hospitalized unconscious and died on April 19 of what was determined to be a neck injury. Six Baltimore police officers, including three who are black, where charged with Gray's death. None were convicted, and the U.S. Department of Justice subsequently decided not to bring charges against them. TAMIR RICE Timothy Loehmann, a white police officer, shot Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy who was displaying a toy gun, in Cleveland, Ohio, on Nov. 22, 2014. A grand jury declined to indict Loehmann and another officer at the scene. Loehmann was later fired from the police department for concealing information in his original job application. WALTER SCOTT Michael Slager, a white police officer, was caught on video shooting a 50-year-old unarmed black man, Walter Scott, in the back after a traffic stop in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 4, 2015. After a state murder trial ended with a deadlocked jury, Slager pleaded guilty to federal charges that he violated Scott's civil rights and was sentenced in 2017 to 20 years in prison.

      "text": "Phoenix police officer shoots dead unarmed black man during scuffle\n\nManage your account\n\nBy Daniel Wallis (Reuters) - A Phoenix police officer shot to death an unarmed black man during a struggle and authorities said the officer believed the individual had a gun, in the latest fatal incident amid national turmoil over the policing of black communities. The Phoenix Police Department said Rumain Brisbon, 34, was sitting in a black Cadillac SUV outside a convenience store on Tuesday evening, and that two witnesses told the officer the occupants of the vehicle were selling drugs. With police forces across the country under increased scrutiny over killings of unarmed black men, Phoenix police said in a statement that its officer called for backup, and then saw Brisbon appear to remove something from the car's back seat. It said the officer, a seven-year veteran of the department, gave him several commands to show his hands, before Brisbon \"placed one or both hands in his waistband area\" and then fled. The officer chased and caught up with him, it said, and during a struggle the policeman believed he felt the handle of a gun while holding the individual's hand in his pocket. \"The officer gave the suspect several commands to get on the ground but he refused to comply, yelling profanities at the officer,\" said the police statement issued on Wednesday. At that point a resident opened an apartment door and both men stumbled into her home, it said, adding that the officer was unable to keep a grip on the suspect's hand. \"Fearing Brisbon had a gun in his pocket the officer fired two rounds striking Brisbon in the torso,\" it said. The police department said the back-up officers arrived after the shooting, and while they and members of the fire department treated Brisbon, he was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said Brisbon was carrying a vial of oxycodone pills, and that a semi-automatic handgun and a jar of what is believed to be marijuana were found in the SUV. The 30-year-old officer was not injured during the incident, the statement added. The shooting in Phoenix comes at a tense time between U.S. law enforcement and the communities in which they operate. Two grand jury decisions not to indict officers who killed unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and in New York City have triggered racially charged protests throughout the United States.

      "text": "Armed and Black. How a group of men licensed to carry guns say they are seeking racial justice\n\nManage your account\n\nBefore he drove to the grocery store parking lot, Romeal Taylor did the same thing he's done every day this summer - he holstered his 9-millimeter handgun to the waistband of his gym shorts until he could feel it hug his right hip.\n\nWhen he arrived at the store in north Minneapolis he spotted six other Black men, some in tactical gear, armed with Glock 23s and Smith & Wesson M&Ps. One of them beamed when he spotted Taylor and hugged him.\n\n\"Bro, good to see you,\" Taylor said, muffled through a face mask.\n\nThey had come together for a meet-and-greet to introduce themselves to the community, marking one of the first public gatherings of the Minnesota Freedom Fighters.\n\nThe ad hoc group of about two dozen men - including a retired firefighter, a healthcare worker and a veteran - formed in the days after George Floyd's killing in response to the local NAACP chapter putting out a call for residents in predominantly Black north Minneapolis to protect small businesses from destruction as fires and unrest engulfed the city.\n\nHeeding the call, the men - who would meet at a local cafe - stood watch outside small businesses for several nights in late May and early June. More recently, they have patrolled neighborhoods, offering security to protesters, and have been in regular communication with city officials about protests they plan to attend.\n\n\"It's important to have men from the community step up for the community,\" said Sasha Cotton, director of the city's Office of Violence Prevention. \"It's their right to be out on the streets and it's commendable. There are Black residents who in the early days of the unrest felt vulnerable ... and still do.\"\n\nCotton said the Freedom Fighters have also met with Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who is Black, and they're in touch with precinct commanders.\n\nA spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department declined repeated requests for comment. At a summer Freedom Fighters event, a patrol officer stopped and posed for selfies with members of the group during a 30-minute visit.\n\nLeslie Redmond, president of the Minneapolis National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said she is happy the men are armed and wants them to grow as community leaders.\n\n\"These brothers were there in the beginning, when threats were being made by white supremacists,\" she said. \"There is no doubt they stepped up for the community.\"\n\nTaylor and other members view the group as a way to provide safety for peaceful protesters. But they also understand that Black men armed with legally registered guns are viewed differently by many in law enforcement and other parts of society than, say, white militia members who stormed state capitols waving their firearms without repercussions in recent months.\n\nNonetheless, he said, \"We are like any other American.... We have the right to bear arms.\"\n\nMonths after Floyd was killed in Minneapolis police custody, as national unrest over police brutality toward Black people has mixed with partisan politics, deadly incidents have occurred in Kenosha, Wis., and Portland, Ore., involving armed, self-styled civilian security operatives.\n\nIn Kenosha, Kyle Rittenhouse, a white Illinois teenager who traveled across state lines with a military-style rifle, is accused of killing two white men who were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was struck multiple times in the back during an arrest. Rittenhouse was not apprehended by police at the scene but was arrested later on homicide charges; his attorneys argue the 17-year-old was acting in self-defense.\n\nNear Portland, meanwhile, Michael Reinoehl, 48, a white man who had provided armed security to protesters, was killed by federal agents in a hail of gunfire as they sought to arrest him in the shooting death of a member of a far-right group. Before his death, which government agents claim occurred when he pulled out a weapon as they confronted him, Reinoehl had told a reporter that he had acted to protect the life of a companion when the man he shot attempted to attack them.\n\nMembers of the Freedom Fighters say their objective is to avoid confrontations by working hand in hand with authorities and making clear that they are prepared to defend their community. They also say they aim to de-escalate situations so that police do not get involved, because calling the police has sometimes led to encounters in which unarmed Black men have been killed.\n\nBecause of its cooperation with city officials, the group is not fearful the police will attack them. In their view, they are an added layer of security in the community.\n\nThe Freedom Fighters' mission statement reads: \"Our objective is not to be the police, but the bridge to link the police and the community together.\"\n\nIn addition to marching in the streets of their hometown, some have traveled to Louisville, Ky., in support of protesters demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old Black woman who was shot to death inside her apartment in March by police carrying out a no-knock warrant.\n\nAmid calls for justice and an end to systemic racism, dozens of armed Black groups have sprung up across the nation. Such groups have marched through city streets in Atlanta and Detroit and have gathered at Stone Mountain in Georgia.\n\nAfter Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man, was shot to death after being confronted by white men while out for a jog in a Georgia neighborhood in February, members of a Black militia group called NFAC - the full name of the coalition uses an expletive to explain that they're not messing around - showed up with long guns and tactical vests in Brunswick, Ga. Weeks later, some 1,500 members went to Stone Mountain, calling for the removal of Confederate monuments there and elsewhere. The group, along with other protesters, engaged in a peaceful march.\n\nRecently, similar groups have patrolled gatherings in Kenosha, where protesters demand justice for Blake.\n\nWhile armed Black groups hark back to the 1960s Black Panther movement and its armed citizen patrols, the modern iterations by and large do not share the same policing-the-police viewpoint.\n\nThe fate of the Black Panthers serves as a case study for the long-standing risks felt by Black men who legally carry firearms. Local and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, ceaselessly surveilled the group and wound up shooting to death some of its leaders, including Fred Hampton in Chicago.\n\nOutrage by white society to the Panthers carrying weapons, which they had lawfully purchased to conduct armed patrols of predominantly Black Oakland neighborhoods, was such that then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan signed a gun control measure known as the Mulford Act that prohibited Californians from carrying loaded firearms to protests.\n\nAt this point, 36% of white people nationwide own a gun, according to the Pew Research Center, compared with 24% of Black people.\n\nFears concerning Black gun ownership are nonetheless a raw reality for many people in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a nearby suburb in 2016, Philando Castile, who had a licensed firearm, was killed by police during a traffic stop after he let an officer know that he had a legal weapon.\n\n:::\n\nFor Romeal Taylor, 28, who works as an overnight security guard at a local hotel, owning a gun has always been about personal protection. For the last six years, he's carried a firearm with him anytime he goes out in public. He understands he can be viewed as a threat, but he's also a trained and proud gun owner.\n\n\"There is a lot going on out here in the world,\" he said. \"I would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it.\"\n\nDays after Floyd was killed, Taylor said, he heard from neighbors in north Minneapolis about a call to action for licensed gun owners to protect local businesses from vandalism and destruction. The call resonated with him, he said, because he had been frustrated to see people he didn't recognize from his neighborhood destroying buildings.\n\n\"These weren't Black folks,\" he said. \"These were outsiders truly intent on destroying this city.\"\n\nThe group's headquarters was Sammy's Avenue Eatery along a bustling thoroughfare.\n\nIt's where Taylor met Randy Chrisman and other local Black gun owners like himself. Chrisman, who lives in the suburbs, read the NAACP call to action on Facebook and showed up at the cafe.\n\n\"It's been a brotherhood ever since,\" said Chrisman, who has had his concealed carry permit for nearly a decade and typically carries his handgun with him.\n\n\"You just never know when something is going to happen,\" he said. \"As a Black man, I have the same rights as others to also carry a firearm and I do it.\"\n\nIn the evenings after Floyd's death, Chrisman would leave his job at a restaurant in the suburbs and drive into the city. He can still hear the sound of the National Guard Humvees barreling past him and the hum of helicopters overhead as he holstered his Glock. He had to work to steel his nerves during their long nights of patrolling.\n\n\"You have to be prepared to take action if needed,\" Chrisman said. \"It's something I'm ready to do. I don't want to, of course, but I'm ready if needed.\"\n\nDuring the patrols and at backyard barbecues and other events they've held together, the men have formed a kinship, giving one another nicknames, such as \"Sarge\" and \"Roach.\" They feel lucky to have found one another - a group of like-minded thinkers who value their right to bear arms and support racial equity, but who don't view the police as the enemy.\n\n\"This is about filling the gap we see between police and community.... It's really about harm reduction,\" said Robert Sayers, a fire inspector for the city of Minneapolis and member of the Freedom Fighters.\n\nSayers got involved after witnessing outside groups - white supremacists, he says - burning properties around the area where Floyd was killed. He wanted to help protect Black-owned businesses.\n\n\"We could not and still cannot allow destruction in the city,\" the 52-year-old said.\n\nOthers in the community see the Freedom Fighters as allies.\n\nThe Rev. Tim Christopher, whose church is in north Minneapolis, has a concealed carry permit and packs during church service on Sundays. Christopher, who has testified at the state Capitol in St. Paul in recent years in support of the 2nd Amendment, says he felt comforted the first time he saw members of the Freedom Fighters in his neighborhood.\n\n\"It's been a breath of fresh air,\" he said. \"Seeing an armed Black man - knowing he is here to take care of the community, nurture the community - is a blessing.\"\n\nBut Christopher also knows the risks of carrying as a Black man.\n\nWhen he drives while carrying his handgun, he thinks about Castile and others like him. If he gets stopped by police, he said, he doesn't tell them he has a firearm until they ask.\n\n\"At that point, my hands are on the steering wheel and I say, 'Yes, officer, I have a firearm and it's legal,'\" he said. \"They always back up and place a hand on their gun.... There is a stigma, and they're scared of Black men with guns.\"\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Christopher stood with the Freedom Fighters in a grocery store parking lot. Some of the guys grilled hot dogs and burgers as R&B played in the background. Kids screamed as they played tag near an inflatable playhouse that was flapping in the afternoon breeze.\n\n\"We want to show all the good we can do for and in the community,\" Taylor said.\n\nLater, one of the Freedom Fighters handed printouts of group photos the men took in the days after Floyd's death. They showed the group armed - AR-15s, Glocks, tactical vests, bandannas - near the intersection where Floyd was killed.\n\nA little boy gripped one of the printouts and looked up at Taylor with a pen.\n\n\"Oh, he wants your autograph,\" said the boy's mother.\n\nAs Taylor leaned over and swiftly signed the back of the photo, he turned to the young child's mother.\n\n\"Be sure to let us know if you all ever needed anything, for real,\" he told her.\n\nShe nodded and clinched her fist in a salute.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times ."

(Reuters) - Newly released video footage of police killing an unarmed black man in a barrage of gunfire in Sacramento, California, left the mayor \"horrified\" and sparked street protests on Thursday that gridlocked traffic in the state capital for hours. Police said the video, captured by body cameras worn by officers involved in Sunday night's confrontation, showed the victim, Stephon Clark, 22, holding an object that later turned out to be a cell phone as he was shot 20 times. The video was released by police late on Wednesday and it soon went viral on the internet. Sunday's shooting was the latest in a series of killings of unarmed black men by police across the United Stated since 2014 that has sparked a national debate about racial bias in the criminal justice system and the use of lethal force. More than 200 demonstrators gathered on Thursday to denounce the shooting in a protest organized by the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests were orderly and police allowed a group of demonstrators to march onto Interstate 5 at the height of the commuter rush hour as they blocked all southbound lanes. Traffic was backed up on the highway, and through much of the downtown area, for hours. The crowd then marched on to the state capitol building before converging outside the Golden 1 Center basketball arena, preventing many fans waiting to see a game between the Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks from getting in to the event. \"It's a loss of one night's entertainment for me, but this family will feel this loss forever,\" season ticket holder Frank Andersen, a 70-year-old retiree from Elk Grove, California, said as he walked with his wife to their car. The Kings later issued a statement asking those fans to return home and promising refunds for their tickets. Hours earlier, Mayor Darrell Steinberg told reporters he was appalled by video of the shooting. \"Like any compassionate person, I was horrified by the death of a young Sacramento man who we later found out had two kids,\" Steinberg told a news conference. \"What was my reaction? It was horrible.\" Protesters marched into City Hall during the day shouting \"It's a phone, not a gun\" and demanded to see the police chief. \"I have four grandbabies who are black and I don't want them taken,\" said protester Tami Collins, 47, who is white. Sacramento police said the shooting stemmed from a report of someone breaking car windows in a residential area where officers later found three damaged vehicles. Police said the suspect was also seen from a helicopter shattering a glass door of a house before jumping a fence into a yard next door. The video from police body cameras showed two officers chase Clark through the dark with their flashlights and turn the corner of a house to face him in the backyard, yelling: \"Show me your hands\" and \"gun\" before they opened fire. The officers had seen Clark \"advance forward with his arms extended and holding an object,\" which they mistakenly believed was a gun, police said. Officers waited five minutes after the shooting until backup arrived before approaching Clark to help him, police said. The encounter unfolded behind Clark's grandparents' home, where he was staying, according to the Sacramento Bee newspaper, which spoke to his relatives. Sacramento prosecutors were investigating the incident. (Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in LOS ANGELES; Editing by Leslie Adler and Paul Tait)"

      "text": "Horrific Body Cam Footage Shows Fatal Police Shooting of Andre Hill\n\nManage your account\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio-Authorities here have identified 47-year-old Andre Maurice Hill as the unarmed Black man shot and killed by police earlier this week, with body-cam video showing the cop opening fire on him in the garage of a home he was visiting.\n\nAdam Coy, the officer who carried out the shooting , has a remarkably dense history of complaints against him, including a 2012 excessive force case that led to a $45,000 city payout to a victim.\n\nCoy, 44, was responding to a complaint about a man and an SUV early Tuesday morning. Body-camera footage from one of the officers, released Wednesday and published below, shows police approaching Hill. Because the officers had not enabled their body cameras before the shooting, there is no audio of the incident before Coy opens fire.\n\nThe footage shows Hill turning around to face the officers. He holds a cell phone in his left hand, with the illuminated screen out, as if to show what he is holding. Shots are heard. In audio that begins after those shots, Coy shouts at another officer not to approach Hill, who is laying on the garage floor, because Coy cannot see the man's left hand. He shouts at Hill to \"put your fucking hands out to the side\" and to \"roll on your stomach, now.\"\n\nEventually, Coy takes one of Hill's arms and rolls him onto his back. Though Hill is immobile, Coy does not immediately give him aid.\n\nColumbus Cop Fatally Shoots Unarmed Black Man, Turns on Body-Cam After\n\nNeither Coy nor the Columbus Police Department immediately responded to requests for comment. A police report for the incident is short and grim. \"Officer discharged his firearm upon confronting Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill did not survive his injuries,\" it reads.\n\nCoy is a 19-year veteran of Columbus's police force. But his tenure has been marked with complaints, including allegations of excessive force. His is just part of a remarkably opaque local history of police violence, including the killing of 23-year-old Black man Casey Goodson by a sheriff's deputy just weeks ago.\n\nGoodson's funeral was being held on Wednesday, nearly concurrent to the release of footage showing the killing of Hill.\n\nPaisha Thomas, 46, an artist and racial-justice activist based in Columbus, said the local criminal justice system needs top-down reform, calling for the resignation of Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther and Police Chief Thomas Quinlan. Both men described the fatal shooting of Hill as a disturbing one even before body-cam footage was released, a testament to official awareness of the potential for local outrage to boil over.\n\n\"I think one of the things we need to do right now is get rid of Quinlan. He needs to be fired for gross negligence,\" Thomas told The Daily Beast. \"Ginther has known about this problem, about the egregious, excessive use of force by Columbus Police, before he even took office. They gotta go. They need to be fired.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mayor Ginther called for Coy to be fired, indicating that several minutes passed after the shooting before Hill got medical attention.\n\nAs Coy opened fire, \"I heard 'pop, pop, pop,'\" the neighbor who called 911 about the SUV previously told The Daily Beast . \"No glass, no screams. I said, 'What the hell's going on out here?'\"\n\nAudio of the 911 call, reviewed by The Daily Beast, reveals the neighbor complaining about the SUV idling. He said he hadn't gone out to inspect the situation. \"I'd go out there, but I don't want to get in trouble,\" the caller told 911 with a short chuckle. \"I don't have a gun.\"\n\nWarning: The police body-cam footage below is graphic and disturbing.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio announced on Wednesday that he will review the shooting for potential federal civil rights violations. He will not have to look very hard for evidence of past misconduct.\n\nDuring a drunk-driving stop in October 2012, Coy punched a man, slammed him on the ground, and repeatedly bashed his head into the hood of his car while the man was handcuffed. The incident, witnessed by a college student and Coy's own dashboard camera, was so bad the victim was awarded a $45,000 settlement from the city.\n\nAn internal police investigation found that the driver did not appear to be resisting arrest in the first place.\n\n\"To me, we have to be concerned about somebody from the outside looking in to this type of behavior,\" Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs told Coy during a disciplinary hearing, reported by the Columbus Dispatch . \"You are not allowed to use force that's unnecessary and unreasonable. You have to control yourself.\"\n\nStill, Coy remained on the force, following a 160-hour suspension.\n\nOther incidents have dotted Coy's professional record. The Dispatch reported nine complaints against him in 2003, alone. He received written counseling for those incidents.\n\nA Daily Beast review of Coy's Internal Affairs Bureau file reveal more than 180 complaints against him since he joined the force. Most were labeled as unfounded, unsustained, or within the allowed limits of police force. But at least 16 reports were marked as sustained.\n\nAmong them are six complaints of Coy engaging in \"rude or discourteous language or actions\" during arrests or questioning. Five complaints related to a \"violation of police rules, orders, etc.\" during arrests or questioning are also marked as sustained.\n\nThe fatal shooting, from an officer with a history of complaints, is emblematic of Columbus's police department, where from 2001 to 2017, just six percent of officers made up half of all police complaints, according to a report from The Appeal .\n\nIn one representative case, just two months before Coy was filmed banging a man's head into a car, two police officers beat a Black college student into unconsciousness while arresting him for what ended up as a littering case. One of his arresting officers had 14 misconduct complaints on her record. Another one of the officers had 40 misconduct complaints, Reuters reported .\n\nMorgan Harper, 36, a Columbus attorney and activist, said the deaths of Hill and Goodson had frayed already-tense relations between the community and police.\n\n\"This is another tragedy, and we as a community are sick of seeing unarmed Black men die at the hands of police,\" she said.\n\nColumbus Police and other local law-enforcement agencies have also been criticized for what advocates say is a notable lack of transparency. Details surrounding the death of Goodson remained in dispute even as his funeral took place on Wednesday, with authorities stating officers shot him after he was seen holding a gun, and family members inside his home at the time of the shooting stating that they did not see him with a weapon. There is no body camera footage of his death.\n\nAdvocates for police reform told Reuters that details on some past incidents were missing-because Columbus Police routinely purge their records every four years.\n\n\"We shred them in various cycles,\" a Columbus Police records custodian told the outlet.\n\nA 19-year veteran of the Columbus Police force like Coy might have worked through four of those cycles.\n\nImmediately following Ginther's press conference, a group of about 20 community activists gathered in front of Columbus City Hall. They pinned a banner to the entrance that read \"Columbus Isn't Safe for Black People.\"\n\nCommunity organizer Hana Abdur-Rahim said the purpose of the gathering was to express solidarity with the families of Hill, Goodson, and others who have lost loved ones to police shootings.\n\n\"Everyone's grieving right now,\" she told The Daily Beast. \"We're connecting with them about how they want us to show up for them.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.

(KDVR) - A jury has found an Aurora police officer liable for using excessive force during a traffic stop.\n\nA civil rights lawsuit was filed after a traffic stop made by Aurora Police on East Iliff Avenue in May 2021 just after midnight. The officers stopped Preston Nunn after they said he had violated the Move Over Law and drove into a lane where officers were conducting a traffic stop.\n\nPrevious coverage: 8 Aurora officers sued in violent arrest caught on body camera video\n\nIn the lawsuit, Nunn's attorney alleged excessive force was used when Nunn reached for his wallet so he could show his license. Nunn's attorneys said the officers unreasonably escalated what should have been a normal traffic stop.\n\nThe stop was recorded by officers' body-worn cameras. Nunn alleged he was tackled, slammed to the ground and choked. He said the actions caused him to be injured in violation of his constitutional rights.\n\nTwo officers were on trial, but just one, Gabriel Nestor, was found liable.\n\nAttorneys for the two officers in closing arguments Friday said the officers used restraint. They said Nunn was angry and was resisting arrest so officers had to use force to get him under control.\n\nFOX31 spoke to Nunn's godfather and attorney after the verdict was read.\n\n\"I'm disappointed. But it's a victory. It's a victory for Preston. It's a victory for the Black community. We fought for years. We fought for you all. We fought for Preston.

(Reuters) - A 24-year-old black man has died after being shot in the head by a Minneapolis police officer over the weekend, officials said on Tuesday, in an incident that has sparked protests and dozens of arrests.\n\nCommunity activists say that Jamar Clark was unarmed and handcuffed when he was shot shortly after midnight on Sunday.\n\nOfficials confirmed Clark was unarmed and said they were still investigating whether he was handcuffed.\n\n\"There were handcuffs on the scene at the time. And we are still examining whether or not they were on Mr. Clark or whether they were just fallen at the scene,\" Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe deaths of unarmed black men and women in encounters with police in the United States over the past year have fueled protests nationwide and rekindled a national civil rights movement called Black Lives Matter.\n\nClark was taken off life support on Monday evening, his family told local media.\n\nThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said in a statement on Tuesday evening that Clark died of a gunshot wound to the head, and reported the time of death as Monday at 9:25 p.m. at the Hennepin County Medical Center.\n\nThe Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a unit of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, will hand the results of its investigation to prosecutors in two to four months, Evans estimated.\n\nA federal civil rights investigation is also taking place.\n\nActivists blocked the entrance of a police precinct following the shooting and briefly flooded an Interstate highway late on Monday, demanding that authorities release video in the shooting.\n\nAt least 50 people were arrested after blocking a section of Interstate 94 that runs through Minneapolis.\n\nEvans said there was no video of the shooting from police dashboard or body cameras. He said investigators are reviewing video from business and security cameras in the area, as well as from witnesses' cellphones, but none of those videos captured the entire incident.\n\nThe footage will not be released as it could taint witness interviews, Evans said.\n\nIn the incident, two Minneapolis police officers responded to a request for assistance from paramedics who reported that an individual disrupted their ability to help an assault victim.\n\nThe BCA said Clark was a suspect in the assault and that there was an altercation between him and the officers before one of them shot him.\n\nThe BCA said the officers' names will be released after they are interviewed by investigators. Both have been placed on administrative leave.\n\n(Additional reporting and writing by Suzannah Gonzales and Fiona Ortiz in Chicago; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown)"

      "text": "Policing mental health: Recent deaths highlight concerns over officer response\n\nManage your account\n\nWalter Wallace Jr., Ricardo Muñoz and Angelo Quinto were all experiencing mental health episodes when they were killed by the police officers their families called for help. Their deaths, along with many other similar cases, are once again highlighting concerns about whether law enforcement is equipped to handle such crises.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 people fatally shot by police have mental illnesses, according to a Washington Post database of fatal U.S. shootings by on-duty police officers. Since 2015, when The Post launched its database, police have fatally shot more than 1,400 people with mental illnesses.\n\nAngela Kimball, national director of advocacy and public policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said she believes the numbers are so high because people in mental health crises do not always respond in ways officers want them to.\n\n\"Police are trained to respond to a situation with a goal of protecting public safety and their own safety,\" she said. \"They are used to using interventions that are designed to contain somebody that is perceived as a danger.\"\n\nJuan Rios, an assistant professor who directs the master of social work program at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, said the statistics are higher for Black men than for other major demographics.\n\nLast month the journal Annals of Epidemiology said in an analysis that police are more likely to shoot and kill unarmed Black men who show signs of mental illness than white men who exhibit similar behaviors.\n\nRios said that is partly because Black men are least likely to get treatment for active mental health diagnoses among major demographics. Men ages 18 to 27 are also less likely to be treated, he said.\n\n\"You intersect all of those factors and you have Black young men who are most at risk who may not be in treatment,\" Rios said. \"And the reality is also Black men are more likely to be deemed as a threat than any other demographic.\"\n\nKimball said that during mental health crises, the presence of police officers, coupled with the uniforms and shouting, is quite often \"counterintuitive\" and that it can lead to tragedy.\n\nAngelo Quinto died in December, days after an incident involving Antioch, California, officers. His family had called the police for help because he was experiencing an episode of paranoia, according to a wrongful death claim .\n\nBy the time officers arrived, Quinto's mother had been able to calm him down. She was holding him in her arms when the officers took him away from her and laid him on his stomach, the complaint says.\n\nOne officer crossed Quinto's leg behind him, while the other placed his knee on Quinto's neck for more than 4 minutes, according to the complaint. Quinto \"became lifeless\" and was taken to a hospital, where he died Dec. 26.\n\nAntioch Police Chief Tammany Brooks has denied that officers used a knee or anything else to put pressure on his neck.\n\nQuinto's mother, Maria Quinto-Collins, told reporters that police handling of the situation was \"absolutely unnecessary.\"\n\n\"I trusted the police, because I thought they knew what they were doing, but he was actually passive and visibly not dangerous or a threat,\" she said at a news conference in February.\n\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, police fatally shot Ricardo Muñoz in September after his sister called for help, saying he had become aggressive.\n\nIn the audio of a 911 call played at a news conference, Muñoz's sister told the dispatcher that he was schizophrenic and bipolar and asked that officials take him to a hospital.\n\nWhen an officer arrived at the home, Muñoz exited with what authorities described as a hunting knife.\n\nLancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said at a news conference that Muñoz \"immediately, and without warning, charged the officer.\" The officer \"ran for his life\" and fired 4 seconds later, killing Muñoz.\n\nThe officer was cleared; Adams said he responded as he had been trained and met \"deadly force with deadly force.\"\n\nMuñoz's sister has questioned why police did not have a different standard for people suffering mental health crises.\n\n\"The right person should have been there,\" Rulennis Muñoz has said. \"The first responder needs to be someone like a caseworker, someone who knows how to deal with this situation so the cops wouldn't be the first person to approach.\"\n\nMuñoz's death echoes the killing in October of Walter Wallace Jr., 27, who was fatally shot by Philadelphia police responding to a call about a mental health crisis.\n\nAnthony Fitzhugh, Wallace's cousin, has said the family knew how to pacify Wallace when he was having an episode.\n\nBut on Oct. 26, they called 911 to request an ambulance in the hope that Wallace, who was bipolar, would receive medical intervention . A police officer arrived first.\n\nThe incident was recorded on cellphone and police body camera video , which showed Wallace, a father of eight children, being fatally shot in front of his mother and neighbors.\n\nIn the police video, an officer yells for Wallace to \"put the knife down now\" as he walks down his front steps with an object in his hand. As Wallace walks across the street still holding what appeared to be a knife, the officer fires multiple rounds.\n\nPolice have said that Wallace was ordered \"several times\" to drop the knife but that he continued to \"advance towards\" them. Officers fired \"multiple times,\" hitting Wallace in the chest and a shoulder, the police department said.\n\nWallace, who was Black, was pronounced dead at a hospital. The officers have been reassigned to restrictive duty pending an investigation, the police department said.\n\nWallace's family has denounced police for using deadly force, saying his wife had relayed his mental health struggles to police at the scene before he was shot. The family's attorney, Shaka Johnson, criticized the officers' handling of a mental health call.\n\nMany law enforcement agencies use the \"Memphis Model\" for crisis intervention training, or CIT. According to the CIT Center at the University of Memphis in Tennessee, it was developed in 1987 after Memphis police fatally shot a man who was threatening people with a knife. The man, who was Black, had a history of mental illness.\n\nThe death sparked outrage in Memphis and calls for a better way to intervene when someone is in a mental health episode.\n\nKimball said the program requires about 40 hours of training in mental health diagnoses, drug use issues and de-escalation tactics. There are more than 2,700 crisis intervention training sites around the country.\n\n\"It's really more of a concept of community engagement. Part of it is about law enforcement developing those connections with homeless shelters and with community mental health systems like hospitals so that everybody is working together,\" Kimball said.\n\nWhile the training is crucial for law enforcement officers, it is \"a workaround for a system that shouldn't be sending law enforcement to a call for a mental health crisis,\" she said.\n\nRios of Seton Hall said he agrees.\n\n\"When we look at why folks are ... more likely to die at the hands of police officers, it's that their training focuses more on marksmanship than it does on mental health support or crisis work,\" he said. \"A badge and gun should not be the first one to address a nonviolent mental health crisis call.\"\n\nRios and his colleague Tom Shea, a former police officer who is director of the Police Graduate Studies Program, are trying to counter that by working with communities on 911 divergence so that in nonviolent situations, people can call mental health professionals before they call police.\n\nRios said they will provide community-based training in deconstructing stigmas.\n\n\"Oftentimes what happens is our own implicit bias says that if there's a Black man who's in distress or in crisis, he must be on drugs, versus a white person who is in distress or in crisis needs help,\" he said. \"So we're looking to educate the community on being more cognitively flexible about who is in distress, who needs help and how to access resources.\"\n\nRios and Shea are working with communities in South Orange, New Jersey, with plans to expand their project elsewhere.\n\nLast year, the Federal Communications Commission formally designated 988 as a nationwide number for mental health crisis and suicide prevention services. The number is set to go live in July 2022.\n\nThe FCC said making 988 the go-to number for suicide prevention and mental health crisis calls \"will make it easier for Americans in crisis to access the help they need.\"\n\nKimball of the National Alliance on Mental Illness said the number will be a good alternative to 911 because \"there's a mobile crisis team of behavioral health professionals who can help defuse the situation, connect people to treatment and get them on a path to recovery.\""

Howard\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A former New York City police officer found guilty of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man should not go to prison, Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Peter Liang was indicted, prosecuted and subsequently convicted by a jury because his reckless actions caused an innocent man to lose his life,\" Thompson said in a statement.\n\n\"There is no evidence, however, that he intended to kill or injure Akai Gurley. When Mr. Liang went into that building that night, he did so as part of his job and to keep the people of Brooklyn and our city safe.\"\n\nLiang, 28, is scheduled to be sentenced before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun on April 14. He faces up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThompson said in comments also filed as a recommendation with the court that Liang should receive five years of probation on condition that he serves six months of home confinement with an electronic monitor. He also recommended that Liang perform 500 hours of community service.\n\n\"Although we disagree with Mr. Thompson on the fundamental issue of Peter's culpability, he deserves praise for his dispassionate and courageous decision that incarceration is not called for in this case,\" Liang's attorneys Pauld Shechtman and Gabriel Chin said in a statement.\n\nLiang, who was on the police force less than a year, was convicted of manslaughter in the Nov. 20, 2014 shooting of 28-year-old Akai Gurley, which occurred in a darkened, Brooklyn public housing stairwell he was patrolling.\n\nGurley's relatives expressed outrage over Thompson's recommendation, saying it \"sends the message that police officers who kill people should not face serious consequences.\"\n\nThe incident sparked protests similar to those over police shootings of other unarmed black men in Maryland, Missouri and other states.\n\nA jury found Liang responsible for firing a bullet that ricocheted off a wall and killed Gurley, who was walking one floor below. A Chinese-American, Liang testified that he was startled by a noise, which caused him to accidentally fire his gun.\n\nAlthough prosecutors at trial argued that it was not an accident, Thompson said the case was about justice, not about revenge. \"As I have said before, there are no winners here,\" said Thompson. \"But the sentence that I have requested is just and fair under the circumstances of this case.\"\n\n(Reporting by Marcus E.

      "text": "Why do US police keep killing unarmed black men?\n\nThere have been large-scale protests against police brutality across the US\n\nRecent high-profile cases of unarmed black men dying at the hands of the US police have sparked protests and civil unrest in several American cities.\n\nThe deaths of Michael Brown , Eric Garner , Walter Scott , and Freddie Gray are - some claim - evidence of long-standing problems with police racism and excessive violence.\n\nFour expert witnesses talk to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme , including the head of President Obama's taskforce on police reform, Charles Ramsey.\n\nSam Sinyangwe is a researcher and activist who started the Mapping Police Violence , external project.\n\nSam Sinyangwe was frustrated by the lack of official statistics on people killed by police officers\n\n\"I'm 24 years old.  I'm a black man. It's incredibly depressing to see people just like me who have been killed.\n\n\"I started the project to provide answers in the wake of the shooting of Mike Brown. It's very heavy to read these stories, and yet it feels like the right work to do.  It's important.\n\n\"There are statistics on all kinds of violent crimes. And yet, when it comes to people being killed by police officers, there's no data on that. So a light bulb went off in my head. I looked at two crowd-sourcing databases which collected all of the names. I then went through the media reports listing each of those people who were killed.\"\n\nHe counted 1,149 people of all ethnic groups killed by the police in 2014.\n\n\"I identified whether they were armed or unarmed. I identified them by race by looking at if there was an obituary or another picture of them online.\n\n\"In the aftermath of Ferguson [where the unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed], there was this big question 'Is this a pattern, is this an isolated incident?' What [my data] shows is that Ferguson is everywhere. All over the country you're seeing black people being killed by police.\"\n\nThe youngest recorded was 12, the oldest 65. More than 100 were unarmed.\n\n\"Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police in the United States than white people. More unarmed black people were killed by police than unarmed white people last year. And that's taking into account the fact that black people are only 14% of the population here.\n\n\"It goes back to this question of how do they perceive young black men? There's something in the US called Vision Zero, a commitment by mayors to achieve zero traffic fatalities in a specified timeframe.\n\n\"We haven't seen mayors step up and make clear commitments to eliminate the level of police violence in their communities. I think that says a lot about the relative value that they place on those constituents' lives.\"\n\nLorie Fridell is an Associate Professor of criminology at the University of South Florida and was director of research at the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\nLorie Fridell cites research showing black people are often assumed to pose a higher threat\n\n\"I'm a white, middle-class professional woman. I enjoy a great deal of privilege. And I certainly have the black crime implicit bias: I am more likely to see threat in African Americans than I would Caucasians.\n\n\"Racial profiling was the number one issue facing police [in the 1990s], and I came to understand two things. Bias in policing was not just a few officers in a few departments; and, overwhelmingly, the police in this country are well-intentioned. I couldn't put those two thoughts together in my head until I was introduced to the science of implicit bias.\n\n\"We all have implicit biases whereby we link groups to stereotypes, possibly producing discriminatory behaviour - even in individuals who are totally against prejudice.\n\n\"The original 'Shoot, Don't Shoot' studies , external have a subject sitting in front a computer monitor and photos pop up very quickly, showing either a white or black man. That man either has a gun in his hand or a neutral object like a cell phone. The subject is told 'if you see a threat, hit the 'shoot' key and if you don't see a threat, hit the 'don't shoot' key'. \"\n\nThe studies suggest that implicit biases affect these actions - for example in some studies people are quicker to 'shoot' an unarmed black man than an unarmed white man. A Department of Justice report released in March looking at the use of deadly force by Philadelphia police , external , supports the idea that police are susceptible to implicit bias:\n\n\"One of the things they looked at is what they called threat perception failure. The officer believed that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case. And these failures were more likely to occur when the subject was black [even if the officers were themselves black or Latino].\n\n\"Officers, like the rest of us, have an implicit bias linking blacks to crime. So the black crime implicit bias might be implicated in some of the use of deadly force against African-Americans in our country.\n\n\"An important message in our training is that stereotypes are based in part on fact, and we have to recognise this because in our country, people of colour are disproportionately represented amongst the people who commit street crime.\n\n\"That does not give you licence to treat every individual in a group as if they fit the stereotype, that's where we go wrong.\"\n\nFormer policeman Seth Stoughton is now a law professor at the University of South Carolina.\n\nSeth Stoughton argues police training should focus more on conflict resolution than the use of force\n\n\"The first rule of law enforcement is to go home at the end of your shift. The key principle is officer survival. That's what all training is designed to promote. But it ends up endangering civilians rather than preserving their safety.\n\n\"The warrior culture - the belief that police officers are soldiers engaged in battle with the criminal element - that has contributed to some shootings that were most likely avoidable.\n\n\"It starts in police recruitment videos that show officers shooting rifles, strapping on hard body armour, using force. That attracts a particular type of candidate, and the Police Academy further entrenches this.\n\n\"It teaches officers to be afraid by telling them that policing is an incredibly dangerous profession.\n\n\"Officers are trained to view every encounter as a potential deadly force incident: you walk up to a person who is loitering outside of a convenience store, their hands are in their pockets. You as the officer begin talking to them, and without saying a word they pull a gun out of their pocket and begin shooting you.\n\n\"Training involves an average of about 60 hours on deadly force - the use of firearms - and just over 60 hours on self-defence. Compare that to de-escalation conflict resolution training: the average there is only eight hours of training, and most of that is classroom-based.\n\n\"When the military is designing a mission, they have in mind the fact that they're going to lose soldiers. The police profession has strongly repudiated that notion. No officer fatalities are acceptable.\n\n\"If all of the states had the same approach and the same numbers of officer-involved homicides as the best states, the states that had the fewest, we could expect about 300 to 600 lives to be saved every year.\"\n\nCharles Ramsey is the Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, and was asked by President Obama to run the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing , external .\n\nCommissioner Ramsey argues that police officers are also the victims of violence\n\n\"We live in a society where everybody wants to point fingers, but we have a lot of deeply-rooted societal problems: poverty, education, poor housing stock.\n\n\"We've got to deal with the issue of extreme poverty. Philadelphia has the highest rate of poverty among US cities. You have an underground economy that supports many of these neighbourhoods - drugs, prostitution, illegal cigarette sales.\n\n\"Why are police in large numbers in some of these neighbourhoods? We have to deal with the reality that there's a disproportionate amount of crime occurring in many of these neighbourhoods.\n\n\"We've had several police officers shot and killed during the past seven years.  I've had eight officers killed in the line of duty - five shot dead. So there is violence that takes place against police as well, and that needs to be taken into consideration.\"\n\nTo tackle the problem, he has divided Philadelphia into separate areas with their own teams:\n\n\"They have monthly community meetings to talk about crime and disorder. Cadets that come out of the academy are assigned to foot patrol right away, they don't automatically go into cars. So that they actually get to know people in these challenged communities, good folks that are there entrapped in certain conditions.\"\n\nIn response to the Department of Justice report criticising Philadelphia police's use of force, Commissioner Ramsey introduced new training that focuses on de-escalation, as well as armed response:\n\n\"Putting them in scenarios where they have to exercise good judgement and being able to critique that so that when they are in these real live situations, their reaction, their response, is really more consistent with what the actual threat is.\"\n\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 1205 GMT/1305 BST.

      "text": "Tyre Nichols: Memphis reckons with murder charges for black officers\n\nAt the VIP Barbershop less than a mile away from where Tyre Nichols was attacked by five Memphis Police officers, PJ, the shop's owner, described the moment he realised that Mr Nichols was from his community.\n\nHe recognised him as the quiet young man who would skate through his shop's parking lot.\n\n\"He would ride his skateboard with headphones on, just coasting and minding his business,\" he said. \"He never bothered anyone.\"\n\nAs PJ spoke about Mr Nichols, 29, his violent death and the video of his beating that's soon to be released, the barbershop's lunchtime crowd nodded in agreement.\n\n\"It's a shame, it's embarrassing,\" said a man named London, adding that it's painful to add yet another name to the long list of unarmed black men killed by police.\n\nMore difficult to discuss perhaps, was the race of the police officers themselves. All five of the men, now facing murder charges, are black too.\n\n\"I heard a couple of them were just standing around looking instead of saying, 'Hey man don't do that, stop!' You're just as guilty if you just stand there and let that happen,\" PJ said.\n\nIt makes Mr Nichols' death feel different, he added.\n\nIt looked different, too, from some of the most infamous cases of police violence or killings involving black victims and primarily white officers: Rodney King in Los Angeles, Michael Brown in Ferguson, and George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nBut experts on race and policing told the BBC that the involvement of black officers in Mr Nichols' death was unsurprising.\n\n\"I wasn't surprised because Memphis is a majority black city,\" said Alexis Hoag-Fordjour, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and co-director of the Center for Criminal Justice. She practised law in Memphis for a decade. \"The elected officials, those that work for the city, the county, there's a lot of black leadership.\"\n\nIndeed, under Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis - the first black woman to serve in that role for the city - the majority of the force is black, according to the city's website.\n\nBut there is no clear answer as to why these officers attacked Mr Nichols and how, exactly, the race of all six men may have led to his death.\n\nChief Davis told the BBC News she still struggles to explain what happened, two weeks after she first saw the video of Mr Nichols' beating.\n\n\"The mentality of what I saw, it's very difficult to explain,\" she said, adding that she \"can't answer\" if the encounter would have ended differently had Mr Nichols been white. \"It doesn't matter what colour these officers were, doesn't matter what colour the driver was. If you look at the video, race has nothing to do with it,\" she said.\n\nMr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, told the BBC that it was the race of the victim - in this case her son - and not the race of the perpetrators that mattered.\n\n\"It's not about the colour of the police officer. We don't care if it's black, white, pink, purple. What they did was wrong,\" she said.\n\n\"And what they're doing to the black communities is wrong. We're not worried about the race of the police officer. We're worried about the conduct of the police officers.\"\n\nProfessor Hoag agrees. The race of police officers is not the primary issue, she said. Instead, it's a problem of policing.\n\n\"Policing in this country is focused on control, subordination and violence - regardless of the race of the officer,\" she said. \"Society views black people as inherently dangerous and criminal... even if you have black people in the position of law enforcement, that doesn't mean that proposition goes away.\"\n\nAccording to data collection by Mapping Police Violence, black people in the US are approximately three times more likely to be killed in comparison to their white counterparts.\n\nThe picture is less clear on the race of officers who perpetrate police brutality.\n\n\"We do know that there is more anti-black bias among white officers than black officers but we also know that black people and black officers have anti-black bias too. We're talking about a difference in degree,\" said Khalil Gibran Muhammad a professor of race and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nThe Stanford prison experiment tells us that \"bad things happen in places built to do bad things\", he said. \"Anyone who dons the uniform is more likely on average to engage in abusive behaviour directed toward a black person.\"\n\nRodney King, in his memoir, talked about being abused by white and black officers alike.\n\nFrank Sykes, a former Tennessee deputy sheriff, who is also African American, told the BBC this abusive behaviour comes down to how officers are trained - something that caused him to leave the force.\n\nOfficers \"will judge a person off a look because you've been trained if 'they look this way, they're bad'\", he said. Until Americans take a closer look at how officers are taught, he said, these tragic incidents of police brutality would continue to happen.\n\n\"It's bigger than just the personal officers, it's something that within the whole process of training, that keeps pushing these things to happen,\" he said. \"And it's going to continue creating the same outcome of us vs them.\"\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the family of Mr Nichols held a press conference. As their lawyer, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, spoke, PJ turned the volume up on the barbershop TV.\n\nBut if he and the VIP patrons were looking for a straightforward answer to this latest incident of police brutality, they wouldn't get one.\n\nMr Crump urged the country to focus on changing the culture of policing that allows any officer - regardless of race - to have such a callous disregard for the citizens they are sworn to protect and serve.\n\nAs Mr Crump spoke, one man shook his head. \"Memphis is complicated man,\" he said.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Daniel Prude: New York police used 'spit hood' on man who died of asphyxiation\n\nAn African American man died in New York state after being hooded by police and held face down to the road for two minutes, body camera footage shows.\n\nDaniel Prude, 41, who had mental health issues and who was unarmed, was restrained in March by police who put a \"spit hood\" - used to stop detainees spitting or biting - on his head.\n\nHe later died of asphyxiation but his story has only now been made public.\n\nHis death was two months before the killing of George Floyd.\n\nMr Floyd died after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly eight minutes in Minnesota. Anti-racism protests broke out in the US and globally in the wake of his killing.\n\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Mr Prude's brother, Joe, said he called police in Rochester on 23 March as his sibling was showing acute mental health problems.\n\n\"I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother to get lynched,\" he said.\n\nA warehouse worker from Chicago and father of five, Daniel Prude was visiting his brother at the time of his death.\n\nPolice body camera footage obtained by the family through a public records request shows Mr Prude, who had been running naked through the streets in a light snow before police arrived, lying unarmed as officers restrain him on the ground.\n\nThe video shows that Mr Prude complied immediately when officers arrived on the scene and ordered him to lie on the ground and put his hands behind his back. He can be heard saying: \"Sure thing, sure thing.\"\n\nHe becomes agitated, at times swearing at the officers who surround him and spitting, but he does not appear to offer any physical resistance, according to the footage.\n\nMr Prude told officers he was infected with coronavirus, and they placed a white \"spit hood\" over his head.\n\nOne officer is seen pressing down with both hands on Mr Prude's head and saying: \"Stop spitting.\"\n\nAfter he stops writhing and goes quiet, one officer notes: \"He feels pretty cold.\"\n\nMedics try to revive him before he is carried into an ambulance. He was taken off life support a week later on 30 March.\n\nThe family's lawyer said the reason the case was not made public earlier was that it had taken \"months\" for police footage to be released.\n\nAccording to a post-mortem examination report seen by the Rochester-based Democrat and Chronicle newspaper, Mr Prude's death was a homicide caused by \"complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint\".\n\nThe report also listed PCP, a strong hallucinogenic drug, as a complication.\n\nIn a statement, New York state's attorney general called the death a \"tragedy\" and said an investigation was under way.\n\nMr Prude's brother called his death \"cold-blooded murder\". \"How many more brothers gotta die for society to understand this needs to stop?\" he added at the news conference.\n\nLawyers for the family are in the process of filing a wrongful death suit.\n\nThe family have also called for the firing and arrest of the officers, US media report.\n\nThe officers involved have not been suspended.\n\nProtesters gathered in the city of Rochester, New York, on Wednesday over Mr Prude's death.\n\nRochester police used pepper spray and pepper balls against some demonstrators outside the Public Safety Building, according to the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper.\n\nSeveral people were briefly taken into custody after entering the building, which serves as police headquarters, the local media reports say.\n\n\"Spit hoods\" are mesh fabric hoods placed over the heads of suspects. They are intended to protect officers from a detainee's saliva.\n\nCritics who oppose their use say they are distressing and humiliating, can cause panic in the detained person, and make it harder to notice if a prisoner is having difficulty breathing.\n\nIn recent years, they have been scrutinised as a factor in the deaths of several detainees in the US and other countries.\n\nIn the UK, campaign group Liberty said that, as of February 2019, \"spit hoods\" were being used by at least 30 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales.\n\nBack in 2016, UK police forces told the BBC they only used them when \"proportionate, appropriate and justifiable\" to protect officers. The Metropolitan Police says its medically supervised tests have found \"spit hoods\" present no risk to a suspect's breathing.\n\nThe death of George Floyd sparked huge protests in the US, some violent, against police brutality and racism in both the police force and society in general. Demonstrations were held in many other countries.\n\nNews of Mr Prude's death came amid heightened tensions in the US after black man Jacob Blake was shot multiple times in the back during an arrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 23 August, sparking days of protests in the city. Mr Blake's father has said his son is now paralysed from the waist down - though doctors do not know if it is permanent.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Wednesday called for charges against police involved in Mr Blake's shooting and that of Breonna Taylor, an African-American woman who was shot eight times by police who entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky on 13 March.\n\n\"I think we should let the judicial system work its way,\" he told a news conference in Delaware. \"I do think, at a minimum, they need to be charged, the officers.\"\n\nUS Attorney General William Barr dismissed accusations that black and white Americans were treated differently due to police racism.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Wednesday, he said it was very rare for an unarmed black person to be shot by white officers.\n\n\"I think the narrative that the police are in some epidemic of shooting unarmed black men is simply a false narrative,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It's not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about,\" he said.\n\n\"All fair-minded people should be concerned.\"\n\nPointing to statistics showing African-American citizens are far more likely to be shot by police by whites, Mr Obama called on law enforcement to root out internal bias.\n\n\"When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if it's because of the colour of their skin, they are not being treated the same,'' he said. \"And that hurts.\"\n\nThe latest incidents follow a long line of controversial deaths of African-Americans at the hands of the police that has ignited a national debate about the use of lethal force.\n\nSome of the people bringing bouquets to the site of the shooting are too emotional to talk. \"I'm just numb and sad,\" mumbles a middle-aged black woman.\n\nAn elderly white woman, Diana, has driven 40 miles to this quiet middle-class suburb to pay her respects.

A pastor and Iraqi war vet, Thomas, offers this bleak view of the police: \"This is the same as a combat zone,\" he says. \"If black people get pulled over we need to position ourselves as prisoners of war and survive the encounter.\"\n\nMinnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who has requested a federal investigation into the shooting , external in St Paul, , Minnesota, said he didn't think Philando Castile would have been shot if he had been white.\n\n\"Would this have happened if the driver and the passengers were white?

      "text": "Atlanta police shoot naked and unarmed black man\n\nLocal police say they have turned over the case to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation\n\nA white police officer in an Atlanta suburb shot dead an unarmed black man who was not wearing clothes on Monday.\n\nThe officer was responding to an emergency call about a man \"acting deranged\" and \"crawling around on the ground naked\".\n\nDeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander said no weapon was found at the scene, and suggested that the man may have suffered from mental illness.\n\nSince Friday, at least three unarmed black men have been shot by US police.\n\nThe man has been identified by local media and The New York Times as 27-year-old Anthony Hill, a veteran of the US Air Force.\n\nPolice have identified the officer who fired the shots as Robert Olsen, according to the Reuters news agency. He has been on the force for seven years.\n\nAround 13:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Monday, the officer responded to an emergency call at an apartment complex northeast of Atlanta.\n\nAccording to Mr Alexander, Hill charged at the officer despite repeated orders to stand down.\n\nThe officer fired two shots, and Hill was declared dead at the scene.\n\nAuthorities did not find a weapon at the scene\n\nThe officer was in possession of a non-lethal Taser, according to Mr Alexander, who also noted that the officer attempted to provide emergency aid to the man.\n\n\"It appears that may not have been any weapon found at the scene,\" Mr Alexander told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe case has been turned over to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.\n\n\"I find it - we find it here - very important that we seek and appear to be as transparent around this investigation as we can,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked whether Hill had a history of mental illness, Mr Alexander said: \"I don't know that specifically. I can only reasonably assume if he was running around in the apartment complex naked, I believe we can make the assumption there may have been some mental health experience that he might have been having.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Times, a family member said Hill was a veteran of the US Air Force and had sought treatment from the Veteran's Administration. \"To my understanding he was having some difficulties with the medication that he was on,\" Harrietta Jones said.\n\nThe officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative leave.\n\nUS police departments have been criticised in recent months after several high profile cases in which white officers killed unarmed black men.\n\nLast Friday, police in Aurora, Colorado, shot dead an unarmed black man following an altercation with police who were trying to arrest him.

Nobody was hurt.\n\nS Lee Merrit, lawyer for Rose's family, said the victim's mother \"didn't really expect a different verdict\" in light of rulings in similar cases elsewhere in the US.\n\nPittsburgh district attorney Stephen Zappala Jr said he disagreed with the court's decision.\n\nIn the wake of the verdict about 100 protesters reportedly blocked roads and read a poem written by Rose, while chanting his age.\n\nThe death of Antwon Rose is one of many high-profile cases of unarmed black men dying at the hands of white US police officers - cases that have ignited protests and civil unrest across the country.\n\nOfficers stopped Rose's car because it matched the description of one sought in connection with a nearby shooting, police said. Rose was a passenger in the vehicle at the time.\n\nWhen the driver was stopped and ordered out of the car, Rose and a second unidentified passenger ran away.\n\nRose was shot several times in the arm, face and abdomen from behind. He later died in hospital from his injuries.\n\nThe officers were not wearing body cameras at the time, but a video filmed by a bystander went viral and led to days of protests in Pittsburgh.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Mr Rosfeld first said he \"saw something dark that he perceived as a gun,\" but witnesses said Rose had nothing in his hands.\n\nMr Rosfeld later changed his story, according to the detectives' complaint, saying he did not see a gun.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

And then crime rates rose.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Oct. 05, 2016, 9:13 p.m. ET\n\nIn 2004, Frank Jude Jr., an unarmed black man, was viciously beaten by at least 10 white, off-duty police officers outside a housewarming party in Milwaukee because they said he stole one of their badges.\n\nWhen the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel broke the news more than three months later, not one of the police officers had been charged or arrested, even though the city knew who they were.\n\nIn the six months that followed, 911 calls from black neighborhoods to report crimes plummeted as the city's murder rate jumped. The decline in 911 calls is symptomatic of a loss of confidence in law enforcement, according to the study and criminal justice experts. And that trust deficit then leads to rising violent crime rates.\n\n\"An important implication of this finding is that publicized cases of police violence not only threaten the legitimacy and reputation of law enforcement; they also - by driving down 911 calls - thwart the suppression of law breaking, obstruct the application of justice, and ultimately make cities as a whole, and the black community in particular less safe,\" reads the study, \"Police Violence and Citizen Crime Reporting in the Black Community,\" that will appear in the October edition of the American Sociological Review.\n\nThese are the results of a study of the effect high-profile excessive force by police against unarmed black men have on an entire community, which Matthew Desmond, the lead author and a sociologist at Harvard University, said is the first empirical study of its kind.\n\nThe mistrust and, perhaps, discontent the study shows in Milwaukee has been mirrored in similar cases across the country in the decade since, with flashpoints in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore, Chicago, and now Charlotte, N.C. At the same time, the number of people murdered in the country in 2015 experienced the first substantial increase in a quarter-century , leading many to ask why.\n\nSome observers have argued that police, in the face of public scrutiny, have pulled back from their duties, the so-called \"Ferguson Effect.\" But the soon-to-be published study offers empirical evidence to the contrary. Police have not stopped doing their job. Nor has gang violence turned city blocks into war zones. Rather, the deaths of young black men at the hands of law enforcement can lead whole communities, distrustful of police, to withdraw from the country's criminal justice system.\n\n\"What this paper does is add something very important to the understanding of what those mechanisms are,\" says David Kennedy, director of the National Network for Safe Communities , a project at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. \"Breaches in the confidence that communities have in the police, themselves, lead to disengagement in the criminal justice system, which leads to increased violence and crime.\"\n\n\"It makes absolutely perfect sense that when communities have experience in what they regard as an egregious instance of police behavior, they are less interested and less willing to cooperate with the police,\" continues Mr. Kennedy, who was not involved in the study. \"Now the study says that. It's not just conjecture. It's as close as we get in social science to fact. And that's connected to very substantial increases in violence.\"\n\nThe study was conducted by Dr. Desmond and two other sociologists, Andrew Papachristos at Yale University, and David Kirk at the University of Oxford. They looked at every crime-related 911 call in Milwaukee from March 2004 to December 2010. They calculated that in the six months after the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel broke the news that Mr. Jude was left bloody and half-naked in the street , the number of crime-related 911 calls in the city decreased by about 22,000, to about 110,000. Fifty-six percent of this decline occurred in predominantly black neighborhoods.\n\nThe number of crime-related 911 calls would return to normal after about a year, the authors found. However, the six-month decrease from March through August 2005 led to the most violent stretch in the seven years the authors looked at. During those six months, there were 87 murders in Milwaukee, a 32-percent increase compared to the same six-month periods in 2004 and 2006.\n\nThe number of 911 calls in all Milwaukee neighborhoods also declined significantly following the high-profile killing of Sean Bell by police in Queens, N.Y. in 2006, suggesting the fallout of police violence is not an \"isolated incident,\" as the authors write \"police departments and city politicians often frame [it].\"\n\nAfrican Americans' lack of confidence in police has been well documented through surveys and testimonies. Just this week, 9-year-old Zianna Oliphant was filmed telling the Charlotte City Council about being black.\n\n\" I don't like being treated differently ,\" she said through tears at the City Council's first meeting since Keith Lamont Scott was killed in an officer-involved shooting six days earlier.\n\nThe Pew Research Center has consistently found African Americans don't trust police will treat them equally to whites. Following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, 46 percent of black respondents told Pew they had \"very little\" confidence in police to treat them equally.\n\nBut observers have debated over whether a lack of confidence in police has led African Americans to not report crime.  It doesn't, according to a 2006 study by Lawrence Bobo and Victor Thompson. A vast of majority of both whites and black respondents said they would call 911 if their house was burglarized, even if an overwhelmingly majority of blacks didn't expect to be taken seriously when police arrived.\n\nThis changes in the wake of high-profile police violence in the news, according to the soon-to-be published study. It is perceived by some as a \"severe breach in the social contract that exists between citizens and the criminal justice system.\"\n\n\"That breach is so sudden and violent when unarmed black men are beaten or killed that virtually no institutional response, from public apologies to sanctioning offending officers, can swiftly repair it,\" the study says.\n\nIn an interview with the Monitor, Tony Brown, a sociologist at Rice University who studies how racism works, was skeptical of the implications of the study. He praised its analysis, but said the personal motivations that led whole neighborhoods to call 911 less frequently must be studied further. He also stressed the conclusions should be considered within a larger context, namely how the country and its race relations have changed since 2005, and speculated about the so-called \"Ferguson Effect,\" which FBI Director James Comey referred to in May, but many criminologists and President Obama have rejected.\n\nWhatever those motivations, Dr. Kirk at Oxford said in a statement that police should take seriously the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, in particular its recommendations for procedural justice, transparency, and accountability .\n\nMr. Kennedy at John Jay says many departments are.\n\n\"For the longest time, police never criticized police. That's a real problem for communities that already don't think highly of you,\" he says. \"Across the country, we're just beginning to see police are willing to say to their community, 'I think that's wrong too.' That's an important development.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

His shooting of a fleeing Walter Scott following a traffic stop on April 4 was recorded on a bystander's cellphone.\n\nAnthony Scott said during the interview that justice for the family is a murder charge, a guilty verdict and a life sentence for Slager.\n\nSlager, 33, faces 30 years to life in prison without parole if convicted. The death penalty doesn't apply because there are no aggravating circumstances, such as robbery or kidnapping, said prosecutor Scarlett Wilson who announced the indictment.\n\nWilson said no trial date has yet been sent.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm ready for it to go into trial just yet,\" Anthony Scott said in the interview. \"But we'll be ready when the time comes.\"\n\nWilson said the murder charge requires prosecutors to prove what is referred to as \"malice aforethought.\" That's a form of premeditation, but Wilson explains that it doesn't mean Slager would have had to think about killing Scott for a certain period of time before firing. She says the state can prove it's murder \"as long as malice exists in the heart and mind at the time before and during the killing.\"\n\nSlager's defense lawyer, Andy Savage, said he won't comment \"until we have an opportunity to fully evaluate the state's case and to compare it with our own investigation.\"\n\nChris Stewart, a lawyer for Scott's family, said he plans to file a wrongful death civil suit against North Charleston, most likely by the end of July, and will keep close watch on the criminal prosecution meanwhile.\n\nSlager has said he initially tried to stun Scott with his Taser when both men scuffled over the stun gun and he fired his handgun at Scott in self-defense.\n\nThe video shows the men briefly scuffling before Scott runs away and the officer fires at Scott's back.\n\nThe charge against Slager is the fourth in recent months in South Carolina involving white officers shooting at unarmed black men. One ended in a mistrial in January and is set for retrial next week.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

While white Americans have led the liberalization of gun laws in the past decade, black gun carry is becoming a test of constitutional agency.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated July 20, 2017, 12:15 p.m. ET | Atlanta\n\nLike many African-Americans of his generation, Phillip Smith, a Californian in his 50s, grew up without a gun in the house. To his parents, gun ownership was not just politically unacceptable, but morally wrong - a fount, if anything, of trouble and tragedy.\n\nWhen he moved his own family to the South in 2002, he found a different tradition, where black families, many of them fresh from the farms, had hunting rifles for sport and, to an extent, self-defense. Mr. Smith was intrigued. As he bought his first guns and began practicing at a gun range, he had an epiphany: Perhaps the Second Amendment is the black man's ultimate sign of full citizenship.\n\nSmith's crossover into the world of guns and ammo makes him part of a widening attempt to, as he says, \"normalize\" a black gun-carrying tradition fraught with historical pain and tragedy.\n\nHis advocacy for African-American gun rights has turned out to be a potent message. The National African-American Gun Association he founded has grown from 800 to 20,000 members since 2015. Unlike the primarily white and male National Rifle Association, NAAGA is diverse in both color and gender; 60 percent of its members are women.\n\n\"The main thing - and I'd be lying if I said something else - is that in the last 18 months the racial tone of the country has tilted in a direction that is alarming, at a minimum,\" says Smith, who lives in an Atlanta suburb. \"For African-Americans, we're seeing the same old faces, the same type of conversations we saw in the '50s and '60s, and we thought they were dead and gone.\"\n\nGiven that white Americans have led the liberalization of gun laws in the past decade, black gun carry is becoming a test of constitutional agency, injecting what University of Arizona gun culture expert Jennifer Carlson calls the specter of \"legitimate violence\" into an already tense political climate. Incidents like the June acquittal of the Minnesota police officer who shot Philando Castile, a legal gun owner, during a traffic stop have added to that tension, gun owners like Smith say - as did the National Rifle Association's silence over both his shooting and the verdict.\n\nFor some black gun owners, the question is a stark one: Can African-Americans reasonably expect to be covered by the Second Amendment in a country still marbled by racist rhetoric, attitudes, and acts?\n\nIn one way, \"it is saddening and troubling how much hopelessness there must be to make such a massive shift to decide guns might be a necessary answer\" to a documented rise in overt racism, says Nancy Beck Young, a political historian at the University of Houston.\n\nThe shooting of Mr. Castile and the election of President Trump changed things for Dickson \"Q\" Amoah, a former Air Force reservist from the outskirts of Chicago.\n\nLike Smith, Mr. Amoah says his parents were vehemently anti-gun. To this day, he says, \"Honestly I still think that getting rid of all these excess guns in Chicago and the country would be a good thing.\"\n\nThen he saw the white nationalist salute of \"Hail Trump\" near the White House in January. His first thought was: \"Oh, hell no.\"\n\nFor him, carrying a gun has become a test of a stereotype, as Professor Young says, \"built on the myth of what the black man was after and what he might do.\"\n\n\"I used to worry about what people thought of me as a black man,\" says Amoah, the president of the 761st Gun Club of Illinois. As a gun-carrier, he says, \"Now, I just don't care anymore.\"\n\nThe extent of the risk legally armed black men take to carry guns is hard to measure. The Washington Post has found that unarmed black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than unarmed white men. But there are no hard studies on that have looked at how officers react to armed black men versus armed white ones. Moreover, privacy laws prohibit deep-dive studies of gun registration data to look for patterns by race.\n\nBut Ms. Carlson, author of \"Citizen-Protectors: The Everyday Politics of Guns in an Age of Decline,\" found a proxy in administrative \"gun boards\" that exist in several states to adjudicate gun license issues. She found differences in how gun boards operated in Michigan's majority-black Wayne County and majority-white Oakland County. Black concealed-carry applicants in Wayne were routinely lectured and quizzed in public forums - what she calls \"degradation ceremonies.\" White gun owners in Oakland, meanwhile, were addressed without lectures in hearings where they could plead their case in a semi-private room. (Michigan has since done away with the gun boards.)\n\nHer findings suggest such proceedings for concealed-carry licenses now \"serve as mechanisms ... to encourage black men to internalize their position at the bottom of the racial ... hierarchy.\"\n\nThat evidence, she says, underscores how some policing strategies, like stop-and-frisk, \"only work if you can presume that the guns that are being carried are illegal,\" says Carlson. In that way, \"gun laws change the ordering of how people think about danger in a way that is way beyond whether there is a gun there or not.\"\n\nOnly about half as many African-American households have guns as white ones - 19 percent, compared with 41 percent. And attitudes toward guns remain starkly divided along racial lines. Sixty percent of black voters favor more gun control, while 61 percent of white voters seek more gun rights.\n\nThat reflects a deep resistance to guns in African-American communities that goes back to the civil rights era, when blacks, often victims of gun crimes, began to see gun ownership as counterproductive and dangerous. But that doesn't tell the whole story, gun-carry proponents say.\n\n\"You dig and you realize the civil rights movement wasn't just a nonviolent movement,\" counters Amoah. \"The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was a gun carrier. And you look at Malcolm X differently. He was a self-defense guy.\"\n\nSmith in Atlanta says he has had heated debates with preachers over his gun carry advocacy. To some, it seems a reprise of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense movement, which led to a wave of gun control laws in the US. After 30 of its members marched, armed and defiant, into the California state capitol in 1967, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, who ran for president as a staunch Second Amendment defender, signed a law prohibiting open carry in the state.\n\nScholars say that Second Amendment rights for African-Americans cannot be fought for separately from other rights.\n\n\"No. 1, Philando Castile was seeking to show an officer his permit when he was killed, so having a gun is not an escape from being killed,\" says historian Gerald Horne, author of \"The Counter-Revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the United States of America. \" \"But while that case suggests that African-Americans' Second Amendment rights are not worth as much as those of others, it also brings us to the devalued citizenship of black Americans in 2017. In order to re-value that citizenship it will take a political movement that goes beyond Second Amendment rights and focuses on the whole panoply of rights generally.\"\n\nThe coast-to-coast growth of NAAGA chapters from a handful to 32 in less than two years seems to mirror a shift, partly a generational one, in that thinking. The number of blacks who prioritize gun rights over gun control rose from 18 percent in 1993 to 34 percent in 2014, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBlack-owned gun shops say they have seen business increase in the last six months, even as gun sales overall have softened, leading to price cuts of more than 50 percent.\n\nAt 280 pounds, Louis Dennard says he can be an intimidating presence - until people get to know him as the kind-hearted gardener and pitmaster that he is.\n\nHis worry is that racist stereotypes get enshrined into law, under a president who openly questioned former President Barack Obama's citizenship and, in Mr. Dennard's view, is basing his legacy on dismantling the work of the country's first black president. \"Right now, they are in the process of prejudicing the system,\" he says.\n\nThough the growth of his gun club is tied to national politics, Smith is careful to not focus his advocacy on the president or the NRA. He says his toughest critics, so far, have been others in the African-American community, who don't see a strong correlation between the Second Amendment and a sense of full citizenship.\n\n\"I'm trying to let everyone know that you have the right - not the God-given right, but the right as an American - to carry a gun,\" says Smith. \"We have things to overcome in the black community in terms of what you believe you have a right to do as a citizen.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Kenn Blanchard, author of the \"Black Man with a Gun\" franchise, won't carry weapons openly, even where that's legal.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Dec. 13, 2014, 9:18 p.m. ET | ATLANTA\n\nThe Rev. Kenn Blanchard, a former federal police officer, has spent 20 years challenging gun control orthodoxy through speeches, Internet campaigns, and his \"Black Man with a Gun\" book franchise.\n\nBut the man who's seen by some as the godfather of a nascent African-American gun rights movement says he's often actually a black man without a gun.\n\nConcerned about getting falsely profiled and even killed by police as a threatening black man by carrying a legal gun openly, Mr. Blanchard says he refuses to carry weapons in plain sight, even at a time when many white gun owners are carrying openly, in places where that's their legal right, but which might spark police attention.\n\n\"Open carry, I won't do it,\" he tells the Monitor. \"I don't want to give a police officer that second of time to say, 'Is he a bad guy?' I don't want that to be on me.\"\n\nHis statements (which he says are aimed at both black and white police officers) come amid national debate over high-profile police shootings in Arizona, Missouri and Ohio , after which thousands of Americans have taken to the streets to protest decisions by white police officers to resort to deadly force against unarmed black men, and the refusal by grand juries to hold officers criminally accountable. At the same time, a majority of Americans for the first time favor expanded gun rights over stronger ownership restrictions.\n\nFor the black community, the questions of gun ownership and carry are complex, to say the least, and span harsh crime realities in the inner cities to little-discussed aspects of the civil rights movement. Blanchard himself told Al-Jazeera last year that \"[i]t's the hardest thing in the world to decide I want to be a gun owner in a black community ... nobody supports you.\"\n\nBut as Blanchard posits in his work, gun control efforts historically have had race at their roots, with ownership and carry rules intended primarily to disarm blacks during Jim Crow.\n\nIn the recent \"Negroes and the Gun,\" Nicholas Johnson, a Fordham Law School professor, chronicles the black community's long gun-owning tradition and its role in the freedom struggle, notably how that tradition historically has drawn strict distinctions between guns for self-defense and political violence. Johnson's book also notes that several recent Supreme Court gun rights cases were led by black plaintiffs.\n\nThe debate has contemporary implications.\n\nBlack communities suffer the most from gun violence, given high murder rates among young black men - a reason why there's historically been skepticism about gun ownership in the black community. But those attitudes are changing quickly, according to a new Pew survey released this week. For the first time, a majority of African-Americans believe guns can be an effective crime deterrent when weighed against the dangers of owning guns.\n\nBut while YouTube videos of police approaching then backing off white men carrying legal guns openly on the street have become popular among gun rights proponents, such videos provide a contemporary contrast to how black people with legal guns are sometimes approached and dealt with differently than white people with legal guns.\n\nThis summer, for example, John Crawford III, a black man, was killed by two police officers after someone reported him for carrying what turned out to be a toy rifle at a Walmart . The shooting occurred in Ohio, where residents are allowed to legally carry guns openly in public, including in stores.\n\nA few weeks ago, a 12-year-old black boy named Tamir Rice was killed in Cleveland while carrying a pellet gun. Video shows an officer shooting the boy within two seconds of arriving at the scene.\n\nBrandman University law professor David Long , who is black, says such incidents underscore concerns about racial profiling among police, and how that affects gun rights for different races.\n\nIn the YouTube videos, \"you see young white guys walking down the street with weapons, and the police approach them without guns drawn, have a chat, and that's it,\" Long told the Monitor recently. \"You try that as a young black man, you'll be dead.\"\n\nTo be sure, the shootings, protests and frank realities like the unequal profiling that concerns Blanchard, have begun to move the needle on justice system reforms, including the introduction of a Congressional grand jury reform bill this week to allow more scrutiny of police who kill, and introduction of police body cameras that have helped reduce use-of-force incidents by police.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nAs a former police firearms instructor and US Marine, Blanchard says his concerns as a black man about wearing guns openly even though some whites are comfortable doing so cuts to the nexus of guns and race in America .\n\n\"It's the same thing since the Civil War, it hasn't changed - we have a holdover from the sins of our fathers,\" he says.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The officer was fired from the NYPD shortly after the jury verdict in February.\n\nThe prosecutors for the case recommended probation and home confinement as punishment, a decision that has angered some members of Gurley's family.\n\n\"Because his incarceration is not necessary to protect the public, and due to the unique circumstances of this case, a prison sentence is not warranted ,\" said Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMr. Gurley's shooting came at a time when national attention is focused on the shootings of unarmed black men by police officers, further fueling the tensions. Mr. Liang's case, however, was different from the protests that helped intensify the Black Lives Matter movement, as he was not being accused of intentionally shooting Gurley. Some Chinese Americans staged protests of their own , saying that Liang was being used as a scapegoat for police misconduct.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Liang delivered an emotional testimony, saying that what happened was a deadly accident. Mr. Liang and his partner, Officer Shaun Landau were patrolling a darkened stairwell of a housing project on Nov. 20, 2014, when a startling sound prompted Liang to pull the trigger on his service pistol, inadvertently shooting Gurley. But the prosecutors have said that Liang acted recklessly, and did not make any effort to help Gurley after the shooting. Mr. Liang has said that he felt that both he and his partner weren't qualified to help Gurley.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The judge denied the claim saying that the defense had failed to prove that the juror's omission violated Liang's rights.\n\nThis report contains material from the Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Since then, activist movements created in response to the shooting have exposed racial issues and tensions that had been ignored for decades by the mainstream.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Feb. 27, 2017, 7:36 p.m. ET\n\nTrayvon Martin would have been 22 years old this month, had he not been shot and killed by the head of the local neighborhood watch in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012.\n\nIn some ways, Trayvon's death was the spark for a civil rights movement that had lain dormant for decades, one that has shaken, not just the African-American community to which he belonged, but the nation as a whole. Today, five years later, Trayvon's death, along with other high-profile shootings of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, continues to amplify the grievances of a substantial portion of the black population.\n\nThe movement that began with a gut reaction to the tragic shooting, and subsequent acquittal of the shooter, has led to an important reconnection with uncomfortable racial issues that remained out of sight and out of mind for decades, says Wornie Reed, director of the Race and Social Policy Research Center at Virginia Tech, to The Christian Science Monitor via email.\n\n\"African-American racial justice movement activity stopped in the 1970s,\" says Dr. Reed, who knew Martin Luther King Jr. and was active in the civil rights movement during the 1960s. \"From the mid-1970's we went four decades without such a movement - until the Black Lives Matter movement started in 2014, in reaction to the police killings of unarmed black men and boys.\"\n\nThe shooting of the unarmed black teenager sparked a massive public outcry. But when George Zimmerman was acquitted for the shooting at the subsequent trial for reasons of self-defense, the tag #BlackLivesMatter began to trend across social media, eventually coalescing into a coherent movement that hoped to shed light on the deep ethnic and racial divides that had quietly persisted in the United States for decades.\n\nFor Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's parents, the death of their son had become more than a personal tragedy.\n\n\"All I wanted was to be a mother, to work at my job and raise my kids and live a normal life,\" Ms. Fulton writes in the book \"Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin,\" which was released for the fifth anniversary of Trayvon's death. \"Then my son was killed and my world went with him, and God led me to another place, another world and another life. I became a mother on a mission .... So that the killing of Trayvon Martin would stand for something, so that the killing will someday stop and the healing will begin.\"\n\nAfter the acquittal of Zimmerman, community activists Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in protest.\n\n\"This generation of African-Americans grew to adulthood when there was little if any self-defining struggle,\" says Reed. \"[But] struggles for civil and human rights are always needed,\" he adds. \"Many of the rights and privileges African-Americans gained through the years were accomplished as the result of protests, public engagements, and demonstrations. Such activity had been largely missing since the 1970's. Racial progress stalled - and possibly regressed.\"\n\nThat stall suddenly came to an end, Reed says, as the deaths of Trayvon in Florida, Eric Garner in New York, Michael Brown in Missouri, and others, suddenly gained national notoriety, fueling the outrage of the movement's participants.\n\n\"#BlackLivesMatter is a call to action and a response to the virulent anti-Black racism that permeates our society,\" reads the description of BLM on their official website. \"Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes.\"\n\nOf course, the rise of BLM has not come without controversy. Conservatives have expressed concern that the movement effectively put a target on the backs of police officers leading to an increase in ambushes of law enforcement and fostering a general \" state of lawlessness .\"\n\nOpposition to the group sprang up almost immediately on social media, and the fledgling movement was even criticized by some African-Americans for its sometimes less-than-cohesive message and protest methods. Last year, however, BLM made efforts to clarify its various positions, creating a more streamlined set of principles and drawing up a new policy platform for the organization, as the Monitor previously reported .\n\n\"This happens to movements,\" Michael Fortner, a professor of urban studies at the City University of New York told the Monitor in August. \"Over time people who are engaged in that activism realize that they have to take their movement to the next level, that they need to take their righteous indignation and turn it into good remedies for the problems they have identified, and I think this new Black Lives Matter platform tries to do just that.\"\n\nSince its founding, BLM has inspired similar protests and brought increased scrutiny to racial biases on multiple levels of American society. It has also likely played a role in the push for police bodycams over the past few years, which supporters say hold officers accountable for their actions while on duty.\n\nBut despite this, BLM remains a divisive subject for many Americans. A Pew Research poll conducted between February and May of last year found that 43 percent of those surveyed said they support the movement. While only 22 percent said they opposed the movement, another 30 percent said they did not know about BLM, or chose not offer an opinion on the subject.\n\nFor Reed, the movement sparked by the death of Trayvon Martin still has a long way to go, but it has a great deal of potential for positive change, despite its tragic roots.\n\n\"Social movements often start with 'grass roots' people and end up affecting future societal developments,\" he says. \"If the BLM movement continues and if it causes other movement organizations to form, it has the potential of affecting in a positive manner the near term history of the United States, especially in the area of racial justice.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But some prominent Americans have voiced concerns about the campaign's goals.\n\nThe BLM movement , started by Patrisse Cullors, Opal Tometi, and Alicia Garza, was intended as a bulwark against anti-black racism in the US amid a series of high-profile incidents in which unarmed black men were killed by police. \"Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise,\" wrote Ms. Garza in article for the Feminist Wire . \"It is an affirmation of Black folks' contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.\"\n\nBut some are critical of the movement. \"The 'BlackLivesMatter' movement is focused on the wrong targets, to the detriment of blacks who would like to see real change,\" Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson wrote in an article for USA Today on August 24.\n\nIn a televised interview on Fox News's \" The Kelly File ,\" Mr. Carson said that many African-Americans share his view, but that they feel uncomfortable speaking out.\n\nIn late August, African-American US Navy veteran Peggy Hubbard posted a video on her Facebook page, criticizing the BLM movement. Watched by over 8 million people, the video recounted recent shootings that have caused concern, including the death of 9-year-old Jamyla Bolden who was killed at home while doing her homework.\n\n\"You black people, my black people, you are the most violent [people] I have ever seen in my life. A little girl is dead. You say black lives matter? Her life mattered. Her dreams mattered. Her future mattered,\" says Hubbard in the video.\n\nA few days later, Ms. Hubbard posted a second video, reiterating her concerns about BLM. \"This is not a race issue. It never has been a racial issue.... This is about accountability and responsibility,\" she said. \"Black lives matter, white lives matter, Asian lives matter, Hispanic lives matter, Lithuanian lives matter, Russian lives matter, life in general matters ... but it's never gonna get better until we admit that we have a problem in our community.\"\n\nHubbard goes on to accuse BLM of focusing on white-on-black racism, particularly in the form of police brutality, instead of focusing on the black-on-black violence that afflicts some black communities.\n\n\"If anyone is surprised by Hubbard's emergence, or that there are like-minded black people who are encouraging her, it is only because large swaths of the media cover the black community as if conservative voices like hers don't even exist,\" wrote Conor Friedersdorf in The Atlantic .\n\nAnother conservative voice, Johnathan Gentry, black minister at West Angeles Church of God in Christ, cited BLM as \"superficial, shallow\" in a televised interview with Fox News . \"Why are you not cleaning up your own community if black lives matter?\" he questioned, saying BLM is \"nowhere to be found in their own communities.\"\n\nThe movement has also faced criticism from those who see it as a demonstration of anti-police sentiment. A growing refrain from some politicians and conservative media claims that the movement legitimizes or even enables anti-police violence.\n\nLast Friday, Harris County, Texas Sheriff's Deputy Darren Goforth was killed at a Houston-area gas station after filling up his car. Police have accused an African-American man, Shannon J. Miles of the murder. The \"execution-style\" killing of Mr. Goforth was condemned by Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman who said in a statement following the shooting, \"We've heard black lives matter, all lives matter.... well, cops' lives matter, too. So why don't we just drop the qualifier and just say 'lives matter.'\"\n\nAs the movement continues to gain steam, so does the backlash against it. Earlier this week, African-American US Marine Corps veteran Michael Whaley launched the 'All Lives Matter' campaign, garnering support from others across the country. \"Michael, you have restored my faith in people. You are doing what SO MANY are afraid to do. You're standing up to your whole race,\" a supporter posted on the campaign's website .\n\nIn an attempt to counter the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag that has permeated social media, Whaley has started #‎ColorBlind‬, hoping to move away from a focus on race and skin color. Brutality and violence exist, Whaley says. Instead of highlighting race, why not unify in an effort to reduce violence and improve justice for all?\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The Washington Post's Janell Ross wrote on Tuesday :\n\nIt is a kind of logic that says safety and civil rights sit at opposite poles or are part of a zero-sum equation - if x matters, then y does not. That not only has never been an idea that Black Lives Matter activists have publicly espoused; it's pretty antithetical to the movement's general push for greater regard for the experiences, injuries and deaths suffered at the hands of police. Existing patterns, these activists argue, suggest that black lives do not matter at all. So they must be spoken for and spoken about with particular fervor.\n\nOther supporters point out that responding to \"Black Lives Matter\" by saying \"all lives matter\" minimizes the problems faced by black Americans, and undercuts their message. In a New York Times op-ed from August 9, columnist Charles M. Blow wrote, \"until this country values all lives equally, it is both reasonable and indeed necessary to specify the lives it seems to value less.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Yet recordings of police who handle difficult situations well would be the best result from 'body cams,' creating models to emulate.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 13, 2015, 4:34 p.m. ET\n\nPolice officers are in a \"performance profession,\" much like teachers or ballet dancers. Their work, which requires quick reflexes, is expected to be perfect. When it is not, such as in the recent police shootings of unarmed black men in South Carolina and elsewhere, a common reaction is to focus on what is wrong with the entire profession.\n\nSharp questions are being asked of police these days: Do many have an implicit racial bias? Are they too arrogant in traffic stops? Do they too quickly escalate a confrontation?\n\nReforms are now being proposed to better expose police mistakes and to hold officers more accountable. Over the past year, in which civilians have used cameras to capture police shootings gone wrong, the most popular proposal has been to place body cameras on every cop. President Obama, for example, promises $75 million for the purchase of 50,000 cameras for law enforcement officers.\n\nThis reform is not without merit. Studies of the few police departments that already use such cameras suggest the mere presence of a recording device has a \"civilizing effect,\" not only on police but on the people they encounter. Complaints about police have declined in these communities. Cops seem to be more calm and courteous. Violent incidents are fewer. Investigations of wrongdoing are made easier.\n\nYet the resistance to \"body cams\" remains strong, and not only from police who fear exposure of their work. The cameras can invade the privacy of civilians, such as children during investigations of domestic violence. The costs of storing or reviewing the videos are high. At times, such as when police officers need to talk to informants, the cameras must be shut off.\n\nThis resistance and the problems that the cameras might bring could be more easily overcome if this reform were viewed in an entirely different light. The recordings could be used as a valuable teaching tool in highlighting the many cases in which police officers acted well during the hundreds of different types of difficult situations. They would serve as models for how police can be the perfect professional.\n\nA few police departments, such as in Miami and in Britain, have used such recordings to help both rookies and experienced officers improve their performance. But the practice remains rare.\n\nOne \"performance profession\" that has discovered the value of watching videos of perfect practitioners is teaching. Doug Lemov, an American educator, has collected hundreds of videos of teachers with proven effectiveness in the classroom. His book, \"Teach Like a Champion,\" and his workshops have helped thousands of teachers learn from the best in the field.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nToo often a profession is forced to focus on its errors rather than its excellence. This can distort or slow reform.\n\nIf police in the United States and elsewhere want to keep their professional prestige and avoid tragic violence, body cameras might be one good solution. But they should be used as much as a learning tool as a correcting rod.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Who do you serve,\" thousands of protestors marched in Washington, D.C. Saturday, demanding legislative action against police violence toward unarmed black men.\n\nLoading...\n\nDec. 13, 2014, 12:13 p.m. ET | Washington, D.C.\n\nThousands of protesters converged on the nation's capital Saturday to help bring attention to the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police and call for legislative action.\n\nLed by several civil rights organizations, the crowd will march to the Capitol on Saturday afternoon with the families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed black men who died in incidents with white police officers. Civil rights advocate The Rev. Al Sharpton also will be part of the march. The groups and marchers - with signs reading \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Who do you protect? Who do you serve\" - are calling for law enforcement reforms after several high-profile cases of what they call police brutality.\n\nTerry Baisden, 52, of Baltimore said she is \"hopeful change is coming\" and that the movement is not part of a fleeting flash of anger.\n\nShe said she hasn't protested before but felt compelled to because \"changes in action, changes in belief, happen in numbers.\"\n\nProtests - some violent - have occurred around the nation since grand juries last month declined to indict the officers involved in the deaths of 18-year-old Brown in Ferguson, Missouri , and Garner, 43, who gasped \"I can't breathe\" while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in New York. Politicians and others talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system.\n\nMurry Edwards said he made the trip to Washington from St. Louis because he wants to make sure the momentum from the movement in Ferguson reaches a national stage.\n\n\"This is the national march,\" Edwards said. \"We have to get behind the national movement.\"\n\nSheryce Holloway, a recent graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond , attended a smaller gathering outside Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington ahead of the main rally.

      "text": "It might be different this time: Lawmakers, activists more optimistic about police reform\n\nBetween the thousands marching across the globe, the legislation moving through government channels and even the actions of some private businesses, it's clear that something is different this time.\n\nAn eruption of protests following George Floyd's death last month has spread wider than any comparable movement in recent history, analysts say , with hundreds of thousands turning out in all 50 states - and even overseas - to demonstrate against police brutality and racism.\n\nFloyd is not the only unarmed Black person whose death at the hands of police has driven protesters into the streets demanding change. But lawmakers and activists alike are seeing signs that this political moment, which comes amid the coronavirus pandemic and an already-vicious presidential election season , could finally bring to fruition some of the reforms they've pushed for years.\n\n\"I'm hopeful and I'm optimistic that this is the straw that has broken the camel's back,\" New York City Councilman Rory Lancman said in an interview.\n\nLancman, a Democratic council member from Queens, has reason to believe the political winds have shifted.\n\nIn 2014, he introduced a bill banning police chokeholds following the death of Eric Garner, a Black man who died in Staten Island in 2017 after an officer held him by the neck. The bill had failed to gain enough support to override a veto by Mayor Bill de Blasio , who vowed to reject the legislation after two NYPD officers were killed in Brooklyn.\n\nBut in the wake of Floyd's death, Lancman's bill has gained enough support for a veto-proof majority, even as it has been broadened to ban officers from restricting \"the flow of air or blood by compressing the windpipe, diaphragm, or the carotid arteries\" during an arrest. Floyd died after a since-fired Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with murder.\n\nLancman said the current civil unrest is the \"deepest, broadest wave of public outcry\" for criminal justice reform he's seen in his time in office. \"This moment allowed us to move [the bill] forward with confidence,\" he said.\n\nThat momentum appears to have carried over to Congress, where Democrats this week put forward sweeping police reform bills in the House and Senate . The bills would overhaul police precincts across the country, in part by banning the use of chokeholds, ending \"no-knock\" search warrants in drug cases and applying new oversight measures to departments.\n\nRepublicans, led by South Carolina's Tim Scott, one of only three Black U.S. senators, are working up their own alternative legislation to address the policing system. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday a proposal that steered clear of major police reform .\n\nLocal governments have already taken significant steps. After Minnesota launched a civil rights probe into Floyd's death, most of the Minneapolis City Council on Sunday committed to disbanding and replacing the city's police force .\n\nThe move marked an advancement for the movement to \"defund the police\" that has sprung from the protests . It will likely take Minneapolis years to decide how it would replace the police force. De Blasio said Monday he would redirect some NYPD funding to youth and social services.\n\nRandy Shrewsberry, executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform and a former police officer, said \"we're in full support of\" the calls to defund the police.\n\n\"There has to be a reevaluation from us collectively as a society as to what we are expecting the police to be in our day-to-day lives,\" Shrewsberry said. \"We are in big favor that there needs to be a reduction in funding [and] a reduction in manpower,\" he said.\n\nTimothy Lovelace, a Duke University law professor and legal historian of the civil rights movement, said Floyd's death, which was captured on video, \"added to the pain\" from other recent instances of unarmed Black men and women being killed. Lovelace cited the shootings of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March.\n\n\"Far too frequently, we see Black men and women who are being murdered on camera,\" Lovelace said. \"This leads to lots of frustrations and seems to be a reoccurring cycle.\"\n\nGarner and Floyd were unarmed. Both men had also said \"I can't breathe\" before they died - pleas that have become rallying cries for protesters.\n\nBut where the officer who put Garner in a chokehold did not face criminal charges, Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder . The three ex-officers who had assisted Chauvin's arrest of Floyd have been charged with aiding and abetting murder.\n\nThe protests against police brutality and racism have also reignited a debate over whether monuments and other displays of Confederate symbols should be removed from public spaces. And there has been an impact on popular culture, as well.\n\nSome police-focused entertainment content is also getting canceled . ViacomCBS announced it was dropping \"Cops,\" the reality show that has followed police officers on duty for 30 years. Cable network A&E also announced that it was ending production of a similar show, \"Live PD,\" and Investigation Discovery's version, \"Body Cam,\" has been removed from the network's schedule.\n\n\"My sense is that the outrage and the recognition of the injustices have now reached almost every segment of society,\" Lancman said.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which has forced state leaders to virtually shut down their state economies in an effort to slow transmission, may be providing additional oxygen to the protests.\n\n\"Many Americans have more time to turn their attention to social justice issues because of the Covid-19 crisis,\" as well as \"new space and new time to protest,\" Lovelace said.\n\nShrewsberry concurred: \"Part of this is that we're home right now and we're not distracted by running back and forth to the office. ... You know, none of this is new. This has been going on long before George Floyd died.\"\n\nAll states have started taking steps to lift their strict social distancing rules, and Trump has pushed regional leaders to speed up the process.\n\nTrump is eager to get back on the campaign trail, which had been derailed by the pandemic. With less than five months until the 2020 election, Trump is ceding ground to presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in multiple national polls .\n\nTrump's own popularity has declined as he faces criticism over his handling of the pandemic and his response to the protests over Floyd's death. More than 2 million Covid-19 cases, and at least 112,000 deaths, have been reported in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University .\n\nTrump has reacted aggressively to the protests, demanding \"law and order\" from state and city leaders to quash the violence that has sprung up at some demonstrations, while Biden has vowed to work to heal the country's racial wounds that undergird the unrest.\n\nThe protests have been largely peaceful, though violence and looting have broken out in multiple cities on some nights of demonstrations, especially in Minneapolis .\n\nRegardless, recent polls show that a majority of Americans support the protests .\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "George Floyd family calls for first-degree murder charges against cop after independent autopsy finds asphyxiation killed him\n\nLawyers for George Floyd's family on Monday called for a first-degree murder charge to be filed against ex-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin, who already faces lesser murder and manslaughter charges, after an independent autopsy commissioned by the family found that Floyd died as the result of asphyxiation from sustained pressure on his neck and back.\n\nFloyd's family cited those findings as they called for criminal charges to be lodged against the three police officers who were with Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes.\n\nHours later, the Hennepin County, Minnesota, Medical Examiner's Office released updated findings of its official autopsy, which ruled that Floyd was the victim of a homicide, with the cause of death being cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by police restraining him and compressing his neck.\n\nThe ME's autopsy noted \"other significant conditions\" in Floyd, which included \"arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; recent methamphetamine use.\"\n\nChauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter last week after the preliminary findings of the official autopsy suggested that Floyd's underlying heart conditions, combined with the police restraint and \"potential intoxicants in his system,\" likely contributed to his death.\n\nThose earlier findings by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner did not support a diagnosis of strangulation as the independent autopsy by Floyd's family did.\n\nBut Dr. Michael Baden, one of the pathologists who performed the independent autopsy, at a news conference Monday said, \"Mr. Floyd had no underlying medical problems that caused or contributed to his death.\"\n\nBaden's autopsy found that Floyd's death was a \"homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain,\" according to a statement issued by the family's lead attorney, Ben Crump.\n\n\"Sustained pressure on the right side of Mr. Floyd's carotid artery impeded blood flow to the brain, and weight on his back impeded his ability to breathe,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd's diaphragm to function.\"\n\nBaden addressed the fact that Floyd repeatedly said, \"I can't breathe\" as Chauvin knelt on his neck.\n\n\"Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That's not true,\" said Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, who conducted the second autopsy with Dr. Allecia Wilson of the University of Michigan.\n\nCrump said, \"For Chauvin to leave his knee on George's neck despite warnings and evidence that his life was in danger - and to continue that course for many minutes - demands a first-degree murder charge.\"\n\n\"For George Floyd, the ambulance was his hearse,\" Crump said.\n\nAntonio Romanucci, another lawyer for the Floyd family, said he would leave it up to state prosecutors to decide what charges should be lodged against Chauvin's three fellow officers, but said that charges of some kind are warranted, given the autopsy's findings.\n\n\"They knew that they were applying restraints that could or would cause death,\" said Romanucci about the other officers.\n\n\"They are criminally liable because they knew what they were doing could lead to death.\"\n\n\"Not only was the knee on George's neck a cause of his death, but so was the weight of the other two police officers on his back, who not only prevented blood flow into his brain but also air flow into his lungs.\"\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo on Sunday night said that all four officers are \"complicit\" in Floyd's death.\n\nThe incident, which is the latest in a series of deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police, has ignited protests nationwide.\n\nCrump and Floyd's family said people should continue to protest, but urged them to not engage in violence or looting.\n\nChauvin and three other officers - all of whom have since been fired - detained and arrested Floyd on suspicion that he had used a counterfeit bill to make a purchase.\n\nA criminal complaint , released Friday accuses Chauvin of keeping his knee pressed down on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including for nearly three minutes after Floyd was unresponsive.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

In Chicago, protesters walked  onto the Dan Ryan Expressway and brought traffic to a halt. And  in Washington, D.C, a crowd staged a \"die-in\" a block from the  National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony near the White House.\n\n\"Anger is not even a word, outrage is my word. Those words don't  begin to define the decomposition of your soul when you hear  something like this,\" said one protester at New York's Foley  Square, who identified himself as Graham D., 33. \"Before, no one  believed this was happening, but now we have clear distinct  evidence that police abuse is happening and still nothing  happens.\"\n\nRead More Protests follow no  indictment in NYPD chokehold case\n\nA grand jury on Wednesday declined to indict white NYPD officer  Daniel Pantaleo in the July 17 death of Eric Garner, who died  after being wrestled to the ground with Pantaleo's arm around his  neck, while telling officers, \"I can't breathe.\" A bystander  captured the incident on video.\n\nMany felt the grand jury's decision reaffirmed a belief that  police are too often not held accountable for excessive force,  especially when it comes to the deaths of unarmed black men. And  the grand jury's decision in the Garner case came a week after a  Missouri grand jury declined to indict a white Ferguson police  officer, Darren Wilson, for fatally shooting Michael Brown, who  was unarmed, on Aug. 9.\n\n\"I'm college educated and I still have to be seen like I'm a  threat due to my skin color,\" said protester Isaiah Jones, 22,  who demonstrated with a large group at Brooklyn's Fulton Mall.  \"We have to slow down everything in Brooklyn and Manhattan. If  they keep killing us, the system doesn't deserve to keep going.  It's the best we can do right now.\"\n\nRead More Violence erupts as Ferguson cop avoids  indictment\n\nThe protests occurred in several spots in New York City, with  crowds at times blocking traffic on the West Side Highway, lying  down in an intersection outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn,  and converging outside the terminal to the Staten Island Ferry in  southern Manhattan.\n\nPolice arrested at least 28 people during protests in New York as  of Thursday night, law enforcement sources said.\n\nProtesters also marched in Washington, D.C., for a second  straight day. A group of about 100 people staged a \"die-in\" near  the White House as a tree lighting ceremony went off about a  block away, NBC Washington reported. Several hundred protesters  marched in Boston ahead of a tree lighting ceremony on the Boston  Common and police were prepared for larger demonstrations, NBC  station WHDH reported.\n\nIn Chicago, hundreds marched during rush hour Thursday. Crowds  later walked onto the Dan Ryan Expressway, briefly closing it,  until police escorted them off the road. Protesters staged a  \"die-in\" on Roosevelt and shut down traffic for 10 minutes. There  were also protests in Dallas, Atlanta and Portland, Oregon.\n\nWednesday night, hundreds of protesters in New York shut down a  section of the West Side Highway and another group staged a  \"die-in\" at the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal and  rallied in Times Square. Police said they made 83 arrests at  various protest sites around the city.\n\nSome protesting in New York Thursday said they had no doubt that  Wilson would not be indicted for shooting Brown in Missouri. But  with the video showing Garner's arrest in such detail, they were  certain of a different outcome here.\n\n\"Ferguson, I wasn't surprised at all, I think we saw that coming,  but with this one I was horrified,\" said another protester in  Foley Square, Margaret Rodgers, 72. \"It's unbelievable and a  total miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Wednesday that the  Justice Department will launch a civil rights investigation into  Garner's death.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "After Chauvin verdict, business leaders speak out saying fight for racial justice must continue\n\nIn tweets, corporate statements and letters to their employees, some of the nation's top business leaders are expressing relief at the guilty verdict in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd. They are also calling for the country to continue to fight against systemic racism and for police reform.\n\nChauvin was found guilty of all three charges , including second-degree murder and third-degree murder, on Tuesday.\n\nLast spring, Floyd's murder catalyzed Black Lives Matter protests across the country and the globe. A video taken by a teenage bystander, Darnella Frazier, outside of a Minneapolis convenience store, showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes. In Floyd's final moments, he struggled to breathe and called out for his mother.\n\nAs protestors marched in the streets, companies faced scrutiny for their own records on racial equity. They were pushed to do more than simply put out statements - prompting a series of corporate commitments from overhauling how companies recruit and hire Black employees to backing mandatory deescalation training for police.\n\nHere is a round-up of reactions to the Chauvin verdict by business leaders and companies, in alphabetical order:\n\n\"There are countless examples of violence against Black men and women that don't end this way. In the past year, a number of brutal and senseless murders of Black Americans - from Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor to Daunte Wright and many others - remind us of the stark reality and persistence of systemic racism in our country. They sparked anger, awareness and dialogue; but not the change needed to address injustice in our communities and institutions. As an airline, we bring people of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds together every day.\"\n\n\"We believe Black lives matter. We know there is more work to do to achieve racial justice and equity in our society, and we remain committed to the journey.\"\n\n- Excerpts from a letter sent to employees Tuesday night by American Airlines executives, CEO Doug Parker, President Robert Isom and Cedric Rockamore, vice president of global people operations and diversity and inclusion\n\n- Tim Cook, Apple CEO, said on his personal Twitter account\n\n\"While this verdict in the murder of George Floyd symbolizes some measure of progress toward racial equity and accountability, it does not fully erase our nation's history of systemic and institutional racism. We still have a long way to go in our fight for racial justice in this country, and Best Buy's unwavering commitment to this work is as strong as ever.\"\n\n- Statement from Best Buy\n\n\"Today's verdict confirms that George Floyd was the victim of a senseless crime. Though today's verdict is a step toward justice in this case, unarmed Black men and women continue to die in encounters with the police. To ensure true justice and healing, our country needs to take steps to address its long history of racial inequity in law enforcement.\n\nBusiness Roundtable will continue to work with Members of Congress and the Administration on bipartisan policing reforms that implement national policing standards, and greater accountability, training, community engagement and transparency.\"\n\n- Statement by group of CEOs, which is led by its chairman, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon\n\n- Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, said on his personal Twitter account\n\n\"George Floyd's murder almost one year ago sparked a much needed reckoning on racism in America. It rightly pushed us as individuals and as a company to examine what we can and should do - what we must do - to take action to create a more equitable society.\n\nThe verdict in the trial today sparks a great deal of emotion for many of us. It feels like justice has been finally served, yet it doesn't end the grief felt by so many. It underscores the EMT's [executive management team's] commitment - shared by so many of you - to be allies, to fight systemic racism at every level, and to support all those facing injustice. It also speaks to the importance of the work we're doing through our Action for Racial Equity commitment to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the U.S.\"\n\n- Excerpts from a LinkedIn post by Sara Wechter, Citigroup 's head of human resources\n\n\"Right now I'm thinking of George Floyd, his family and those who knew him. I hope this verdict brings some measure of comfort to them, and to everyone who can't help but see themselves in his story. We stand in solidarity with you, knowing that this is part of a bigger struggle against racism and injustice.\"\n\n- Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of Facebook , said in a post on the social media site\n\n\"A small measure of justice was done today. But real justice would be for George Floyd to be alive and in the arms of his family. This brutal tragedy is one page in the much larger story of systemic racism, oppression, and injustice in our country.\n\nAs we continue to regularly witness unarmed Black people in America killed by police, I stand with those demanding change. We can't un-see what Derek Chauvin did to George Floyd. We can't un-know the truth it exposed about racism in America today. And we can't - mustn't - ever forget. There can be no true justice in America until liberty and equality are real for everyone.\n\nMy thoughts are with George Floyd's family today, and with so many other families who are missing their loved ones today.\"\n\n- Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, said in a post on the social media site\n\n\"We are hopeful today's verdict will allow a grieving family and a community to start to heal. However, the systemic racism and social injustice apparent in the killing of George Floyd and countless other terrible episodes in our country are deeply rooted. Together, we must remain thoughtful and determined in addressing this reality, including the unacceptable abuse of authority and power and the pain it causes - disproportionately for the Black community and other people of color. For our part, Ford and our UAW partners will continue to create a company culture where everyone feels they belong and our differences are truly valued.\"\n\n- Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford , and Jim Farley, CEO, said in a statement\n\n- Mary Barra, General Motors CEO, said on her personal Twitter account\n\n- Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO, said on his personal Twitter account, echoing the company's support of congressional action on police reform and advocacy for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act\n\n\"Justice was served, it's the beginning of a long path to fix some of these things.\"\n\n\"We haven't solved this racial inequality problem for hundreds of years, and in fact in some decades it's gone backwards.\"\n\n- Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO, said Wednesday at a company event\n\n- Marc Benioff, founder and CEO of Salesforce and owner of Time, quoting from a story by Time journalist Janell Ross\n\n\"Today's verdict is a verdict against bias, against injustice; an important milepost on our collective journey. As communities, as leaders and as businesses, we must all continue to be part of the solution to shift our society, take a stand against racism and violence, and act as a catalyst of change.\"\n\n- Mike Manley, Stellantis head of the Americas, said in a statement\n\n\"The murder of George Floyd last Memorial Day felt like a turning point for our country. The solidarity and stand against racism since then have been unlike anything I've experienced. Like outraged people everywhere, I had an overwhelming hope that today's verdict would provide real accountability. Anything short of that would have shaken my faith that our country had truly turned a corner.\n\nToday's guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial is another sign of forward progress. As I think about the Minneapolis Police Department denouncing the brutality George Floyd faced, and the disgrace expressed by multiple witnesses, the jury's verdict reassures me that we will not go backward.\n\nSadly, this kind of tragedy did not end last May 25, and our country has a lot of work to do and a long way to go. I can't imagine how difficult these months have been for the family and friends of George Floyd. They are very much in my thoughts, and I hope today's verdict offers some measure of solace.\n\nI am also thinking about our Black team members in particular. I know this trial cannot erase the pain that comes from years of inequalities and inequities. What I want to offer today is my promise that we as a company will continue to use our values and actions to advance empathy and understanding and to confront individual bias and systemic racism. Today's verdict does not mean that our work is done. There's much more to do as we support healing in our hometown of Minneapolis and across the country. We have to keep moving forward, together, toward a safe and equitable future for all.\"\n\n- Letter sent to employees Tuesday night by Target CEO Brian Cornell\n\n- Jeff Lawson, co-founder and CEO of Twilio , said on his personal Twitter account\n\n- Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber CEO, said on his personal Twitter account\n\n\"This has been an especially painful time in our nation, particularly for Black and African Americans and communities of color. We hope today's verdict is an initial step towards justice and healing. Wells Fargo is committed to fostering a culture that supports diversity, equity and inclusion, both within our company and the communities we serve.  As we move forward, we are working to create meaningful change and will continue supporting our employees, partners and investing in our communities because it's our responsibility as a corporate citizen and the right thing to do.\"\n\n- Statement shared by a Wells Fargo spokesperson\n\n- Eric Yuan, Zoom co-founder and CEO, said on his personal Twitter account, which included a copy of a letter sent to employees\n\n- CNBC's Leslie Josephs , Phil LeBeau , Ari Levy , Hugh Son, Michael Wayland and Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "George Floyd protests: Pentagon moves troops to DC, UCLA 'troubled' by police using stadium as 'field jail'\n\nState and local officials ramped up efforts once again Tuesday evening, adding to police forces and imposing earlier curfews as demonstrators took to the streets in major cities across the U.S. for another night of protests.\n\nNew York City announced its 8 p.m. curfew will remain in place for the rest of the week , but that didn't stop hundreds from marching to protest the death of George Floyd. The 46-year-old died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on the unarmed black man's neck for nearly nine minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, black tech CEOs spoke out against race violence , while opening up about how they have been racially profiled.\n\nThe Australian government announced that it had opened an investigation into the apparent assault of an Australian news crew covering protests near the White House Monday night.\n\n6:20 a.m. ET - The acting chief of U.S. Park Police has defended actions taken on Monday to forcibly clear protesters in order to allow President Donald Trump to have his photo taken in front of St John's Church outside the president's residence.\n\nIn a statement published on Tuesday , the agency said \"violent\" protesters had thrown projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids. It also denied tear gas was used by U.S. Park Police officers or any other assisting law enforcement officers to clear the area at Lafayette Park.\n\nInstead, Gregory T. Monahan, acting chief of the U.S. Park Police, said officers \"employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls.\"\n\nThe statement is in stark contrast to video footage which shows riot police and military police abruptly clearing a crowd of peaceful protesters near the White House by using pepper spray canisters and rubber bullets more than half-an-hour before the start of a city-wide curfew in Washington.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control says in a fact sheet published online that riot control agents, sometimes referred to by the umbrella term \"tear gas,\" includes pepper spray.\n\n4:45 a.m. ET - Pope Francis directly addressed the ongoing protests in the U.S. on Wednesday morning, saying racism or exclusion in any form cannot be tolerated but condemning violence as \"self-destructive and self-defeating.\"\n\n\"I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd,\" Pope Francis said, as he delivered the English-language section of his weekly audience.\n\n\"We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,\" he continued. \"At the same time, we have to recognize that the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.\"\n\n2:12 a.m. ET - The Houston Police Department said they have made more than 200 arrests of \"individuals engaged in criminal conduct, including throwing rocks and bottles at officers.\" It said many people refused to clear the streets and were taken into custody.\n\nThe department also said the figure was \"an extremely low number of arrests considering the thousands of people in our community who marched and demonstrated peacefully today.\" It said it is currently \"not aware of any significant property damage or injuries.\" - Christine Wang\n\n1:59 a.m. ET - UCLA said it is \"troubled\" by reports that the Los Angeles police used the Jackie Robinson Stadium as a \"field jail.\" The university said that was done \"without UCLA's knowledge or permission.\"\n\nThe college baseball stadium is named after Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first African-American player.\n\nUCLA's statement came after members of its faculty signed a letter expressing their deep concern that police used the stadium to detain protesters and process arrests on Monday.\n\n\"As UCLA faculty, we refuse to allow our university to serve as a police outpost at this moment of national uprising and at any other time,\" the letter said. \"As a public university, we serve the public and our students, and this in turn requires dismantling the mechanisms of punishment that have historically caused undeniable harm to communities in Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe letter also alleged that law enforcement violated social distancing protocol by crowding the detained protesters onto buses to bring them to UCLA. It also remarked on the \"cruel irony\" that the facility had previously been used as a Covid-19 testing site. - Christine Wang\n\n1:17 a.m. ET - Protesters continued demonstrations in many cities well after curfews began in their cities. Police in some regions began to make arrests.\n\nIn Los Angeles, NBC News reported that officers were seen taking people out of cars . Multiple sources familiar with the arrests told NBC that most were for violating curfew, which began at 6 p.m.\n\nAt least 1,000 protesters on a bridge turned back to Brooklyn after NYPD blocked them from entering Manhattan, NBC reported. The standoff between the two lasted more than an hour as some protesters tried to negotiate with police to let them through, NBC said.\n\nNew York City's curfew began at 8 p.m., but the Associated Press reported that thousands continued to demonstrate throughout the city. The AP reported that police began making arrests around 9 p.m.\n\nIn Washington D.C., peaceful protests also carried on past the 7 p.m. curfew , NBC Washington reported.\n\nThe Denver Post reported that marchers in the city stopped at 9:40 p.m. for nine minutes of silence in honor of Floyd.\n\nDenver, protesters were seen gathering at the Colorado State Capitol waving their cellphones after curfew began at 9 p.m. - Christine Wang\n\n12 a.m. ET - In an extraordinary resignation letter, a member of the Pentagon's Defense Science Board slammed Secretary of Defense Mark Esper for participating in a widely criticized White House photo-op in front of St. John's Church in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Law-abiding protesters just outside the White House were dispersed using tear gas and rubber bullets - not for the sake of safety, but to clear a path for a presidential photo op. You then accompanied President Trump in walking from the White House to St. John's Episcopal Church for that photo ... You may not have been able to stop President Trump from directing this appalling use of force, but you could have chosen to oppose it. Instead, you visibly supported it,\" Miller wrote in his resignation letter to Esper.\n\nIn a Tuesday night interview with NBC News , Esper said \"I didn't know where I was going\" when asked about the highly criticized photo opportunity. \"I thought I was going to do two things: to see some damage and to talk to the troops,\" he added. - Amanda Macias\n\n11:28 p.m. ET - The Department of Defense said it has moved multiple active duty Army units into the National Capitol Region as a \"prudent planning measure in response to ongoing support to civil authorities operations.\"\n\nIt said about 1,600 active duty troops have been recently moved from Fort Bragg and Fort Drum.\n\nThe announcement comes after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the military to quell demonstrations. He had also urged governors to mobilize more National Guard units.\n\nNearly 1,300 D.C. National Guard personnel were joined by 1,500 more from South Carolina, Tennessee and Indiana to help support local police in D.C. - Amanda Macias, Christine Wang\n\nUpdate: This post has been updated with further information.\n\n9 p.m. ET - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Tuesday to discuss the recent protests throughout the country following the death of George Floyd.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar said its \"essential\" to further the discussion about racism and police brutality toward black people in America.\n\nFloyd's death was the latest to spark outrage about racism and police brutality against black people. Abdul-Jabbar called for law enforcement and corporate officials to \"understand the problem\" facing blacks in America. - Jabari Young\n\n8:30 p.m. ET - President Donald Trump made two visits to Christian religious sites this week , both of which were marred by controversy almost as soon as they occurred.\n\nOn Monday, riot and military police abruptly cleared out a peaceful crowd of protesters near the White House with pepper spray and rubber bullets, apparently so that Trump could walk across the public park to a nearby church.\n\nThere, Trump held up a bible and posed for photographs. The following day, Trump visited a Catholic shrine in Washington to Saint Pope John Paul II, and signed an executive order on \"religious freedom\" at the White House.\n\nBoth visits drew condemnation from Christian religious leaders. The Rt. Rev. Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, said she was \"horrified\" that Trump had used the bible and the church as a political prop.\n\nFor the Trump reelection campaign, any potential schism between the president and Christian voters is cause for alarm, after a series of recent polls that showed the president losing ground among evangelical and Catholic voters.But one of the lessons of Trump's 2016 victory was that his stumbles with the Christian faith did little to dampen support for him among evangelical Christian voters. - Christina Wilkie\n\n7:30 p.m. ET - Tech CEOs have been vocal in their opposition to race violence, but almost none of them are black -- there's not a single black CEO among tech companies in the Fortune 500.\n\nRocket Lawyer's Charley Moore and ShotSpotter's Ralph Clark are in the distinct minority, and both have a lot to say about the significance of the killing of George Floyd. Moore says he's been racially profiled his whole life, most recently when he was pulled over in Vermont while driving with his son. Clark says that as a black man in the business world, \"you've got to work twice as hard and be twice as good to get half as far.\" - Ari Levy\n\n6:30 p.m. ET - The Minnesota National Guard said Tuesday it plans to test all of its nearly 7,000 deployed troops for the coronavirus after one tested positive and nine others developed symptoms.\n\nThe state's National Guard is deployed in response to mass protests sparked by George Floyd's death, caused by a Minneapolis police officer who knelt on the unarmed black man's neck for nearly nine minutes.\n\n\"Upon activation, all of our members were screened for health readiness, including for symptoms of COVID-19,\" Lt. Col. Dean Stulz said in a statement, adding that one service member tested positive for Covid-19 and has been placed in isolation.\n\nNearly a dozen public health specialists who spoke with CNBC have expressed concern that the protests will lead to greater spread of Covid-19 as many unmasked officers and protesters clash. - William Feuer\n\n6 p.m. ET - A senior Defense official told reporters that the nation's highest-ranking military officer's role had not changed, despite President Donald Trump's comments a day prior saying he was putting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \"in charge\" of efforts to address protests.\"\n\nAlthough the military and the Department are involved, General Milley remains an advisor to the president, remains an advisor to the Secretary, his role has not changed,\" the Defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a contentious call with the nation's governors Monday , Trump described Milley as \"a warrior\" with \"a lot of victories and no losses,\" according to audio obtained by NBC. He then added that he was putting the four-star general in charge. It was not immediately clear what Milley would be tasked with as it relates to the domestic unrest across the nation, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. - Amanda Macias\n\n5:45 p.m. ET - Former President George W. Bush spoke out about the turmoil that has followed the death of George Floyd.\n\nBush, the 43rd president, lamented the enduring stain of racism on American society while condemning the looting and rioting that has accompanied the wave of protests over Floyd's death.\n\n\"Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions,\" Bush said in a statement.\n\nBut \"we know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means,\" Bush said. \"Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress.\"Bush has largely avoided the spotlight since leaving office in 2009. Former President Barack Obama on Monday shared his own thoughts about the protests over Floyd's death. - Amanda Macias\n\n5:30 p.m. ET - The Australian government said it will open an investigation into the apparent assault of an Australian news crew covering protests near the White House.During a live broadcast, a Channel 7 correspondent and cameraman were hit with rubber bullets as U.S. law enforcement forcibly cleared their position within a protest. The pair are then seen running from the scene while another policeman swung at them with a baton. Before the on-camera reporter was struck, she was heard telling officers that she was a member of the media.\n\ntweet\n\nAustralia's ambassador in Washington, Arthur Sinodinos, said that his government was \"in discussion with the State Department and they have offered assistance to identify where the complaint should be targeted.\" - Amanda Macias\n\n5:16 p.m. ET - Citi Bike said it received short notice on Monday to shut down its service by 10:30 p.m. and for the duration of New York City's curfew. The bicycle-sharing company also said it is required to shut down for the new curfew, starting at  8 p.m., after being unable to reach an agreement with the mayor's office and the city's transportation department.\n\nIn a tweet, Citi Bike said, \"We disagree with this decision and believe it is important for the system to remain open and provide a reliable transportation option. We know how disruptive this is to everyone who relies on Citi Bike to get home - especially essential workers.\"\n\nCiti Bike Tweets\n\nCiti Bike service in Jersey City, New Jersey will continue uninterrupted. -Melodie Warner\n\n4:57 p.m. ET - California police made hundreds of arrests Monday as people disobeyed curfews implemented amidst widespread protests in the state, according to a report from the Associated Press.\n\nWhile many demonstrations remained peaceful and ended when curfews took effect, lingering crowds tossed fireworks and bottles, and police deployed rubber bullets and tear gas.The unrest was on a smaller scale compared to the violence seen in California over the weekend, which included the destruction of local businesses, multiple injuries and the torching of police cars. -Hannah Miller\n\n4:33 p.m. ET - As Americans in cities nationwide have taken to the streets to protest, a new meta-analysis published in The Lancet Monday found social distancing to be the most effective way to slow the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThousands of demonstrators in cities across the country have gathered to protest police brutality after the death of George Floyd. But Dr. Holger Schünemann, a professor of medicine and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Canada who worked on the analysis, told NBC News the protests heighten the risk of spreading coronavirus .\n\nThe analysis comes as public officials, including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, have expressed concerns that the protests could prompt an increase in the spread of the virus.\n\nSchünemann recommended hand washing and the use of eye and face coverings to lower the risk of spread. The analysis, which reviewed 172 studies to gauge the success of prevention and control measures, found that staying at least 3 feet apart can reduce the likelihood of transmission from 12.8% to 2.6%, though the authors noted distances of 6 feet or more could further lessen the transmission rate. -Alex Harring\n\n4:20 p.m. ET - \"A lot of people are focused on the fact that the unrest is tied specifically to the spate of recent murders we've had and that's absolutely true,\" Scott Mills, president of the BET Network, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" Tuesday. \"But the broader context of the unrest is that people are fundamentally saying we require change in this country. This disparate treatment of the black American community, this effect of lethal racism on this community, it has to change.\"\n\nBET is broadcasting a special Tuesday night featuring leaders and activists to discuss solutions to systemic issues in the country. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, singer John Legend and activist Tamika Mallory are among those who will be part of the dialogue.\n\nThe network has also announced that it is holding its first-ever presidential forum and has invited President Donald Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden to participate. -Sarah Whitten\n\n4:03 p.m. ET - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees the company would not reverse its decision to leave up a post in which President Trump said \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\n\nZuckerberg announced this during a virtual all-hands meeting following public criticism over the weekend and on Monday from dozens of employees. At least two employees resigned over Facebook's refusal to moderate Trump.\n\n\"I cannot stand by Facebook's continued refusal to act on the president's bigoted messages aimed at radicalizing the American public,\" software engineer Timothy Aveni posted on LinkedIn . -Salvador Rodriguez\n\n3:57 p.m. ET - The state of Minnesota filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department and is launching a broad investigation into its policies and practices.\n\nGov. Tim Walz said the Minnesota Department of Human Rights will lead the inquiry, which will cover the past 10 years of \"policies, procedures, and practices\" at the department. The investigation will seek to determine whether the police department engaged in systemic discrimination.\n\nIn a tweet, Walz wrote that his administration \"will use every tool at our disposal to deconstruct generations of systemic racism in Minnesota. This effort is one of many steps to come in our effort to restore trust with communities that have been unseen and unheard for far too long.\"\n\nWalz tweet\n\nA separate federal investigation being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota, the Department of Justice and the FBI is probing whether the Minneapolis Police Department violated federal law in connection with Floyd's death. -Tucker Higgins\n\n3:43 p.m. ET - A senior Defense official said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, did not intend to participate in President Donald Trump's photo-op in front of St. John's Church.\n\n\"They were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square. And once they began that walk off the White House grounds with the president, their understanding was that they were going out of the White House to go into a Lafayette Park to review the efforts to do address the protests,\" explained a senior Defense official on a call with Pentagon reporters.\n\nOnce the protesters were forcibly cleared, Trump walked through the square with several members of his Cabinet as well as Chairman Milley. The president then stood in front of the historic church holding a Bible and posing for photographs. He later motioned to members of his Cabinet to stand alongside him for more pictures.\n\nEsper, who has previously said that he would preserve the military's apolitical nature, entered the frame and stood alongside Trump for the photo op. Esper and Milley were later seen engaging with National Guard members responding to the civil unrest. -Amanda Macias\n\n2:54 p.m. ET - A lawyer for the family of George Floyd said \"we understand that\" former vice president Joe Biden will attend Floyd's funeral on June 9 in Houston.\n\nBiden's presidential campaign had no immediate comment on whether he would attend the service for Floyd. CNBC has requested comment from Floyd family lawyer Ben Crump on whether President Donald Trump has been invited to the funeral. The White House had no immediate comment.\n\nCrump also said that he expects that three other officers who were with Officer Derek Chauvin when he kneeled on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes would be criminally charged before the funeral next week. -Dan Mangan\n\n2:50 p.m. ET - Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said the spread of the coronavirus and now, civil unrest, won't keep people from gravitating to urban centers across the country.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC's \"Power Lunch,\" the Ohio mayor said he remembers when people worried the 9/11 terrorist attacks would drive people away from New York City.\n\n\"I was a city councilman at the time here in Cincinnati, and we were all afraid it would signal the end of urban life,\" he said.\n\nCranley said he had similar concerns when people protested after a police officer killed an unarmed black man, Timothy Thomas, in Cincinnati in 2001.\n\nBut, he added, since then, New York City has come back and Cincinnati's population is rising again. He said urbanization is increasing and people want to live in cities near others who are creative and innovative. - Melissa Repko\n\n2:31 p.m. ET - Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley joined other business leaders in voicing his thoughts to employees about the \"senseless and tragic death of George Floyd.\"\n\nManley, in a message to employees obtained by CNBC, said he is \"deeply disturbed by the events that have occurred in the U.S.\" following the death last week of the 46-year-old unarmed black man, which has sparked protests and riots across the globe.\n\n\"On behalf of everyone at the company, I emphatically reject the hatred and prejudice that still tears at the fabric of our society and which led to the death of George Floyd and so many before him,\" Manley wrote. \"Although we are seeing the rawness of this issue exposed in the United States, the scourge of racism and discrimination has no respect for international boundaries.\" -Michael Wayland\n\n12:57 p.m. ET - Countless companies have come out publicly in recent days to condemn racism and police brutality or to reflect how they're responding following the death of George Floyd\n\nAnd while some responses have been well-received, others have fallen flat for appearing hypocritical or opportunistic .\n\n\"People want to feel that black lives matter to brands before we get to the streets. Before something is burning. Before we are marching for our lives,\" God-is Rivera, the global director of culture and community at Twitter , told CNBC. \"I think it's really important that brands first have to really think about, have they built equity with this community?\" -Megan Graham\n\n12:48 p.m. ET - Infectious disease experts and doctors fear protests will spur more Covid-19 infections and potentially make a second wave of the coronavirus in the fall much worse. However, they also say it's difficult to balance the desire to protest injustice against the risk of infection.\n\nWhile protesters cannot completely eliminate the risk of the coronavirus, there are things they can do to decrease the spread or chance of getting it , according to interviews with a dozen epidemiologists, doctors and infectious disease specialists. -Berkeley Lovelace Jr.\n\n12:37 p.m. ET - President Donald Trump gave credit to himself for \"Domination\" and \"overwhelming force\" that he said kept relative calm in Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis on Monday night after continued protests about George Floyd's death in police custody.\n\n\"D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!),\" he wrote in a Twitter post.\n\nTweet\n\nTrump also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his brother Chris Cuomo, an anchorman on CNN, whom the president insultingly called \"Fredo,\" a reference to a hapless character in the \"The Godfather\" saga.\n\n\"Yesterday was a bad day for the Cuomo Brothers. New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum,\" Trump wrote in a tweet. \"The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces. Likewise, Fredo's ratings are down 50%!\"\n\nTweet\n\nTrump's taunt came a day after police swept clear the area in front of the White House, using force to clear protesters so that the president could stage a photo opportunity at the nearby St. John's Episcopal Chapel, where he posed for cameras while holding a bible. - Dan Mangan\n\n12:28 p.m. ET - Instagram users are taking part in Blackout Tuesday and posting images of black squares in solidarity with black victims of police violence. As of 11:45 a.m. ET, more than 14.6 million Instagram posts used the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday.\n\nThe online movement first started in the music industry, when executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang requested that fellow leaders pause business and take a stand against racism. Platforms, such as Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube Music, joined the movement and are using their apps to promote black artists.\n\nThe movement has since spread to brands, organizations and individuals, who are using Instagram to post only a black square to show a virtual moment of silence. Others are choosing to continue posting, but will only amplify voices of the black community.\n\nThe movement also hit a snag in the morning as people used hashtags meant for Black Lives Matter, which usually is related to global protests and donations, along with their black squares. That caused the usual #BLM and #BlackLivesMatter pages to be flooded with simple squares rather than information and resources, leading several to call out the problem. - Jessica Bursztynsky\n\n12:15 p.m. ET - A curfew on New York City will continue through the end of the week as heated protests over the death of George Floyd continue to shake the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced.\n\nThe curfews will take effect at 8 p.m. ET each evening and will be lifted at 5 a.m. the following morning, de Blasio said at a press briefing. The extension comes as massive protests in the city over Floyd's death at the hands of a police officer erupted into violence and looting once again Monday night. New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at the briefing that nearly 700 arrests were made on Monday night.\n\n\"We will not tolerate violence of any kind. We will not tolerate attacks on police officers. We will not tolerate hatred being created,\" de Blasio said. \"An attack on police officers is an attack on all of us. Pure and simple.\" - Kevin Breuninger\n\n11:55 a.m. ET - Former Vice President Joe Biden slammed President Donald Trump's handling of the multiple crises plaguing the country, including the protests against police brutality and the coronavirus pandemic. Biden also laid out his own plan for police reform , and he pressed Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit the use of chokeholds by police.\n\nBiden invoked Floyd's memory by repeating his last words. \"'I can't breathe.' George Floyd's last words,\" said Biden. \"But they didn't die with him. They're still being heard. They're echoing across this nation.\"\n\n\"They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk. They speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to a virus and 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment - with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in the black and minority communities,\" he added.\n\nBiden, who was vice president under Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, has previously said that he decided to run for the White House after hearing Trump say there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists and neo-Nazis marched in 2017. - Amanda Macias, Christina Wilkie\n\n11:50 a.m. ET - Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a request from Secretary of Defence Mark Esper to send up to 5,000 of the state's Army National Guard to Washington, D.C., the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe request was part of a show of force spearheaded by the Trump administration to respond to violent civil protests and looting, Northam's chief of staff, Clark Mercer, told AP.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's comments to governors in a phone call Monday , in which he said most governors were \"weak\" and needed to \"dominate\" the streets, played a role in the decision.\n\n\"The president's remarks to the governors heightened our concerns about how the guard would be used,\" Mercer told AP. - Terri Cullen\n\n10:32 a.m. ET - My wife and I, like most Americans, were horrified by the killing of George Floyd last week and moved by the peaceful protests against racial injustice that followed. As white people raising a black baby girl, we need to prepare our daughter for a world where the deck can be stacked against minorities.\n\nWe don't pretend to know what it's like to be black, but we know we want to be part of the solution to create a more inclusive and just society. When we need help, we're going to ask for it from our black friends, the black community and our families. We hope our daughter, in time, will not have to endure the kind of racism that exists today, more than a half century since the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAfter a weekend of violent unrest, I held my baby girl and told her I loved her and that's she's a ray of hope who someday can be part of the changes we hope to see in America. But I assured her that for now her job is to be the beautiful, charismatic, and healthy little girl that brings such joy to our lives. Read my entire commentary here. - Matthew J. Belvedere\n\n9:54 a.m. ET - Leaders of three civil rights groups said they were \"disappointed and stunned\" after a call with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg about the company's decisions to maintain posts by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe executives participated in a Zoom call Monday with leaders of Color of Change, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\n\"We are disappointed and stunned by Mark's incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,\" wrote the leaders, Rashad Robinson of Color of Change, Vanita Gupta of the Leadership Conference and Sherrilyn Ifill of LDF. \"He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump's call for violence against protesters. Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\"\n\nTrump addressed recent protests over the killing of George Floyd while in police custody, in a post on both Twitter and Facebook Friday, saying, \"Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Twitter flagged the tweet with a warning that it violates the company's rules about \"glorifying violence,\" but Facebook took no action on the post.\n\nHundreds of Facebook employees took part in a \"virtual walkout\" Monday in a rare show of opposition within the company. The employees said on social media that they were ashamed and upset by their employers' decision to leave Trump's post untouched.\n\n\"We're grateful that leaders in the civil rights community took the time to share candid, honest feedback with Mark and Sheryl. It is an important moment to listen, and we look forward to continuing these conversations,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. - Lauren Feiner\n\n9:47 a.m. ET - Outgoing AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told CNBC that chief executives across the U.S. need to advocate for racial justice following the killing of George Floyd. Stephenson specifically pointed toward law enforcement policies that allow racial profiling, saying those must be stopped.\n\n\"All of us CEOs have large African-American employee bodies. We owe it to them to make sure that we're speaking to this, that we're asking our policymakers to step up, that we're asking our political leaders to step up and recognize and just say it: We've got a problem,\" Stephenson said in a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"We have a big problem and it needs to be dealt with.\" - Jessica Bursztynsky\n\n9:13 a.m. ET - In a message to employees and the public, Home Depot CEO Craig Menear spoke out against \"the senseless killing\" of unarmed black men and women, including George Floyd.\n\n\"We cannot ignore that their deaths are part of a pattern of racism and reflect the harsh reality that as a nation we are much too far from fulfilling the promise of equal justice for all,\" he wrote. \"We must stand with all who are committed to change that will bring us closer to realizing an end to discrimination and hatred.\"\n\nMenear said the retailer will donate $1 million to Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit and nonpartisan organization. He said he is also working with employees to plan internal town halls \"to share our experiences and create better understanding among us all.\" - Melissa Repko\n\n9:09 a.m. ET - General Motors CEO and Chairman Mary Barra is \"impatient and disgusted\" following the deaths of George Floyd and other black Americans, she said in messages to employees, suppliers and dealers this week. Barra said she is commissioning an \"inclusion advisory board\" of both internal and external leaders, which she will chair.\n\n\"Putting this in writing is not enough,\" she wrote. \"In addition to affirming the above principles, we are taking immediate action.\" Barra said we need to stop asking why and start asking what we can \"do - individually and collectively - to drive change ... meaningful, deliberate change. As one of the largest global companies, there is much we can do.\"\n\nBarra's message, according to a GM spokesman, was posted on the company's internal intranet Sunday. It was then distributed to thousands of GM dealers and suppliers on Monday. - Michael Wayland\n\n9:02 a.m. ET - New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday proposed a reform agenda that prohibits law enforcement officers from using excessive force and chokeholds, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio years ago said he'd veto.\n\n\"I said from day one, I share the outrage and I stand with the protestors, [sic]. You look at that video of the killing of an unarmed man, Mr. Floyd, it is horrendous,\" Cuomo said during a press briefing with reporters, referencing the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last week in Minneapolis.\n\n\"So, yes, we should be outraged,\" he added. \"And yes, there's a bigger point to make. It is abuse by police. But it's something worse. It is racism. It is discrimination. It is fundamental inequality and injustice.\" -Yelena Dzhanova\n\n8:30 a.m. ET - Bank of America announced it's committing $1 billion to help communities grappling with exacerbated economic and racial inequality caused by the Covid-19 pandemic . The bank said in a press release that the program will focus on \"assisting people and communities of color that have experienced a greater impact from the health crisis.\" The funds will be used toward virus testing, flu clinics, support for minority-owned businesses and investments in affordable housing. -Thomas Franck\n\n7:54 a.m. ET - Popular social networking site TikTok has apologized after users complained that the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd were showing zero views .\n\nTikTok said in a blog post that it was down to a technical glitch, suggesting that it had nothing to do with suppression.\n\n\"We acknowledge and apologize to our Black creators and community who have felt unsafe, unsupported, or suppressed,\" wrote Vanessa Pappas, TikTok U.S. general manager, and Kudzi Chikumbu, director of creator community. -Sam Shead\n\n7:47 a.m. ET - Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford and CEO and President Jim Hackett sent a rather open letter to employees Monday regarding the \"tragic killing of George Floyd\" as well as America's ongoing \"systematic racism.\"\n\nFord joins other companies such as Apple and Snap in sending messages to employees regarding the death of Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer last week, which has sparked protests and riots across the country.\n\n\"While we would like to say that racism has no place in our society, we know that systemic racism still exists despite the progress that has been made,\" the letter said. \"We cannot turn a blind eye to it or accept some sense of 'order' that's based on oppression.\"\n\nThe message was sent Monday afternoon before President Donald Trump threatened to bring in the military if states and cities fail to bring an end to protests and riots across the country following Floyd's death.\n\nFord's message also addressed the coronavirus pandemic's impact on black communities , citing \"the legacy of economic disparities in our own home city of Detroit.\" -Michael Wayland\n\nRead CNBC's previous coverage of the nationwide demonstrations: New York City imposes earlier curfew after violent protests, Trump threatens military action .\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Cleveland protests erupt after officer found not guilty\n\nA Cleveland police officer was found not guilty on Saturday in  the shooting deaths of an unarmed black man and a woman after a  high-speed car chase in 2012, one in a series of cases that have  raised questions over police conduct and race relations in the  United States.\n\nJudge John O'Donnell said Officer Michael Brelo, 31, acted  reasonably in shooting the two suspects while standing on the  hood of their surrounded car and firing multiple rounds through  the windshield. Brelo, who was among a group of officers who  fired on the car, was found not guilty of voluntary manslaughter  and aggravated assault.\n\nProtesters took to Cleveland streets on Saturday night as police  patrolled in riot gear. Cleveland police spokeswoman Jennifer  Ciaccia said that more than 20 people had been arrested.\n\nBrelo's trial, which began on April 6, took place at a time when  U.S. law enforcement is under scrutiny for the use of lethal  force against minority groups. It followed a series of  high-profile deaths of unarmed black men in confrontations with  police, which have prompted sometimes violent  demonstrations.\n\nThe two people who were killed, Malissa Williams and Timothy  Russell, were black and Brelo, a former Marine, is white.\n\n\"Brelo was acting in conditions difficult for even experienced  officers to imagine,\" O'Donnell said during the roughly hour-long  reading of the verdict.\n\n\"He was in a strange place at night surrounded by gunfire, sirens  and flashing bulbs. Brelo did not fire too quickly or at a person  who was clearly unarmed or unable to run him over,\" he  added.\n\nSoon after the verdict, a small crowd of demonstrators took to  the streets chanting \"No justice, no peace,\" with protests  becoming larger and more unruly.\n\nPolice said on Twitter there was an incident with a large crowd  with people spraying others with pepper spray.\n\nPolice arrested at least three people at a restaurant after  someone threw an object through a window and injured a  customer.\n\nReaction to the verdict was swift on social media, with many  saying they were bewildered.\n\nU.S. Representative Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Ohio, called  the decision a \"stunning setback on the road to justice.\"\n\n\"The verdict is another chilling reminder of a broken  relationship between the Cleveland Police Department and the  community it serves,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"Today we have been told - yet again - our lives have no value,\"  added Fudge, who is African-American.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said its civil rights division, the  U.S. attorney's office and the FBI were reviewing testimony and  evidence from the state trial and would determine if federal  action would be taken.\n\n\"While the law and the court ... found him not guilty, we feel  that he was culpable and he was far from innocent, as was the  city of Cleveland in their role in this situation,\" Paul  Cristallo, an attorney for Russell's family, told a news  conference.\n\nBrelo's attorney, Patrick D'Angelo, described prosecutors as  \"ruthless\" for pursuing the charges against his client. \"It was  classically a case of David vs Goliath,\" he said.\n\nThe trial came months after the Justice Department found the  Cleveland Police Department systematically engages in excessive  use of force against civilians. It launched the   investigation after a series of incidents, including the  Brelo case.\n\nThe department, in a December report, found that supervisors  tolerated and in some cases, endorsed use of unnecessary or  unreasonable force.\n\nJust days before the report was released, a Cleveland police  officer shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was  carrying what turned out to be a replica gun that typically fires  plastic pellets. The shooting is under investigation.\n\nCar chase\n\nAhead of Saturday's verdict, Cleveland officials braced for  demonstrations, concerned about flashes of violence that erupted  in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, after fatal shootings of  unarmed black men.\n\nSix officers involved in the Baltimore incident in April have  been indicted, while a Missouri grand jury decided against  bringing charges against the officer who fatally shot Michael  Brown in Ferguson last August.\n\nMayor Frank Jackson said he hoped Cleveland would stay peaceful.  \"Actions that cross the line, either by police officers or  citizens, can not and will not be tolerated,\" he said.\n\nFive other police supervisors were indicted on misdemeanor  dereliction of duty charges in the deaths of Williams and   Russell and are scheduled to go on trial in July. Dozens of  officers have been disciplined and Cleveland paid the families of  Williams and Russell $1.5 million each to settle a wrongful death  lawsuit.\n\nBrelo, who waived his right to a jury trial, will remain on  unpaid suspension until a police review is completed, Cleveland  Police Chief Calvin Williams said.\n\nThe chase, which started in downtown Cleveland after reports of  gunfire coming from the car, went through multiple cities at  speeds topping 90 mph (145 kph) and ended with 13 Cleveland  police officers firing 137 rounds.\n\nRussell was struck 24 times and Malissa Williams 23 times. No  weapon was found in the car or along the route. A forensic  mechanic testified that the car was prone to backfiring.\n\nThe judge found Brelo, who climbed on the car's hood once it had  been cornered by patrol cars, had acted reasonably in the belief  that the suspects were shooting at him and other officers.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Michael Jordan Can 'No Longer Stay Silent'\n\nSign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter\n\nFor most of his time as a public figure, Michael Jordan has taken  heat for not being outspoken enough on politics and social  justice issues.\n\nThe oft-disputed quote \"Republicans buy sneakers, too\" has long  been attributed to him, after he failed to throw his weight  behind the 1990 U.S. Senate candidate Harvey Gantt, an  African-American lawmaker challenging the infamously racially  insensitive Sen. Jesse Helms.\n\nBut on Monday, Jordan wrote a personal essay for the  African-American themed sports blog The Undefeated -  breaking with his decades-long tradition of largely being  agnostic when it comes controversy.\n\nRead more from NBC News: WNBA Rescinds Fines Issued Over 'Black Lives Matter'  Protest WNBA Stars Angered Over League Fines for 'Black Lives  Matter' Protest Heat Wave Grips the East Coast, Expected to Last All  Week\n\nIn a post entitled \"I Can No Longer Stay Silent,\" Jordan  referenced the 1993 gun-violence related death of his own father  to underline how the shootings of unarmed black men is a deeply  personal issue for him. \"I grieve with the families who have lost  loved ones, as I know their pain all too well,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people  regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and  frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem  to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better  than that, and I can no longer stay silent,\" Jordan added. \"We  need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair  and equal treatment AND that police officers - who put their  lives on the line every day to protect us all - are  respected and supported.\"\n\nJordan, who remains one of highest-earning athletes despite  having retired from the game of basketball 13 years ago, has  pledged to contribute $1 million to the Internal Association of  Chiefs of Police's Institute for Community-Police Relations and  the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\n\"We are privileged to live in the world's greatest country -  a country that has provided my family and me the greatest of  opportunities,\" wrote Jordan. \"The problems we face didn't happen  overnight and they won't be solved tomorrow, but if we all work  together, we can foster greater understanding, positive change  and create a more peaceful world for ourselves, our children, our  families and our communities.\"\n\nWhile Jordan's position on gun violence is hardly a radical one,  his uncharacteristically candid commentary is an unexpected  declaration for the NBA icon who fellow Hall of Famer Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar once accused of choosing \"commerce over conscience.\"\n\nIn recent years, Jordan was also dinged for helping turn his  beloved sneaker brand into a literally dangerous commodity in  communities of color and for not being more active on behalf of  Barack Obama during his campaigns for the White House (although  he did appear at a 2012 fundraiser for him).\n\nTweet\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan's remarks come after a flurry of activist  statements from current professional basketball players. NBA  superstars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane  Wade all made public pleas to stop the violence at the opening of  this years' ESPY awards.\n\nAnd the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, New York Liberty and the Indiana  Fever went even further, donning shirts with hashtags honoring  Black Lives Matter and the white police officers murdered  recently in Dallas. There actions resulted in small fines for the  players, and they responded by refusing to take any  sports-related questions in a follow-up game. The league  eventually rescinded their punishments.\n\nThis is also not the first time recently that Jordan, the owner  of the NBA franchise the Charlotte Hornets, has been dragged into  a public dispute which speaks to cultural issues. Last week,  Jordan begrudgingly agreed with the NBA's decision to pull next  year's All-Star game out of Charlotte in protest of the state of  North Carolina's controversial \"bathroom bill,\" which many  believe permits discrimination against the LGBT community.\n\nAnd in 2014, Jordan weighed in on the controversy swirling around  then-Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was caught  on tape making racially prejudiced statements about his own  players.\n\n\"I look at this from two perspectives - as a current owner  and as a former player,\"Jordan said in a statement at the time.  \"As an owner, I'm obviously disgusted that a fellow team owner  could hold such sickening and offensive views.\"\n\nPerhaps, just as Jordan predicted at his polarizing Hall of Fame  induction ceremony speech that his journey with the game of  basketball was far from over, it appears that his evolution as a  public figure with considerable influence has continued,  too.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

These are great young men,\" Tepper told CNBC's Scott Wapner in a \" Halftime Report \" interview from Carnegie Mellon University. \"So to say that [they aren't patriotic] makes me so aggravated and angry. It's just wrong, it's dead wrong.\"\n\nThe protests, which started with players sitting during the anthem then moved to them kneeling, were spurred by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick then spread around the league, focusing on police brutality and shootings of unarmed black men. However, few players knelt during the first game of the 2018 season last week.\n\nKaepernick had filed a collusion suit against the NFL, saying owners conspired to keep him out because of his position on the anthem. One of his co-protesters in San Francisco was Eric Reid, a 49ers safety who also filed a collusion complaint. Tepper signed Reid on Thursday to a one-year contract.\n\nTrump has criticized the protests repeatedly and some fans have boycotted the NFL. Viewership has been down significantly.\n\nTepper has been critical of Trump in the past.\n\n\"We're talking about it? I wasn't talking about it,\" Tepper said in response to Wapner saying that the protests remain a point of conversation. \"There's a red-headed guy in D.C. that likes to talk about it, but I don't want to mention his name.\"\n\nReciting the pledge of allegiance, Tepper said the protests are about \"justice for all.\"\n\n\"It's the Pledge of Allegiance, one of the most patriotic things you can do. It's about justice for all,\" he said. \"Now listen, everybody's standing this season, because I think people understand that it's what you do in the community, it's what you do out here.\"\n\nThough he didn't criticize anyone directly, he said the league generally could do a better job of publicizing the good that players do.\n\n\"You've got a lot of people that do a lot of good things.

      "text": "Economic decline underpins Baltimore protests\n\nIt's not just about the law enforcement.\n\nThe rioting this week in Baltimore has been blamed on anger and  frustration over the April 19 death of a 25-year-old African-American man in police custody.\n\nBut the source of the  widespread unrest in the city-and other distressed urban  neighborhoods-stems largely from decades of economic  decline and the dearth of services and opportunities for those  left behind, according to some economists, urban policy experts  and local observers.\n\nAfter a night of rioting and arson, residents of the hardest-hit  neighborhoods in Baltimore began clearing debris Tuesday morning as National  Guard members joined local police in sections of the city that  had seen the worst of the protests.\n\nProtesters continued to seek a fuller explanation for what happened to Freddie Gray, who died from a spinal injury a week after being arrested by Baltimore police, while  city and state officials sought to maintain calm after violence  flared after a week of peaceful protests. The public outcry  echoed similar protests of police killings of unarmed black men  in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.\n\nAs the violence subsided, some of that outcry turned to the  economic forces that have thwarted efforts to widen opportunities for city residents. In neighborhoods hit hardest by  Monday's rioting, more than a third of families live in poverty.  Some sections have not been rebuilt since the 1968 rioting that  followed the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther  King Jr.\n\nSince then, Baltimore-like a number of other, older American  cities-has seen its economic base hollowed out by the flight  of wealthier residents to the suburbs and businesses sending  high-wage jobs overseas.\n\n\"You had good-paying jobs in manufacturing that offered  tremendous opportunities for African-Americans in the '50s and '60s  and those began to dry up in the '70s and more rapidly in the  '80s,\" said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic  and Policy Research. \"So the avenues to a secure  middle-class life have really been cut off.\"\n\nRead More\n\nAs those jobs left, so did the tax base to pay for city services,  including education and training to prepare residents for better  economic opportunities, said Baker.\n\n\"For the ones left behind the cities are in pretty bad  financial shape,\" he said.\n\nBasic services like water, for example, are badly in need of  repair. Most of the pipes under the city's streets were put there  before Elvis Presley recorded his first album. Since then, years  of deferred maintenance have left behind a vast, leaky  network-roughly 20 percent of the 225 million gallons of  water flowing into the city from three huge reservoirs never  makes it to a water customer.\n\nTo help pay for a 10-year, $3 billion plan of capital improvements,  the city has had to pass along big increases in water rates that  some residents couldn't afford. This week, the city water  department sent shut-off notices to 25,000 delinquent customers,  giving them 10 days to pay overdue bills or lose water service.\n\nRead More The trickle-down effect of  Baltimore's crumbling infrastructure\n\nAs services deteriorate, business investment becomes more  difficult to attract and the tax burden falls more heavily on  those left behind. Urban policy experts and economists point to a  vicious cycle of decline, where shrinking job opportunities  further widen income disparities and inequality.\n\n\"It is not just low wages themselves that explain why greater  Baltimore has so many low-income residents,\" wrote Brookings  Institution fellow Jennifer Vey in a 2012 study of the city's' economy. \"The region has an economic structure that for years has  been producing too few decent-paying jobs that too few low-income  workers are able to access.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Conservative Commentators Suggest Protests Are Based On A 'Lie'-Here's Why That's Misleading\n\nConservative commentators such as Tucker Carlson and Charlie Kirk are using their platforms to suggest the protests against the killing of George Floyd are a sham because, they say, few black people are murdered at the hands of the police, though their arguments overlook key elements of what most demonstrators are saying.\n\nTucker Carlson, host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" has previously faced criticism for declaring white ... More supremacy \"a hoax.\"\n\n\"Is our nation being ripped apart by a total and complete lie, a provable lie?\" Tucker Carlson asked his audience on his show-which last month topped Sean Hannity's show for the highest-rated on television- after reciting facts on police killings from the Washington Post database that showed ten instances where an unarmed African American was killed by police last year.\n\n\"People say, 'Police are killing unarmed black men at record rates!'-this is a lie,\" Charlie Kirk said, also referencing the Washington Post database , in a selfie video tearing into the protests posted on his Instagram account that as of Thursday had more than 1.4 million views.\n\nKirk and Carlson also both reference a Wall Street Journa l opinion piece entitled \"The Myth of Systemic Police Racism\" published on Tuesday by Heather Mac Donald, a conservative commentator and author, who makes a similar argument: \"However sickening the video of Floyd's arrest, it isn't representative of the 375 million annual contacts that police officers have with civilians,\" Mac Donald writes.\n\nYet, while the data is right, the majority of protesters are railing against the fact that black people are disproportionately shot and killed by police, which is supported by the Post 's database.\n\nAs Philip Bump of the Post points out, according to the same statistic category, twice as many unarmed white people (20) were shot and killed by police as black people (10) last year, but whites make up almost five times as much of the population (blacks were also much more likely to be arrested than whites in every year since 2012, for which data are available ).\n\nMany prominent black rights organizations, such as Black Lives Matter, have characterized their demands as broader than police shootings: \" . . . when we started Black Lives Matter, it wasn't solely about police brutality and extrajudicial killing,\" Opal Tometi, cofounder of the activist group Black Lives Matter, told the New Yorker in an interview on June 3.\n\nTometi says the movement is \"bigger than that\" and that Floyd's death was a \"spark point\" that encompasses other injustices such as African Americans' housing, education and health care struggles.\n\nIn the same monologue, Carlson also accused the media of perpetuating a \"lie\" to drum up racial hatred as a \"path to power, even if it destroys the country.\"\n\nIn an widely read opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times , former NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar writes that racism is like dust in the air and that the protests, to him, are in response to African Americans feeling like they've been \"living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer.\"\n\nTucker Carlson: Is America being torn apart by a total, complete - but provable - lie?

      "text": "This Time Was Supposed To Be Different\n\nBy Douglas Haynes\n\nBy Douglas Haynes ,\n\nContributor.\n\nBlack Lives Matter sign at Brooklyn protest march.\n\nThis time was supposed to be different. At least that was the sentiment on the streets and in board rooms across America this summer. The recorded killing of George Floyd in police custody on May 24 ignited vast multi-racial protests against police brutality, from the West coast to the East coast and around the world. The scale and demand for confronting systemic racism appeared to have created a tipping point for change in the United States.\n\nAt the time, the evidence seemed overwhelming. The Black Lives Matter movement went mainstream. Fortune 500 companies embraced it, and publicly pledged to do better. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell apologized for ignoring the voices of Black players who called for greater attention to social justice. This is a far cry from league owners who denied Colin Kaepernick the opportunity to play for taking a knee during the national anthem in silent protest against racial injustice in 2016. Rather than fearing backlash, now many leagues and companies-including NASCAR-proudly promote social justice messages on team jerseys and at venues. Universities and colleges-the public conscience of civil society-moved beyond statements in support of diversity. Many acknowledge systemic anti-Black racism and vowed to create anti-racist cultures.\n\nA call for change does not necessarily translate into lasting change. This is a lesson that Black Americans understand. The killing of unarmed Black men and women in police custody or by vigilantes is not new. This lesson made the sentiment \"This time is different\" ring somewhat hollow. However well-intended the public pledges and on-line petitions, they highlight the differential labor in confronting anti-Black bias, prejudice and bigotry in our society. If past reckonings on racism are any indication of the future, today's protesters and allies may experience compassion fatigue either with the pace of change or with coming to terms with the contours of racial injustice. Black people must not permit the real exhaustion of seeking justice to stop them from fighting for their humanity. Their very lives are on the line.\n\nIn truth, the sentiment ,\"This time is different\" receded into the background just as it was momentarily in the foreground of public consciousness as the list of names of Black people killed or shot by the police or murdered by armed civilians grew. Among some of these included Ahmaud Arbery (Brunswick, GA., February 23), Breonna Taylor (Louisville, KY., March 13), Daniel Prude (Rochester, NY., March 30), George Floyd (Minneapolis, MN., May 25), Tony McDade (Tallahassee, FL., May 27), Rayshard Brooks (Atlanta, GA, June 12), Elijah McClain (Aurora, CO., August 24) and Jacob Black (Kenosha, WI., August 24). One is too many. The uneven nature of accountability for these and other killings or shootings captures a central contradiction of the United States: Black Americans are free, but their freedom remains contingent and conditional.\n\nGeorge Floyd's death provided a snapshot into the Black experience for a national and global audience. It did not change it. His death and those before and after were public executions. The effect of each produces more inter-generational trauma for Black families and communities while deepening the culpability for crimes against humanity. To be sure, the recording of the last 8 minutes and 46 seconds of George Floyd's life provoked many people to see and believe anti-Blackness-many for the first time. Others committed themselves to learn about and take responsibility for confronting anti-Black racism in its many manifestations.\n\nYet, these responses pose another question? Why is it necessary for Black bodies to be brutalized or lives to be snuffed out before we care as a society?  Why George Floyd in 2020 and not Sandra Bland in 2015, or Tamir Rice in 2014 or Trayvon Martin in 2012 or Emmitt Till in 1955? What does it take to see the humanity in Black people?\n\nNow is the time to build a society where having to say that \"This time is different\" won't be necessary."

      "text": "\"When Silence Is Betrayal\" - What Must Be Said About The Killing Of George Floyd\n\nBy Seth Cohen\n\nBy Seth Cohen , Former Staff. Chief Impact Officer, Forbes\n\nBy Seth Cohen ,\n\nFormer Staff.\n\nIn the spring of 1967, exactly one year before the date of his assassination, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his first major speech on the Vietnam War. The civil rights leader, in speaking out about the conflict in southeast Asia, shared a succinct belief:\n\n\"A time comes when silence is betrayal.\"\n\nMuch like those spring and summer months of 1967 were a tumultuous time in American history, we once again are a nation that is burning with anger. This time, however, it is not about a war in a faraway land; it is about a war that continues to be waged on unarmed black men in America. And as Minneapolis burns in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by the knee of a police offer, now is the time to ask:\n\nHow can any leader - how can any person - remain silent?\n\nAn individual wearing a hat that reads 'Make Racism Wrong Again' poses for a photograph.\n\nThe statistics speak for themselves. In the past year, 1,014 people have been shot and killed by police, and black Americans are targets at a disproportionate rate compared to other racial groups. And in a vast majority of the cases, police aren't charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nBut more than the statistics, it's also the names that we remember: Rodney King in Los Angeles, Trayvon Martin in Florida, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Philando Castile in his car with his girlfriend and her child, and Eric Garner in New York City. And now a this spring are three more names that were added to the heartbreaking list: Ahmaud Arbery on a jog in Georgia, Breonna Taylor in her home in Louisville...\n\nand George Floyd on a street in Minneapolis.\n\nAs outrage grows at the killing of Floyd, riots have consumed the streets of Minneapolis. Additionally, violent protests are spilling over in places such as Los Angeles, a city that recalls its own 1992 riots in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating. Yet amidst the immediate anger, it is hard to look at the past week (or month, year, decade...) without a sense of vertigo and a bit of foreboding about where we stand on the matter of racial justice in America. After decades of growing inequality and conflict, the coronavirus pandemic is laying bare issues of health inequality as well. Even philanthropy, which has long strived to address racial injustice, is plagued by its own racial biases .\n\nAs the pandemic has us sheltering in place at the same time our economy has us sinking in unemployment, it also feels to many that our progress towards a more just society is being challenged, and not advanced. And most worrisome, too many people are increasingly afraid - of others, of authorities, and of the future. In other words, the arc of history that for so long has bent towards justice feels like it might be bending in other directions.\n\nWith all this in mind, to many leaders it can appear that there is a darkening of the sun of optimism that we so desperately want to shine on our country. Even I, ever the optimist, can see these clouds, and they keep prodding me with an overwhelming realization...\n\nIn times of pessimism and deep social strife, they have no choice - leaders cannot remain silent.\n\nIt isn't a lack of empathy that keeps some leaders silent - many leaders know they must say something, yet are frozen about what exactly to say. In his book How to Be an Antiracist , author Ibram X. Kendi lays out a helpful roadmap. The author, who describes racism as \"a marriage of racist policies and racist ideas that produces and normalizes racial inequities,\" explains that to be antiracist requires intention and action, a recognition of what is wrong and undertaking to do what is right.\n\n\"The opposite of racist isn't 'not racist.' It is 'anti-racist.'\" Kendi writes. \"What's the difference? One endorses either the idea of a racial hierarchy as a racist, or racial equality as an anti-racist. One either believes problems are rooted in groups of people, as a racist, or locates the roots of problems in power and policies, as an anti-racist. One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an anti-racist. There is no in-between safe space of 'not racist.'\"\n\nIt is in a moment like now when leaders, no matter their race, do not have the privilege to hide in the 'in-between space' Kendi describes. Now is the time for leaders to take actionable steps to be allies and advocates for those who are victims of racial inequalities. To give money, to give power, and to give voice to those who need it. To console, and not to condemn, those who are expressing their anger at a society that continues to perpetuate injustice.\n\nThis is the calling for leaders right now, and what they are being called upon to say.\n\nYet even with leaders speaking out, finding pathways through our shaken and shifting world won't be easy. Over the past several decades we have tilted way more towards discussions of economic value as opposed to ethical and moral values. We have consumed ourselves with the exhilaration of social media as opposed to the demands of social movements. And we have turned away from the spiritual to the secular, letting the shortcomings (and even perversion) of religious institutions distance us from the essence of faith that can help sustain us in moments like the one we are in now.\n\nIn 1967, in a similar spirit, Dr. King encouraged a nation to find its voice:\n\n\"Some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak. We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak.\"\n\nNow, in the wake of another senseless killing that sparks another moment of deep national reflection, Dr. King's voice should echo in our ears...we have no choice, we must speak.\n\nIt is the very least we owe George Floyd."

      "text": "2020 Has Been Difficult For The Black Community. Discrimination At Work Only Adds Insult To Injury\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nFrustrated despondent african american office worker getting fired from job concept, white boss ... More dismissing depressed sad terminated black employee holding notice, unfair racial discrimination at work\n\nThe start of 2020 has been an especially trying time for many black professionals. Already, we've heard talk of COVID-19 disproportionately affecting the black community and, simultaneously, companies discussing the need to improve diversity and inclusion in the workforce.\n\nAlthough the two seem unrelated, they are very much connected. Factors such as the global pandemic and its devastating impact on blacks, the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, and ongoing experiences with discrimination and antiblack racism in the workforce can contribute to racial battle fatigue (RBF), which has detrimental mental health implications for members of the black community.\n\nCoined by critical race theorist, William Smith in 2008, RBF describes the experiences and reactions of black males when faced with racism at predominantly white institutions. Sociologists and social psychologists quickly realized that these experiences and stress responses were not exclusive to only black male students and the term has since been used to speak to the experiences and responses of all people of color in America who are exposed to racism.\n\nDepression is prevalent in the black community and one in four blacks will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their life. Exposure to racism and discrimination only exacerbates these issues. Studies suggest that there is a link between chronic exposure to racism and racial battle fatigue. RBF symptoms include anger, increased anxiety, depression, exhaustion, frustration, insomnia, and various physical health issues such as high blood pressure, ulcers and heart problems. Fear of future experiences with racism, racial bias, and race-based violence has also been linked to increased anxiety and depression among blacks.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has proven to be a significant source of stress and anxiety for the black community. According to the CDC , blacks make up 27% of the almost two million confirmed cases in the United States, compared to 52% of whites, and almost 60% of deaths in counties with high black populations. This data is especially startling considering that blacks make up less than 14% of the country's population.\n\nAlthough many are concerned about soaring unemployment-and rightfully so, members of the black community who have been fortunate enough to hold on to their jobs still face other unique covid-19 related stress. Being a member of a racial group that is ravaged by a global pandemic is cause for significant stress and anxiety in and of itself. Factors such as working in fields that are considered essential and having greater exposure to the virus, lack of access to quality medical care, and experiences with bias in healthcare only stoke the flames of pandemic-related anxiety.\n\nData released by Rubix Life Sciences , a biotech firm, suggests that blacks with covid-19 symptoms were less likely to be tested than whites. Knowing that one's race can act as a predicating factor in the quality of medical treatment they receive, or if they receive medical treatment at all, can be a painfully daunting and depressing reality.\n\nRecent news of the murder of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd only adds insult to injury for many black Americans during an already traumatic time. Authorities say that Arbery was chased and fatally shot three times on February 23 while jogging in Georgia by the white father and son duo, Gregory and Travis McMichaels. Although details related to the incident are still being released, the police report states that the McMichaels pursued Arbery because he resembled someone who was associated with a string of recent robberies in their neighborhood.\n\nThe McMichaels were arrested and charged with felony murder and aggravated assault almost three months later on May 7. The fatal shooting is being investigated as a federal hate crime. Similarly, on March 13 Breonna Taylor , a 26-year-old EMT, was fatally shot more than eight times while sleeping, when three police officers entered her apartment in Kentucky with a warrant for a narcotics investigation, in which she had no involvement . No drugs were found at her apartment and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMost recently George Floyd died on May 26 after police handcuffed him and held him down by wedging a knee into his neck. The incident was caught on tape and viewers can hear Floyd repeatedly saying, \"I can't breathe.\" The officer didn't relent, even after apprehending Floyd. Floyd died only a few hours later.\n\nArbery, Taylor and Floyd are just three examples of the thousands of unarmed black Americans who have been killed over the past six years. A recent study pulling data on police killings from 2013 to 2018 found that approximately one in 1,000 black males will be killed in their lifetime compared to 39 out of 100,000 white males. In 2019, 24% of the 1,099 people who were killed by police were black. Like Arbery, we have also seen similar incidents of civilians fatally shooting unarmed black men like in the case of Trayvon Martin .\n\nThankfully, social media has shined a much-needed light on racial violence, but here are still mental health implications associated with this exposure to \" black trauma porn \"- of unarmed black people recorded for mass consumption. It's one thing to hear countless stories about people who look like yourself being shot and killed, but it can severely damage the psyche to see those images on repeat.\n\nMany black workers enter their place of employment carrying an overwhelming weight associated with being exposed to anti-black racism and discrimination. Carrying this stress can be heavy. Experiencing discrimination at work can make that weight unbearable. In 2019, Glassdoor surveyed 5,241 working adults in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and France.\n\nAlmost half of the surveyed American workers (42%) said they have experienced racism directly or indirectly while at work, which is 12% higher than the overall average. More than half (55%) said their company should do more to increase diversity. More specifically, blacks reported a 60% higher rate of discrimination compared to whites. Also alarming, black workers account for 26% of all EEOC filed claims despite only making up 13 % of the U.S. workforce.\n\nA lack of diversity in the workforce plays a significant role in discrimination. This is especially true in corporate professions where only 10% of corporate C-suite positions are made up of men of color and only 4% women of color. Meanwhile, white men and women make up 68% and 18% of those positions.\n\nThere is still much work that needs to be done to improve racial diversity and inclusion in the workforce. Not only in terms of hiring and promoting diverse employees, but also providing training that examines how discrimination and racism can present themselves both within and outside of the office. Overt acts of racism in the workplace are still very much alive and well in the US. A black married couple, for instance, sued the Michigan Department of Corrections in 2019 after enduring years of antiblack racism.\n\nMore subtle forms of discrimination such as microaggressions and implicit bias can be equally detrimental. Racism and discrimination are not always black and white. We all have implicit biases and acting on one's implicit bias is not necessarily an implication that the person is racist. Well-meaning people can direct microaggressions toward blacks unknowingly and with the best intention. The key is to be aware and honest about what is shaping their actions, and address and correct biases as they present themselves.\n\nAlthough businesses and organizations should work tirelessly to ensure that they hire diverse staff and invest in creating inclusive environments for all of their employees, it's important for members of the black community and all people of color to also identify ways to cope with RBF. Coping methods include participating in social-justice-oriented activities, getting adequate sleep, engaging in spiritual practices, exercising, and seeking counseling services.\n\nIn the black community, seeing a therapist is generally viewed as taboo. This apprehension is detrimental and it's critical that members of the black community release themselves from that stigma and seek help when needed. Racism is very real and can result in traumatic mental, emotional, and physical health challenges. Seeking help is not indicative of weakness, but rather courage, strength, and advocacy for one's self."

      "text": "What Derek Chauvin's Trial Can Mean For Blacks And Law Enforcement\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MAY 30: A protester holds a sign with a photo of former Minneapolis police ... More officer Derek Chauvin during demonstrations following the death of George Floyd on May 30, 2020 in Los Angeles, California. Chauvin was taken into custody for Floyd's death. Chauvin has been accused of kneeling on Floyd's neck as he pleaded with him about not being able to breathe. Floyd was pronounced dead a short while later. Chauvin and 3 other officers, who were involved in the arrest, were fired from the police department after a video of the arrest was circulated.  (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nOn Monday morning, opening statements were made in the Derek Chauvin trial over the highly controversial killing of George Floyd last summer. The prosecution encouraged jurors to \" trust their eyes ,\" and the defense argued that the case was far more complex than the viral video of George Floyd's death that sparked widespread outrage and global protests throughout June and July. But many civil rights leaders, lawmakers, social justice activists, and members of the Black community argue that the Derek Chauvin trial offers more than an opportunity for justice to be made in the horrific death of Floyd. The trial could also mark the beginning of a reckoning and atonement for the countless unarmed Black men and women killed or otherwise assaulted by law enforcement.\n\nOn May 25, police were called to a convenience store after store clerks accused George Floyd of attempting to pay for cigarettes with what they believed to be a counterfeit $20 bill. What transpired less than one hour later almost mirrored a horror film, but unfortunately is a bitter risk and reality for many Black Americans. After successfully restraining Floyd, former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, was seen in a chilling video knelling on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds. Chauvin was later fired, arrested, and charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nDuring testimony that followed Monday morning's opening statements, the first witness brought to the stand was a 911 dispatcher who said she called a police sergeant when she saw officers restraining Floyd on video footage from a camera across the street. The day ended with a chilling testimony from Donald Williams, a former wrestler trained in mixed martial arts. During his testimony, Williams shared with the jury that he \"heard George on the ground pretty much pleading for his life\" and that Williams repeatedly yelled for Chauvin to relieve pressure on Floyd's neck.\n\nWilliams's described the move that Chauvin used on Floyd as a \"blood choke\" - a comment that caught Chauvin's direct eye contact after Williams shared with the jury that the move is dangerous and can cause death by suffocation. Williams then described watching as blood dripped from Floyd's nose and his eyes began to roll in the back of his head. \"He barely could move while he was trying to get air,\" Williams shared. \"I watched him slowly fade away, like a fish in a bag.\" Williams went onto recall the role that, Tou Thao , played in the deadly encounter.  Thao is one of the four former Minneapolis police who were at the gruesome scene with Chauvin. As bystanders pleaded for Chauvin to release Floyd, Williams said that Thao ordered them to stand back and said, \"this is what drugs do to you.\" He went onto say that Thao \"controlled the people - he controlled me. He was the guy that let it go on while it went on.\"\n\nAs thousands watched the heart-wrenching and grueling first two days of the trial, the White House confirmed that President Biden would also be closely following the court proceedings and supported a police accountability bill named after George Floyd, which is currently working its way through Congress. While some are hopeful for the new bill, others are much less optimistic. Despite the use of police bodycams and dashboard cams, a new report by researchers at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania found that in the last five years, there has been no decrease in the racial disparity in fatal police shooting victims. In fact, a recent study released that the number of police shootings seems to be increasing. In the first two months of 2021, 132 people have been shot by police, 16 of whom were Black. These numbers are alarming, considering that Blacks only make up 14% of the U.S. population. Last year, there were 1,004 fatal police shootings. In 2019, there were 999 fatal police shootings, and according to Statista, the rate of deadly shootings was significantly higher among Blacks. To that end, another group of researchers found that Black men are more likely to be fatally shot by police and face about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police throughout their lifetime. Comparatively, the average lifetime probability of being killed by a member of law enforcement is about 1 in 2,000 for men and around 1 in 33,000 for women.\n\nThe study conducted by Yale and the University of Pennsylvania also measured the impact of fatal police shootings on people of color in terms of years of life lost - a method used to measure premature deaths that weigh deaths at a younger age on a heavier scale. The study revealed that an average of 31,960 years of life is lost annually in the U.S. due to police shootings. The profound effect of these deaths has been classified as a public health emergency by researchers and extends beyond the victims and their families and contributes to various issues such as PTSD and other mental health challenges. Studies show that the Black population self report worse mental health symptoms where there are police killings. A 2018 study from the University of Pennsylvania found that police killings could contribute to almost two additional poor mental health days per Black person every year and totals 55 million more poor mental health days for Black Americans annually.\n\nNot only has there been an increase in the number of Black Americans who have been fatally shot or killed by police, but many are also outraged over what they feel is a lack of justice and accountability of police. According to NPR , since 2015, police officers have fatally shot at least 135 unarmed Black men and women nationwide - with at least 75% of the officers being white. Of the officers involved in the deadly shootings of unarmed Blacks over the last five years, 13 were charged with murder, three were acquitted, one was found not guilty of murder but guilty of aggravated assault, seven cases are currently pending, and only two were found guilty. Of the seven officers charged with manslaughter, only two were found guilty,  and in the 33 shootings of Blacks, officers were either only fired or resigned - three of whom were given their positions back.\n\nHowever, we do not have to rely on chilling statistics to understand the magnitude of this issue. George Floyd's death shared eerie similarities to Eric Garner's killing , who died after former NYPD, Daniel Pantaleo, restrained Garner in a choke hold which subsequently led to his death in 2014. It was later revealed that Pantaleo had been investigated for misconduct seven times in the five years leading up to Garner's death. That said, the painful, senseless, and high-profile deaths of Blacks such as George Floyd, Eric Garner, and Breonna Taylor are among many others that have fallen under the radar and have been forgotten about. Although researchers who study deadly force report that it's unusual for police officers to be involved in shootings, at least 15 of the officers involved in a shooting in the last two years had a prior history of shooting at civilians. And some have even been involved in three or more shootings without consequence.\n\n\"Many officers will go their entire career without shooting - sometimes without pulling their gun out at all,\" said Peter Scharf, a criminologist and professor in the School of Public Health at Louisiana State University and co-author of The Badge and the Bullet: Police Use of Deadly Force. \"It's rare.\"\n\nNPR recently reviewed thousands of pages of job applications, personnel records, use-of-force reports, citizen complaints, court records, lawsuits, news releases, witness statements, and local and state police investigative reports to examine various officers' backgrounds who were recently involved in police shootings. They found that at least six officers had troubled pasts before being hired as police, including drug use and domestic violence incidents. Several officers were convicted of various crimes while on the force, including resisting arrest, battery, and obstructing - while keeping their jobs. Other officers were fired for various violent abuses of power and then rehired, and more than one dozen had citizen complaints or use-of-force incidents filed against them. These shocking findings help to provide a more detailed explanation for disparities that exist in policing. In response, some agencies have invested heavily in racial bias trainings, which is a great first step. However, until policing as a system is no longer rooted in white supremacy and police are held accountable, sadly, racial disparities will persist and the number of Blacks who are shot or killed by police will continue to rise."

      "text": "Unconscious Racial Bias: From Ferguson To The NBA To You\n\nBy Todd Essig\n\nBy Todd Essig , Former Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. My beat is mental health, mental wealth and making the most of living\n\nBy Todd Essig ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nRace has been in the news recently, as it should be more than it is . First the tragedy in Ferguson, Missouri captured everyone's attention, and is still making news. Then a starkly racist email sent by Atlanta Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson brought back the topic of race relations in the NBA where the owners are mostly white and the players black. And then this week psychologist Jennifer L. Eberhardt won a MacArthur \"genius\" award for her groundbreaking work on the powerful influence out-of-awareness racial attitudes have in the criminal justice system. Because her research can help us understand troubling news about race-as well as many other things I might add-now seems a good time to talk specifically about race and unconscious mental processes.\n\nLots of research documents that understanding race includes understanding how race operates in our minds out of awareness. Some call this racism without racists. Widely reported examples include significant racial bias when otherwise well-intentioned people evaluate job applications. White applicants are selected significantly more frequently than black applicants when the applications are otherwise identical. Or consider how a white person in a crowd will summon help in an emergency, such as someone fainting, 75% of the time when the victim is white but less than 40% when the victim is black. Unconscious racial bias will even lead otherwise progressive, inclusive physicians to more frequently recommend life-saving blood-clot dissolving therapies for white cardiac patients than black cardiac patients.\n\nEberhardt's work contributes to this body of research by drilling down into associations between race and crime. She's documented that defendants convicted of murdering a white person who are judged more stereotypically black were twice as likely to receive the death penalty than a prison term. Also, like shown in the video below, subliminal exposure to pictures of black faces primes people to identify objects from crime scenes, like guns and knifes, based on less information than when exposed to white faces. Of course, less information means less accuracy, suggesting one of the mechanisms contributing to the killing of so many innocent, unarmed black men. As she says, \"blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects.\"\n\nAnother association contributing to racial disparities she documents is a dehumanizing association between African Americans and apes. That's right, that bigoted image still has power. As stated in an abstract of a 2008 article by Goff, Eberhardt, Williams and Jackson, \"(h)istorical representations explicitly depicting Blacks as apelike have largely disappeared in the United States, yet a mental association between Blacks and apes remains. Here, the authors demonstrate that U.S. citizens implicitly associate Blacks and apes.\" In a subsequent 2010 paper (more on that study in a moment) Rattan and Eberhardt write \"(t)his association is dehumanizing, leads people to condone violence against African Americans, and is related to a higher likelihood of death sentences for African American than European American defendants in capital cases.\"\n\nI must admit that made me uncomfortable when I first read it. I was aware of initially wanting to dismiss it as an impossibility: \"Not me!\" I thought. It is not easy to realize that I am exactly the people being discussed. But I am, and so too are you. There are several online demos of various studies (although not from Eberhardt) that can give you a first hand experience with your own unconscious racial attitudes. Here's a link to an Implicit Association Test and one to a revealing shooter task .\n\nBut back to that 2010 paper. It used the now famous study of \"inattentional blindness\" where subjects are instructed to watch one of two teams pass a basketball back-and-forth while counting the number of passes. While the teams are running around passing the ball a person in a gorilla suit walks right through the center of the action. The still remarkable finding is people do not notice the \"gorilla.\" Their attention is elsewhere. They are exhibiting \"inattentional blindness.\" What Rattan and Eberhardt did was introduce race. Before subjects watched the passing-ball video with a \"gorilla\" in the midst, they were \"primed\" by sorting a list of either typically black names or white names. Yup, you guessed it (maybe). Those who were primed with the black names were far more likely to notice the \"gorilla.\" The dehumanizing association of Blacks and apes operates unconsciously, directing attention in biased, discriminatory ways.\n\nThis is tough stuff to take. No decent person believes darker skin makes someone less human. But the conscious mind pulls one way while the unconscious tugs in the other direction. We are indeed often strangers in our minds caught in the eerie depths whose power gets magnified by forgetting it's there. Remember Keyser Soze's warning about evil from The Usual Suspects : \"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\" So too with the unconscious. And the only way not to drown in a riptide of awareness/unawareness is to be both mindful and humble about what mindfulness can achieve.\n\nHistory writes hate on the unconscious. Our job, however difficult or uncomfortable, is trying to read what's there.\n\nFor updates on \" Managing Mental Wealth\" and related news and links follow me on Twitter .

      "text": "Interview With Brittany Packnett Cunningham: On Building Teams, Not Saviors And What It Will Take To Achieve Racial Justice\n\nBy Marianne Schnall\n\nBy Marianne Schnall ,\n\nContributor.\n\nBrittany Packnett Cunningham\n\nFor more than 100 consecutive days, protesters across the nation have been demanding justice for the violence and murders by police of unarmed Black men and women-George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, the recent shooting of Jacob Blake, and many others in a list that, sadly, keeps growing. Alongside this outrage, we've also recently lost great icons in the Black community-John Lewis, C.T. Vivian and Chadwick Boseman-and many of us find ourselves looking for leaders who can help us chart our path forward. Activist Brittany Packnett Cunningham is among those voices many of us have been turning to for guidance, perspective and solutions as our nation grapples with how to heal the wounds of racial injustice, dismantle systemic racism and take action to create lasting change and true equality.\n\nAn award-winning educator, organizer, writer and leader, Packnett Cunningham's deep work around social change and racial justice spans many years and platforms. She held top roles at Teach For America , served as a Congressional policy advisor and co-founded Campaign Zero , a police reform campaign.\n\nPacknett Cunningham became involved in organizing protests against police brutality in 2014, following the shooting of Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. As a result, she was appointed to the Ferguson Commission to conduct a thorough study of the region's social and economic conditions. Cited by President Barack Obama as a leader whose \"voice is going to be making a difference for years to come,\" she was appointed to President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, working to offer recommendations on police reform. She is also the Founder and Principal of Love & Power Works, a full-service social impact firm focused on creating justice and equity in every sector.\n\nThis year, as we've witnessed blatant and brutal police violence toward the Black community, Packnett Cunningham has become a sought-after voice and expert on these issues, appearing as an NBC News and MSNBC Contributor.\n\nI had the opportunity to talk to Packnett Cunningham and get her powerful insights about this pivotal moment, how we can support Black women's leadership, the importance of encouraging confidence and ambition in women, how to make sure we turn out the vote this November, what self-care means to her and what we can all do to advance racial justice to create, as she put it, \"equitable, free, liberated societies where not only can people live and survive but all people can thrive.\"\n\nMarianne Schnall: Between the global pandemic, the groundswell of support for the #BlackLivesMatter movement and the recent loss of civil rights giants, it seems like the world is finally beginning to acknowledge that there is serious collective work to be done if we hope to see social change in our lifetime. I've heard a few people say this time feels different. Do you think real change is ahead? What's your hope for how we emerge from this moment?\n\nBrittany Packnett Cunningham: I think real change is ahead because whenever people of good courage and a radical imagination get together, change is always promised. And I think that the dual pandemics of systemic racism and coronavirus are pushing people to realize that just because this is the way things are, does not mean this is the way things need to be. People are taking power in their own hands to create the world they want.\n\nSchnall: We're seeing so many concerning ways that the pandemic is disproportionately impacting communities of color, who are becoming sick and dying in greater numbers and also soft suffering from the growing economic fallout. Many people are starting to recognize that this shines a light on deeper structural issues in this country. With this in mind, what can we do to make sure that these disparities and the systems that uphold them are addressed on both the societal and policy level?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: I think it really comes down to accountability. It comes down to all of us recognizing that we have influence over the systems that govern us and the things that we consume. That we can stop buying things and start buying things; that we can start voting for folks and vote people out; that we can show up in all of the small and unsexy ways that are required of us as citizens-the city council meetings, the police and fire meetings, the school board meetings and the PTA meetings. And joining up with our local racial justice organizations and truly investing in them-that's going to make a real difference.\n\nBecause ultimately, I think as individuals, we far too often leave change up to other people and we expect people to do things that they have not shown they have a propensity to do. We expect people to care in ways that they haven't shown a pattern of caring. We expect people to keep us in mind when they haven't shown a pattern of doing that. And I am by no means letting those in power off the hook, but it is our job to hold them accountable to that and to be consistently reminding them of the fact that they derive their power-whether it is consumer power and business power or government and legislative power-from we, the people, and we have an absolute say over what does and doesn't happen in our name.\n\nSchnall: You were one of the leading activists who brought attention to police brutality in St. Louis, you served on president Barack Obama's 21st century policing force, you cofounded Campaign Zero - you've spent almost a decade working to address police brutality and the systems that enable it. What should we be doing to join you and the many others working alongside you? What organizations, initiatives, legislation should we be supporting?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: The truth of the matter is, there are lots of ways in which people need to educate themselves first so that they can be having influential conversations with the people in their lives. So conversations about defunding the police should not be had in ways that scare people; they should be had in ways that are honest to the fact that what we are talking about is re-imagining public safety, not creating Gotham without Batman. So there are ways to educate yourself on police divestment and community reinvestment on the New Jim Crow as Michelle Alexander calls it, and the system of mass incarceration, not just in America but across the globe. There are issues happening nationally, globally and in your own community that it is so important to critically educate yourself on because often we see people stepping up to help without the proper knowledge and information that they need to do it well. So that is the first step.\n\nThe second step really is to be connected locally. There are organizations in your community that are addressing the very issues that you care most about. It might be voter suppression; it might be racial injustice; it might be gendered violence; it might be LGBTQ issues. Making sure that you are resourcing your local organizations with your time, talent and treasure makes all the difference in the world. Whether it is the place that you are from or the place where you live, you really have to be grounded locally as you look nationally. So I still do a lot of work with the organizations in my hometown of St. Louis and the organizers there. My husband and I are really proud to continue to support an organization called Action St. Louis , for example, and they, along with many others, have led a two-year campaign to close a medium security prison in St. Louis called The Workhouse. And after those two years, they were successful just recently. So we find that it is truly local grassroots work that tackles issues over the long term with consistency and discipline that need our participation and support.\n\nThe last thing is that we have to confront this system that we are a part of that we perpetuate and that we have internalized. You should be looking around at your workplace, whether you run it or not. You should be looking around at your household, your own habits, your own friendships. We should all be looking at the ways in which we are either perpetuating systems of systemic injustice or we are operating as an oppositional force. That is what we mean when we say being actively anti-racist. It is going to require that not only have you turned away from systemic racism, but that you are running hard and fast in the other direction and gathering as many people along with you to create the oppositional force that is needed to reverse the promised direction of our future.\n\nSchnall: When you spoke in the media following the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, I heard you often start by distinguishing between justice and accountability, saying, for example, \"George Floyd should be alive. This is justice. Everything else is accountability. And the family deserves at least that.\" Can you talk a little bit about that? Why is it important for Americans to understand the significance of this distinction?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: It's a significant distinction because if we believe that justice is the police going to jail after they've killed somebody Black, then we will set limits to what freedom looks like. And no marginalized people can afford those limits. Accountability is holding someone to a minimum standard of humanity after they've already done harm, and so often that harm for Black people is lethal and fatal. So we have to make this distinction because words matter, and if we only set the bar at accountability, we'll never actually reach the freedom and justice we deserve.\n\nWe have to see justice fully as equitable, free, liberated societies where not only can people live and survive but all people can thrive. And that requires an understanding that every single system is interconnected, that we were never just talking about policing: we're talking about economics, we're talking about education, we're talking about housing, we're talking about the carceral state, we're talking about healthcare, we're talking about mental health care, we're talking about full employment. All of those things work together to dictate whether somebody can only struggle to survive or whether they can truly thrive. A world where everybody can truly thrive is what is actually a just world.\n\nSchnall: How do we make sure the #BlackLivesMatter movement doesn't become just a moment in time? What do we need to do to sustain the progress we have seen in the past couple months?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: There are many chapters in the global freedom struggle, and this is one of them. In order to sustain momentum, people need to take the momentum seriously in their personal lives. It was Black feminists who taught us that the personal is political. So what people really need to do is think about every choice they make-from how they run their households, to how they run their businesses-and recognize that liberation is not somebody else's job; it's all of our job, especially if you hold positions of power and privilege.\n\nSchnall: This upcoming election is probably one of the most important we've faced in our history with so much at stake. What thoughts do you have on how we can ensure voter turnout? And what do you think are some of our major challenges we'll need to overcome?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: We're going to have to realize that some of the things we should have planned for should have been planned a while ago. We are experiencing right now the reality that, as unemployment support has been dwindled and Congress has let some of that run out, as protection from eviction has been allowed to run out, we are asking people to engage in mail-in voting during a pandemic and a time when they may not have a stable address. We are asking Indigenous people who often do not have their tribal addresses properly recognized to engage in socially distanced voting when mail-in ballots are often not a viable option for them. We are asking low-income people to continuously take days off of work and/or look for additional childcare or elder care during times when there may be longer wait lines because Congress refuses to fully fund the States in the ways that they need to to make this pandemic-era election seamless.\n\nSo there are some things that, frankly, we are late to the game on, and yet people who are not interested in the fullness of democracy have been exploiting this pandemic since the very beginning with great intention and attention to exactly how they could hold people of color, marginalized folks and low-income people back from the ballot box. So we have to get to work not today but yesterday.\n\nWe're also going to have to make sure that we really come together as communities-all of us making sure that somebody is collecting the mail-in ballots, to be able to walk them from your block to the precinct, so nobody has to worry about sending something through the USPS. Because we watched USPS's ability to maintain an election like this and maintain even their normal operations be challenged by this administration. We know that we need to have folks that are giving people rides to the polls. We know that we're going to need folks who will be able to pass out masks and hand sanitizer so that people can engage in their franchise safely. We know that we're going to need grassroots organizations and national organizations to get out the word and information on what are often confusing processes, because there are 50 different sets of rules in 50 different places.\n\nSo there are lots of things we're going to have to confront when it comes to this election. But we have to be fundamentally clear that there are people who are extremely interested in exploiting this pandemic to make sure that marginalized people do not have their voices fully heard at the ballot box. And we have to be the mighty force that stands against that.\n\nSchnall: Over the years, many of us have come to realize the importance of Black female leadership to the advancement of social justice movements. We want to support Black women and follow your leadership. What action or show of support would you say is most critical to realizing representation in leadership across sectors?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: I think what's most important is realizing that representation is only the first step-that unless people experience true equity and inclusion in the workplace and liberation more broadly, then we haven't done all the work. It is not enough simply to bring Black women to the table if they are not leading the table, if we are not being resourced to build our own, and if we are not respected for the leaders that we are, instead of being made to fit into other people's molds.\n\nSchnall: I feel like Black women are often heralded for always being so strong, and of course, unfortunately, spending so much time oriented around fixing problems that you didn't create, which obviously causes a lot of stress. How do you stay energized and take care of yourself and fight for justice while still managing to find joy? I've heard the phrase, \"Black joy is a form of resistance.\" Can you talk about that in terms of your life?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: I think that the main point for me is what Audre Lorde said, that caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is preservation, and that is an act of political warfare. So our thriving stands in the face of a status quo that has tried everything to subjugate marginalized people. And not only are we still here, we are also more creative than ever, more innovative than ever, more determined than ever, more vocal than ever, more powerful than ever. And the continuation of that in and of itself is a revolution. That is deeply important to me, and that mindset helps me create alignment in my life. So I am doing the things that I am uniquely positioned to do and supporting others as they do the things they are uniquely positioned to do.\n\nI always say we build teams, not saviors because it requires that we are radically disciplined in moving our ego out of movement work-that there are so many gifts and talents that so many different people bring to this work that should be respected and loved and cared for and supported. And, frankly, I don't have to be the one that says yes to everything, because there are brilliant people who are prepared to say yes to the things that I'm not, who can do it even better than me. So for me, self-care actually looks like being disciplined in the art of community and recognizing that this is work for us to do together, and I'm not here to save anybody, because we collectively save ourselves.\n\nBrittany Packnett Cunningham delivering a TED Talk\n\nSchnall: You gave this very inspiring TED Talk about how confidence is a revolutionary act. And of course for women, and particularly Black women, there's often this double bind-and we've seen this a little bit in some of the coverage of women like Kamala Harris and Stacey Abrams and countless others-where powerful, ambitious, confident women are portrayed in negative ways. How do we push back against that? And what advice do you have for women and girls for practicing and building our confidence when there are so many disempowering hurdles and messages trying to hold us back?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: I think it's important that we reclaim those narratives. The world should be grateful for ambitious women. We have stitched together entire societies, movements, cultures. There is art that you would never have without Indigenous women. There are discoveries that you would never have without ambitious women. America wouldn't have made it to the moon without ambitious Black women. So I am convinced that those who find themselves pushing against ambitious women have some internal work to do because it is evidence of them being threatened by someone else's power and promise.\n\nThe truth is, I think as a society we have to recognize that we actually don't operate in scarcity-we operate for the most part in abundance and there actually is enough for everyone if we leverage things responsibly and allow people to share power instead of allow just a tiny few to actually hoard power. When we share power, no one is threatened by the power that somebody else has-we're actually enriched by it. It is this very basic idea that we are stronger together: our society is at its best when you individually are at your best and you can contribute the powerful ideas, leadership and innovation that you have to offer uniquely.\n\nI said in my TED Talk that I believe the crisis of confidence is that we are missing out on the brilliance of so many people that society is told to be quiet: women, women of color, immigrant women, Muslim women, Jewish women, disabled women and trans women have continuously been told over and over and over again to be quiet and wait our turn. And then our turn never comes. What are we missing as a society by all of the things that are bound up in the minds of the women and nonbinary people that we continuously tell to hold on, that we continuously tell to wait? There are cures for diseases that could be in those minds, but we've discouraged that young woman from STEM; there are new technological innovations that are in someone's mind, but we've made no room for Black trans people in the technology field and big tech; there are creative pieces of art that we all should be benefiting from, but our media companies haven't opened up to the disabled folks and the LGBTQ folks who are so well positioned to tell those stories.\n\nWe're all losing out when we silence voices, when we discourage confidence and when we discourage ambition. And the sooner we can realize that, the sooner we'll all benefit from the ambitious women that society seems so afraid of.\n\nSchnall: We have this amazing opportunity right now-while everything is laid so bare-to rebuild a better world. What is your highest, most aspirational vision of what is possible? What does the world look like if your work is ever done?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: For me it looks like true liberation-that we are not just being innovative about how to get people over the barriers, but that the barriers don't exist. And that all people are able to not just survive but thrive and are able to live in a society that does not kill the genius within them. It is a world where there are no more names of hashtags, where there are no more Michael Browns or Eric Garners or Breonna Taylors; where there are no more Tony McDades or Dominique Fells or Nina Pops-some of the Black trans folks that we've seen taken from us this year. It means a world where young people are able to grow up and live their wildest imagination because they are embraced and nurtured from the very beginning instead of turned away from what's possible. I have an absolute belief that these are the things that can be true and that we can uproot the trees that don't feed us all well and plant in their place trees that bear fruit for all people.\n\nSchnall: We've recently lost true heroes and civil rights giants like John Lewis and C.T. Vivian. What's in your mind and heart as we mark these passings in terms of carrying on their message and legacy?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: I think what we have to keep in mind in carrying on their legacy is the discipline of courage. I think some people who have just awakened to the struggle for justice, in whatever way they've awakened to it, have already become tired in week two or three. And these are people, they and their peers, did this work for 40, 50, 60 years and literally did not stop until the Lord called them home. So there is a lesson in their lives that requires us to mimic this discipline of courage, to practice it every single day, to be more and more brave about exactly how we do it, to push further and further into our responsibilities of justice and not get tired after a day or a week or a month or a year of fighting for things that everyone deserves for a lifetime.\n\nSchnall: What is your call to action? And what Black-led groups would you encourage people to donate to and support?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: I would really encourage people to think locally-do the research that they need to do about the city that they're from and the city that they live in, if those are not the same places, and figure out who is putting real wins on the board for racial justice. So for me, that's organizations like Action St. Louis , organizations like Black Lives Matter DC , where I live right now, and organizations like The King Center in Atlanta, which is a national organization, but it's really focused on building beloved community for all people. It is really about finding the places locally that support your community and that are creating discernible change in your community. And it is about making sure that you are also investing in the local and national organizations that have a vision that aligns with true justice and not just incremental change.\n\nSchnall: Do you feel hopeful in this moment?\n\nPacknett Cunningham: I do feel hopeful in this moment because I look to ancestors who remained hopeful in the face of odds more insurmountable than the ones we face now and challenges more impossible than the ones we have now. I think of Harriet Tubman and Fannie Lou Hamer and Dolores Huerta, who is still going strong, and Margaret Bush Wilson from St. Louis and Julia Davis-so many people who did far more with far less than we have now and not only continued to keep their hands to the plow but actually got things done. When I look at what they accomplished, I believe that we are capable of anything.\n\nFor more on Brittany Packnett Cunningham's work, you can visit her website and follow her on Twitter and Instagram @MsPackyetti.\n\nMarianne Schnall is a widely-published interviewer and journalist and author of What Will It Take to Make a Woman President? , Leading the Way , and Dare to Be You .

      "text": "Exactly How Would You Like Us To Protest?\n\nBy Capital Flows\n\nBy Capital Flows ,\n\nContributor.\n\nI found myself in recent weeks, as I often do, turning on the cable news stations, warming up some leftovers and settling down on the couch. It's has become almost ritualistic, preparing myself mentally for the traumatic events ahead that will be displayed by our news media. At the end of September, I watched the protest for the murder of Keith Lamont Scott by the police brewing in Charlotte, NC right before my eyes.\n\nNow to give some context, I am a black woman, a law student, and my concentration is in social justice. This being said, I immediately became fixated on the events unfolding before me. I felt the anger, frustration, depression and rage of those protestors. I felt it deep in my core as only a black American can, knowing without question or need for discussion the inherent fear and racism felt toward my people by many of the law enforcement charged with our protection and service. I began to think to myself about the previous few weeks and the silent, dignified protest of NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling down during the playing of the national anthem in protest of police killings of black Americans. I began to think about the backlash he experienced, the vitriol on social media from fans, fellow athletes, politicians and pundits.\n\nEli Harold #58, Colin Kaepernick #7, and Eric Reid #35 of the San Francisco 49ers kneel in protest ... [+] during the National Anthem prior to their NFL game against the Arizona Cardinals at Levi's Stadium on October 6, 2016. (Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)\n\n\"Who does he think he is?\" \"He's an attention whore!\" \"That's un-American!\" \"What right does he have? \" and on and on... A black man protesting in silence without so much as disturbing or interrupting the song or game was intolerable to many watching, but tolerance, even in defense of the very actions being protested, are commonplace?\n\nThe First Amendment of the United States of America protects our constitutional right to free speech and assembly. Our nation, the very basis of our republic was founded on the protest of tyranny.\n\nFast forward to 2016. We live in a country divided by political lines, fueled by racial tensions and xenophobia. Seeing unarmed black men being gunned down by police seems so routine in our era of camera phones, that we can scarcely turn on our television or log online without another gruesome execution broadcast for the world to see. So the question came to me, as I remained engrossed in my TV screen... How exactly would they like us to protest?\n\nAlso on Forbes:\n\nIf we go into the streets and riot, burn and loot, we are being destructive to property and perpetuating violent action. We are subsequently labeled \"criminals\" and are treated accordingly by both authorities and media.\n\nIf we march peacefully and obstruct traffic or lay down silent and motionless in the streets, we are labeled a public nuisance and are treated criminally by both authorities and media.\n\nIf we simply, silently bend down and take a knee, or raise our fist during the National Anthem, we are vilified and told we don't love our country. I always get emotional when I hear them say \"you don't love your country!\" I want them to understand I do love my country. I just want my country to love me back.\n\nSo the question remains: Exactly just how would you like us to protest? How would you have us express the fear, rage and anxiety most black people feel watching their people being murdered?\n\nJust how do you want me to express the outrage we feel at the lack of humanity and common decency when we are left to bleed out like a hunted animal? Bleeding out on the hot Oklahoma asphalt, body convulsing from the simultaneous shock of the electric currents from the taser and the penetration of the bullet. Your only crime being big and black and having the audacity of breaking down on the side of a Tulsa highway.\n\nJust how do you want us to protest?! I guess quietly, silently, in our prayers in our church services surrounded by ourselves. Far away from you and your watching eyes or listening ears. But it doesn't look like it's going to end that way this time, nor should it."

      "text": "Shifting Focus From Social Justice To Cartoon Logos, Kyrie Irving And NBA Players Take A Step Back\n\nBy Sean Deveney\n\nBy Sean Deveney ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nKyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets\n\nIt was one year ago that, in the wake of the despicable killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, we began hearing something extraordinary from the realm of pro athletes, especially NBA players and coaches. It was coherent and consistent outrage, expressed, almost universally, with grace and empathy. There were powerful personal anecdotes, there were calls to action, there were messages of sheer pain and anger. When taken together, all of those messages showed that as wealthy and removed from George Floyd as those in the league now might be, they all recognized Floyd as a man and felt the pangs of his death. They had seen enough unarmed Black men killed to declare that they would not accept deaths like his any longer.\n\nRemember the angst of Pacers center Myles Turner , who wrote, \"Why Do They Keep Killing Us Man. . . this was heart breaking to watch, There's a systematic agenda against us and I cannot be convinced otherwise.\"\n\nOr the anger of Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade, who wrote: \"JUSTICE WILL NOT BE SERVED UNTIL THOSE UNAFFECTED ARE AS OUTRAGED AS THOSE WHO ARE!\"\n\nOr the eloquence of Pistons coach Dwane Casey, who recalled attending a recently desegregated school in rural Kentucky in 1965 where he was, \"not wanted nor welcomed.\" The details of his experience were not recorded on a cellphone for posterity, but he remembered clearly the feeling of being a helpless eight-year-old.\n\n\"I felt as if I was neither seen, nor heard, nor understood,\" Casey wrote in a team statement . \"As I have watched the events unfold in the days following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a city where I coached and once called home, I see how many people continue to feel those same feelings - helpless, frustrated, invisible, angry.\"\n\nIt is hard to look back on the gravity of that moment in time because of the foolishness of our present moment. The sincerity and seriousness the NBA showed last May, and for the entire gut-wrenching summer of 2020, has devolved over the past 52 weeks into something much different, so petty as to be unrecognizable.\n\nOn Sunday, an NBA player who purports to be a grown man celebrated a win in a playoff game by running to midcourt to stomp on a cartoon leprechaun, an act that was followed by another grown man, a fan, in the stands chucking a water bottle at the player. Sigh.\n\nThe nonsense grows from there. On Monday, multiple NBA players who are also allegedly grown men followed up by logging onto social media to register their offense at the desecration of the floor cartoon.\n\nThis has been the NBA's top storyline of the past 48 hours. This has been the lead topic for a league in the throes of the opening round of the playoffs. First Kyrie Irving of the Nets made a point to scrape his shoe across the face of Lucky the Leprechaun at the TD Garden in Boston, prompting the water-bottle-toss incident. Then, on Monday, Kevin Garnett and Glen Davis, two members of the 2008 champion Celtics, fired back at Irving. Garnett lamented on Instagram, \"Nobody gonna say anything about Kyrie stomping Lucky?\" and added, \"We just gonna act like we didn't see that? Tf going on ...\"\n\nDavis was tougher on Irving, writing, \"You step on Lucky, you step on everybody that played for that team,\" and suggested that such actions could precede, \"somebody get(ting) hurt in real life.\" Nets star Kevin Durant responded with a series of laughing emojis followed by a profane phrase. Durant does have a point because, in reality, when you step on Lucky, you do not actually step on any past Celtics, you step only on a piece of painted flooring, and for Davis to suggest otherwise is laughable.\n\nStill, it bears repeating that this is what our heroes of the NBA are up to today. A year ago, they were taking to the streets to protest for the dignity of Black lives. Now they're taking to the Internet to protest the dignity of a cartoon, and a moderately creepy, winking cartoon wielding a shillelagh, at that.\n\nThe entire kerfuffle has been placed into the context of poor fan behavior that we've seen across the league in recent days as droves of fans are allowed back into arenas for the first time in 15 months, starting with Wizards star Russell Westbrook being doused with popcorn in Philadelphia and Hawks star Trae Young being spat upon at Madison Square Garden. That is fine. With a fan attempting to run onto the floor in Game 4 of the Sixers-Wizards series on Monday night, it's clear there is an ongoing trend of poor fan behavior happening.\n\nRussell Westbrook #4 of the Washington Wizards\n\nBut doltish fans acting like dolts is not the real story, not a context big enough for what is really going on here in the NBA. Fact is the players, too, are acting like silly children and that is a monumental disappointment in the wake of a year in which the NBA had so admirably taken the lead on pushing for a national emphasis on social justice.\n\nRemember that? Remember those weeks and months in which NBA players spoke out in voices that brought pride to the league? Remember when one player addressed his fellow rank-and-file players by suggesting they not go to play in the NBA restart in Orlando because the focus should remain on social justice: \"Whether we want to admit it or not, we are targeted as Black men every day we wake up.\"\n\nAn NBA player said that. In fact, that player was Kyrie Irving, and even if you disagreed with his outlook, you could not deny that he was speaking with passion and conviction. Now, his conviction is being expressed through a shoe-wipe on a fictious character, which has somehow morphed into an important issue.\n\nA reminder: It's not.\n\nIt's not important at all. A year ago, NBA players, including Irving, were talking about things that really matter like justice and equality and humaneness. Let's not forget that."

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIt's been four years since Michael Brown was killed. The unarmed black teenager was shot by white police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, 2014.\n\nOn that day, Wilson received a report of a theft at a convenience store when he spotted Brown, who matched the suspect's description. There was an altercation between the two, leading to a police chase. Wilson fired his gun 12 times at Brown, hitting him about six times, according to The New York Times . Some witnesses, including Wilson, said Brown charged at him. Other witnesses said he had his hands up in the air when Wilson shot at him, while others said he only raised his hands briefly and put them back down, according to The New York Time s.\n\nSince the 18-year-old's death, thousands more have been the victims of police violence. According to The Washington Post 's Fatal Force database , 559 people have been shot and killed by police in 2018, inluding 12 unarmed black men, according to the database.Here are the 12 unarmed black men who have been shot and killed by police this year:\n\n1. Antwon Rose: The unarmed 17-year-old was shot and killed by police in June in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Rose, a high school student, was shot on June 19, after police responded to reports of a vehicle leaving the scene where a 22-year-old was shot. Police detained the driver when Rose and another person left the car and began running. Officer Michael Rosfeld shot and killed Rose, and was charged with criminal homicide in June, The New York Times reported.\n\n2. Stephon Clark: Clark, 22, was shot and killed in his backyard in March after police officers mistook his cellphone for a weapon. The Sacramento Police Department responded to a 911 call of a man breaking into parked cars in the neighborhood and followed the instructions of the department's helicopter team, which said it saw a suspect pick up a toolbar and break a window of a home before he ran into his own backyard. Video released by the SPD showed the police asking the black father of two to \"show me your hands\" before someone else yelled \"gun\" and began firing.\n\n3. Rashaun Washington: The 36-year-old black man from Vineland, New Jersey, was shot and killed by a Vineland police officer on July 14, KYW-TV reported. The officer, who was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, allegedly shot the unarmed man three times. Some witnesses told the news station that the officers sicced a K-9 dog on Washington who bit him several times, causing him to bleed to death, according to the news station.\n\n\"Please do not push this case to the side, being as though it was an officer, and let it go. We need justification for Rashaun,\" Dawn Fisher, Washington's cousin, told the news station.\n\n4. Anthony Marcell Green: Anthony \"Tony\" Green, 33, was shot and killed by a police officer in Kingsland, Georgia, on June 20. A Kingsland police officer was following a vehicle at the intersection of Lily Street and North East Street in Kingsland when two people fled from the vehicle, WTLV reported . The officer chased after them and when he reached Green, an altercation ensued, which eventually led to the officer firing his gun at Green, killing him, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation .\n\n5. Robert Lawrence White: The 41-year-old man from Silver Spring, Maryland, was shot and killed on June 11 by a Maryland County police officer, WTOP reported . The officer was in the area responding to another 911 call when White allegedly approached him because he seemed suspicious and \"became combative,\" causing an altercation, The Washington Post reported . The unarmed black man was shot and killed. There were no weapons found at the scene. The officer, Anand Badgujar, was cleared of the killing by Maryland prosecutors in June, according to The Washington Post .\n\n6. Marcus-David L. Peters: The unarmed 24-year-old black man was shocked with a stun gun before he was shot on May 14, in Richmond, Virginia, WWBT reported . Peters was having a mental episode when he was shot and killed by Richmond Police officer Michael Nyantakyi, according to the news station.\n\n\"There are protocols, policies and procedures that well-trained departments follow when somebody exhibits signs of what appears to me to be excited delirium,\" said Jonathan Halperin, Peters's family attorney, told the news station.\n\n7. Juan Markee Jones: Jones, 25, was shot and killed in Danville, Virginia, on April 8, by Danville police officers. Authorities said they were responding to a disturbance call when officers approached Jones, whom they suspected of attacking a woman, according to The Seattle Times . Police said Jones ignored their commands, drove to a wooded area and refused to show his hands when he was confronted by officers again. Officers deployed a stun gun at Jones, but it did not work, the publication reported. Jones then became \"threatening\" to the officers, which caused them to fire their guns, according to The Seattle Times .\n\n8. Danny Thomas: The 35-year-old was shot and killed in Greenspoint, Texas, on March 22, by a deputy police officer. Cameron Brewer, a deputy at the Harris County Sheriff's Office in Houston, shot the unarmed black man after he stopped him at an intersection of Greens Road and Imperial Valley Drive in Greenspoint, because he was acting erratically, KHOU11 reported . Brewer, who is also black, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting and then fired, CNN reported .\n\n9. Cameron Hall: Hall, 27, was shot and killed in a house in Casa Grande, Arizona, on March 15. Casa Grande Police told KNXV-TV that police were dispatched to a home in Casa Grande where they were confronted by Hall, who assaulted a police officer. Officers said they tried to use their stun gun on Hall to bring him down, but it did not work, which eventually led to the officers shooting and killing the unarmed black man.\n\n10. Shermichael Ezeff: Ezeff, 31, was shot and killed in an apartment complex in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on March 14, WAFB reported . Ezeff, who experienced a psychotic breakdown two days before he was killed, came into contact with a police deputy from the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Department who was serving court papers at an apartment complex in Baton Rouge, KATC reported. The 31-year-old was covered in blood and had a cut on his arm when an altercation took place and caused the deputy to shoot Ezeff once, KATC reported.\n\n11. Ronell Foster: Foster, 32, was shot and killed on February 13, while he was riding his bike in Vallejo, California, KTVU reported . A Vallejo police department officer stopped Foster while he was riding his bike around 7:40 p.m. after a domestic dispute between him and his girlfriend, according to the news station.

He specializes in stories about the FBI, the Department of Justice and congressional intelligence committees. In cover stories, he has written about the high suicide rate for farmers, sex trafficking to farm worker labor camps, the state of policing in America and an embattled FBI director. Besides Newsweek , he has written for Newsweek Japan , Boston and Smithsonian magazines, Vassar: The Alumnae/i Quarterly and Vice.com.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe number of unarmed black men shot and killed by police in the U.S. last year was less than half the total for 2015, according to one database, suggesting that due to nationwide protests, better training or other factors, what the media has called \"a national crisis\" could be abating.\n\nPolice used fatal force on 16 unarmed black men in 2016, according to a Washington Post database. That is down from the 36 unarmed black men police had killed in 2015 . Police used fatal force on one unarmed black woman in 2016 and two in 2015.\n\nRelated: The New American Cop\n\nMembers of law enforcement and analysts who monitor the field say any unjustified officer-involved killing of a person is tragic, but they argue that the national outrage over the deaths of unarmed black men seems disproportionate to the diminishing number of such incidents. \"Police shootings of unarmed black men is not a national crisis,\" says Heather Mac Donald, the author of The War on Cops and a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. \"We have been having a discussion for the last 20 years of phantom police racism in order to not talk about a far more difficult and uncomfortable reality, and that is the wildly disproportionate levels of black-on-black crime.\"\n\nCiting FBI data, Mac Donald points out that 900 more black men were murdered by offenders of all races in 2015 than in 2014 , and that the overall number of black homicide victims in 2015 was around 7,000-higher than that for other demographics. (The FBI has not yet released the 2016 data.)\n\nAdvocates for police reform say crime in black communities does not excuse police violence. \"No one cares for black communities more than black people themselves,\" Opal Tometi, a cofounder of Black Lives Matter, told Newsweek last year. \"Critics who raise this type of rhetoric aim to derail a desperately needed conversation about violence and abuse perpetrated by police.\"\n\nYet law enforcement officials have also said that use of fatal force on either armed or unarmed individuals is infrequent, despite the media coverage . \"Cell phone videos [have] taken what is still a remarkably rare event, which is the police use of deadly force, and turned it into a nationwide moral crisis,\" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn told Newsweek last July.\n\nSanta Barbara County Undersheriff Bernard Melekian agreed. \"What's gotten lost in the rhetoric is the millions, literally millions, of contacts every day that don't result in any force being used for anything-let alone deadly force,\" he told Newsweek . Many thousands of people die from medical error each year , he added, \"but nobody is suggesting that we put body cameras on doctors.\"\n\nThe 16 unarmed black men killed by police in 2016 accounted for 33 percent of the 48 fatal force incidents involving all unarmed people last year-a disproportionate number, since black men make up only 6 percent of the U.S. population. The total number of unarmed deaths was also less than half the previous year's total, which was 94.\n\n(The Post began tracking fatal force incidents in 2015. Other sources have higher numbers for unarmed deaths. The U.S. Department of Justice announced in October that it will begin collecting more comprehensive data on such incidents.)\n\nPerhaps because there were so many prominent incidents involving unarmed black men in 2014 and 2015, family members of those killed, as well as activists, the media and some lawmakers now seem too eager to claim the deceased was unarmed, even if the evidence suggests otherwise, or there is not enough information available. For example, early evidence suggested that Keith Lamont Scott had a gun when police shot and killed him in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September. But in a video of the confrontation, his wife says, \"He doesn't have a gun.\" That is the version that stuck for many. The New York Times had to issue a correction after initially referring to Scott as \"an unarmed black man.\" Hillary Clinton tweeted , \"Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher. Too many others. This has got to end.\" Around two weeks later, Bernie Sanders tweeted , \"I am tired of seeing unarmed African Americans shot in cold blood.\"\n\nIn October, protests erupted in Los Angeles following the fatal officer-involved shooting of Carnell Snell, a black man. Activists described Snell as unarmed in a tweet published to more than 10,000 followers, and in a widely shared Facebook post, a woman who said she had taught Snell in school wrote , \"Witnesses say that his hands were up when he was shot in the back.\" Days later, the Los Angeles Police Department released a video that appeared to show Snell with a gun moments before police killed him.\n\nLaw enforcement experts also point out that an unarmed person can still pose a threat to police and bystanders. \"You can talk to any officer and he'll say in any confrontation with a violent or resisting suspect, there's a gun involved, and that's the officer's,\" says Mac Donald, of the Manhattan Institute. In her book, she scrutinized the Post 's 2015 data. At least five of the unarmed black men killed that year had reportedly tried to grab an officer's gun or beat an officer with his or her own equipment, she wrote. Two more of the men \"were struck by stray bullets aimed at someone else in justified cop shootings.\" In one case, a bystander was killed by police-not the suspect. \"That older man happened to be black, but his race had nothing to do with his tragic death,\" she wrote.\n\nThose tracking police-community issues say the decrease in fatal force incidents does not mean the national conversation around them is over. \"One year-that does not constitute a trend, necessarily,\" says Ronnie Dunn, an associate professor of urban studies at Cleveland State University, and coauthor of the book, Racial Profiling: Causes and Consequences . \"One [shooting] is too many.\" He adds that just because someone is armed does not mean a shooting is automatically justified: \"The Second Amendment applies to all people in this country.\"\n\nTometi, of Black Lives Matter, says the problem persists and goes beyond the recent data. \"This is not just about the killings. It's about brutality, ticketing for profit, mass incarceration and criminalization,\" she says. \"There are issues that this data does not reflect, and [it] does not capture the crux of the problem.\" On Tuesday, for example, a video surfaced of a police officer slamming a female African American student to the floor at a high school in North Carolina. There was a similar incident in a South Carolina school in 2015.\n\nPolice now caution the public from jumping to conclusions and viewing all use of force incidents as unjustified. \"Certainly we have all seen police-involved shootings that defy justification,\" Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said at a press conference after the Snell shooting in October. But that was not what happened in that case, he added.\n\nSeattle Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole previously told Newsweek that after she joined the department in 2014, she helped implement better crisis intervention and de-escalation training. Now her officers use force, including nonfatal force, in less than 2 percent of interactions with people. \"No police officer wants to take someone's life,\" she said.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRacism is more than a social institution; it manifests in mental health as a pervasive indicator of inequity. And among black Americans, the cost is much higher, a new study says.\n\nBlack Americans' mental health suffers from recurring exposure to police killings of unarmed black men and women, according to a study published Thursday in British journal The Lancet . The findings implicate racism as an agent of health disparities that affect entire communities rather than the direct family members of those killed.\n\nIn a survey of more than 100,000 black Americans, respondents reported more days of poor mental health in the months following police killings, whether exposed through word of mouth, TV, written articles or social media (as was the case in the live-streamed murder of Philando Castile , who was shot by police after they pulled him over for a broken taillight).\n\nThroughout the survey, respondents were exposed to one police killing in their state every three months, about four per year. The most marked effects occurred in the immediate weeks and months following publicized killings.\n\nRespondents reported their behavior in Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System interviews from 2013 to 2015. Poor mental health days were characterized by heightened awareness of institutionalized racism, lower self-worth, fear of victimization and distrust toward law enforcement. Due to the sheer number of police killings, black adults were more likely to expect to die.\n\nIt's a phenomenon called black paranoia, said Jeffrey McCune, associate professor of African and African-American studies at Washington University in St. Louis. Black deaths occur so often that they go untreated by society, so black Americans are constantly waiting for the moment they fall victim to police brutality, death or another injustice, he said.\n\nThough researchers intended to survey respondents who lived in the same states as the killings, black Americans across the country felt the tremors too, and reported similarly poor results.\n\n\"These acts of repeated killings are a collective trauma for black folks, who have long thought of their lives as connected,\" McCune told Newsweek . \"Like individual trauma, collective trauma impacts everything you do in the everyday.\"\n\nHe called the black community's connected mental health \"fragile\" in a white supremacist society.\n\nNearly 50 percent of respondents were exposed to at least one police killing in their state in the three months before the survey was conducted, and each additional death eroded their mental health. Cumulatively, black Americans experienced 55 million more poor mental health days as a result of the exposure.\n\n\"Police killings of this type continue to tell back folks that they can't even run and walk free; they are not protected under the law,\" said McCune.\n\nThe study noted its results identified the systemic racism within law enforcement: While several killings made national news, more police killings likely went unreported and unpublicized, so the study relied on a database that vetted suspected killings against police records and social media.\n\nPolice are more than twice as likely to kill black Americans, according to 2016 data collected by The Guardian . Police killed 6.7 black Americans for every million people, compared to less than 3 white Americans for every million people. More than 60 percent of unarmed people killed by police are minorities.\n\n\"There is strong evidence of systematic targeting of black Americans by police in the identification of criminal suspects, as well as in their prosecution, conviction and sentencing in the criminal justice system,\" the study's authors wrote. \"Racial disparities in law enforcement and legal treatment have a long history in the USA, and state-sanctioned violence in particular has been used to terrorize, dehumanize and subjugate black Americans.\"\n\nThe depth of America's numbness to police violence against black people is profound, according to black scholars who have accused Americans and the media of ignoring black trauma in favor of a president who stays silent when black lives are taken.\n\nStories of unarmed black men and women killed by police are common now: As of Stephon Clark's death in March, police have killed 758 black people since 2015. The protests of their deaths look familiar, too: Coverage of the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown's killing in 2014; and Baltimore, after Freddie Gray died in police custody in 2015 was criticized for perpetuating stereotypes of black Americans as \"thugs\" in its depiction of violence and destruction. Reports that follow up with both cities rarely appear in the news cycle.\n\nThe solution, in a \"sea of anti-blackness,\" lies with police, McCune said: less policing by cops with no vested interest in the advancement of black communities; less reliance on violence; and greater consequences for police officers who abuse their power. A New York Times analysis found that in 15 of the most widely publicized police killings, only one officer was sentenced to prison time.\n\nScottie is a Newsweek science fellow and student at the University of Florida.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTwo Los Angeles police officers who fatally shot an unarmed black man described by his lawyer as mentally challenged will face no criminal charges over the 2014 killing, the district attorney said on Tuesday, calling their actions \"legally justified.\"\n\nThe killing of 25-year-old Ezell Ford was one of many shootings of unarmed black men by U.S. law enforcement that triggered national protests and fueled a renewed civil rights movement known as Black Lives Matter.\n\nIn a redacted report, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said Officers Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas spotted Ford leaving a \"known gang area\" on Aug. 11, 2014, and suspected he was trying to dispose of something illegal.\n\nAs Wampler tried to apprehend Ford, the two men scuffled and ended up on the ground with Ford reaching for the officer's gun, according to the report.\n\nVillegas then shot Ford twice, the report said, while Wampler pulled out a backup weapon, reached around Ford's back, and also shot him.\n\n\"Although the loss of Mr. Ford's life is tragic, we believe the officers' actions were legally justified and the evidence supports our decision,\" Lacey said in a statement.\n\nThe family's attorney, Steve Lerman, said that while Lacey's decision was expected, it was disappointing.\n\n\"It's politics as usual,\" said Lerman, who represented motorist Rodney King, who sued the Los Angeles Police Department after he was beaten by officers in 1991 in an attack that was filmed by a witness and broadcast around the world.\n\n\"It's very discouraging. Unless criminal penalties are imposed on officers who commit homicidal acts, then there is no justice for anybody, whether it's black, white, brown or other,\" the lawyer said in a phone interview.\n\nLerman, who said Ford suffered from schizophrenia and manic depression and had the \"thinking pattern of a child,\" said he had been in settlement negotiations with the city over a $75 million lawsuit filed by Ford's family.\n\nLacey's decision not to file criminal charges came almost 20 months after the Los Angeles Police Commission ruled that Wampler violated several department policies in the killing. Villegas was cleared in the shooting.\n\nBoth officers were taken off street duties. That prompted the pair to sue the city last year, alleging the move was racially motivated. Villegas is Latino and Wampler is white.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nJussie Smollett's conviction last week for inventing a hate crime should have led to some soul-searching among the many who quickly accepted his hoax, not only as true but as evidence of the persistence and pervasiveness of white supremacy in America. It should have-but didn't. In a statement, Dr. Melina Abdullah, director of Black Lives Matter Grassroots and co-founder of BLM Los Angeles, doubled down on the movement's support for Smollett. \"In our commitment to abolition, we can never believe police, especially the Chicago Police Department (CPD) over Jussie Smollett, a Black man who has been courageously present, visible, and vocal in the struggle for Black freedom,\" read a statement from BLM.\n\nSupporting a hate crime hoaxter in the name of racial solidarity is a far cry from the movement's origins in 2014 to shine a light on police brutality, particularly the killing of unarmed Black men. But supporting Smollett, who made a mockery of racism, is not an aberration. Across the board, BLM has abandoned its important goal to protect Black life in order to wage a culture war about race.\n\nThe Smollett statement came after another BLM proclamation urging people not to do their Christmas shopping in white-owned stores. \"When buying items, spend exclusively with Black-owned businesses from Black Friday through New Year,\" BLM said on its website and Instagram . As justification, the group cited a number of shootings at two Walmart locations and instances of shoppers being racially profiled for being Black.\n\nEven if in all instances police officers' actions were criminal, the group found six cases nationally over a six year period, and in none of them was the store at fault. Moreover, four of the victims had not only committed offenses but refused to obey police orders and presented a danger.\n\nAs in the case of Smollett, BLM decided to side with the malefactors instead of with the shoppers-also people of color-they may have been threatening.\n\nThe most critical problem and the real betrayal to Black life is BLM's resolute unwillingness to acknowledge the devastating impact of gun violence on Black communities. Whereas nationally 15 unarmed Black Americans were killed by police in 2020, there were more than 1,000 Black homicides-of which 292 were children. But even for those lucky enough to escape being killed, sociologist Patrick Sharkey has documented the serious psychological problems children experience when they hear guns fired in their neighborhoods.\n\nAnd yet, despite this growing and absolutely devastating problem of gun violence in Black neighborhoods, the only people you ever hear talk about it come from the political Right. On the Left, it is routine to silence such concerns as a dogwhistle for racism Thus, the influential black magazine The Root defended Black activists' refusal to talk about it, arguing that bringing up gun violence \"is the repeated sleight of hand used to distract and drown out the voices of Black Lives Matter... an oft-used 'alt-right' refrain.\"\n\nAnd this criticism is used even when the person bringing up gun violence is Black, like actor and TV host Terry Crews who was viciously attacked after criticizing BLM for ignoring the gun violence. Typical was the response of CNN host Don Lemon: \"But that's not what the Black Lives Matter movement is about, Terry. Black Lives Matter is about police brutality and about criminal justice. It's not about what happens in communities when it comes to crime, Black-on-Black crime.\" If Crews wanted to stem community violence, Lemon concluded, he should not expect BLM to be the venue. \"Form your own movement,\" Lemon advised.\n\nAnd this silence of Black Lives Matter and their media supporters when it comes to Black life being stolen by gun violence has shown no sign of abating, even with homicides reaching levels not seen for more than twenty years.\n\nIt's about time those who truly believe that Black lives matter, who believe in strengthening the Black family, who condemn racial hoaxes and reject demonizing all white people for the racist actions of some to separate themselves from the BLM leadership. The moral force of the anti-racist movement is being undermined by the BLM leadership. And we can't afford for that to happen.\n\nRobert Cherry is professor emeritus of economics at Brooklyn College.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

It's the Beginning of an Era of Police Accountability | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDerek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd 's neck for nine minutes . It took a Minnesota jury just 11 hours to reach a verdict. Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts, of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nIt is a watershed moment for the police accountability movement, one that represents the dawn of a new era in American policing.\n\nThe Chauvin murder trial was perhaps the highest-profile criminal case against a police officer accused of killing an unarmed Black man. The trial began after a summer of some of the largest protests against police brutality in American history. And the case was not isolated; Floyd's death was one of a string of highly publicized incidents in which white police officers shot unarmed Black men.\n\nNor was the Chauvin guilty verdict a forgone conclusion. There was considerable angst in our community that Chauvin would be found innocent; historically, police in the United States have rarely been convicted of manslaughter or murder , thanks to systemic bias that favors police accounts of events, close relationships between local prosecutors and police departments, and the more general difficulty Black and brown Americans have faced getting favorable outcomes in the legal system.\n\nBut the outcome of the Chauvin trial has given a lot of us hope. It truly feels like it may be an inflection point, especially considering that two-thirds of Americans approved of murder charges being filed against Chauvin, and nearly the same percentage said that a not-guilty verdict would have been a step backwards for race relations.\n\nThat doesn't mean that cases of police shooting unarmed citizens are going to stop tomorrow. But it does mean that the coming era of police accountability is on the horizon.\n\nThree factors have led to this moment, in which the demand for police accountability might finally see some success. For starters, there has been a demographic shift, which has moved the center of the country to the left and changed which voices get heard. There has also been a massive long-term drop in crime , which has made crime less salient in the minds of middle and upper class liberals living in cities. Equally if not more important has been the rise of smartphones and social media, the crucial medium whereby police brutality has been captured on camera.\n\nDemographic change is the most obvious contributing factor. There have only been eleven Black Senators in U.S. history and seven of those Senators were elected in the past 16 years . While these numbers are still small, the Congressional Black Caucus has more than tripled in size since its founding in the early 1970s . These changes mean that the political concerns of minority groups receive greater consideration in the public discourse.\n\nEqually important is the drop in crime rates, which is not talked about nearly enough as a factor in the rise of the police accountability movement. According to the Pew Research Center , the violent crime rate in the U.S. fell 49 percent from 1993 to 2019, the recent COVID-related uptick in crime notwithstanding. This means that a generation of young liberals who are active in politics no longer view cities as hotbeds of crime.\n\nIt's a salient point: Fear of crime has long been an ideological tool that conservatives used to prevent reform in police departments. Without it, white liberals living in urban areas have become much more favorable to protest movements.\n\nBut the importance of smartphones also cannot be understated. The common denominator in the most publicized police brutality cases today is the availability of camera footage. The ubiquitous nature of smartphones has allowed everyday citizens to become journalists, bringing to life what otherwise would have been mere statistics.\n\nSeeing the video of a police officer shooting or killing an unarmed citizen produces a range of emotions that are absent when one is simply reading the numbers; those videos have galvanized mass protests in real time.\n\nThanks to these factors, the police accountability movement has already had some significant political wins. The past decade has seen a proliferation of departments mandating police body cameras. It's a process accelerated by the demands of protesters for police accountability, who have long pointed to social science r esearch that body cameras can significantly reduce police use of force incidents.\n\nMajor cities across the country have also started thinking about reimagining policing , considering legislative proposals which would have been nonstarters even just a few years ago. And there is ongoing research which suggests that Black Lives Matter protests themselves are associated with a 15 to 20 percent drop in police homicides.\n\nAt the political level, modern Democratic standard bearers from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to President Joe Biden decry \" systemic racism \" and \" white nationalism ,\" topics which were considered off limits for political elites as recently as 20 years ago. And research indicates that the overall number of unarmed citizens killed by police is declining , even as the racial disparities largely remain .\n\nSince the police accountability movement was established in earnest last decade, it has seen rapid growth in size and popularity and already led to significant changes in American society. We have every reason to believe that these shifts are going to continue, and that the relationship police have with citizens is going to change in a way that is more favorable to marginalized groups.\n\nWhat we're witnessing now is not the end of a moment. It is the beginning, an inflection point. Law enforcement and the criminal justice system will see significant changes at the local, state, and federal level over the next generation.\n\nAnd when historians and political scientists of the future look back at what sparked such significant change against entrenched interests, they'll look back on cases like the Derek Chauvin murder trial.\n\nMarcus Johnson is a PhD student at American University who studies how political institutions impact the racial wealth gap.\n\nThe views in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe civil rights activist group Black Lives Matter was first thrust into the public consciousness in 2012, during its first protest following the killing of a 17-year-old unarmed African-American, Trayvon Martin, who was walking home from a convenience store with a bag of Skittles and a drink when he was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a white man.\n\nDuring his trial, Zimmerman cried self-defense, claiming he fired his weapon only after being attacked by Martin, and he skated past murder charges . The verdict sparked outrage and a national race debate in part powered by the creators of Black Lives Matter, after which the nonprofit organization would become synonymous with protesting the wrongful deaths of unarmed black people, especially those shot and killed by non-black police officers.\n\nDespite BLM's efforts to bring awareness to the plight of being black in America, as well as advocating for social justice for minorities, the group has faced strong opposition from law enforcement and race-related support groups like Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter. In fact, the overall tone toward BLM, which aims to bring an end to the oppression experienced by African-Americans, is unfavorable, according to a new poll.\n\nThe Harvard-Harris survey , released Monday, found only 43 percent of voters have a positive view of BLM, while more than half of voters-some 57 percent-have an \"unfavorable view\" of the organization.\n\nNot all that surprisingly, a majority of those who are opposed to the group are white. Only 35 percent of whites feel \"favorable\" toward BLM, compared to 65 percent who have a negative view of the group. As for black voters, 83 percent feel positively toward BLM, while only 17 percent don't.\n\nIn regard to partisanship, support among Republicans was the lowest-21 percent-and only 18 percent of Republicans who voted for Trump have a favorable view of BLM. Sixty-five percent of Democrats feel positively toward BLM and 66 percent of Democrats who voted for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton favor the group.\n\nAlthough instances of police brutality against black people, including the shooting deaths of a number of unarmed black men, have received a high volume of national attention in recent years, Americans in general don't believe police violence toward African-Americans is the biggest problem in today's society. Seventy percent of voters said black-on-black crime in African-American communities is a bigger issue, while 30 percent feel police violence against African-Americans is a bigger issue.\n\nA majority of Americans do believe police are too quick to use aggressive force-56 percent-and 64 percent agree that race played a role in the use of aggressive force. However, 44 percent of voters feel cops only use force when necessary, and 36 percent believe race isn't a factor in the use of force.\n\nFifty-four percent of voters think police are too quick to draw their weapons and shoot at African-Americans, while 46 percent feel police engage with people of all races about the same.\n\nSo far in 2017, 581 people have been shot and killed by police officers, according to The Washington Post's Fatal Force Tracker . Of those killed, 127 were black while 241 were white. Last year, 963 people were shot and killed by cops, 465 of whom were white and 233 black.\n\nMore than 323 million people live in the U.S., and only 13 percent of them are black. Whites make up 76.9 percent of the population. Meanwhile, over 2.3 million U.S. residents are currently serving sentences in prisons and jails. Forty percent of those people are black, according to criminal justice nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative , while 39 percent are white.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe recent killing of George Floyd and the protests throughout the U.S. have, once again, brought the issue of police accountability into the national debate. While the officer at the scene is now being charged with murder , this kind of result is sadly atypical. One only needs to look at the cases of Eric Garner , Michael Brown , Alton Sterling and others to see the pattern of police officers assaulting and killing unarmed black men but escaping criminal charges. The problem is that police officers are treated just like ordinary citizens when it comes to criminal liability.\n\nBut they are not mere citizens. Police officers are granted special powers to detain, arrest and use force-in particular, lethal force. But it may surprise you to know that these special powers currently create no corresponding special responsibilities or duties. What we need is a criminal code of police justice that is specifically tailored to regulate these unique powers.\n\nIronically, the National Guard troops currently deployed alongside police officers to quell these protests are governed by a unique criminal code. This Uniform Code of Military Justice subjects these soldiers (in addition to the traditional ordinary citizen crimes of assault, murder, etc.) to a host of unique crimes like failure to obey orders , dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming of an officer . The purpose behind these unique laws is to regulate professionalism and ethical concerns that may not be covered by traditional crimes. Such laws are important because soldiers acting under federal or state authority are often required to use force in the protection of citizens. In such an environment, good order and discipline is critical-and requires the application of a unique set of laws to soldiers that are very different from those that apply to ordinary citizens.\n\nAccordingly, police officers should be treated like these soldiers when it comes to criminal liability. They, too, carry guns, wear uniforms, work in hierarchal structures, go through extensive training and, most importantly, have the authority to detain individuals and use lethal force. A unique set of laws applicable to the police that, for example, criminalizes dereliction of duty or conduct unbecoming of an officer would make it easier to assure that officers will be held criminally responsible when they overstep their authority.\n\nFor example, consider the recent instances of police officers pepper spraying unarmed citizens during the protests . Currently, it would be difficult to convict an officer of an assault because they inherently have the legal authority to use force in this kind of situation. However, the presence of a code that explicitly makes it criminal for an officer to neglect his/her duty by using excessive force would make it much easier for prosecutors to hold officers responsible for such acts. In turn, this may deter officers from doing the very things that Americans are now protesting.\n\nImposing such heightened criminal standards could also carry the benefit of helping to dismantle what is referred to as the \" blue wall of silence \" in police departments. This system discourages police officers from coming forward with information on abuse or corruption by fellow officers, due to fear of being fired or demoted. Such was the case with former Baltimore detective Joe Crystal, who reported the abuse of a suspect by one of his fellow officers, only to be demoted and harassed until he quit. This culture of silence may very well have contributed to the failure of Officer Derek Chauvin's fellow officers to intervene on Mr. Floyd's behalf.\n\nMoreover, this environment in police departments differs sharply from military culture, which values loyalty to the organization over individual loyalty by criminalizing this kind of unethical conduct .\n\nA criminal code of police justice would not need a separate court system. It could be implemented within the current civilian system of courts, prosecutors, judges and juries. The reason for this is that police officers carry out their duties in communities. They should, therefore, be prosecuted and tried by the people who reside in those communities. This same logic applies to National Guard soldiers deployed in their local communities, who are also subject to the civilian court system.\n\nChanging criminal laws is obviously not an easy task. It takes political capital and will naturally confront challenges. But the current climate may be the opportune time for states to begin to make this kind of real structural change. And moreover, we have the military code as a working model. While certain interest groups-most notably, police officers and their unions-might be opposed to such changes, in the end such a proposal would benefit police officers as much as citizens by providing officers with a clearer sense of what is expected of them. This would help foster an atmosphere of compliance, which would go a long way towards establishing a higher degree of goodwill between officers and the communities that they serve. With increasing calls for decreasing police funding or abolishing police departments outright , we should instead be focused on raising professionalism and ethical standards by treating police officers more like soldiers.\n\nMonu Bedi is a law professor at DePaul Law School, where he specializes in criminal law and policing.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDALLAS (Reuters) - A black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war who said he wanted to \"kill white people\" apparently acted alone in a sniper attack that killed five police officers at a protest in Dallas decrying police shootings of black men, officials said on Friday.\n\nSeven other police officers and two civilians were wounded in the ambush in downtown Dallas on Thursday night, officials said. Police killed the gunman, identified by authorities as 25-year-old Micah Johnson, with a bomb-carrying robot after cornering him in a parking garage, ending an hours-long standoff.\n\nA search of Johnson's home in the nearby suburb of Mesquite found \"bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition and a personal journal of combat tactics,\" Dallas police said in a report on Friday. Police said Johnson had no previous criminal history.\n\nOn Thursday night, the sound of gunfire sent a panicked crowd of hundreds of protesters screaming and running for their lives near the end of an otherwise peaceful march to protest police killings of two black men this week in Minnesota and Louisiana. Police officers patrolling the Dallas demonstration at the time believed they were under attack by several gunmen.\n\nBy late afternoon on Friday, however, investigators had concluded that Johnson, armed with a rifle, was the lone gunman.\n\n\"At this time, there appears to have been one gunman, with no known links to or inspiration from any international terrorist organization,\" U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters in New York.\n\nAt a news conference in Dallas, the city's mayor, Michael Rawlings, said the shooting \"came from one building at different levels from this suspect.\"\n\nThree other people were detained by police, but authorities have not publicly linked them to the shootings. Still, officials said they were looking for evidence of any possible co-conspirators.\n\nThe ambush marked the highest death toll for U.S. police in the line duty from a single event since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nGUNMAN ANGRY ABOUT POLICE KILLINGS\n\nThe attack was certain to complicate rising tensions between minority communities and law enforcement following a string of high-profile killings of unarmed black men at the hands of police across the country over the past two years, giving rise to the Black Lives Matter protest movement.\n\nThe latest violence, which occurred as one such rally was coming to a quiet end, was especially devastating for the people of Dallas, a city that struggled for decades to heal from the scars left by the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, blocks away in Dealey Plaza.\n\nDallas Police Chief David Brown called Thursday's incident \"a well-planned, well-thought-out, evil tragedy.\" He added, \"We are determined to not let this person steal this democracy from us.\"\n\nDuring lengthy negotiations with police, the gunman told police he was angry about the Louisiana and Minnesota killings, Brown told reporters.\n\n\"The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated that he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers,\" said Brown, who is African-American.\n\nSome details began to emerge about Johnson. He posted a rant against white people on a black nationalist Facebook group called Black Panther Party Mississippi last Saturday, denouncing the lynching and brutalizing of black people.\n\n\"Why do so many whites (not all) enjoy killing and participating in the death of innocent beings,\" Johnson wrote in his Facebook post above a graphic video of people participating in a whale-killing, comparing it to the treatment of black people in the United States.\n\nIn what appeared to be his own Facebook page, Johnson was portrayed as a black nationalist, with images of Black Power and the red, black and green flag sometimes known as the Black Liberation flag. His profile photo showed him with his clenched fist in the air in the familiar Black Power salute.\n\nThe U.S. Army said Johnson, 25, had served as a private first class in the Army Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan from November 2013 to July 2014. It said Johnson served from March 2009 to April 2015 and was a carpentry and masonry specialist with the 420th Engineering Brigade based in Texas.\n\n\"HEARTACHE AND DEVASTATION\"\n\nDetails on how the shootings unfolded remained unclear. Video of the attack taken by a witness shows a man carrying an assault-style weapon and large amounts of ammunition.\n\nThe video shows the gunman crouching at ground level and charging at and then shooting another person who appeared to be wearing a uniform. That person then collapsed to the ground.\n\nReuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.\n\nThe Rev. Jeff Hood, an organizer of Thursday night's protest, said he had been chatting with some of the police officers on the street when gunfire erupted.\n\n\"I saw what I believe were two police officers that went down. I didn't know what to do,\" Hood told reporters on Friday. \"If we continue to turn to violence, we are going to continue to see heartache and devastation.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama, in Poland for a NATO summit, called the Dallas shootings \"a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.\" Obama, who has been stymied by the Republican-led Congress in his bid for new gun control laws, added, \"We also know when people are armed with powerful weapons unfortunately it makes attacks like these more deadly.\"\n\nAs Dallas reeled from a night of carnage, there was a flurry of other shootings directed at police across the country.\n\nA man in Tennessee opened fire on a highway, killing a woman and grazing a police officer with a bullet on Thursday, because he was troubled by incidents involving black people and law enforcement, authorities said on Friday. Police officers also were ambushed and wounded in shootings in Missouri and Georgia on Friday.\n\nLargely peaceful protests unfolded around the United States after the police shooting of Philando Castile, a 32-year-old black man, on Wednesday, during a traffic stop near St. Paul, Minnesota. A day earlier, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shot dead Alton Sterling, 37, while responding to a call alleging he had threatened someone with a gun.\n\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the presumptive Democratic and Republican U.S. presidential nominees, respectively, canceled their campaign events for Friday following the attack.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "Washington Post Undercounts Number of Unarmed Black Men Killed by Cops, Misses Bigger Picture\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nEd Krayewski | 8.10.2015 6:00 PM\n\nA year ago yesterday , the killing of Michael Brown by Darren Wilson, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, catapulted the issue of police violence onto the national stage. After Brown's death, subsequent cases of killings by police received more attention than they likely otherwise would've.\n\nEven killings that happened before Brown's, like that of Eric Garner , who was killed by police on Staten Island last July after being accused of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes, garnered more attention afterward. Garner's death saw protests in New York CIty and around the country on a scale not seen when police shot and killed 18-year-old Ramarley Graham after chasing him into his grandmother's house over a small amount of marijuana. Freddie Gray , Walter Scott , and even Sandra Bland subsequently became household names. If their deaths had occurred a few years earlier they would join the thousands of names of people killed by police unknown to Americans, like Graham, or David Lee Turner or Erik Scott or Ernesto Duenez or Bobby Bennett or Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams or even Seth Adams .\n\nThis year, victims of fatal police violence are counted by the media in a way they never have before. Over the weekend, the Washington Post ran a long piece under the headline \"Black and Unarmed\" about the 24 unarmed black men fatally shot by police this year, based on their ongoing analysis of their database on fatal police shootings. The Post does not offer a link to its database itself, but at least one other outlet has its own publicly available database. The Guardian has been collecting news reports of police killings this year and making the database available to the public online as a feature called \"The Counted.\" The Guardian counts 26 unarmed black men fatally shot by police.\n\nIt includes six cases not in the Washington Post 's report, those of Denzel Brown , Sam Holmes , Kevin Judson , Glenn Lewis , Demeris Turner , and Andrew Williams , while categorizing four cases in the Post's report as something other than an unarmed black man fatally shot by cops. The Guardian lists Albert Davis' race as unknown and Victor Larosa's armed status as unknown. Lavall Hall and Bobby Gross are listed as \"armed (other)\" because they were alleged to have been armed, respectively, with a broom stick and a tree branch. The Post says it considers victims of police shootings holding \"an object unlikely to inflict serious injury\" as unarmed.\n\nNevertheless the Post omits 23 other black men shot by police that The Guardian reports were armed with something other than a gun or a knife. The most recent, Darius Graves , barricaded himself in a motel room after being chased for allegedly committing a robbery. Police threw tear gas into his motel room and then shot him when he ran out with a steel pole.\n\nBy focusing on fatal police shootings, the Post missed about 28 other unarmed black men killed by police in some other manner. By focusing only on unarmed black men, the Post can say that the number represents \"a surprisingly small fraction of the 585 people shot and killed by police through Friday evening.\" The Guardian counts 704 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2015-about 83 percent of whom were shot. But less than half of the unarmed black men who were killed by police were shot. Ten died in police custody, including Jonathan Sanders and Freddie Gray . Four were struck by police vehicles-in each case police say it was an accident but in at least two cases, that of Bernard Moore and Bryan Overstreet , the families are questioning the police narrative. Fourteen unarmed black men died after being Tased.\n\nOf the two black women killed by police this year, one was among four people fatally struck by police vehicles in New Jersey alone, and another, Natasha McKenna , died after being Tased while shackled in a Virginia county jail. While authorities insisted her death was accidental, and that psychoactive medications and her state of \"excited delirium\" contributed to it, the jail temporarily stopped using Tasers after the incident.\n\nThe Washington Post points out that its 24 fatal police shootings of unarmed black men make up 40 percent of all shootings while black men make up only 6 percent of the U.S. population. But there have been no reports of police shooting and killing an unarmed black woman this year. They make up 6 or 7 percent of the population too, but no one would suggest there's not a problem with policing when it comes to black women. More than 90 percent of the victims of fatal police shootings are men,\n\nThe Post says it found unarmed black men are seven times more likely to be shot and killed by police, an incredible statistic that points to a big racial problem in policing, and the hiring and firing thereof. But were unarmed black men  killed by police at the same rate as unarmed white men, there would still be more than 40 fatal police shootings of unarmed people in the U.S. this year. There have actually been 65-while 85 other unarmed people died in police custody some other way, more from Tasers than any other method.\n\nWhat most of these cases have in common, across race, gender, and age, is that the officers involved get away with it. Cases like Freddie Gray's and Walter Scott's, where police officers were charged criminally, are the exception. Police officers across the country enjoy a wide array of privileges \"civilians\" involved in homicides don't. Even in the case of Freddie Gray, where the police officers had 10 days to speak to investigators about what happened, the six cops facing charges related to Gray's death all remain on the payroll of the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nPolice officials and police unions complain that the new national mood is turning police officers into targets, on the streets and in the courts. The Washington Post points out 18 cops have been shot and killed in the line of duty-but not that this is a 25 percent decrease from last year, or that police work is getting safer . And where police unions and officials argue there's a problem of overprosecuting cops-setting aside for a moment the absolute absurdity of this argument when most cops don't face charges after killing someone-the employment protections they've carved out for law enforcement have contributed to the problem. In many jurisdictions it's almost impossible to fire a cop absent a criminal conviction. All six Freddie Gray officers, again, are still employed. A lack of meaningful accountability for homicidal misconduct helps create an environment where such misconduct will of course continue.\n\nThe fetishization of the racial aspect of police violence at the expense of any other factors by much of the mainstream media means those systemic problems, and others, that contribute to police violence are ignored. The case of Zachary Hammond , an unarmed white teenager shot during a sting over 10 grams of marijuana, for example, illustrates the drug war's role in police violence. Many police shootings, of people of all races, armed and unarmed, are drug-related. Drug-related violence, state or otherwise, is almost entirely fueled by the government's classification of drugs as illegal substances. Hammond was white, so he's not on the Post's list. But The Root covered Hammond's case last week, pointing out that the \"All Lives Matter\" crowd had not drawn attention to Hammond, while police reform activists operating under the banner of \"Black Lives Matter\" had. Hammond's attorney complains the case has not received as much attention as its controversial nature deserves because the dead unarmed teenager is white.\n\nAs Jacob Sullum notes , the main lesson in Hammond's case is the depravity of the drug war, and the support that war continues to enjoy. Sullum highlighted one quote from a resident responding to the fatal shooting: \"We're so thankful here in Oconee County that our police departments and sheriffs and things like that, that they're on top of the drug problems and trying to eliminate all drugs and everything.\" There is a statement that is pretty typical of the white community. The All Lives Matter crowd The Root refers to isn't one that's interested in police violence as it applies to all races, but one that tries to downplay state violence because of the lives the state saves by, say, throwing people in jail for the things they put in their bodies. Eliminating \"all drugs and everything.\"\n\nThe mainstream media's narrow interest in police violence as a racial problem misses a police violence epidemic that crosses racial and class lines. Hammond's cases is pretty close to what Toni Morrison said would be an indicator of the end of racism-an unarmed white teenager shot in the back. And Hammond isn't the first unarmed white teenager killed by cops who got away with it. It doesn't mean racism is over. Just as if police killed unarmed people of all races at the same rate-even if that rate were the one they currently kill unarmed white people at-there would still be a police violence problem.\n\nUntil cops can be fired for displaying malicious tendencies-even before they kill-until cops are no longer ordered to go into largely poor communities to zealously enforce petty laws meant at raising revenue, until the community-police relationship is really treated as one of master-servant, in that order, there will continue to be plenty of names to count and talk about.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "George Floyd's Horrifying Death Highlights Stark Racial Disparities in the Use of Police Force\n\nGeorge Floyd\n\nJacob Sullum | 6.3.2020 2:30 PM\n\nThe cellphone video of George Floyd's fatal encounter with three Minneapolis police officers-during which one of them kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring Floyd's anguished pleas, bystanders' objections, and the concerns of a colleague who twice suggested that Floyd should be rolled from his stomach to his side-is horrifying enough on its own. But the anger expressed in the nationwide protests triggered by that incident goes far beyond this case or the litany of others in which cops killed unarmed black men. It reflects a general pattern of racially skewed law enforcement that is clear from data on the use of force by police in Minneapolis and elsewhere. These numbers show that African Americans have good reason to believe their complexions make them especially vulnerable to police abuse.\n\nWhenever a Minneapolis officer draws his gun, deploys a dog, or grabs, shoves, slaps, punches, kicks, tackles, pins, strangles, tases, or pepper-sprays someone, he is supposed to report that use of force. Blacks, who account for a fifth of the city's population , were on the receiving end of such violence nearly three-fifths of the time during the last five years, according to official records analyzed by The New York Times . Whites, who account for more than three-fifths of Minneapolis residents, were involved in less than a quarter of those incidents.\n\nTo put it another way, the Times says, \"police in Minneapolis used force against black people at a rate at least seven times that of white people.\" While the contrast is especially striking in Minneapolis, researchers have documented such racial disparities in cities across the country.\n\nIn a 2016 National Bureau of Economics paper , Harvard economist Roland Fryer analyzed information about police encounters from New York City's \"stop and frisk\" program, from a nationally representative survey of the general public, and from reports on incidents in which officers fired their weapons, based on records provided by law enforcement agencies in Austin, Dallas, Houston, six Florida counties, and Los Angeles County. Although he found no evidence of racial disparities in shootings, he reported that \"blacks and Hispanics are more than 50 percent more likely to experience some form of force,\" such as grabbing, handcuffing, slapping, baton strikes, pepper spraying, and pushing to the ground or against a wall.\n\nAccording to a 2015 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, based on data from a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 3.5 percent of blacks who reported contact with the police said they had been threatened with or subjected to force during the most recent encounter, compared to 1.4 percent of whites. Among respondents who said they had been stopped by police on the street, blacks were twice as likely to report the use of force. They were also twice as likely to be manhandled during searches. During traffic stops, blacks were three times as likely to be threatened with or subjected to force.\n\nBlacks are also more likely than whites to be searched during traffic stops. A 2018 analysis of stops in Portland, Oregon, found that black drivers were subjected to discretionary searches 9 percent of the time, compared to a rate of 3 percent for white drivers. Based on data collected by the Pennsylvania State Police, The Philadelphia Inquirer found that \"troopers were roughly two to three times more likely to search black or Hispanic drivers than white drivers.\" And when searches were conducted, \"troopers were far less likely to find contraband\" if the drivers were black or Hispanic rather than white, suggesting that the evidentiary threshold for searching blacks and Hispanics was lower.\n\nIn a 2017 analysis of data from 20 states, researchers at Stanford University found that \"white drivers are searched in 2.0% of stops, compared to 3.5% of stops for black motorists and 3.8% for Hispanic motorists.\" After the researchers controlled for stop location, date and time, and driver age and gender, they calculated that \"black and Hispanic drivers have approximately twice the odds of being searched relative to white drivers.\" They were also twice as likely to be arrested. The study found that \"black and Hispanic drivers are searched on the basis of less evidence than white drivers, suggestive of bias in search decisions.\"\n\nAfter surveying drivers in the Kansas City area in 2003 and 2004, Charles Epp and two other researchers at the University of Kansas classified police encounters based on the legal justification (or lack thereof) and the amount of discretion involved. They found that black drivers were no more likely than white drivers to report clear-cut \"traffic safety stops\" (e.g., for running a red light or stop sign, driving at night with headlights off, or exceeding the speed limit by seven or more miles an hour) but were nearly three times as likely to report seemingly pretextual \"investigatory stops\" (e.g., for an unilluminated license plate, driving too slowly, or no reason mentioned by the officer).\n\nDuring investigatory stops, Epp and his colleagues reported, black drivers were five times as likely as white drivers to be searched. They were also more likely to be handcuffed and threatened with arrest, and more likely to describe the officer's demeanor as rude, hostile, or insulting. Blacks perceived investigatory stops as less legitimate than traffic safety stops, while whites made no such distinction. The more stops black drivers had experienced, the less they trusted the police, an effect that was not apparent among white drivers.\n\nHighly publicized incidents like the death of George Floyd are the most extreme manifestations of a quotidian reality. \"There is no question that there is residual racism in America,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged yesterday. \"This is a vexing issue. If we could have figured out exactly what to do, I think we'd have done it years ago. It's one of our continuing, persistent problems in our society that we're all acutely aware of.\" Some of us more than others.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "We Filmed the Cops. People Changed Their Minds.\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nPeter Suderman | 6.10.2020 2:04 PM\n\nIn the years since the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a wave of protests against abusive law enforcement, there has been a remarkable shift in public opinion about race and policing.\n\nA Washington Post poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans say Floyd's killing represents a systemic problem with policing, while just 29 percent say it's an isolated incident; six years ago, the Post reports, more than half of Americans saw police killings of unarmed black men as isolated events, with just 43 percent viewing them as part of a wider trend.\n\nThat shift has produced bipartisan support for activism against police violence. The Post poll found that 74 percent of Americans support recent protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Democrats were more likely to support the protests, but a majority of Republicans and independents backed them too. A Monmouth poll released last week found that 57 percent of Americans, including about half of white Americans, said police officers were generally more likely to treat black people unfairly than to mistreat white people, which The New York Times describes as a \"drastic change\" in public attitudes about racial disparities in policing.\n\nAs with nearly all instances of rapid social change, there are many factors at work. The Black Lives Matter movement has tirelessly emphasized racial disparities in law enforcement and made police reform an urgent national priority. Conservative activists have embraced criminal justice reforms that reject tough-on-crime policies. News coverage has become less deferential to police narratives. The political class has, in some instances, distanced itself from law enforcement. Social media has proven a potent tool for activists to organize and get out their message. None of these forces should be discounted.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest story one can tell is this: We filmed the cops, and people changed their minds.\n\nFor the last two decades, America has conducted an experiment in mass videography. Virtually everyone in the country now carries a camera in his or her pocket. In addition, our highways, streets, and sidewalks are watched by an array of public and private digital eyes, recording, if not everything, then much of the nation's public interactions-including with the police.\n\nIn the early days of mass camera adoption, cops resisted public attempts to film them , often attempting to shut down and even destroy videos of their work taken by citizens.\n\nIt's not hard to understand the resistance. Those ubiquitous cameras-on cellphones, on dashboards, in stores, on police uniforms-have repeatedly given the public deeply disturbing glimpses into how officers of the law do their jobs.\n\nThey showed us the horrific final moments of George Floyd and Eric Garner, six years apart, as they slowly asphyxiated from the force that police officers exerted on their bodies, each man gasping for breath, crying out for their lives, struggling to form the words, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThey showed us the shots a South Carolina cop fired into Walter Scott's back as he fled on foot after being pulled over for a broken taillight. They showed us the 40 seconds during which Minnesota cafeteria worker Philando Castille was pulled over by a Minneapolis patrolman and then shot to death after disclosing that he was carrying a firearm. They showed us the arrest of Sandra Bland , a Texas woman pulled over for failing to use a turn signal, as an angry cop pointed a weapon at her and screamed, \"I will light you up!\" (A few days later, she was found in her jail cell, hanged to death.)\n\nAnd over the last two weeks, cameras have given us a parade of videos showing how some in law enforcement behave when facing a national outcry over abuses of power and excessive use of force: with abuses of power and excessive use of force.\n\nResearchers have spent years digging into crime data and arrest reports in order to demonstrate the racial disparities in police work and sentencing. But charts and graphs and studies, while valuable, can only do so much. Images inevitably have a more visceral impact.\n\nEach video is an act of documentary filmmaking, and each one helps to tell a story. Although the particulars differ, that story has been remarkably consistent: police abusing their power to violent ends, especially when interacting with minorities. Tell a story enough times, show it happening again and again and again, and it reshapes the way people see the world. Over time, in the public mind, a pile-up of anecdotes eventually becomes data.\n\nAs University of Wisconsin journalism professor Douglas McLeod, who studies the way news consumption affects culture and politics, recently told The New York Times , the steady stream of videos depicting police abuse, in combination with the distribution of those videos through social media, has changed the way people see law enforcement abuses:\n\nDr. McLeod said that as videos showing police brutality against black people have appeared relentlessly on social media, they have helped persuade skeptical Americans that an endemic problem exists. \"When these things accumulate over time, and we start to see more and more of these images, the evidence starts to become more incontrovertible,\" he said.\n\nThese videos not only show us what police do; they show us how that differs from what police say they do. The Minneapolis Police Department initially said in a press release that George Floyd's death stemmed from a \"medical incident during a police interaction.\" The video shows an emotionless officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as the victim begs for his mother and his life. Buffalo police said an elderly protester \"tripped and fell\"; a video shows he was pushed by two officers wearing face shields and carrying batons. The Texas cop who pulled Sandra Bland out of her car said he was afraid; the video Bland took of her own arrest shows that he was angry-and she was the one who was exhibiting fear.\n\nThe tragedy is that these videos could not save the life of George Floyd, or of any of the other victims of police brutality who have come since. Images alone cannot substitute for action. But they can be a motivating force-a rallying point for a ground-up movement demanding change.\n\nThere is already some evidence that this has begun: In a handful of large cities that have adopted reforms designed to reduce the use of force-including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Baltimore-police killings have dropped in recent years. The data, according to a FiveThirtyEight report on trends in police killings, s uggest that \"reforms may be working in the places that have implemented them. Many of these reforms were initiated in response to protests and public outcry over high-profile deaths at the hands of police.\"\n\nAbusive officers recently caught on video , meanwhile, are being swiftly disciplined: The two Buffalo officers who pushed the elderly protester were suspended without pay . All four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death have already been charged . The officer whose chokehold resulted in Eric Garner's 2014 death, in contrast, wasn't fired until 2019 .\n\nMinneapolis, meanwhile, is backing out of negotiations for a new contract with its police union. And when cameras aren't present, it's a point of contention: Among the causes for outrage in the police killing of Breonna Taylor during a no-knock raid in Louisville, Kentucky, this year is that the cops weren't wearing body cameras . Going forward, the city will require police to wear them. Earlier this month, the city's police chief was relieved from duty after it was discovered that officers involved in a separate shooting did not activate their cameras.\n\nIt's true that some studies have found that body cameras do little to alter police behavior. The look of cold, almost bored, indifference on the face of the officer who knelt on Floyd, despite the conspicuous presence of onlookers filming the incident, suggests the limits of video to directly change law enforcement behavior; a police department press release noted that active body cams were worn during the incident.\n\nThe numerous videos showing police abuse during demonstrations against police abuse provide more evidence that cameras alone don't stop police misconduct. As Reason 's Eric Boehm wrote , it has sometimes seemed that the nation's police are determined to demonstrate exactly why people are protesting them in the first place.\n\nYet even if videos aren't directly changing police behavior, they are almost certainly contributing to the public's shifting perception of that behavior, bolstering the case made by activists by making it harder and harder to deny. In turn, they are putting reforms that might have seemed difficult or impossible just a few years ago within reach. On its own, filming police brutality isn't enough. But each new clip that circulates shows us the vivid and excruciating reality of what has happened and what is happening-and demonstrates, over and over again, what desperately needs to change.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Still Not Getting Along\n\nCivil Liberties\n\nStephanie Slade | From the March 2015 issue\n\nOn April 29, 1992, a California jury acquitted four white Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers of the brutal beating of black motorist Rodney King, causing dismay among minority residents of the city. As the dismay turned to anger and the anger turned to violence, five days of rioting ensued; more than 55 people died, and CNN reported economic damage of over $1 billion.\n\nRick Henderson anticipated that frustration in \" L.A., Lawless \" (May 1991). Reflecting on the record of policing in Los Angeles, Henderson called the King beating \"only slightly more disturbing than the official response of the law enforcement community.\" He noted that the LAPD had a history of targeting and \"roughing up\" blacks, including several famous athletes, and that Police Chief Daryl Gates remained in power despite overseeing not just King's abuse but a string of police acts that had cost the city $8 million in payouts the year before. \"Suspected criminals, even 'ex-cons,' don't lose their due-process rights the instant police officers apprehend them,\" Henderson wrote.\n\nTwenty-two years on, many of the same themes have driven residents of Ferguson, Missouri; New York City; Washington, D.C.; and other cities around the country back into the streets. Frustration over disparate racial treatment by police has bubbled over after two separate incidents in which grand juries declined to indict police officers responsible for the recent deaths of unarmed black men.\n\nIn Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot multiple times by an officer who claims Brown tried to take his weapon, the protests became destructive, with local businesses looted and cars set aflame. As in Los Angeles in 1992, the National Guard was called in and authorities attempted to impose a curfew. But the stories of Ferguson and Staten Island, New York, where father-of-six Eric Garner died after police put him in a chokehold, differ from that of Los Angeles in one important respect: The officers in the first two cities will not face trial.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called the failure to indict \"an outrage\" and \"a blow to our democracy [that] should shock the conscience of every single American who cares about justice and fair play.\" Despite King's famous plea, the police and the public have not yet learned to get along.\n\nThis article originally appeared in print under the headline \"Still Not Getting Along.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Shooting of Unarmed 19-Year-Old Highlights the Drug War's Depravity\n\nPolicy\n\nJacob Sullum | 8.10.2015 6:30 AM\n\nLast Friday the Seneca, South Carolina, police department identified Lt. Mark Tiller as the officer who shot and killed 19-year-old Zachary Hammond in a Hardee's parking lot on July 26. Hammond, who was unarmed, was on his first date with 23-year-old Tori Morton, who was eating an ice cream cone in the front passenger seat of his car at the moment of the shooting. Morton was later charged with possessing 10 grams of marijuana. According to The New York Times , police had targeted her as part of \"a sting operation.\" The Washington Post says \"undercover agents set up the drug buy.\"\n\nTiller claims he fired two shots in self-defense through the driver's side window because Hammond was trying to run him down. But an autopsy commissioned by Hammond's family found that one bullet entered his left shoulder from behind while the other entered his chest from the side-wounds that the family's lawyer, Eric Bland, says are inconsistent with Tiller's story, which he calls \"ridiculous\" and \"offensive.\" Police say they have dashcam video of the encounter, which might help clarify the facts, but they have not released it yet.\n\nBland complains that the shooting of Hammond, who was white, has not received the same sort of national attention as incidents in which unarmed black men were killed by police. \"It's sad, but I think the reason is, unfortunately, the media and our government officials have treated the death of an unarmed white teenager differently than they would have if this were a death of an unarmed black teen,\" Bland told The Washington Post last week. \"The hypocrisy that has been shown toward this is really disconcerting.\"\n\nBland may have a point, but to me the main lesson to be learned from this utterly senseless incident has to do with the depravity of the war on drugs. Even if we assume that Tiller is telling the truth and that he reasonably believed lethal force was necessary to avoid death or serious injury, this entire situation was created by the cops. Hammond and Morton were minding their own business when Tiller initiated the use of force because of a pending transaction involving a third of an ounce of marijuana, a drug that is legal for medical or recreational use in 23 states. Furthermore, it was the police who arranged the transaction to begin with, in an attempt to catch Morton doing something that shouldn't be treated as a crime because it violates no one's rights. That's what a drug sting is: a trumped-up version of a fake crime.\n\nWhether or not the shooting is deemed to be legally justified, it is outrageous that a young man is dead for such a stupid reason. Maybe this incident will wake up more Americans to the reality of the war on drugs, which uses violence to stop people from getting high and therefore constantly risks outcomes like this. Or maybe not. Here is how one Hardee's customer reacted to the shooting: \"We're so thankful here in Oconee County that our police departments and sheriffs and things like that, that they're on top of the drug problems and trying to eliminate all drugs and everything.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Why We Should Care About the Racial Divide in Perceptions of Law Enforcement\n\nPolitics\n\nEmily Ekins | 11.26.2014 10:00 AM\n\nThe American Idea posits that the choices we make shape individual success. However, the State can undermine this promise if its most powerful tool-its policing power-is misused or allows external characteristics to skew the application of justice. It's demoralizing and imposes a narrative of inferiority. Recent Reason-Rupe polling reveals Americans are significantly divided in their perception of abuse and bias in the criminal justice system and this perception divide alone ought to give us pause.\n\nIrrespective of the actual extent of systemic bias, perception alone can be debilitating. The perception of a biased justice system may lead one to be less willing to give benefit of the doubt and to feel that self-determination is out of their grasp.\n\nCompiling Reason-Rupe polling data finds dramatic racial differences in perceptions of law enforcement and the criminal justice system more generally. Minorities tend to believe the police too often use excessive force, that the cases of excessive force are on the rise, but also that police officers are not generally held accountable for their conduct.\n\nStark Perception Gap\n\nGranted, majorities of all racial groups-80% white, 52% black, 51% Hispanic-say they have a favorable view of the police. However, black and Hispanic Americans (82% and 72% respectively) are far more likely to believe police are too quick to use lethal force, compared to 34 percent of white Americans. In contrast, a solid majority (59%) of white Americans believe the police only use lethal force when necessary, compared to 16 percent of black Americans and 23 percent of Hispanics.\n\nFurthermore, both African-Americans and Hispanics feel that the number of excessive force cases is increasing-73% and 67% respectively-compared to 38 percent of Caucasians.\n\nNot only that, but 67 percent of black and Hispanic Americans feel police officers are generally not held accountable for misconduct, compared to only 37 percent of white Americans. Notice, the wording did not say \"occasionally\" but \"generally\". Minorities tend to view lack of police accountability as the rule, not the exception. Conversely, a solid majority of Caucasians (58%) says officers are held accountable before the law, compared to a third of nonwhite Americans.\n\nPerhaps most troubling for any Republic committed to the rule of law, is that nonwhite Americans perceive the criminal justice system to treat white Americans more fairly. While 53 percent of Caucasians believe the system treats all racial groups the same, 83 percent of African-Americans and 62 percent of Hispanics say Caucasians are treated more fairly under the law.\n\nReality Check\n\nWhy the perception difference? There is empirical evidence that does reveal racial bias in the application of justice.\n\nFor instance, in Ferguson, MO even though white residents are more likely to be caught with contraband, black Ferguson residents disproportionately comprise 86 percent of all traffic stops and 92 of all arrests despite representing 67 percent of the community. The Missouri Attorney General's Office's 2013 racial profiling report found 1 in 3 white Ferguson residents who were stopped and searched were caught with contraband compared only 1 in 5 black residents who were stopped and searched.\n\nMoreover, a 2010 ACLU report found that although white and black Americans use marijuana at equal rates, African-Americans are nearly 4 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.\n\nImplications\n\nInstead of drawing lines and labeling others as whiners/complainers or racists, we should take a moment to consider the possibility that no particular side has a complete monopoly on reality.\n\nPart of the problem is that most individuals have difficulty understanding the experiences of others, particularly those outside of their social orbits. For instance, an ABC/ Washington Post survey found that nearly two thirds of both white and Hispanic Americans did not believe black Americans in their communities experience racial discrimination. Yet the results are completely flipped for black Americans: nearly two-thirds say blacks in their communities do experience discrimination. This includes 33 percent who say it occurs \"often\" and 29 percent who say \"occasionally\" or \"rarely.\"\n\nFurther complicating the perception divide is the relative group sizes. Suppose you have at least two groups: one of which comprises the majority and sees little problem but the other group is a minority and says there is a problem. Who might you be more inclined to believe? Personally, I'm inclined to believe both sides probably report what they genuinely observe in their own lives.\n\nNevertheless, James Madison's warning in Federalist #10 of tyranny of the majority should prompt us to pay careful attention to the perceptions of the minority:\n\n\"Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.\n\n...When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government...enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nThe fact that white Americans are the majority and don't perceive much of a problem in the criminal justice system necessarily means most elected officials don't perceive a problems and thus don't pursue reform.\n\nFor instance, in the United States, the average member of Congress in 2014 is 57 years old, college educated, male, and Caucasian. As I explain in an earlier post , using a statistical technique we can predict the likelihood this average member of Congress perceives bias in the criminal justice system. Such a test found there is a 65% chance the average member of Congress does not think there is racial bias in the system. Without perceiving a problem, there is little reason to expect them to pursue reform.\n\nAnd this speaks to the core of why so many Ferguson protestors are justifiably upset. It reasonably appears that in the midst of unarmed black men-or any unarmed suspects for that matter-being shot and killed by those entrusted with their protection, law enforcement officials are rarely held accountable . Not only that, but elected officials don't seem to believe there is even a problem. This naturally leads many to conclude those in power do not believe them or worse-even care about them.\n\nAs Ronnie Natch a peaceful Ferguson protestor put it: \"This was a chance to vent about the national treatment of black men across the country... We want to show up at the front door every day and say, through words, that this shooting is not going to be swept under the rug ...There have just been too many deaths.\"\n\nAll lives matter. Until we can genuinely attempt to understand the experiences of others-rather than label those with whom we disagree as complainers, Marxists, or racists-we cannot move forward.\n\n* Contraband Hit Rate=(Searches with Contraband Found/Total Searches) X 100\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "NYPD To Document Nearly All Instances of Force\n\nPolitics\n\nAnthony Fisher | 10.1.2015 1:10 PM\n\nIs a new era of transparency in policing upon us?\n\nPerhaps, if Commissioner William J. Bratton's suggestion that the NYPD's newly announced system, which mandates the documentation of almost any use of force by its officers, becomes a \"national template\" for other police departments.\n\nThe New York Times reports:\n\nEvery police officer will have to detail virtually every instance when force is used not only in an arrest but also in other encounters with the public, including the sort of brief, violent detention and release that occurs routinely on the street and, in the case of the retired tennis star James Blake, is captured on video.\n\nOfficers, who have long been required to intervene when they see other officers using excessive force, will now face formal discipline, up to and including dismissal, not only if they fail to step in or report excessive force, but also if they also fail to seek medical assistance for someone who requests it.\n\nThe new policy comes in the wake of a tumultuous year where the killings of unarmed black men ( and boys ) in New York City and around the country have led to a brighter spotlight shone on police officers' use of force. And while the NYPD has \"meticulously studied\" every single bullet fired by its officers for decades, they will now also study \"far more routine episodes of force - baton blows, physical altercations, mace spraying, takedowns - that erupt in an instant on the street.\"\n\nBratton admitted that by only focusing on gunshots, the department was left with \"a hole in our data\":\n\nMany of the everyday rough encounters between officers and civilians, which rankle observers but that Mr. Bratton has called \"awful but lawful,\" are not presently documented. Officers can note force on forms filed for an arrest, but not after hundreds of thousands of other interactions, including car stops, criminal summonses and dealings with emotionally disturbed people...\n\nBy more closely tracking every physical encounter, including by race, and requiring officers to justify their actions, police officials expect that the new data will capture an increased number of forcible episodes. But they also expect that those encounters will be better understood.\n\nWhile the new system, expected to be implemented in early 2016, will allow for a greater analysis of how, why, and where officers use force, there will still be holes in the data. For example, if an officer pushes a citizen against a wall, they are under no obligation to document that as force. In a situation where a detained individual who is not under arrest becomes less than cooperative, the appropriate level of force hovers in a gray area.\n\nThis new push for transparency and conditioning officers to de-escalate potentially volatile situations comes just days after the NYPD introduced \" Stop and Frisk tickets ,\" essentially a receipt explaining why an officer stopped a person but did not arrest them.\n\nNot everyone is on board with the increased scrutiny on police. The New York Daily News reports:\n\nPatrick Lynch, head of the largest NYPD union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (PBA), called the new paperwork \"another nail in the coffin of proactive policing.\"\n\nReason reached out to the PBA for comment on the new policy regarding use of force reporting. We will update if/when they respond.\n\nIn late 2014, Reason TV reported from a pro-NYPD rally held after massive protests critical of the NYPD erupted all over New York City following the non-indictment of Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner.\n\nWatch below:\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Political Ignorance and Misinformation on the Left\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nPolitical Ignorance\n\nIlya Somin | 5.31.2023 4:00 PM\n\nPolitical ignorance and the closely related phenomenon of misinformation are serious problems. But most commentators are far quicker to identify them on the opposing side of the political spectrum than on their own. For that reason, prominent liberal political commentator Matt Yglesias deserves credit for recognizing that left-wing public opinion is far from immune to these dangers. In a recent post , he highlights two types of misinformation that are widely believed by left-liberals: climate catastrophism and massive overestimation of the number of unarmed African-Americans killed by police:\n\nIn a democracy, those who govern are accountable to a mass public that overwhelmingly comprises people who don't think much about politics and policy and who really don't know much about it. That real-world citizens are not idealized deliberators is a really important aspect of how society functions, and it's important that everyone who cares about such things try to understand it....\n\nBut this whole genre of genuine inquiry into public opinion dynamics has gotten derailed, I think, by the sort of goofy idea that Donald Trump was swept into power by a tidal wave of \"misinformation....\"\n\nThe thing that makes this sort of superficial analysis so seductive is that it's not exactly wrong. Most people really are very poorly informed about politics and policy. A lot of campaign messaging is pretty misleading. A lot of media coverage is sloppy and propagandistic. It's also true that as a result of education polarization, over the past few cycles, Democrats have mostly done worse with relatively uninformed demographic groups (poor white people, working-class Hispanics) and better with relatively well-informed high-SES whites. This is to say that if you set out to find misinformation among people voting Republican, it's not hard to do so. But it's a totally unprincipled inquiry unless you take a systematic look at misinformation, in which case you'll see it's hardly confined to Republicans.....\n\nI think the most salient example of this is climate change, where you not only have rightists spreading insane conspiracy theories (Trump used to say it was a Chinese hoax), but you also have a lot of very influential wrongheaded ideas on the left.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent version of this is the idea that the world faces a hard tipping point to climate apocalypse sometime around 2030 . This is routinely debunked ( here's Scientific American ) but keeps popping up....\n\nI also think many people don't realize that natural disaster deaths have become much rarer over time because for most people, the benefits of living in a richer world with better technology far outweigh the hazards of living in a warmer world.....\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to overstating the most likely consequences of the status quo, it's common to hear grossly exaggerated accounts of the ease of getting to net zero with current technology . That's often paired with undervaluing energy in general ... These are errors that have had meaningful policy and political impacts, but that get totally ignored in a misinformation discourse that locates misinformation exclusively on the right....\n\nOne suggestive survey indicated that about 40-50% of liberal or very liberal people believe 1,000 or more unarmed Black men are shot and killed by the police in a typical year. I have a lot of qualms with the methods used in that survey, which I think encouraged overestimation across the board. But if nothing else, it demonstrates that a huge share of the population is operating with very little factual information about a subject it purports to believe is very important. This is not unique to liberals or the topic of police misconduct -it is, rather, fairly typical of average citizens' general lack of engagement with policy or facts.\n\nFor context, the total number of people killed by police in recent years is about 1000 per year , and a plurality of them (389 of 1097 in 2022, as compared to 225 blacks; there were 341 fatalities whose race is unknown) are white. And a large percentage of these fatalities were in fact armed criminals, not innocent people that police shot because of bigotry or just for kicks. Police brutality and racial profiling are serious problems. I recently urged my fellow libertarians to devote more attention to the latter. But the scale and severity of them (at least the former) are far less than much of left-wing public opinion believes.\n\nTo Yglesias' discussion of left-wing misinformation on climate change, I would add that, relative to conservatives and moderates, left-wing Democratic voters are also most likely to oppose nuclear power , by far the most effective \"clean\" energy source . It should not be hard to see how the combination of catastrophism and opposition to nuclear power is likely to strengthen support for a range of terrible policies.\n\nThe two issues Yglesias identifies are just the tip of a much larger iceberg of left-liberal political ignorance and susceptibility to misinformation. Other examples include Barack Obama's highly successful use of lies (\" if you like your health care plan, you can keep it \") to sell the Affordable Care Act to the public, disproportionate left-wing susceptibility to 9/11 \"trutherism\" (a counterpart to right-wing susceptibility to \"birtherism\"), and much else. An important recent study on economic ignorance underlying NIMBYism suggests that at least some of these misconceptions (that developers, rather than zoning regulations are responsible for high housing prices) are particularly prevalent on the left. As a longtime supporter of housing deregulation and author of The Rent is too Damn High , Yglesias can surely appreciate the significance of this particular type of left-wing ignorance.\n\nOverall, social science research suggests that susceptibility to misinformation cuts across the political spectrum, and isn't necessarily much greater on one side of it than the other. The fundamental problem is that most voters have little incentive to seek out information about policy issues, or to objectively evaluate what they learn. They are instead rationally ignorant , and often act as biased \"political fans\" rather than truth-seekers. Yglesias is right to highlight that \"[m]ost people really are very poorly informed about politics and policy\" and that this is a deeply rooted aspect of democratic politics. And the problem is exacerbated by the enormous size, scope, and complexity of modern government , which makes it difficult for even relatively conscientious voters to have more than a very superficial understanding of most policy issues.\n\nThe fact that left-wing voters often behave in these ways should not blind us to the dangers of ignorance and misinformation on the political right, of which Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election are just one particularly egregious example. He effectively exploited political ignorance and misinformation in 2016, as well . I think Trump's lies and deceptions are, overall, worse than those of Obama before him, and have caused greater harm. But even if you believe the reverse, you still should not give your side of the political spectrum a pass, or assume that ignorance and misinformation only exist on the other side.\n\nIn many cases, it's possible to argue that ignorance and misinformation isn't causing much harm or are even having beneficial effects. For example, perhaps excessive fear of climate change has the beneficial effect of pushing progressives to work harder on finding a solution. Or perhaps it's a useful counterweight to climate change denialism on the right. \"Miracle of aggregation\" theorists argue that the errors of one side of the political spectrum can offset those of the other, leading the public as a whole to make good decisions.\n\nIn Democracy and Political Ignorance , I describe a number of scenarios where political ignorance can actually be beneficial. But I also explain why such cases are likely to be rare, and why \"miracles of aggregation\" are unlikely to occur in plausible real-world circumstances (though it's easy to construct theoretical models where they happen frequently). If you find yourself attracted to a story in which your own side's ignorance and bias just happens to have beneficial effects, while that of the other side is uniformly harmful, there's a good chance you're being misled by your own biases. At the very least, it pays to be skeptical of such stories.\n\nIn my view , the best approach to addressing widespread voter ignorance and bias is to empower people to make more decisions by \"voting with their feet\" and fewer at the ballot box. Foot voters have much better incentives to seek out relevant information and use it wisely than ballot-box voters do. Yglesias likely has a very different perspective on what should be done. I certainly can't resolve that longstanding debate here. But the beginning of wisdom is to recognize that the problem is widespread and not just confined to the terrible people on the other side of the political spectrum.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The facts simply do not bear out that claim.\n\nYes, we have heard about a horrific series of black citizens killed by police. But over the years, there have been many more white citizens killed by police.\n\nPrecise numbers are not known because, almost unbelievably, no one is keeping track. There is a federal law called the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013, but it has largely been ignored by both states, which are required to report such deaths, and the Justice Department tasked with compiling and analyzing the information.\n\nTo fill the void, in 2015, The Washington Post started keeping track of every on-duty police officer shooting. Let's look at last year's figures.\n\nThere were 1,004 police involved shootings in 2019. Of the 802 cases in which the race of the suspect was available, we see that 371 were white, and 236 were black. Given that blacks make up only about 13.5 percent of the U.S. population, African Americans were disproportionally killed more often than whites. Additionally, as the Post's data shows, black suspects were more likely to be armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the fatal incident.\n\nAs for the oft-repeated claim that police routinely target unarmed black men, this startling fact from the Post's 2019 tally: There were just 10 fatal cases involving a black citizen who carried no weapon. Make no mistake; one case is one too many. But 10 cases in a population of 330 million people is hardly a routine or \"systemic\" occurrence.\n\nNow, let's drill down on those 10 fatal cases. It is undisputed that in five of them, the perpetrator attacked the officer first either during the commission of a crime or as they were being pursued on outstanding warrants. In another case, the officer struggled with a mentally ill man suspected of burglary, and it was determined that his weapon discharged \"accidentally.\" That leaves four remaining cases-and in two of those, the officers were criminally charged. One policeman in Newark, New Jersey, is now charged with manslaughter, and another in Fort Worth, Texas, now faces trial for homicide.\n\nFacts are facts. Street protestors who carry signs about black \"genocide\" or \"white terrorism\" in America are either grossly uninformed or lying for effect. Is there racism in the United States? Without a doubt, I'm sad to say. But last year was the safest year for suspects-black or white-since The Washington Post started tracking police involved shootings.\n\nIt was not, however, the safest for police. Forty-eight law enforcement officers were murdered on the job last year.\n\nIt is high time and positively right for us to question deadly police actions and to demand more accountability from law enforcement. It is also way past time for all citizens-especially minorities-to demand an end to gratuitous police brutality. Police work for us, and we all should be treated with respect.\n\nBy the same token, protestors must come to grips with some harsh realities. The biggest threat to people of color does not come from police; it comes from criminal elements within their own communities.\n\nCrime is generally intraracial. White killers overwhelmingly slay other whites, and the same holds true in black societies. FBI statistics from 2018 concluded when a murder victim was black, 88 percent of the time, the culprit was also black.\n\n\"The truth is, there are some black folk who do bad things. The sad truth is that their victims are most often other black people,\" professor John Hudgins wrote recently in the Baltimore Sun. Hudgins, an African American professor of sociology at Coppin State University, urges other blacks to look within to help end the violence.\n\n\"We must realize that some black people are a much greater threat to other black people than the Ku Klux Klan or the White Citizens' Councils,\" he wrote.\n\nThe scab that hid this nation's racial tension has been torn off. We only heal if everyone accepts responsibility for their prejudices, admits their failures and marches forward in calm solidarity to bring this country together. Otherwise, welcome to the new normal."

      "text": "The Model Who Convinced 167 Classmates and 4 Teachers to Join Ferguson Protest\n\nNEW YORK-Leading hundreds of angry teens in protest of the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers on Monday was a small collective of highly motivated high school students.\n\nShana Buckstad, 17, was part of the group. She alone convinced 167 students and four teachers in her school to walk out.\n\nThe feat earned her a warning Monday from the principal of her school on Governors Island, for possible suspension.\n\n\"You're the one enforcing it in the school and putting our students in danger,\" Shana said she was told. When she got the news, she panicked.\n\nShana is an overachiever who wakes up at 4:30 a.m. She transferred to New York Harbor School in her junior year to learn marine biology.\n\nShe put on a brave face at school where she is student body president, but when she got to her home in Jackson Heights, Queens, she let her anxiety show.\n\nShana, who is also a part-time model and played a small role on Law and Order when she was 14, said, \"My dad was nervous because I've never gotten in trouble.\"\n\nShe then added wryly: \"Besides seventh grade-I had one detention.\"\n\nIn the end she was not suspended, and the principal called it a misunderstanding, she suspected due to media coverage.\n\nNot deterred by the slap on the wrist, later that day, she spoke on the phone with a student protest leader at Bard High School Early College to discuss next week's protest on Dec. 13.\n\nA Staten Island grand jury decided Wednesday not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for placing Eric Garner in a chokehold during an arrest. The chief medical examiner said the maneuver was a factor in Garner's death. The decision means more protests.\n\nAlthough Shana usually works at the Governors Island Alliance every day after school until 7, she said she would leave work early to attend and help lead the 5:30 p.m. Union Square protest Thursday against the grand jury decision.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go against the police ... [but] the youth finally understand the system is corrupt and they're not protecting us,\" she said.\n\nShe is angered by the decisions made by the grand juries in Staten Island and in St. Louis, Mo., not to indict the white officers for killing Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Mo.\n\n\"I couldn't take it. We need to make a statement-ASAP,\" she said.\n\nIt wasn't the first time she has spoken out against social inequity. During the Flood Wall Street protests this year she was arrested for yelling. Police later released her in the early hours of the morning. Because it was too late to go home, she headed straight to class.\n\nIn addition to her job, school cabinet position, and outside modeling and acting work, Shana is also trying to start a dance club at her high school. Girls would often see her dancing in school and wanted to learn from her, so she wanted to give them the opportunity.\n\n\"I haven't heard back from the school yet,\" said Shana, although she submitted her application at the beginning of the school year.\n\nThe anecdote is characteristic of the young woman, whose mother is Haitian Native American and whose father is of Norwegian descent. She is constantly testing the limits of how much she can achieve.\n\nFor two years, she attended Civic Leadership Academy, located in Elmhurst, Queens, only to find the academics did not challenge her enough.\n\nNow a senior at the Harbor School, Shana has to commute 1 hour and 15 minutes, taking a bus, train, and ferry, to get to school in the morning. It wasn't easy to make the transfer either, her school principal had to pull strings to let her in.\n\n\"I really wanted to be part of this school,\" she said, admiring the beauty of the campus. Its large trees, grass, and historical buildings echo the look of many liberal arts colleges, and she is excited by the thought of studying oysters. \"I heard about how we'd be able to work in a lab and in the actual harbor and that's amazing.\"\n\nOver the past summer, she worked two jobs, at a food truck, and handing out maps during an internship for the Alliance. She then asked for a more permanent job during the school year and is now working to get more funding from large corporations for the island by making PowerPoints and attending meetings.\n\nHer schedule grew too demanding and she chose to leave the honors level classes for the regular ones. Still, even with the schedule switch, Shana is still getting home at 8 or 9 every night, leaving her little time for sleep.\n\n\"I put energy into whatever I'm doing at the moment completely,\" she said, \"I mean, it wears me out a lot; that's why I sleep so well at night. But it's definitely worth it, if change is made. It pays off.\"\n\nShe is motivated by hearing her classmates discuss current events rather than the latest parties, knowing it signifies change. It is these kinds of improvements to society that she aspires to, rather than padding her application to college.\n\nIn fact, Shana might not go to college straight after high school. To avoid taking out loans, she is considering continuing her job at the Alliance and taking a new job afterward. But she is also applying and considering state schools in California where she could go scuba diving.\n\nShana, who is polished and wise beyond her years, attributed her mental strength and work ethic partly to a rough year she suffered as she was just beginning high school.\n\nThe day before she started ninth grade, she had an altercation with her parents, resulting in several injuries.\n\n\"I just went to school the next day and I said that I was playing with friends, but they knew that wasn't it,\" she said. School officials decided to send her to foster care and jail her father.\n\nDuring foster care, Shana lived in three homes in several months. In the first home, in Jamaica, Queens, there was a shooting. Someone banged on the door and one of her foster sisters opened it.\n\n\"It was this crazy young boy at the door, with a gun, flailing it around and breaking everything in the living room,\" said Shana. \"He said he was going to kill everyone.\"\n\nUpstairs, she looked down at him thinking she was going to die. Then, she went downstairs to him-and the boy, while crying, put the gun to the middle of her forehead.\n\n\"I came downstairs, because I knew I had to protect the people I call family,\" said Shana. \"I knew I was the only one who could get him to put the gun down.\"\n\nShana was crying too, but she repeated over and over to the boy, \"I'm here for you, don't worry,\" comforting him even as she was scared for her life.\n\nEventually, the boy gave up the gun and embraced her. No one was injured.\n\nHe told her to stay by his side from then on, so she had to ride in the police car with him and sit with him while he received a psychiatric evaluation in the hospital. After that Shana never went back, leaving the home and never visiting the boy again.\n\n\"I was just too scared to go back,\" she said.\n\nFollowing that traumatic incident, she was then moved to a house in Brooklyn with a Hispanic family who cooked delicious food, and a daughter her age. But, while missing her parents and feeling lonely, Shana grew miserable.\n\n\"I don't know why, but I went through a really deep depression,\" she said, \"And I ended up going into the hospital for seven months, because I tried to take my life.\"\n\nShe shared the story in order to help others dealing with similar difficulties.\n\n\"I swallowed a lot of pills and I didn't wake up until two days later, and I was in the hospital with my parents there, and foster parents.\"\n\nBut the trial wasn't over. Shana was then moved back to a therapeutic home in Jamaica. She initially thought the house looked nice, but she was bullied by many girls there who stole her things and made the water freezing cold while she showered.\n\n\"I ran away from there, and that's when I was homeless for a few months because I didn't want to go back,\" she said. The police had a warrant out for her. When they finally found her, she insisted on going back to live with her parents, a request that was approved.\n\nShana said that her parents changed after the whole ordeal. They also realized their daughter had endured suffering beyond her years, and now give her more leeway.\n\nIn spite of everything, Shana said she would never let it hold her back, or make her hate everyone.\n\nInstead, she said she concentrates on \"just self-perseverance.\"\n\n\"I just feel like I have to make myself the person I want myself to be. And not worry about where I came from, or my past.\"\n\nHer attitude has inspired many in her school, including her friend, Katelyn Francisco, 18, who is also a senior.\n\nWhen Shana walked into the classroom on the first day of school junior year, Katelyn thought, \"Who is she? She looks hot.\"\n\nAnd now, after getting to know the girl, Katelyn was influenced to fight for what she believes in too, such as attending the Monday protest despite the disapproving gaze of authority figures.\n\n\"She gives me hope,\" Francisco said, tears forming in her eyes."

Jerrold Nadler Gets in Car Accident Ahead of Barr Hearing: Spokesperson\n\nAttorney General William Barr's testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee was delayed on Tuesday after the panel's chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), was involved in a car accident in Washington, according to his spokesperson.\n\nA spokesperson for Nadler told several news outlets that he was not hurt during the incident and wasn't driving.\n\nNadler's office has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee hearing was originally scheduled to start at 10 a.m.\n\nIn his testimony, Barr was set to accost Democrats in the House for pushing a narrative that President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. Former special counsel Robert Mueller later found that the Trump campaign didn't collude with the Kremlin.\n\nAccording to a transcript of his speech, the attorney general will also say that police killings of unarmed black men, including the incident that left George Floyd dead in May, \"are fortunately quite rare\" across the United States.\n\nBarr is also expected to say that black men are far more likely to die at the hands of other black males in the U.S.\n\n\"The threat to Black lives posed by crime on the streets is massively greater than any threat posed by police misconduct,\" Barr's remarks read. \"The leading cause of death for young Black males is homicide. Every year approximately 7,500 Black Americans are victims of homicide, and the vast majority of them-around 90 percent-are killed by other Blacks, mainly by gunfire. Each of those lives matter,\" according to the transcript.\n\nBarr is also expected to speak about the situation unfolding in Portland, Oregon, where violent rioters have-on a nightly basis-gathered around a federal courthouse and other federal property."

      "text": "At NYC City Hall, Accountability for Police Violence Becomes Refrain\n\nFriction between New York City police and city council members has only grown more visible over time amidst ongoing protests over the grand jury decisions in Missouri and Staten Island to not indict white police officers for the tragic deaths of unarmed black men.\n\nWhether there is accountability for police misconduct and whether police are encumbered by the many watchdog agencies from doing police work, are central questions as protests in New York and the rest of the country continue. That the council and police can't come to a compromise on the answers to these questions only fuels the conflict.\n\nLast week, to the chagrin of New York City's largest police union, city council members asked for additional measures to monitor police conduct.\n\nThese include a request for the Inspector-General of the police department to investigate how cases of police brutality are handled and expanding the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Council members have also staged a protest stating that black lives matter and have several bills in the works for regulating police behavior. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has released a series of statements decrying the council's actions.\n\n\"I am disgusted with the double talk coming out of this City Council,\" said PBA President Pat Lynch, \"They praise police with words and then take actions that clearly demonstrate their true lack of support.\"\n\nAs one of two lone voices of dissent, Bronx Council member James Vacca cautioned his colleagues during a related meeting last month that if passed, much of the legislation \"would mean that this council is inserting itself, in many times, into the day to day operations of the police department.\"\n\nWhile Vacca spoke at the meeting, his fellow council members sitting beside him chatted with each other, checked their phones, and looked bored. Many spoke up adamantly in defense of the proposed legislation.\n\nA growing rift between police and the city council is far from preferable, as protests sink into chaos on occasion, and questions arise over whether the Staten Island grand jury decision should be challenged.\n\nLast week, the council announced a formal request to the newly appointed police Inspector General to investigate how police are dealing with brutality accusations. The Inspector General is a pet project of the City Council's. The office was created at the end of last year to increase public safety, protect civil rights, and build stronger police-community relations, according to Local Law 70.\n\nThe NYPD Inspector General office responded to the request in a statement, \"We look forward to receiving the City Council request.\" The office had already been reviewing use of force, specifically, chokeholds, for several months, the statement revealed, but would not discuss the investigation until completion.\n\nThe council also plans to expand the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) to more locations, to give the public more opportunities to file complaints about police behavior.\n\nPolice union president Lynch dismissed the review board's effectiveness, stating, \"Civilian complaints are not worth the paper they are written on because anyone can file the most baseless, sensational complaint.\"\n\nInstead of taking each complaint at face-value, the board should require complaints to be made with the penalty of perjury, Lynch recommended.\n\nThe CCRB investigates each complaint, including interviewing the accused police officers. Still, all complaints are kept on an officer's record, regardless of if they are proven false.\n\n\"This is one of the most overseen agencies in the country,\" said Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, \"At some point, the department is spending all of its time writing reports to other oversight bodies and it gets harder and harder to get policing done.\"\n\nMany council members have openly protested against police brutality and even staged a \"die-in,\" where they laid on the ground in solidarity with the deceased black men, in the hallway outside a stated meeting in City Hall.\n\nLynch has taken fault with the council members' protest, covered by media. He called it an example of not being a responsible body of government.\n\nFew in the city council speak up in defense of police, while sympathy for protesters and anger over police brutality abound.\n\nMany bills to regulate police behavior have been introduced in the council in the past. Last month, three bills were introduced in particular, which are still under committee review. One would ban the chokehold and another would require officers to ask permission before searching a suspect. A third would require the police department to submit an annual report on the use of force.\n\nWithin the council, two members spoke up on behalf of the police last month: Vacca, the council member in the Bronx, and Eric Ulrich, the youngest council member and the only Republican council member in Queens.\n\nUlrich said of the raw deal police were getting: \"Why we are attempting to demoralize police officers who are already demoralized, who are already underpaid, who are always getting their butts kicked in the news every day, by folks who don't like them to begin with, quite frankly, is beyond me.\"\n\nBoth council members refrained from commenting for this article.\n\nProtests ensued across the country when white police officer Darren Wilson was not indicted for the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael brown, who was black, in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nAnd protests erupted again when officer Daniel Pantaleo also wasn't indicted by the Staten Island grand jury for placing Eric Garner in a chokehold and causing the latter's death.\n\nThe resounding theme to public outrage has been that there is little accountability for police violence.\n\nManhattan Institute Fellow Mac Donald disagreed, stating that the Garner and Michael Brown incidents were outliers in the whole, law-abiding police force.\n\n\"The idea that this is a rogue department is just ridiculous,\" she said. \"Globally, [New York] is viewed as an absolute model of a police agency.\"\n\nNot counting grassroots civilian watchdog groups, New York City police are subject to a litany of oversight bodies, including five district attorneys, federal attorneys, the CCRB, and internal prosecutions."

      "text": "Starbucks #RaceTogether Campaign: An Idea That Failed in Execution\n\nStarbucks Coffee's #RaceTogether campaign to get customers talking about race relations in America has hit a rough patch.\n\nAfter a tirade of negative press and harsh criticism on social media this week, Starbucks CEO and chairman Harold Schultz defended the company's efforts at its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, saying that the company will continue to roll out the year-long campaign with its partner, USA Today. This Friday, the newspaper will begin distributing leaflets with each copy, which include suggestions for conversation starters, such as \"How have your racial views evolved from those of your parents?\" and \"What is America's greatest race challenge?\"\n\nSchultz explained in a video about the campaign that the idea came from employees who spoke out during company forums that were held in the wake of protests in Ferguson, Mo., and New York City, after unarmed black men were killed at the hands of police.\n\nThe company appears genuine in their desire to get more people to acknowledge the realities of racial inequality in this country. But the overwhelming dissent toward the campaign indicates the public isn't buying it. So what exactly went wrong?\n\nPublic relations experts point out that #RaceTogether is a prime example of a well-intentioned idea that was executed poorly. Instead of getting people to talk about race, Starbucks should have explicitly articulated actual goals and actions that reflect their commitment to the cause, said Melissa Arnoff, senior vice president of the public relations firm, Levick.\n\nFor example, Starbucks could pledge to hire more minorities, or collaborate with known organizations that work on race issues to hold local town hall forums.\n\n\"It [the campaign] has to be more defined than, we want to win hearts and minds with a conversation on race,\" said Arnoff via a phone interview. A campaign should be transparent about what it wants to achieve, and have measurable impact-beyond writing a hashtag on customers' coffee cups, Arnoff added.\n\nRace and racism is a complex issue that is both personal and deeply rooted in America's history. While Schultz has said he doesn't expect the campaign to solve the problem of racism in America, Arnoff noted that by starting such an effort, the company is obligated in some ways to do something about it.  \"No one expects a coffee company to know the answers. But if they do this campaign, they need to talk about how they're going to help find the answers,\" she said.\n\nStarbucks has a history of championing positive social change, such as hiring more military veterans to help them transition to civilian life, encouraging employees to volunteer in their communities, and providing healthcare benefits to its part-time staff.\n\nThe race relations campaign is in line with that history, so Arnoff doesn't see the backlash to #RaceTogether having much long-term effect on the company's reputation.\n\nSimilarly, Stephen Hahn-Griffiths at the global consulting firm Reputation Institute believes Starbucks should have used the campaign as an opportunity to celebrate diversity and inclusiveness within the company, instead of a vehicle to discuss current events.\n\n\"That's turning an unfortunate incident [deaths of unarmed black men] into a political statement. The minute you do that, you're starting to polarize, rather than bring together,\" said Hahn-Griffiths, who is vice president of U.S. strategy consulting at the Institute. Corporations are not the appropriate venues to talk about difficult social-political topics, he explained.\n\nRather than creating conversation, Starbucks could make efforts to foster a work environment that reflects a more diverse America. \"It's not just an HR [human resources] policy or a marketing campaign,\" Hahn-Griffiths said. \"It has to be part of doing business. It has to be an initiative, not just paying lip service.\"\n\nEven when USA Today and Starbucks stores begin distributing leaflets about their campaign, Hahn-Griffiths is skeptical it can do much to improve people's perceptions of the campaign.\n\n\"When it comes to something like diversity, actions speak louder than words,\" he said."

It is time for the leader of this nation, the leaders in the varied political positions that they hold, the people, we as artists-all of us come together as a united people of these United States of America.\n\n\"What I want you to know is that we are in a race, we here, all of us here, a race against time ... [so] it's time for all the leaders, all the people, all of us to come together in the spirit of unity so we can move this world to a positive form.\"\n\nAfter performing several of his famous hit songs with his band, the 67-year-old musician performed a version of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" on harmonica-on one knee.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, many in the crowd joined Wonder in kneeling.\n\nWonder knelt in solidarity with various sports figures who have chosen to protest racial inequality by kneeling during the national anthem of at the start of their games.\n\nThe trend began when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the anthem in 2016 to protest the acquittal of white police officers who shoot unarmed black men.\n\nWonder's remarks in Texas echo what he said in an interview with celebrity website TMZ.\n\nWonder told TMZ, \"People want to be respected-the Constitution's about everyone being respected. It's about stopping all this-putting one group against the other group.\"\n\nHe said that kneeling during the anthem didn't mean disrespect to the flag. \"People have died for the flag-everyone, every culture, every ethnicity-so it's not about not valuing the flag.\"\n\nWonder also took a knee during his performance at the 2017 Global Citizen Festival in New York's Central Park on Sept. 23, 2017.\n\nWith the help of his son Kwame Morris he knelt down on stage before saying a prayer for \"our planet, our future, our leaders of our world\".\n\n\"Tonight, I'm taking a knee for America,\" Wonder told the audience. \"Not just one knee, but both knees in prayer for our planet, our future, and leaders of our world.\n\n\"Our global brothers and sisters, I didn't come here to preach, but I'm telling you, our spirits must be in the right place all the time.\"\n\nMany people have tried to recast the #takeaknee movement as disrespectful of America, the flag, and U.S. veterans.\n\nAs Wonder reiterated, the protests are designed to call attention to racial inequality, and specifically to the number of unarmed and unresisting black men shot by white police officers. Many of these incidents have been caught on video, and in almost every case the white officers have been acquitted.\n\nKneeling during the anthem is a powerful gesture of protest precisely because it touches such important symbols: the flag, the anthem itself, and America's history of honoring the flag and associating the flag with fallen soldiers.\n\nBecause each person interprets symbols differently, it is easy for people to confuse the meaning of the protests with the form of protest.\n\nThe protests have apparently reduced attendance at NFL games during the 2017 season."

Like many Americans, he's anxious for change.\n\nHe says it's not happening quickly enough.\n\n\"I'm not here to ramp on America, that's not me,\" James told the Associated Press on Monday. \"I'm not a politician, but I've lived this life and I've got a family and what scares me is my kids growing up in this society right now, where innocent lives are being taken and it seems like nothing is being done.\"\n\nJames, who delivered an NBA title to title-starved Cleveland earlier this summer, spoke passionately about his concerns for his children's future and other social topics to the AP and during a wider interview session as the Cavaliers held their first media day as defending champions.\n\nJames said plans to stand during the national anthem and said he supports San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, whose decision to kneel has sparked a heated national debate.\n\n\"I'm all in favor of anyone, athlete or non-athlete, being able to express what they believe in in a peaceful manner and that's exactly what Colin Kaepernick is doing and I respect that,\" James said. \"When I'm passionate about something I'll speak up on it, so me standing for the national anthem is something I will do. That's who I am, that's what I believe in. But that doesn't mean I don't respect and don't agree with what Colin Kaepernick is doing.\n\n\"You have the right to voice your opinion, stand for your opinion and he's doing it in the most peaceful way I've ever seen someone do something,\" James said.\n\nThe three-time champion admires how Kaepernick has continued an important conversation James and his friends Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul helped further in July when they took the stage together at the ESPYs, ESPN's annual awards show, and decried violence against unarmed black men. The foursome also encouraged athletes to do more to support local police and improve communities.\n\nKaepernick's protest has prompted some athletes to follow him and kneel or raise a closed fist during the anthem. James says he is troubled by criticism overshadowing the reasons behind the demonstrations. He said things don't seem to be improving, as evidenced by recent shootings captured on video in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"Obviously, I know things don't happen overnight, but it doesn't seem like there is any change,\" he told the AP. \"We just want the conversation to continue to be, 'Who are our leaders? Who are our true leaders that are going to help us change what's going on?' Everyone is looking for that and no one knows.\"\n\nJames recognizes he doesn't have the answers to very complex problems, but he's proud of his role in getting people to talk about them.\n\n\"We just wanted the conversation to continue to go, to understand that police brutality and killings and things of that nature of innocent people, it's not the answer,\" he said.\n\nA father of three, James has been disturbed enough by recent shooting to fear the day his 12-year-old son,LeBron Jr., gets a driver's license and can be out on his own.\n\n\"You tell your kids if you just apply and if you just listen to the police that they will be respectful and it will work itself out,\" he said. \"You see these videos that continue to come out, and it's a scary-ass situation that if my son calls me and says that he's been pulled over that I'm not that confident that things are going to go well and my son is going to return home.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old superstar takes personal pride in raising awareness among his peers on social causes, understanding the power of his fame. Through his foundation, James has given children in his hometown of Akron and elsewhere educational opportunities and more.\n\nHe's not recruiting others to help, but hopes his actions can inspire.\n\n\"I'm not here to ask anybody else to do any more,\" he told the AP. \"Guys have a lot going on. I feel like I'm doing all I can do - and more - to be in my community, to give back to my community, to lend my hand with my foundation with all the kids and just letting them know that there is a brighter tomorrow and America is great. I'm doing as much as I can with these kids who look up to me.\""

      "text": "Protesters Block Terminal, Traffic at Minneapolis Airport\n\nMINNEAPOLIS-A large protest that started at the Mall of America quickly migrated Wednesday to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where demonstrators blocked roads and caused significant traffic delays.\n\nAirport officials said access to one of two terminals was blocked, which also caused backups on nearby roads. Some protesters took a light-rail train to the airport after the nation's largest mall was closed by police.\n\nHundreds of protesters with Black Lives Matter abruptly walked out of the suburban Minneapolis mall shortly after a rally began Wednesday afternoon, chanting, \"What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!\" Organizers were trying to draw attention to Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old black man who died last month after being shot by Minneapolis police responding to an assault complaint.\n\nStores closed their gates, kiosks were covered and even Santa left his sleigh shortly before protesters gathered at the massive shopping district on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Numerous signs were posted on mall property, saying no protests were allowed-including a long message on a screen in a central rotunda between two Christmas trees.\n\nPolice quickly closed the mall's main entrances and urged onlookers out, threatening arrest, and protesters moved toward a light-rail train station that allowed quick access to the airport a few miles away.\n\nA similar demonstration at the mall last December drew hundreds of demonstrators angry over the absence of charges following the police killings of unarmed black men in New York City and Ferguson, Missouri. Stores in the mall had to close, and dozens of people were arrested.\n\nThe massive retail center in the Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington houses an amusement park and more than 500 shops spread across four floors, attracting shoppers from around the globe.\n\nNeither mall officials nor Bloomington police said what security measures they put in place to prepare for the protest, though special event staff members were searching bags and stationed at every mall entrance. Security guards cordoned off parts of the central rotunda, and officers from several cities patrolled inside.\n\nDozens of stores had closed their gates shortly before the protest started.\n\nThe mall sought a court order blocking the planned protest. A judge on Tuesday barred three organizers from attending the demonstration, but said she doesn't have the power to block unidentified protesters associated with Black Lives Matter-or the movement as a whole-from showing up.\n\nBloomington Police Deputy Chief Denis Otterness confirmed officers would be at the mall, but declined to discuss their plans for handling the protest.\n\n\"We're just not releasing that at this point,\" he said. \"Our number one priority is the safety of everybody out at the Mall of America today.\"\n\nGov. Mark Dayton also told reporters early Wednesday that 30 Minnesota State Patrol officers will be on scene at the local police department's request. He said he sympathizes with protesters' concerns, but he stressed that the mall is private property.\n\nKandace Montgomery, one of three organizers barred by the judge's order, said the group isn't deterred by the ban. She declined to say if she or her fellow organizers still planned to go to the mall, but she said she expects at least 700 people to show up-including some who are prepared to be arrested.\n\nOn one of the busiest shopping days of the year, Montgomery said the retail mecca is the perfect venue for their demonstration to pressure authorities involved in the investigation of Clark's death to release video footage.\n\n\"When you disrupt their flow of capital ... they actually start paying attention,\" she said. \"That's the only way that they'll hear us.\""

I certainly don't accept it as President Trump, and in all fairness, it's not funny, it's not artistic.\"\n\nThe video has also drawn criticism from U.S. Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\n\nRubio, who has spoken of being a fan of hip hop music, said that because of America's history of assassinations \"anything like that is something people should be really careful about.\"\n\n\"I think people can disagree on policy, but we've got to be careful about that kind of thing because the wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea and you could have a real problem,\" Rubio told TMZ.\n\nCalifornia rapper Snoop Dogg, 45, told Billboard he saw Trump as a clown.\n\nThe video, released on Sunday, was intended to address police violence, the incarceration of black people and Trump's bid to impose a temporary ban on people entering the United States from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\"I feel like it's a lot of people making cool records, having fun, partying, but nobody's dealing with the real issue with this .... clown as president,\" the musician said.\n\n(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Frances Kerry)\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights at a gala in New York.\n\n\"Today we can say again in a loud and clear voice that the United States should never condone or practice torture anywhere in the world,\" Clinton told the audience. \"That should be absolutely clear as a matter of both policy and law, including our international treaty obligations.\"\n\nThe remarks marked Clinton's first on the subject since the release of a Senate report last week investigating the CIA's interrogation techniques after 9/11. The report has sparked questions about the appropriate use of force in the war against terrorism.\n\nClinton said that recent world events, including the mass murder of children in Pakistan and the siege in Sydney, Australia, \"should steal our resolve and underscore that our values are what set us apart from our adversaries.\"\n\nClinton said Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968, would agree that it's \"possible to keep us safe from terrorism and reduce crime and violence without relying on torture abroad or unnecessary force or excessive incarceration at home.\"\n\nClinton, a former first lady, New York senator and U.S. Secretary of State, is considering another run for president and is viewed as the likely Democratic nominee if she runs.

You wouldn't have people disrespect our country right now.\"\n\nBut an outright ban on the practice may not come soon, if at all, NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on a conference call on Monday ahead of the two-day meeting starting Tuesday of team owners, players and their union's leaders at a Manhattan hotel.\n\n\"I anticipate a very productive presentation of things we can do to work together,\" Lockhart said. \"Beyond that I don't anticipate anything else.\"\n\nThe league was more inclined to seek a compromise that recognized the players' concerns rather than to compel them to stand during pregame renditions of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" he said.\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started a polarizing national debate last year after refusing to stand during the national anthem. He initially sat during the anthem, then began going down on one knee.\n\nThe kneeling gesture has since been emulated by others in the league - where the majority of players are black - who share his anger at police killings of unarmed black men and boys across the United States and racial disparities in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn a memo sent to teams last week, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league had been working with owners and players to promote the players' political concerns.\n\nKaepernick, who has still not been signed by any of the league's 32 teams through the first six weeks of the NFL's 2017 season, said on Sunday he has filed a grievance against the league's team owners.\n\nThe filing says both the NFL and its owners colluded to deny Kaepernick a job in retaliation for his leadership and advocacy for equality and social justice.\n\n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Christian Radnedge)\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

We stand in solidarity with you, knowing that this is part of a bigger struggle against racism and injustice.\"\n\nTarget CEO Brian Cornell told employees in a note Tuesday that the \"murder of George Floyd last Memorial Day felt like a turning point for our country\" and that the guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial is a sign \"of forward progress.\"\n\n\"As I think about the Minneapolis Police Department denouncing the brutality George Floyd faced, and the disgrace expressed by multiple witnesses, the jury's verdict reassures me that we will not go backward,\" he wrote. \"Sadly, this kind of tragedy did not end last May 25, and our country has a lot of work to do and a long way to go. \"\n\nCornell added that he hopes the \"verdict offers some measure of solace.\"\n\nStarbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said Tuesday's verdict \"is a step forward in accountability\" but also acknowledged that \"there is so much more work to do to address systemic racism in our society and create the change needed to ensure everyone has an equal chance to succeed and thrive.\"\n\n\"[Tuesday's] jury verdict in the murder trial of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin will not soothe the intense grief, fatigue and frustration so many of our Black and African American partners are feeling,\" Johnson wrote in an open letter to employees and customers. \"Let me say clearly to you: We see you. We hear you. And you are not alone. Your Starbucks family hurts with you.\"\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said although the verdict \"represents accountability and an important step towards justice,\" he reaffirmed that it still is \"just that: a step.\"\n\nMembers of Business Roundtable, a nonprofit whose members are chief executives of major U.S. companies, released a statement saying that the country still needs to address racial inequity in law enforcement.\n\n\"Though today's verdict is a step toward justice in this case, unarmed Black men and women continue to die in encounters with the police,\" Business Roundtable wrote. \"To ensure true justice and healing, our country needs to take steps to address its long history of racial inequity in law enforcement.\"\n\nThe group promised to \"work with Members of Congress and the Administration on bipartisan policing reforms that implement national policing standards, and greater accountability, training, community engagement and transparency.\"\n\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra noted that the verdict delivered on Tuesday would not replace the loss of Floyd's life and the loss experienced by his family.\n\nRoz Brewer the CEO of the Walgreens Boots Alliance urged Americans to remember the lessons learned over the past year as Americans have taken to the streets and demanded change.\n\n\"Even with a verdict now handed down, we must never forget what this past year has taught us, and we must always keep alive the memory of George Floyd, and the countless victims who have suffered similar fates,\" Brewer said .\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBlue Shield of California CEO Paul Markovich called Tuesday's verdict evidence of the criminal justice system \"at work.\"\n\n\"By no means is that work anywhere near complete,\" Markovich added. \"But today's verdict is a meaningful step towards establishing a justice system and a society that truly live up to our aspirations.  At Blue Shield of California, we are committed to do our part to help make this dream a reality.  In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers remain with George Floyd's family and friends.  May they find some peace with this decision.\"\n\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith called the decision \"a step forward\" in the ongoing fight against racism and discrimination.\n\n\"Our nation has a long journey ahead before it establishes the justice and equity that Black Americans deserve,\" Smith said in a statement. \"The murder of George Floyd is a tragedy and a crime, and no jury can bring him back to life or reverse the pain and trauma experienced by his family and still felt across the country and around the world. Today's verdict is a step forward in acknowledging painful truths and for the continued cause of defeating racism and fighting discrimination. Our company remains committed to the continued path ahead.\"\n\nIn a Twitter post, Salesforce acknowledged the verdict as a defining and important moment, pledging continued action for racial equality and a more just world.\n\nIn a series of Twitter posts, Burlington, Vt., based Seventh Generation, which manufactures cleaning products, said that it supported defunding the police and investing in systems that build community health and well-being.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nColdplay headlined at Sunday's Super Bowl halftime show, but it was R&B super stars Beyonce and Bruno Mars who delivered the sizzle with a lively, upbeat production that paid homage to previous halftime performers.\n\nKnown mainly for mellow hits, British alt-rockers Coldplay amped up the energy, staging \"Viva La Vida\" on a colorfully illuminated floor surrounded by dancing violinists.\n\nAfter Coldplay crowd-pleasers \"Paradise\" and \"Adventure of a Lifetime,\" a black-leather-clad Mars, who headlined the halftime show in 2014, bounced through \"Uptown Funk!,\" with producer Mark Ronson on DJ decks on stage.\n\nBut all eyes were on Beyonce, who gyrated her way through her latest single \"Formation\" - a power anthem to race and feminism that made a surprise debut on Saturday.\n\nThe music video features powerful images of a flooded New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It also depicts graffiti that reads \"stop shooting us,\" suggestive of the Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged in the wake of killings of unarmed black men, several at the hands of police.\n\nPrior to the game, some fans speculated on social media that Beyonce would deliver a politically charged performance.\n\nBut, partnered with Mars on the football field, the tone of the performance was lighter than the video. They subtly conveyed the themes of \"Formation\" with female dancers dressed in black shorts, crop tops and berets, in what was perceived as an homage to the black nationalist Black Panther Party movement of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nCedric Betts of Millbrae, California, who saw the performance live at the game, said Beyonce's message was clear. \"As black people we have to embrace these moments because it's not often we get them,\" he said.\n\nAn ad immediately following the show announced Beyonce's \"Formation\" world tour beginning in April, her first major tour in three years.\n\nBefore wrapping up one of the signature moments of America's biggest sporting event, Beyonce and Mars joined Coldplay frontman Chris Martin for a quick re-visit to \"Uptown Funk!,\" ending on Coldplay's uplifting ballad \"Fix You.\" Images honored past halftime performers including Stevie Wonder, Black Eyed Peas and the late Michael Jackson, whose military-style wardrobe inspired Beyonce's costume Sunday.\n\nEven for music's biggest stars, the Super Bowl halftime show is the largest stage of their careers, drawing more than 100 million viewers to the live event and lighting up social media.\n\nThis year's halftime show garnered a total of 3.9 million tweets. Beyonce dominated the conversation on social media during the halftime performance, with 1.3 million tweets about the singer according to figures from Twitter. Coldplay followed with 774,000 tweets, while Mars garnered 341,000 tweets. The most-tweeted song was \"Formation.\"\n\nLast year, Katy Perry garnered 3 million tweets during her halftime performance.\n\nAll three acts of this year's performers quickly became top trends on Twitter, with sentiments towards Coldplay's halftime show measuring overall positive, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph, with twice as many positive tweets than negative tweets.\n\n(Additional reporting by Melissa Fares and Anjali Athavaley; Writing by Piya Sinha-Roy,; Editing by Sara Catania and Mary Milliken)\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

      "text": "Ken Burns is the most famous documentary filmmaker in America. He has made 35 films over the past 5 decades on historical and cultural subjects like the Civil War (which is the most streamed film in public television history), baseball, jazz, the Roosevelts, Jefferson, Vietnam, Benjamin Franklin, the Statue of Liberty, Muhammad Ali... and many, many more. But of his most recent film, The U.S. and The Holocaust , he said: \"I will never work on a film more important than this one.\"\n\nEven if you've seen many movies or read many books on the Holocaust, Burns' new film, which focuses on the U.S.'s response to the worst genocide in human history-what America did and didn't do, could have done and didn't, and the way the Nazis derived inspiration from ideas popular in America at the time-is bound to both horrify and surprise.\n\nSo today, on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I talk to Burns about why a filmmaker of American history takes on the Holocaust and what this dark period of history tells us about the chasm between America's ideals and our actual reality. And later, we get into an intense and rich discussion about the responsibilities of telling American history, the uses and misuses of the Holocaust as a political metaphor, and what pitfalls we face when drawing parallels between history and now.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n\nI just listened to Bari's interview with Ken Burns and found it repugnant.  It all but obliterated my respect for, and trust in, Ken Burns as a filmmaker.\n\nBurns waxes poetic about the importance of storytelling to adequately communicate all perspectives on a subject.  He is not the first to make this point, and I agree.  Our culture is based, to a great extent, on the perpetual telling of stories.  He also adds this: \"The writer Richard Powers...said, 'The best arguments in the world won't change a single person's point of view.  The only thing that can do that is a good story.'\"\n\nKen Burns proves this is the case in this interview, in which he repeatedly cherry picks stories to advance his own political agenda, without making even a nod to the competing stories or, for that matter, the \"best arguments.\"\n\nHere's a remark that caused me to stop the recording and rewind to make sure that I had heard it correctly:  \"Is there murder in the United States by the State in the biggest and broadest sense of that word, against African-American citizens?  Yep!  And it still goes on to this day.\"  To Ken Burns it doesn't matter that the data contradict this.  The George Floyd story evidently looms large in his mind, and it's irrelevant to him that only about 15-20 unarmed black men are killed by police each year, and about double that number of unarmed white men.  Pedantic individuals can debate about whether or not those numbers are proportional to overall population, or how they compare to relative police encounters, but it doesn't matter.  The numbers are TINY relative to the population and are indicative of nothing more than a few random, inexcusable tragedies.  There is no valid statistical information in them, but that doesn't matter to Mr. Burns....because he's got his \"story\" and he's sticking with it.\n\nIt gets a lot worse as the interview continues.  Burns evidently uses the last three minutes of his production to exploit as many parallels as he can between the Holocaust and actions of people he doesn't like in 2023... and they're all on his opposite political side.  This is a common practice among Progressives:  Anyone who doesn't toe the Progressive line is a \"Nazi.\"  George W. Bush is a Nazi, Mitt Romney is a Nazi, Ron DeSantis is a Nazi, and, of course, Donald Trump is a Nazi, and the conservative members of the Supreme Court are all Nazis.\n\nMr. Burns has the comic audacity to state that drawing a direct line between the Holocaust and Donald Trump is \"not political.\"  He talks about the \"authoritarian playbook\" and mentions one firing in the state of Florida, completely ignoring the scores of firings and cancellations being promoted under Leftist, \"Woke\" philosophy.  No one is more aware of this hypocrisy than Bari, and I'm disappointed that she did not challenge him on this point.\n\nTo Burns, nothing HE says is political.  It only becomes political is someone challenges him.\n\nI had been looking forward to watching \"The U.S. and the Holocaust,\" but now I don't know if I can trust anything Burns has to say.  He has made it clear that he deliberately chooses the stories that suit him and will present them as fact.  He has undermined his own credibility and integrity, and I can no longer assume that anything he tells me is not just pushing a narrative.\n\nHaving lost scores of relatives in the Holocaust, I don't need to be convinced that Adolf Hitler was a murdering tyrant, but if Ken Burns tells me Hitler was a murdering tyrant, I'm not sure, at this point, that I would believe him without checking elsewhere first.\n\nJohn L\n\nIn defense of Bari not pushing back harder: If she doesn't give free platform for people, they won't do interviews with her and don't reveal themselves for who they are and what their agendas are. Now we know Ken Burns' intentions. Thank Bari and share far and wide for as long as we are still allowed freedom of speech.\n\nNo posts"

Now we know Ken Burns' intentions. Thank Bari and share far and wide for as long as we are still allowed freedom of speech.\n\nI just listened to this and so disappointed in Ken Burns and his inability to see the Holocaust as the realization of antisemitism and uniquely awful for Jews.  His need to try and tie the Holocaust to his misrepresentation of Florida's laws about teaching sexuality to young children and his repeated references to Fox News - just so awful. I have no words.    This has completely changed my view of Burns and his work and how he seeks to promote his political agenda.\n\nI think he missed a few indigenous tribes; but he proved to me what a virtuous human being he is - a model to strive to be.\n\nWill watch this.  Think Bari tried a couple times to push back and Burns just ignored the question or talked around it.  Really enjoy her stuff but she should have pushed Burns a little harder at the end.\n\nBarri\n\nI truly enjoyed the first 35 to 40 minutes of that presentation. I was left rather angry with the last 20 minutes or so. It's impossible for anyone to be 100% fair in treating both sides of our current binary political team system.  I am no Trump supporter. But the cavalier approach to governor DeSantis and his political decisions was informative of how left leaning Ken Burns is. I was surprised that she didn't challenge him on that. You generally embrace these difficult discussions. He got a free pass and got a couple of left jabs in.   I think you can be better whether they are punching from the right or punching from the left.\n\nAt about minute -14 Burns says: \"When somebody disagrees with you and your fire them, ...\"  of what do you think.  When I heard him say this I thought of cancel culture, the most powerful religious force in our society today.  But not Burns, he thinks of someone fired for plausible cause by DeSantis.  Perhaps Rebekkah Jones, fired in Florida for a history of violating DOH policy. Or perhaps Andrew Warren, the Tampa Bay prosecutor fired by DeSantis for ostentatious selective enforcement of the law.  Of course, Burns vigorously promotes a partisan political agenda, it's obvious, and he's willing to twist history to support his agenda.  I dramatically lowered my expectation that he's a remotely reliable documentarian.\n\nBurns repeatedly trots out this tired trope that Trump rhymes with Hitler.  I think that Trump rhymes better with the Gracchi brothers but your ear may hear things differently.  More importantly, what is the most powerful authoritarian forces in our society?  Take the anti-semitism on which his documentary focuses.  Yes, we have some ridiculous white supremacists and we have the occasional (too frequent) white Nazi attacking a synagogue.  But we also have frequent attacks on Jewish people by black haters aligned with the left, the Crown-Heights pogrom inflamed by the still popular Al Sharpton, and the casual anti-semitism of Ilhan Omar, a duly elected US Representative.  Which source of anti-semitism is most powerful in our society today?  In college classes some students still read Mein Kampf, do you think they read it with the same adulation and expectation of insight that they read the anti-semite writer James Baldwin?  Who is more persuasive in modern America?\n\nAlas, one could go on and on about the obvious failures of perception Burns demonstrated in the interview.  Sadly, I now have to revisit my opinions about his other documentaries with my new much-lowered assessment of his capabilities.\n\nAnything that is promoted by Public Television is going to be slanted to the left. Too aggravating to bother watching.\n\nIt infuriates me that we are forced by taxation to support programming that is so blatantly biased.\n\nI guess we can give Burns credit for admitting he's a story teller, not a historian. Must be nice to be able to dismiss all those troubling facts and arguments that get in the way of a good story. ...Lord he was difficult to listen to but it served to shine a light on the left's thinking these days, not that it surprised me. So self aggrandizing and so dismissive of any accountability. So disappointing. And slippery, my God that man is slippery.\n\nBari: can you interview someone else to rebalance this discussion? I sensed that you wanted to push back harder but pulled your punches... I hope that is true..?\n\nBurns' statement that the US government is murdering blacks today was especially infuriating.\n\nOnce upon a time he made a great documentary about the Civil War. since then, not so much.\n\nI agree with all of the previous comments.  I came home after listening to the podcast today and thought I had to write a comment for the first time because I was so disappointed with how you handled Ken Burns and the subject matter.  Looks like I wasn't the only one and I don't have much to add.  I knew he was a big lib but I hoped for an even-handed look at a very difficult subject.  Didn't happen.  You pride yourself on your journalistic ability to cut through the partisan bullshit, on both sides.  That's why I listen.  Boogie Man Trump again.  Doesn't matter what he accomplished with the Abraham Accords.  Oh no, that's another film.  He'd never make that one.  I will never watch another of his films now that I know he has an agenda and I'll have to consider whether to continue with my subscription.  What a shame.\n\nI appreciate Bari for airing people with a wide range of viewpoints but am very disappointed that she didn't push back against Burns' overtly political and disproportionate conflation of Nazi atrocities with present-day conservative leanings. While the story he tells deserves to be heard, he destroys his own credibility by embracing tired, old, cartoonish caricatures of present-day Republicans and others who support the humane and sensible enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nThe media too often conflates the really horrible ideas held by the Nazis, with their model of government, which we describe as fascism.  Yes anti-semitism is horrible and it was practiced by Nazi fascists.  It is also practiced by a fringe minority of white supremacists in this country; but they are not fascists.  Idiots yes, fascists no.  Fascism is a type of government in which several supposedly separate entities work together, \"bundled\" to a common purpose.   Such actors include the state, the press, and corporations.  By definition a minority faction of any sort cannot be fascist.  Ironically, in this country, the organization that comes closest to fascism is the Democratic Party, in concert with the mainstream media and social media, and a significant number of \"woke\" corporations.  Indeed it is only the republican minority that keeps these \"democratic\" authoritarians from running rough shod.  See:  the lockdowns following covid in blue states.\n\nAll this hand wringing about Trump and \"right wing\" conspiracy makes me puke.  Bari should have pushed back against this garbage.\n\n\"I'm just the storyteller, the onus is on you, the listener\" just feels like a huge cop out. I knew what I would get before I hit play, I just wish Bari would have pushed back more. Perhaps she was just trying to avoid more random bizarre tangents about the state of Florida?\n\nKen Burns is one of my favorite storytellers.  I have watched with interest many of his documentaries.  I appreciate that this project did a deep dive into a history there is still, after all that has been written and documented, room for more examination.  This includes the perspectives that influenced how and to what degree the US intervened.  I am sure that I am not well versed in America's attitudes at the time.\n\nHowever Mr. Burns blatant political bias revealed in this interview, and his tangling of the holocaust with today's current events left me wondering how much I could trust what he has included in the story.   A shame really, that what could otherwise have been an important reveal of a different perspective on the holocaust, he chose to inject his world (US) view of the facts as he sees them.   This is one of his documentaries that I plan to skip.  And given what he revealed as his POV, I  will watch his other documentaries with a more critical eye.\n\nThat Ken Burns is a brilliant filmmaker is without question.  The interview was troubling, though, as he reaffirmed his elitist, unctuous credentials.  He correctly points out instances of authoritarianism on the right, but conveniently ignores the issue of authoritarianism and anti-free speech behavior on the left:  Government agencies during COVID;  Big Tech's partnership with the White House to suppress free speech; Transition of legacy media from reporting to narrative; Speech codes at universities, etc.   All of this leads one to wonder:  Is Ken Burns shining a light on an important and tragic historical event, or is he leveraging this as a cudgel to advance his polemic political view?\n\nBrilliant filmmaker?  Well you  could say the same about Leni Riefenstahl I guess.    I find Burns to be a very accomplished propagandist    He should stick to actual history."

If they can't open clinics use the money to help get them to facilities out of their states.\n\nSorry about that 🤣😂 for some reason I thought you said you were a man.  I prefer the old message of people on the left which was that abortion should be safe, legal and rare.  Todays message is whenever a woman wants to for whatever reason.. it is a very extreme message.I have 4 children and no one can tell me they were without humanity before birth.  At some point, the fetuses interests should matter. We care if a mom drinks or does drugs which seems inconsistent with my body my choice.  Even if a woman does not know she is pregnant at 6 weeks, she knows she had unprotected sex.  This is not morality police, it is respecting different choices that other Americans make. In all the States that will limit Abortion, women have the vote.\n\nIt is understandable that the author sympathizes with the other 27 year olds circumstances but, these pregnancies did not just happen.  Adults need to own the choices they make and the consequences of those choices. Her children had no choice.  Kaitlin made choices and now her life is not her own anymore it is about her children. They have no voice  and they have no choice.\n\nSomething I don't think I'll ever be able to understand.... I'm in my 27th year as an L&D nurse on a high risk OB unit in a large city. As far as I can tell, 99 percent of my coworkers are enraged by the overturning of R v W. They talk about it constantly and absolutely assume that everyone around them feels the same way. Prior to the announcement of the ruling many of the physicians I work with have been traveling to cities in red states to perform abortion procedures on babies up to 24 weeks. I think they view this as community service.  Local newspapers wrote stories on these local \"heroes \". They fly back home, come to work, and talk about the \"community service\" they performed. Then they deliver another woman's 24 week baby born very  early due, usually, to preterm labor that can't be stopped. The NICU team pulls out all the stops to resuscitate and care for this baby. They are referred to as the \"million dollar babies\". Very often the baby survives and goes home to their family. Usually the only difference is that one of the babies was wanted and the other wasn't. Why does a baby have to be wanted to be able to be allowed to live? How do those doctors do both of those things? So far I have found no way to understand. Very privately, when the Supreme Court decision was announced when I was circulating in the operating room and heard yet again the cry of a newborn, relief washed over me.\n\nInteresting article. I see Suzi working hard to try to draw parallels between she and Kaitlyn, but there really aren't many. As a result, her conclusion is unconvincing and the article falls flat for me. I take serious issue with this line, in particular:\n\n\"Because this woman who could be me lacks the few hundred dollars for transport, childcare, and the abortion itself, she may end up having a child she doesn't want and doesn't feel she can care for.\"\n\nWrong. Because this woman didn't have the opportunity to learn (perhaps she was never taught, or she chose to reject any wisdom given to her by friends or elders), she continued to have unprotected sex and repeat the same choices that led to her having her first child. Then second. Now possibly, third. These are living human beings she is now responsible for, and we're supposed to believe that she's in this predicament because of a low paying job, high gas prices, the town she lives in. While all of those factors expose the stark differences between Kaitlyn and Suzi - and with it, class differences - those are not the reasons this young woman is now pregnant again, unmarried to the father of the child, stuck, and overwhelmed. Regrettably, it's more likely lack of self control, not much hope for a different future in the long term, lack of intelligence, an unwillingness to put personal or sexual desires on hold until she betters her life for herself and current children, etc.\n\nSuzi shows compassion for Kaitlyn, and likely that makes her feel good. But she also shows what a bubble she lives in by not thinking too deeply about the real differences between herself and Kaitlyn.\n\nI'm pro-choice but have zero sympathy for women who put themselves in these situations because they willingly refuse to use birth control while continuing to be sexually active. I'm sorry, Kaitlyn had not one, but TWO IUDs removed, then chose to have unprotected sex with some bro who lied about having a vasectomy?\n\nWhen she got pregnant and decided to abort the pregnancy she essentially used abortion as a form of birth control. There's no other way to see it. She was not on birth control that \"failed,\" she didn't need an abortion for medical reasons. She needed an abortion to get her out of the mess she made by not taking responsibility for her reproductive health. She even notes that she had postpartum depression as a justification for not wanting to endure another pregnancy/birth. I would think this, plus already having two kids she cannot afford to feed, would be motivation enough for an adult women to do everything within her power to avoid becoming pregnant. And yet, she wasn't even trying to use birth control. She just acted on faith that her casual sex partner was being forthcoming, which is not exercising autonomy over one's life.\n\n50% of women who have an abortion aren't on any form on birth control (according to the Guttmacher institute) and 1/4 of women having abortions have previously had one. Most have already had a child, too, so they should have a basic understanding of the female reproductive system.\n\nWomen need to stop acting like victims who have no agency, stop \"hooking up\" unless you have an IUD, and take advantage of the limitless free and effective birth control options that are available through non-profits like Planned Parenthood. Abortion should be safe, legal, and RARE.\n\nBelated constructive criticism.\n\nIf you're looking to persuade the gettable, you probably missed both.\n\nIf you're looking for a piece that will be emotive, (not reasoned) for some, OK.\n\nFirst, how persuaded would you be by a title \"The babies who live and those who are killed\" ? Probably not much, right? Yours is the mirror image of that.\n\nSecond, framing it as the pregnant woman being a victim of a male is pretty unoriginal. And not very representative. And gonna lose some people. But, I understand the framing works for some people. But, you're gonna lose a lot of us with that.\n\nThird, my understanding is the vast majority of abortions are underclass women who either don't use BC or don't use it well.  And use abortion as a backstop. Your story would be more accurate if the mother was one of these, but it would certainly lack it's emotive power, no?  Facts tend to do that.\n\nYour story is pretty typical of the rhetoric used to whip up young white women. Who generally use BC, and use it well. And if that's what you want to turn out, hey it's yours and Bari's substack. But, if you're trying to help persuade people or solve the problem, you'll have to accurately portray things. I get it that any criticism (or even advice) of underclass black women is fraught these days. But, if that's where the bulk of abortions are, then that's where the discussion needs to be too.\n\nFeedback welcome.\n\nThen abortion will have to be an option but not more than twelve weeks, if the children were siblings not sure if they were twins but if siblings tell u the history of the mother there in lies the problem but Democrats don't want this problem solved they want us to throw federal dollars at these clinics which we do instead of better prevention laws which probably won't receive as much money why would the Democrats rock the boat who would want to stop the $$$ pouring in\n\nOk. Worried about sharing nude photos? She's a single mother of 2 children. One with very special needs. What is she thinking? How about focusing on her children and putting her sexuality on hold for a while? I am not falling for her story of being a victim. If women want the right to be in charge of their bodies, then she is not their poster child.\n\nAfter George Floyd's murder we had very much needed national conversation, even a convulsion, over police misconduct in this country. It didn't matter that the number of unarmed Black men killed by police that year was 18, every life is precious. A year earlier I watched an exchange between Pete Buttigieg and a pro-life Democrat primary voter in Iowa. She was pressing him on his position on third term abortions performed in this country without a medical necessity, i.e., for the social, family or emotional health of the mother. Buttigieg was very put off by this line of questioning, finally whining \"well, it's only 6,000 abortions a year and you don't know what that woman is going through. Any one who has felt an infant give happy kicks when you hum to them through the mommy's tummy wall knows there is another person who's voice is not being heard in Buttigieg's moral universe.\n\nI think what is going on for Kaitlyn is tragic, but not as tragic as the alternative for the thousands of seven or eighth month babies that will not be snuffed out because their mom broke up with her boyfriend or was a habitual procrastinator or wanted to run off to be a death row groupie.\n\nLet me expand a little. I think access to health care, especially contraceptive care, should be fundamentally improved in this country. I think the amount of research done on finding a male contraceptive should be tripled at least. I do not support restrictions on abortion at seven weeks or eleven weeks. But women like Kaitlyn are the only \"victims\" the MSM, even this blog, will ever consider. If we were living in 1854 debating abolition on this forum the only victims would be the poor persecuted slave owners being treated as an oppressed minority - there would be another group of people who's voice would not be heard.\n\nYou are quite correct .... Money is a very limiting factor in how much freedom we have.\n\nI get where you're going, I think. On my part, there was nothing meant about sterilization, which is a completely personal decision. I simply made the point that such a personal decision should not have anything to do with whether the nation's fertility rate is rising or falling. It is the individual's decision, end of story. If we are a nation of free individuals (as conservatives so often remind us), that freedom is threatened by every law that tells us what we can and cannot do, whether those laws have to do with, for example, limiting the amount of carbon a corporation (given individual status by the court) allowed in the air or whether or not an individual may or may not obtain an abortion or contraceptives or how many and what types of guns we may possess. But our individual freedom is ultimately limited by the fact that we cannot do anything that infringes in someone else's freedom. When it comes to abortion, the crux of the problem lies with one question:  what constitutes a person, an individual? Until we can answer that question, we cannot resolve the great abortion debates.\n\nI have never understood why abortion is such an uber-holy, sacrosanct, untouchable icon for the political Left. It's the hill they have chosen to die on. I would love to have a conversation with a confirmed abortion advocate about this, but it would have to be honest and rational, and I despair of that possibility. Their most public voices are universally dishonest and disingenuous.\n\nThe governor of Minnesota has declared that his state will always defend women's \"reproductive rights\". What does that mean? Does overturning Roe prevent women from reproducing if they want to? Does it compel any woman to reproduce if she doesn't want to? Ridiculous notion, but it sounds righteous, and that's really the point, isn't it?\n\nSome link abortion to \"reproductive health\". If a woman is pregnant, her reproductive health is in good shape. How will having an abortion improve her \"reproductive health\"? Another ridiculous notion.\n\nThen there are the signs that say \"Abortion is Health Care\". What?! Is a pregnant woman ill, to be cured by having an abortion? All dishonest, all disingenuous, all lies.\n\nThey call themselves \"pro-choice\", but the issue is not and never has been about choice. It is and always had been a matter of life and death. All human life begins in the womb. No one really disputes that. It's true. Abortion advocates simply believe that some lives ought to end in the womb, and they further believe that they are just the people who are best qualified to decide whose.\n\nAbortion advocates hate it when pro-life folks say that abortion is murder, and who can blame them? No one wants to be associated with murder, especially murder of the defenseless and innocent. But the only way they can distance themselves from that connection is to define the precise moment at which life does begin. In the womb, remember?\n\nBut they can't do that. Yet, the burden of proof is still on them. Until they can, the only truth that remains is that abortion is murder.\n\nIt's. Just. That. Simple.\n\nThat's the problem with so many people who support outlawing abortion; they're fine with it because they don't think they'll ever need it - hell, there's plenty of that sentiment right here in the comments.  Thank you for sharing this story to give some people (at least, those with a shred of empathy) at least a sense of how trapped millions of women are feeling right now (and in a country they're told is \"free\").\n\nRe: J6, when there is no cross examination, the key \"witness\" wasn't there and is reporting hearsay--not admissible in a court--and the entire story is refuted by several individuals that were actually there during the alleged encounter, it might be a nefarious narrative rather than a revelation. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/29/secret-service-agent-testify-trump-wheel-jan-6\n\nI gotta say, this is not one of my favorite Common Sense articles. And I'm pro-choice.\n\nThere is always anectodal, emotional evidence on one side of any complex issue. Sure, the new Louisiana law is going to make Kaitlyn's life hard. Bad timing for her! Kaitlyn was also not as proactive about reproductive issues as Suzy was, which is another difference between them aside from the state they live in.\n\nBut anecdotes aside, we should be talking about what next steps should be taken now that it has been decided that Roe was never constitutional (which I agree with, in my limited understanding). I agree with Suzy that Kaitlyn's in a tough position and support her efforts to get an abortion in this situation. But instead of emotional hand-wringing, how about some concrete ideas about where we go from here?"

      "text": "If you wonder why I-a woman of color, an African, a former Muslim, a former asylum seeker, and an immigrant-look at the antics of today's anti-Israel, anti-American protesters with such fear and trembling, allow me to explain.\n\nI was born in Somalia in 1969. The country had achieved independence nine years before. But less than a month before I was born-on October 21, 1969-a junior member of the brand-new Somali armed forces seized power with the help of the Soviet Union. The first two decades of my life were shaped by the upheaval that followed that coup.\n\nThe Somalia that gained its independence was a young, optimistic society full of national pride. We had such hope for growth, political stability, prosperity, and peace. But, in a story sadly familiar to many of my fellow Africans, those hopes were dashed.\n\nWhat followed was a nightmare.\n\nFor me it is all captured in the earliest memories of my youth: statues of Mohamed Siad Barre , our dictator, sprung up across Mogadishu, flanked by a trio of dark seraphim: Marx, Lenin, and Engels. This particular communist experiment plunged Somalia into bloodshed, mass starvation, and a 20-year period of suffocating tyranny. I recall my grandmother and mother smuggling food into our house. I also remember the whispering: we felt the state was omnipresent. It could hear everything.\n\nMy father was thrown into prison. His friends-those other pioneers in pursuit of a democracy modeled on America-were either jailed like him or, in many cases, executed.\n\nBy the time I was eight, my family knew we needed to escape. We left in 1977. By 1990, the country had descended into a civil war from which it has never fully recovered.\n\nI never stopped longing for the kind of freedom my father had taught me about. And at the age of 22, I fled to the Netherlands seeking it. There-and later, in America-I discovered what we've come to call \"Western\" values.\n\nThe West's inheritance springs from a peculiar confluence of habits and customs that had been practiced for centuries before anyone branded them as \"ideas.\" But they are principles-radical ones-that have given us the most tolerant, free, and flourishing societies in all of human history.\n\nAmong these principles are the rule of law, a tradition of liberty, personal responsibility, a system of representative government, a toleration of difference, and a commitment to pluralism. Each of these ideas might have been extinguished in their infancy but for the grace of God and the force of their appeal.\n\nPerhaps it is because I was born into a part of the world where these principles were nonexistent that I feel a particular love for them-and an instinct for when they are in danger.\n\nRight now, so many Western nations are under grave threat from the twin forces of cultural Marxism and an expansionist political Islam familiar to me from my youth.\n\nFor a time, many refused to believe that anything was actually wrong. The tide of populism was, they insisted, a momentary manifestation of frustration. The decline of each of our institutions was viewed in isolation, as a problem of poorly selected leadership, which could be corrected after the next election or with a changing of the guard. The sense of hopelessness that people felt was explained away as the temporary consequence of the rapid transition away from industrialism and the ushering in of the digital age.\n\nIn this light, though there were problems, they were distinct from each other and would be corrected in time.\n\nCan any serious person believe this now?\n\nPeople are encountering our current crisis in different ways, though a compelling explanation, let alone a solution, remains elusive. I am reminded of the Buddhist parable of the blind men and the elephant. The story goes that a group of blind men, who have never encountered an elephant before, hear that one has been brought to their town. They go to touch the elephant to work out what it might look like. One man touches the elephant's trunk and thinks it must be like a large snake. Another touches its leg and likens it to a tree. A third who grasps the elephant's tail says it feels like a rope. A fourth presses its sides, and when it does not budge, compares it to a wall. The fifth touches its tusk and thinks it to be like a spear.\n\nEach of the blind men touches the same elephant and comes up with a different interpretation. Although there is truth in each of their assessments, none is able fully to comprehend the elephant in its totality. Those who feel the decline in Western society are like these blind men, encountering the elephant in their own ways and grasping at explanations in the half-light of dusk.\n\nWhen the omni-breakdown burst forth in 2020 with the crises the Covid-19 pandemic and the draconian controls that governments imposed, and the George Floyd riots, most of us awoke from our slumbers and behaved like the blind men, ping-ponging around theories with the tremulous (sometimes furious) chatter that heralds the turning of an age.\n\nAs one of those blind men-and surely I, too, am encountering only part of the elephant-my perception is that we are a society subverted. By this, I do not mean that we are subverted in the sense that a few spies and saboteurs are conducting covert operations, blowing up a bridge or an airfield. I mean we are subverted in a more systematic and totalizing way.\n\nListen to Ayaan read this essay today on Honestly:\n\nBefore I explain who might be doing the subverting, and for what reason, let me first explain what I mean by it. The best description comes from Yuri Bezmenov , who says that this form of subversion is very gradual, but ultimately transformational.\n\nBezmenov had been a KGB agent promoting foreign subversion when he grew disillusioned with the Soviet system. In 1970, he defected to the West-to Greece, then Canada. The rest of his life was dedicated to exposing the secret Soviet apparatus of subversion in the West.\n\nLiving in the West in 1983, Bezmenov gave a lecture in which he explained \"Psychological Warfare, Subversion, and the Control of Society.\" It begins:\n\nSubversion refers to a process by which the values and principles of an established system are contradicted or reversed in an attempt to sabotage the existing social order and its structures of power, authority, tradition, hierarchy, and social norms. It involves a systematic attempt to overthrow or undermine a government or political system, often carried out by persons working secretly from within. Subversion is used as a tool to achieve political goals because it generally carries less risk, cost, and difficulty as opposed to open belligerency. The act of subversion can lead to the destruction or damage of an established system or government. In the context of ideological subversion, subversion aims to gradually change the perception and values of a society, ultimately leading to the undermining of its existing systems and beliefs.\n\nThis kind of subversion is familiar to me because of my background. Somalia wasn't the only African country subverted by the USSR. And those that were warped by Soviet infiltration-such as Ethiopia and Angola-bear the scars to this day.\n\nOne of the key insights Bezmenov expresses about a subverted society is that, for a while, there is only a passing sense that something is wrong. It's a mood-a vibe. I believe that's what many of us have been witnessing for several years now, maybe even as long as a decade or two.\n\nThe pressure makes society rumble like a volcano, quiet one minute and flaring the next. Then, finally-and seemingly suddenly-the revolution bursts into view.\n\nWhen, on October 8, protests erupted across the Western world in support of Hamas-and not the democracy that had been overrun by terrorists-I saw the revolution. When I look at the recent spectacle at Columbia or Yale or UCLA or Harvard or Stanford-students tearing down American flags and raising Palestinian ones; or chanting in Arabic \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\"-it is hard not to see the fruit of this long process. I hear the same when, week after week, the streets of London, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Hamburg ring with cries of \"intifada\" or open demands for a caliphate or Sharia law in the heart of Europe.\n\nHow did it happen?\n\nBezmenov described the subversion process as a complex model with four successive stages, a diagram of which I have provided. These are, in order: demoralization , destabilization , crisis , and finally, normalization .\n\nDemoralization is the first stage and requires the subverters' greatest investment of time and resources. Bezmenov claims the process of demoralization can take between 10 to 30 years, because that is the amount of time it takes to educate a new generation.\n\nThe demoralization process targets three areas of society: its ideas, its structures, and its social institutions. The targeted institutions include religion, education, media, and culture. In each realm the old ways of thinking, the old heroes, are discredited. Those who believed in them come to doubt themselves and their ability to discern reality itself.\n\nThink of the cynicism and selective truth-telling young Americans encounter in most classrooms. You know Jefferson owned slaves, right? You know Columbus killed millions? Again, never mind that Jefferson set us on the path to emancipation, or that Columbus knew nothing about epidemiology. A little learning, as the saying goes, is a dangerous thing.\n\nOnce inside, it is very difficult to escape the mosh pit of civilizational self-loathing. Maybe you can climb to the top for a while by being the white person who hates white people most loudly, or the straight person who goes to the most debauched parades. But most people give up.\n\nThe ultimate intended outcome is that the afflicted willingly embrace self-destructive behaviors and ideas. Thus, all moral constraints can be eschewed in the pursuit of \"just\" and \"virtuous\" causes.\n\nWhat else can explain the daily displays of moral panic attacks masquerading as righteous activism, from the destruction of artwork to self-immolation ? As human life ceases to look inviolable, we might also expect measures like euthanasia to gain steam, not just to help end terminal anguish but to end all manner of non-debilitating hardship. It's no surprise, then, that we are seeing movements speeding ahead for \"assisted dying\" in the U.S., UK, the Netherlands, Canada, France, Ireland, and the rest of the West.\n\nNext, the fundamental structures of society-like the rule of law and social relations-are targeted. For example, demoralization in the rule of law would entail undermining our trust in legal institutions and eroding the basis for legal authority. This could be accomplished by presenting the justice system as corrupt or illegitimate and by sowing distrust in the mechanisms of law enforcement. Think of the movements to \"defund the police\" because of \"systemic racism.\" Or the conviction last week of the front-runner presidential candidate on 34 counts of obvious political charges.\n\nAs a consequence, citizens lose confidence in the administration of justice, paving the way for untold social disorders, including legal nihilism, where people disregard the law en masse.\n\nIn America in 2019, 14 unarmed black men were shot by police-most, apparently, in self-defense. And yet, when polled, most Americans who described themselves as \"very liberal\" estimated the number at 1,000 or more. A fifth thought 10,000 or more. Were the BLM riots, then, any surprise?\n\nTo be sure, this isn't just a progressive problem. Republicans also demonized the Justice Department, the FBI, and members of the judiciary when it suited them. Conservatives are also losing their confidence in law enforcement, in part because of what they see as the lax enforcement of the law as applied toward groups like antifa, Black Lives Matter, and pro-Hamas demonstrators.\n\nThe subversion here appears to be working, with both sides agreeing: there is a two-tiered police and justice system-one set of rules for me, and another for thee.\n\nThe third area-which Bezmenov called \"life\"-includes core social institutions such as family, health, race, population, and labor. Demoralization of the family is probably a familiar concept to us all. It involves promoting ideas that weaken the bonds between members of the family, promoting narcissistic individualism over family unity, creating financial stressors that discourage family formation, acrimony between the sexes, and the replacement of parental authority with the state.\n\nThus, the retrograde practice of polygamy is rebranded as polyamory. The natural human urge to create and nurture new human life is treated derisively by \" DINKS \" with slightly more latte money, or, more seriously, as an irresponsible and selfish choice to make because of climate change. Meantime, parents are told at every turn that they don't know what they're doing-and to defer to the experts instead.\n\nThe result is that not only do individuals feel less attachment to family, the fundamental unit of a healthy civilization, but they even end up detached from society itself. As we now know, the breakdown of family is strongly correlated with the epidemic of mental health crisis and explosive rise in violent crime: 85 percent of American youth in prison come from fatherless homes.\n\nThe goal of demoralization is to gradually degrade the foundations of a healthy society across all domains by erasing moral lines and exploiting preexisting discontents. What a society used to call abnormal and pathological, subversion normalizes. Just consider, for example, our culture's attitude toward pedophiles, now rebranded as \" minor-attracted persons .\" By hijacking the legacy and language of the civil rights movement, nearly any \"marginalized\" group has a vehicle to try to \"mainstream\" deviant behavior. Consider the fact that across civilized societies it is not just \"wrong\" to say that a man cannot become a woman. It is thought to be cruel . So cruel that the Scots have made it illegal .\n\nWhat's striking about the demoralization process is that the law doesn't typically change-at least not initially. Subversion abuses the tolerance of an open culture, forcing the host society to accomplish its aims like a virus attaches to a host.\n\nIn the Soviet case, according to Bezmenov, a successful subverter could come to be employed by a major university and teach a class on communism. When professors, donors, and students raise eyebrows, they get labeled as cranks or retrograde. The subverter responds: \"Who are you to decide what can't be taught?\" Meanwhile, the subverter works to indoctrinate more young and impressionable minds and to secure positions for allies or useful ideologues. If you oppose this, you are asked: \"What do you have against intellectual diversity?\" Or \"Do you oppose free thinking?\" Thus, dissenters are silenced.\n\nOver time, as the subverters come to dominate an institution, they apply institutional pressure. Curbs on academic freedom, the curriculum, and alterations to the hiring process inevitably follow. Think of the novel instruments to enforce uniformity of thought among academics: DEI statements , now a requirement at universities across America. Repeat ad infinitum .\n\nEven in the cases where subversive activity is clearly illegal, such as with destruction and violence during the 2020 riots and at many anti-Israel protests today, crimes committed in service of some larger goal-like \"decolonization\"-are presented as righteous. Decolonization is a word that's become as common these days as social justice . But what does it mean? Gal Beckerman of The Atlantic has written about the Marxist origins of this concept and one of its chief proponents, Frantz Fanon. Fanon, Beckerman writes, is \"the patron saint of political violence,\" and his \"concepts have provided intellectual ballast and moral justification for actions that most people would simply describe as terror.\" Listen to Fanon himself: \"whatever may be the headings used or the new formulas introduced, decolonization is always a violent phenomenon.\"\n\nWhen young people say \"resistance is justified,\" many-if not most-of them believe they are simply standing up for the downtrodden. But the deeper implications of that statement are about justifying the morally reprehensible. How else to explain that at our most prestigious college campuses, students can be found glorifying Hamas terrorists and openly praising North Korea?\n\nAs far as I can tell, we are on our way to being considerably demoralized. If you look at the last few years, standards have declined, and subversive content, like Fanon's, fills the media and our children's curricula from K-12 to college and beyond. By beyond I mean even the Girl Scouts: here's a St. Louis chapter learning to cheer for \"the intifada.\"\n\nDo most elementary school teachers really want to racially stratify fourth graders? No. I think they dislike the racism of the past and want to do what they can to fix it. Since their betters in college told them that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is the way to go, well, so be it. Likewise, I don't think your local high school history teacher wants to bring about a Bolshevik revolution. He has simply been told to replace the focus on 1776 with something from The 1619 Project . So he gets with the times. And on and on and on.\n\nWe have also come to a place where it is difficult for anyone to dissent for fear of incurring the wrath of the adherents-witting or not-of subversion. So people go along, keep their heads down, and try not to make a fuss.\n\nDestabilization is the next phase. This process is considerably shorter, taking anywhere between five months to two years. With demoralization now reaching its full maturity, society is increasingly paralyzed by harsh domestic turmoil across all sectors. Democratic politics take on the character of a vicious struggle for power. Factionalism takes hold. Economic relations degrade and collapse, obliterating the basis for bargaining. The social fabric frays, leading to mob rule. Society turns inward, leading to fear, isolationism, and the decline of the nation-state itself, leading to crisis .\n\nIt is important to understand that, at this stage, the process of subversion is largely self-propelled. What once required active involvement on the part of a subverter has now taken root and grows organically. Then, society ruptures all at once in a rolling series of crises as the full extent of the cancer manifests.\n\nFinally, says Bezmenov, a subverted society enters the normalization stage, which is when the subversive regime takes over, installing its ideology as the law of the land. By then, the enemy has totally conquered the target society-without ever firing a shot.\n\nThe question, of course, is who is doing the subverting. Who is trying to unravel America and the West?\n\nAgain, I am feeling only my part of the elephant, but I can discern at least three forces.\n\nThe first: American Marxists . This category includes old card-carrying communists, red-diaper baby socialists, antifa anarchists, and many of whom we now call woke . Though the Soviet Union collapsed decades ago, the Soviet worldview has found familiar proponents: young Americans and their professors. They are no longer advancing their cause merely through class struggle, but through the fusion of racial, class, and anticolonial struggles. Theirs is now a cultural communism ; they lead subversion through the institutions with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the West.\n\nThe thundering socialists of the past (think of poor Bernie) seemed to earnestly care about the working class. Perhaps they did so naively, but at least they loved the poor. Does AOC? Rashida Tlaib? My former countrywoman, Ilhan Omar?\n\nThe second force is the radical Islamists , who are riding the coattails of the communists to power. A good example is the Muslim Brotherhood and its many tentacles. Of these tentacles, some are openly religious, like the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Muslim Students Association, each with chapters in nearly every American university. Other organizations don a secular mask, like the so-called Students for Justice in Palestine. These groups have become increasingly confident over the past months. Anti-Israel Muslim candidates recently won elected seats in countries like England, where imams talk openly about reestablishing the caliphate in Europe.\n\nThe third force is the Chinese Communist Party . The most obvious avenues through which the CCP has spread subversion in America is through its numerous Confucius Institutes . These organizations have been vehicles for Chinese espionage within major American academic institutions. Then there is TikTok, an addictive social media app controlled by the CCP, which presents Chinese children wholesome, educational content while wreaking havoc on American kids-polarizing them and feeding them anti-American propaganda.\n\nI believe Vladimir Putin is currently waging his own subversion campaign by supporting and advancing the three other forces. That is why I do not place him in one particular category.\n\nWhat unites these enemies ? On the surface, they have little in common. We all know what happens to \"Queers for Palestine\" in the Palestinian territories. Or Muslims in China . We all know what CCP mandarins think of Black Lives Matter activists. Or rather, what they would think, if they deigned to do so.\n\nBut they have wisely chosen the same common enemy: the West.\n\nI am not saying that Bezmenov's formulation explains all that we are seeing. It clearly does not address all the West's problems. But once I immersed myself in his formulation, many of the topsy-turvy developments in our institutions fell into place.\n\nThe widespread acquisition of useless, aggressively ideological degrees in gender and race, or the claims of the possibility of an unlimited number of genders, or the total racialization and \"decolonization\" of our political discourse, or the demands to defund the police, the toppling of statues, the defacing of art, the \"spontaneous\" protests to dismantle our structures, and much else, I now understand as acts of subversion rather than mere expressions of discontent or youthful energy run amok.\n\nIt's important to note that not all activism is subversive. My life would not be possible without the righteous activism of those who fought for women's rights and civil rights. So how to tell the good activism from the bad?\n\nI regret to tell you that there is no easy way. One thing to pay attention to is your gut. Another is your mind: be discerning and skeptical of people recruiting you to their cause. Does their cause ask toleration of you or require compelled speech? Are you being recruited to fight for a cause you know nothing about? Is that cause maximalist and uncompromising; does it glorify violence?\n\nRegardless of whether you agree with my interpretation of events, subversion is a risk to all open societies. As Bezmenov says, subversion is a two-way street. A closed society is immune to subversion because it simply tells potential subverters to leave. Free and open societies cannot rely on this defense.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States was able to forestall subversion because its institutions and people had the necessary antibodies to stave off subversive ideas. Doing so is easier when you have a visible peer as an enemy. But when the Cold War came to an end and we declared victory, we mistakenly thought our enemies laid down their arms and that history had ended-so we let our guard down.\n\nOrwell said that \"To see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle.\" Everyone with eyes to see is now scrambling to do just that.\n\nWhat is at stake in our ability to see plainly?

      "text": "Ken Burns is the most famous documentary filmmaker in America.\n\nI just listened to Bari's interview with Ken Burns and found it repugnant.  It all but obliterated my respect for, and trust in, Ken Burns as a filmmaker.\n\nBurns waxes poetic about the importance of storytelling to adequately communicate all perspectives on a subject.  He is not the first to make this point, and I agree.  Our culture is based, to a great extent, on the perpetual telling of stories.  He also adds this: \"The writer Richard Powers...said, 'The best arguments in the world won't change a single person's point of view.  The only thing that can do that is a good story.'\"\n\nKen Burns proves this is the case in this interview, in which he repeatedly cherry picks stories to advance his own political agenda, without making even a nod to the competing stories or, for that matter, the \"best arguments.\"\n\nHere's a remark that caused me to stop the recording and rewind to make sure that I had heard it correctly:  \"Is there murder in the United States by the State in the biggest and broadest sense of that word, against African-American citizens?  Yep!  And it still goes on to this day.\"  To Ken Burns it doesn't matter that the data contradict this.  The George Floyd story evidently looms large in his mind, and it's irrelevant to him that only about 15-20 unarmed black men are killed by police each year, and about double that number of unarmed white men.  Pedantic individuals can debate about whether or not those numbers are proportional to overall population, or how they compare to relative police encounters, but it doesn't matter.  The numbers are TINY relative to the population and are indicative of nothing more than a few random, inexcusable tragedies.  There is no valid statistical information in them, but that doesn't matter to Mr. Burns....because he's got his \"story\" and he's sticking with it.\n\nIt gets a lot worse as the interview continues.  Burns evidently uses the last three minutes of his production to exploit as many parallels as he can between the Holocaust and actions of people he doesn't like in 2023... and they're all on his opposite political side.  This is a common practice among Progressives:  Anyone who doesn't toe the Progressive line is a \"Nazi.\"  George W. Bush is a Nazi, Mitt Romney is a Nazi, Ron DeSantis is a Nazi, and, of course, Donald Trump is a Nazi, and the conservative members of the Supreme Court are all Nazis.\n\nMr. Burns has the comic audacity to state that drawing a direct line between the Holocaust and Donald Trump is \"not political.\"  He talks about the \"authoritarian playbook\" and mentions one firing in the state of Florida, completely ignoring the scores of firings and cancellations being promoted under Leftist, \"Woke\" philosophy.  No one is more aware of this hypocrisy than Bari, and I'm disappointed that she did not challenge him on this point.\n\nTo Burns, nothing HE says is political.  It only becomes political is someone challenges him.\n\nI had been looking forward to watching \"The U.S. and the Holocaust,\" but now I don't know if I can trust anything Burns has to say.  He has made it clear that he deliberately chooses the stories that suit him and will present them as fact.  He has undermined his own credibility and integrity, and I can no longer assume that anything he tells me is not just pushing a narrative.\n\nHaving lost scores of relatives in the Holocaust, I don't need to be convinced that Adolf Hitler was a murdering tyrant, but if Ken Burns tells me Hitler was a murdering tyrant, I'm not sure, at this point, that I would believe him without checking elsewhere first.\n\nJohn L\n\nIn defense of Bari not pushing back harder: If she doesn't give free platform for people, they won't do interviews with her and don't reveal themselves for who they are and what their agendas are. Now we know Ken Burns' intentions. Thank Bari and share far and wide for as long as we are still allowed freedom of speech.\n\nI just listened to this and so disappointed in Ken Burns and his inability to see the Holocaust as the realization of antisemitism and uniquely awful for Jews.  His need to try and tie the Holocaust to his misrepresentation of Florida's laws about teaching sexuality to young children and his repeated references to Fox News - just so awful. I have no words.    This has completely changed my view of Burns and his work and how he seeks to promote his political agenda.\n\nI think he missed a few indigenous tribes; but he proved to me what a virtuous human being he is - a model to strive to be.\n\nWill watch this.  Think Bari tried a couple times to push back and Burns just ignored the question or talked around it.  Really enjoy her stuff but she should have pushed Burns a little harder at the end.\n\nBarri\n\nI truly enjoyed the first 35 to 40 minutes of that presentation. I was left rather angry with the last 20 minutes or so. It's impossible for anyone to be 100% fair in treating both sides of our current binary political team system.  I am no Trump supporter. But the cavalier approach to governor DeSantis and his political decisions was informative of how left leaning Ken Burns is. I was surprised that she didn't challenge him on that. You generally embrace these difficult discussions. He got a free pass and got a couple of left jabs in.   I think you can be better whether they are punching from the right or punching from the left.\n\nAt about minute -14 Burns says: \"When somebody disagrees with you and your fire them, ...\"  of what do you think.  When I heard him say this I thought of cancel culture, the most powerful religious force in our society today.  But not Burns, he thinks of someone fired for plausible cause by DeSantis.  Perhaps Rebekkah Jones, fired in Florida for a history of violating DOH policy. Or perhaps Andrew Warren, the Tampa Bay prosecutor fired by DeSantis for ostentatious selective enforcement of the law.  Of course, Burns vigorously promotes a partisan political agenda, it's obvious, and he's willing to twist history to support his agenda.  I dramatically lowered my expectation that he's a remotely reliable documentarian.\n\nBurns repeatedly trots out this tired trope that Trump rhymes with Hitler.  I think that Trump rhymes better with the Gracchi brothers but your ear may hear things differently.  More importantly, what is the most powerful authoritarian forces in our society?  Take the anti-semitism on which his documentary focuses.  Yes, we have some ridiculous white supremacists and we have the occasional (too frequent) white Nazi attacking a synagogue.  But we also have frequent attacks on Jewish people by black haters aligned with the left, the Crown-Heights pogrom inflamed by the still popular Al Sharpton, and the casual anti-semitism of Ilhan Omar, a duly elected US Representative.  Which source of anti-semitism is most powerful in our society today?  In college classes some students still read Mein Kampf, do you think they read it with the same adulation and expectation of insight that they read the anti-semite writer James Baldwin?  Who is more persuasive in modern America?\n\nAlas, one could go on and on about the obvious failures of perception Burns demonstrated in the interview.  Sadly, I now have to revisit my opinions about his other documentaries with my new much-lowered assessment of his capabilities.\n\nAnything that is promoted by Public Television is going to be slanted to the left. Too aggravating to bother watching.\n\nIt infuriates me that we are forced by taxation to support programming that is so blatantly biased.\n\nI guess we can give Burns credit for admitting he's a story teller, not a historian. Must be nice to be able to dismiss all those troubling facts and arguments that get in the way of a good story. ...Lord he was difficult to listen to but it served to shine a light on the left's thinking these days, not that it surprised me. So self aggrandizing and so dismissive of any accountability. So disappointing. And slippery, my God that man is slippery.\n\nBari: can you interview someone else to rebalance this discussion? I sensed that you wanted to push back harder but pulled your punches... I hope that is true..?\n\nBurns' statement that the US government is murdering blacks today was especially infuriating.\n\nOnce upon a time he made a great documentary about the Civil War. since then, not so much.\n\nI agree with all of the previous comments.  I came home after listening to the podcast today and thought I had to write a comment for the first time because I was so disappointed with how you handled Ken Burns and the subject matter.  Looks like I wasn't the only one and I don't have much to add.  I knew he was a big lib but I hoped for an even-handed look at a very difficult subject.  Didn't happen.  You pride yourself on your journalistic ability to cut through the partisan bullshit, on both sides.  That's why I listen.  Boogie Man Trump again.  Doesn't matter what he accomplished with the Abraham Accords.  Oh no, that's another film.  He'd never make that one.  I will never watch another of his films now that I know he has an agenda and I'll have to consider whether to continue with my subscription.  What a shame.\n\nI appreciate Bari for airing people with a wide range of viewpoints but am very disappointed that she didn't push back against Burns' overtly political and disproportionate conflation of Nazi atrocities with present-day conservative leanings. While the story he tells deserves to be heard, he destroys his own credibility by embracing tired, old, cartoonish caricatures of present-day Republicans and others who support the humane and sensible enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nThe media too often conflates the really horrible ideas held by the Nazis, with their model of government, which we describe as fascism.  Yes anti-semitism is horrible and it was practiced by Nazi fascists.  It is also practiced by a fringe minority of white supremacists in this country; but they are not fascists.  Idiots yes, fascists no.  Fascism is a type of government in which several supposedly separate entities work together, \"bundled\" to a common purpose.   Such actors include the state, the press, and corporations.  By definition a minority faction of any sort cannot be fascist.  Ironically, in this country, the organization that comes closest to fascism is the Democratic Party, in concert with the mainstream media and social media, and a significant number of \"woke\" corporations.  Indeed it is only the republican minority that keeps these \"democratic\" authoritarians from running rough shod.  See:  the lockdowns following covid in blue states.\n\nAll this hand wringing about Trump and \"right wing\" conspiracy makes me puke.  Bari should have pushed back against this garbage.\n\n\"I'm just the storyteller, the onus is on you, the listener\" just feels like a huge cop out. I knew what I would get before I hit play, I just wish Bari would have pushed back more. Perhaps she was just trying to avoid more random bizarre tangents about the state of Florida?\n\nKen Burns is one of my favorite storytellers.  I have watched with interest many of his documentaries.  I appreciate that this project did a deep dive into a history there is still, after all that has been written and documented, room for more examination.  This includes the perspectives that influenced how and to what degree the US intervened.  I am sure that I am not well versed in America's attitudes at the time.\n\nHowever Mr. Burns blatant political bias revealed in this interview, and his tangling of the holocaust with today's current events left me wondering how much I could trust what he has included in the story.   A shame really, that what could otherwise have been an important reveal of a different perspective on the holocaust, he chose to inject his world (US) view of the facts as he sees them.   This is one of his documentaries that I plan to skip.  And given what he revealed as his POV, I  will watch his other documentaries with a more critical eye.\n\nThat Ken Burns is a brilliant filmmaker is without question.  The interview was troubling, though, as he reaffirmed his elitist, unctuous credentials.  He correctly points out instances of authoritarianism on the right, but conveniently ignores the issue of authoritarianism and anti-free speech behavior on the left:  Government agencies during COVID;  Big Tech's partnership with the White House to suppress free speech; Transition of legacy media from reporting to narrative; Speech codes at universities, etc.   All of this leads one to wonder:  Is Ken Burns shining a light on an important and tragic historical event, or is he leveraging this as a cudgel to advance his polemic political view?\n\nBrilliant filmmaker?  Well you  could say the same about Leni Riefenstahl I guess.    I find Burns to be a very accomplished propagandist    He should stick to actual history."

      "text": "If you wonder why I-a woman of color, an African, a former Muslim, a former asylum seeker, and an immigrant-look at the antics of today's anti-Israel, anti-American protesters with such fear and trembling, allow me to explain.\n\nI was born in Somalia in 1969. The country had achieved independence nine years before. But less than a month before I was born-on October 21, 1969-a junior member of the brand-new Somali armed forces seized power with the help of the Soviet Union. The first two decades of my life were shaped by the upheaval that followed that coup.\n\nThe Somalia that gained its independence was a young, optimistic society full of national pride. We had such hope for growth, political stability, prosperity, and peace. But, in a story sadly familiar to many of my fellow Africans, those hopes were dashed.\n\nWhat followed was a nightmare.\n\nFor me it is all captured in the earliest memories of my youth: statues of Mohamed Siad Barre , our dictator, sprung up across Mogadishu, flanked by a trio of dark seraphim: Marx, Lenin, and Engels. This particular communist experiment plunged Somalia into bloodshed, mass starvation, and a 20-year period of suffocating tyranny. I recall my grandmother and mother smuggling food into our house. I also remember the whispering: we felt the state was omnipresent. It could hear everything.\n\nMy father was thrown into prison. His friends-those other pioneers in pursuit of a democracy modeled on America-were either jailed like him or, in many cases, executed.\n\nBy the time I was eight, my family knew we needed to escape. We left in 1977. By 1990, the country had descended into a civil war from which it has never fully recovered.\n\nI never stopped longing for the kind of freedom my father had taught me about. And at the age of 22, I fled to the Netherlands seeking it. There-and later, in America-I discovered what we've come to call \"Western\" values.\n\nThe West's inheritance springs from a peculiar confluence of habits and customs that had been practiced for centuries before anyone branded them as \"ideas.\" But they are principles-radical ones-that have given us the most tolerant, free, and flourishing societies in all of human history.\n\nAmong these principles are the rule of law, a tradition of liberty, personal responsibility, a system of representative government, a toleration of difference, and a commitment to pluralism. Each of these ideas might have been extinguished in their infancy but for the grace of God and the force of their appeal.\n\nPerhaps it is because I was born into a part of the world where these principles were nonexistent that I feel a particular love for them-and an instinct for when they are in danger.\n\nRight now, so many Western nations are under grave threat from the twin forces of cultural Marxism and an expansionist political Islam familiar to me from my youth.\n\nFor a time, many refused to believe that anything was actually wrong. The tide of populism was, they insisted, a momentary manifestation of frustration. The decline of each of our institutions was viewed in isolation, as a problem of poorly selected leadership, which could be corrected after the next election or with a changing of the guard. The sense of hopelessness that people felt was explained away as the temporary consequence of the rapid transition away from industrialism and the ushering in of the digital age.\n\nIn this light, though there were problems, they were distinct from each other and would be corrected in time.\n\nCan any serious person believe this now?\n\nPeople are encountering our current crisis in different ways, though a compelling explanation, let alone a solution, remains elusive. I am reminded of the Buddhist parable of the blind men and the elephant. The story goes that a group of blind men, who have never encountered an elephant before, hear that one has been brought to their town. They go to touch the elephant to work out what it might look like. One man touches the elephant's trunk and thinks it must be like a large snake. Another touches its leg and likens it to a tree. A third who grasps the elephant's tail says it feels like a rope. A fourth presses its sides, and when it does not budge, compares it to a wall. The fifth touches its tusk and thinks it to be like a spear.\n\nEach of the blind men touches the same elephant and comes up with a different interpretation. Although there is truth in each of their assessments, none is able fully to comprehend the elephant in its totality. Those who feel the decline in Western society are like these blind men, encountering the elephant in their own ways and grasping at explanations in the half-light of dusk.\n\nWhen the omni-breakdown burst forth in 2020 with the crises the Covid-19 pandemic and the draconian controls that governments imposed, and the George Floyd riots, most of us awoke from our slumbers and behaved like the blind men, ping-ponging around theories with the tremulous (sometimes furious) chatter that heralds the turning of an age.\n\nAs one of those blind men-and surely I, too, am encountering only part of the elephant-my perception is that we are a society subverted. By this, I do not mean that we are subverted in the sense that a few spies and saboteurs are conducting covert operations, blowing up a bridge or an airfield. I mean we are subverted in a more systematic and totalizing way.\n\nListen to Ayaan read this essay today on Honestly:\n\nBefore I explain who might be doing the subverting, and for what reason, let me first explain what I mean by it. The best description comes from Yuri Bezmenov , who says that this form of subversion is very gradual, but ultimately transformational.\n\nBezmenov had been a KGB agent promoting foreign subversion when he grew disillusioned with the Soviet system. In 1970, he defected to the West-to Greece, then Canada. The rest of his life was dedicated to exposing the secret Soviet apparatus of subversion in the West.\n\nLiving in the West in 1983, Bezmenov gave a lecture in which he explained \"Psychological Warfare, Subversion, and the Control of Society.\" It begins:\n\nSubversion refers to a process by which the values and principles of an established system are contradicted or reversed in an attempt to sabotage the existing social order and its structures of power, authority, tradition, hierarchy, and social norms. It involves a systematic attempt to overthrow or undermine a government or political system, often carried out by persons working secretly from within. Subversion is used as a tool to achieve political goals because it generally carries less risk, cost, and difficulty as opposed to open belligerency. The act of subversion can lead to the destruction or damage of an established system or government. In the context of ideological subversion, subversion aims to gradually change the perception and values of a society, ultimately leading to the undermining of its existing systems and beliefs.\n\nThis kind of subversion is familiar to me because of my background. Somalia wasn't the only African country subverted by the USSR. And those that were warped by Soviet infiltration-such as Ethiopia and Angola-bear the scars to this day.\n\nOne of the key insights Bezmenov expresses about a subverted society is that, for a while, there is only a passing sense that something is wrong. It's a mood-a vibe. I believe that's what many of us have been witnessing for several years now, maybe even as long as a decade or two.\n\nThe pressure makes society rumble like a volcano, quiet one minute and flaring the next. Then, finally-and seemingly suddenly-the revolution bursts into view.\n\nWhen, on October 8, protests erupted across the Western world in support of Hamas-and not the democracy that had been overrun by terrorists-I saw the revolution. When I look at the recent spectacle at Columbia or Yale or UCLA or Harvard or Stanford-students tearing down American flags and raising Palestinian ones; or chanting in Arabic \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\"-it is hard not to see the fruit of this long process. I hear the same when, week after week, the streets of London, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Hamburg ring with cries of \"intifada\" or open demands for a caliphate or Sharia law in the heart of Europe.\n\nHow did it happen?\n\nBezmenov described the subversion process as a complex model with four successive stages, a diagram of which I have provided. These are, in order: demoralization , destabilization , crisis , and finally, normalization .\n\nDemoralization is the first stage and requires the subverters' greatest investment of time and resources. Bezmenov claims the process of demoralization can take between 10 to 30 years, because that is the amount of time it takes to educate a new generation.\n\nThe demoralization process targets three areas of society: its ideas, its structures, and its social institutions. The targeted institutions include religion, education, media, and culture. In each realm the old ways of thinking, the old heroes, are discredited. Those who believed in them come to doubt themselves and their ability to discern reality itself.\n\nThink of the cynicism and selective truth-telling young Americans encounter in most classrooms. You know Jefferson owned slaves, right? You know Columbus killed millions? Again, never mind that Jefferson set us on the path to emancipation, or that Columbus knew nothing about epidemiology. A little learning, as the saying goes, is a dangerous thing.\n\nOnce inside, it is very difficult to escape the mosh pit of civilizational self-loathing. Maybe you can climb to the top for a while by being the white person who hates white people most loudly, or the straight person who goes to the most debauched parades. But most people give up.\n\nThe ultimate intended outcome is that the afflicted willingly embrace self-destructive behaviors and ideas. Thus, all moral constraints can be eschewed in the pursuit of \"just\" and \"virtuous\" causes.\n\nWhat else can explain the daily displays of moral panic attacks masquerading as righteous activism, from the destruction of artwork to self-immolation ? As human life ceases to look inviolable, we might also expect measures like euthanasia to gain steam, not just to help end terminal anguish but to end all manner of non-debilitating hardship. It's no surprise, then, that we are seeing movements speeding ahead for \"assisted dying\" in the U.S., UK, the Netherlands, Canada, France, Ireland, and the rest of the West.\n\nNext, the fundamental structures of society-like the rule of law and social relations-are targeted. For example, demoralization in the rule of law would entail undermining our trust in legal institutions and eroding the basis for legal authority. This could be accomplished by presenting the justice system as corrupt or illegitimate and by sowing distrust in the mechanisms of law enforcement. Think of the movements to \"defund the police\" because of \"systemic racism.\" Or the conviction last week of the front-runner presidential candidate on 34 counts of obvious political charges.\n\nAs a consequence, citizens lose confidence in the administration of justice, paving the way for untold social disorders, including legal nihilism, where people disregard the law en masse.\n\nIn America in 2019, 14 unarmed black men were shot by police-most, apparently, in self-defense. And yet, when polled, most Americans who described themselves as \"very liberal\" estimated the number at 1,000 or more. A fifth thought 10,000 or more. Were the BLM riots, then, any surprise?\n\nTo be sure, this isn't just a progressive problem. Republicans also demonized the Justice Department, the FBI, and members of the judiciary when it suited them. Conservatives are also losing their confidence in law enforcement, in part because of what they see as the lax enforcement of the law as applied toward groups like antifa, Black Lives Matter, and pro-Hamas demonstrators.\n\nThe subversion here appears to be working, with both sides agreeing: there is a two-tiered police and justice system-one set of rules for me, and another for thee.\n\nThe third area-which Bezmenov called \"life\"-includes core social institutions such as family, health, race, population, and labor. Demoralization of the family is probably a familiar concept to us all. It involves promoting ideas that weaken the bonds between members of the family, promoting narcissistic individualism over family unity, creating financial stressors that discourage family formation, acrimony between the sexes, and the replacement of parental authority with the state.\n\nThus, the retrograde practice of polygamy is rebranded as polyamory. The natural human urge to create and nurture new human life is treated derisively by \" DINKS \" with slightly more latte money, or, more seriously, as an irresponsible and selfish choice to make because of climate change. Meantime, parents are told at every turn that they don't know what they're doing-and to defer to the experts instead.\n\nThe result is that not only do individuals feel less attachment to family, the fundamental unit of a healthy civilization, but they even end up detached from society itself. As we now know, the breakdown of family is strongly correlated with the epidemic of mental health crisis and explosive rise in violent crime: 85 percent of American youth in prison come from fatherless homes.\n\nThe goal of demoralization is to gradually degrade the foundations of a healthy society across all domains by erasing moral lines and exploiting preexisting discontents. What a society used to call abnormal and pathological, subversion normalizes. Just consider, for example, our culture's attitude toward pedophiles, now rebranded as \" minor-attracted persons .\" By hijacking the legacy and language of the civil rights movement, nearly any \"marginalized\" group has a vehicle to try to \"mainstream\" deviant behavior. Consider the fact that across civilized societies it is not just \"wrong\" to say that a man cannot become a woman. It is thought to be cruel . So cruel that the Scots have made it illegal .\n\nWhat's striking about the demoralization process is that the law doesn't typically change-at least not initially. Subversion abuses the tolerance of an open culture, forcing the host society to accomplish its aims like a virus attaches to a host.\n\nIn the Soviet case, according to Bezmenov, a successful subverter could come to be employed by a major university and teach a class on communism. When professors, donors, and students raise eyebrows, they get labeled as cranks or retrograde. The subverter responds: \"Who are you to decide what can't be taught?\" Meanwhile, the subverter works to indoctrinate more young and impressionable minds and to secure positions for allies or useful ideologues. If you oppose this, you are asked: \"What do you have against intellectual diversity?\" Or \"Do you oppose free thinking?\" Thus, dissenters are silenced.\n\nOver time, as the subverters come to dominate an institution, they apply institutional pressure. Curbs on academic freedom, the curriculum, and alterations to the hiring process inevitably follow. Think of the novel instruments to enforce uniformity of thought among academics: DEI statements , now a requirement at universities across America. Repeat ad infinitum .\n\nEven in the cases where subversive activity is clearly illegal, such as with destruction and violence during the 2020 riots and at many anti-Israel protests today, crimes committed in service of some larger goal-like \"decolonization\"-are presented as righteous. Decolonization is a word that's become as common these days as social justice . But what does it mean? Gal Beckerman of The Atlantic has written about the Marxist origins of this concept and one of its chief proponents, Frantz Fanon. Fanon, Beckerman writes, is \"the patron saint of political violence,\" and his \"concepts have provided intellectual ballast and moral justification for actions that most people would simply describe as terror.\" Listen to Fanon himself: \"whatever may be the headings used or the new formulas introduced, decolonization is always a violent phenomenon.\"\n\nWhen young people say \"resistance is justified,\" many-if not most-of them believe they are simply standing up for the downtrodden. But the deeper implications of that statement are about justifying the morally reprehensible. How else to explain that at our most prestigious college campuses, students can be found glorifying Hamas terrorists and openly praising North Korea?\n\nAs far as I can tell, we are on our way to being considerably demoralized. If you look at the last few years, standards have declined, and subversive content, like Fanon's, fills the media and our children's curricula from K-12 to college and beyond. By beyond I mean even the Girl Scouts: here's a St. Louis chapter learning to cheer for \"the intifada.\"\n\nDo most elementary school teachers really want to racially stratify fourth graders? No. I think they dislike the racism of the past and want to do what they can to fix it. Since their betters in college told them that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is the way to go, well, so be it. Likewise, I don't think your local high school history teacher wants to bring about a Bolshevik revolution. He has simply been told to replace the focus on 1776 with something from The 1619 Project . So he gets with the times. And on and on and on.\n\nWe have also come to a place where it is difficult for anyone to dissent for fear of incurring the wrath of the adherents-witting or not-of subversion. So people go along, keep their heads down, and try not to make a fuss.\n\nDestabilization is the next phase. This process is considerably shorter, taking anywhere between five months to two years. With demoralization now reaching its full maturity, society is increasingly paralyzed by harsh domestic turmoil across all sectors. Democratic politics take on the character of a vicious struggle for power. Factionalism takes hold. Economic relations degrade and collapse, obliterating the basis for bargaining. The social fabric frays, leading to mob rule. Society turns inward, leading to fear, isolationism, and the decline of the nation-state itself, leading to crisis .\n\nIt is important to understand that, at this stage, the process of subversion is largely self-propelled. What once required active involvement on the part of a subverter has now taken root and grows organically. Then, society ruptures all at once in a rolling series of crises as the full extent of the cancer manifests.\n\nFinally, says Bezmenov, a subverted society enters the normalization stage, which is when the subversive regime takes over, installing its ideology as the law of the land. By then, the enemy has totally conquered the target society-without ever firing a shot.\n\nThe question, of course, is who is doing the subverting. Who is trying to unravel America and the West?\n\nAgain, I am feeling only my part of the elephant, but I can discern at least three forces.\n\nThe first: American Marxists . This category includes old card-carrying communists, red-diaper baby socialists, antifa anarchists, and many of whom we now call woke . Though the Soviet Union collapsed decades ago, the Soviet worldview has found familiar proponents: young Americans and their professors. They are no longer advancing their cause merely through class struggle, but through the fusion of racial, class, and anticolonial struggles. Theirs is now a cultural communism ; they lead subversion through the institutions with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the West.\n\nThe thundering socialists of the past (think of poor Bernie) seemed to earnestly care about the working class. Perhaps they did so naively, but at least they loved the poor. Does AOC? Rashida Tlaib? My former countrywoman, Ilhan Omar?\n\nThe second force is the radical Islamists , who are riding the coattails of the communists to power. A good example is the Muslim Brotherhood and its many tentacles. Of these tentacles, some are openly religious, like the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Muslim Students Association, each with chapters in nearly every American university. Other organizations don a secular mask, like the so-called Students for Justice in Palestine. These groups have become increasingly confident over the past months. Anti-Israel Muslim candidates recently won elected seats in countries like England, where imams talk openly about reestablishing the caliphate in Europe.\n\nThe third force is the Chinese Communist Party . The most obvious avenues through which the CCP has spread subversion in America is through its numerous Confucius Institutes . These organizations have been vehicles for Chinese espionage within major American academic institutions. Then there is TikTok, an addictive social media app controlled by the CCP, which presents Chinese children wholesome, educational content while wreaking havoc on American kids-polarizing them and feeding them anti-American propaganda.\n\nI believe Vladimir Putin is currently waging his own subversion campaign by supporting and advancing the three other forces. That is why I do not place him in one particular category.\n\nWhat unites these enemies ? On the surface, they have little in common. We all know what happens to \"Queers for Palestine\" in the Palestinian territories. Or Muslims in China . We all know what CCP mandarins think of Black Lives Matter activists. Or rather, what they would think, if they deigned to do so.\n\nBut they have wisely chosen the same common enemy: the West.\n\nI am not saying that Bezmenov's formulation explains all that we are seeing. It clearly does not address all the West's problems. But once I immersed myself in his formulation, many of the topsy-turvy developments in our institutions fell into place.\n\nThe widespread acquisition of useless, aggressively ideological degrees in gender and race, or the claims of the possibility of an unlimited number of genders, or the total racialization and \"decolonization\" of our political discourse, or the demands to defund the police, the toppling of statues, the defacing of art, the \"spontaneous\" protests to dismantle our structures, and much else, I now understand as acts of subversion rather than mere expressions of discontent or youthful energy run amok.\n\nIt's important to note that not all activism is subversive. My life would not be possible without the righteous activism of those who fought for women's rights and civil rights. So how to tell the good activism from the bad?\n\nI regret to tell you that there is no easy way. One thing to pay attention to is your gut. Another is your mind: be discerning and skeptical of people recruiting you to their cause. Does their cause ask toleration of you or require compelled speech? Are you being recruited to fight for a cause you know nothing about? Is that cause maximalist and uncompromising; does it glorify violence?\n\nRegardless of whether you agree with my interpretation of events, subversion is a risk to all open societies. As Bezmenov says, subversion is a two-way street. A closed society is immune to subversion because it simply tells potential subverters to leave. Free and open societies cannot rely on this defense.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States was able to forestall subversion because its institutions and people had the necessary antibodies to stave off subversive ideas. Doing so is easier when you have a visible peer as an enemy. But when the Cold War came to an end and we declared victory, we mistakenly thought our enemies laid down their arms and that history had ended-so we let our guard down.\n\nOrwell said that \"To see what is in front of one's nose needs a constant struggle.\" Everyone with eyes to see is now scrambling to do just that.\n\nWhat is at stake in our ability to see plainly? Everything. What is at stake is nothing less than the preservation of our way of life.\n\nNow is the time for all of us blind seekers to come together. To restore what we have lost will be the work of our lifetimes. Can there be a more important project?\n\nAyaan Hirsi Ali is the author of several books, including most recently, Prey: Immigration, Islam, and the Erosion of Women's Rights .\n\nSubscribe to Ayaan's Substack, Restoration, here .

Ayaan had a unique perspective on what is transporting in America today. We would be wise to bed what she says.\n\nShe makes an interesting argument about the risk coming from one direction. But I'm much more concerned about the rise of Christian nationalism on the right in the United States. They are the ones seeking to roll back the gains that have liberated me during my lifetime. If the American experiment fails, it will be because of Donald Trump and his cult. They are the far greater threat to the three key values she identifies, and with which I agree --  the rule of law, a tradition of liberty, personal responsibility, a system of representative government, a toleration of difference, and a commitment to pluralism.\n\nNo posts"
