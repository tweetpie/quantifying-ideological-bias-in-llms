Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nIn a letter to America's bishops, Pope Francis last month decried a \"major crisis\" unfolding in the United States: \"the initiation of a program of mass deportations.\" He called on \"all the faithful of the Catholic Church, and all men and women of good will, not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.\"\n\nBorder-hawk Catholics were scandalized.\n\nR. R. Reno, the editor of the traditionalist religious magazine First Things , denounced the pope as \"an accelerationist\" who believes that a \"borderless fraternity is a true utopia.\" The Daily Wire 's Matt Walsh characterized the letter as \"pure nonsense,\" while the Heritage Foundation's head, Kevin Roberts, called it a \"veiled shot\" at Catholic supporters of Donald Trump. Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, addressed Francis directly : \"I got harsh words for the pope ... He ought to fix the Catholic Church and concentrate on his work, and leave border enforcement to us.\" (Each of these critiques came before Francis's hospitalization last month.)\n\nThroughout Francis's papacy, some American Catholics have accused him of prioritizing a platitudinal liberalism over doctrinal orthodoxy. But on the issue of immigration, Francis's critics are the ones who appear to be sidestepping Catholic tradition-even while claiming to uphold it.\n\nStart with the incident that prompted the current intra-Catholic dispute over immigration: a back-and-forth between the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and America's highest-profile Catholic official. After the Trump administration authorized Immigration and Customs Enforcement to apprehend people in churches and other social-service ministries, the USCCB called the move \" contrary to the common good .\" Vice President J. D. Vance came to the administration's defense.\n\n\"There's this old-school-and I think it's a very Christian concept, by the way,\" Vance told Fox News's Sean Hannity in late January, \"that you love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\" Vance's rationale sparked intense debate in Catholic circles, especially online: His supporters cheered his use of religious rhetoric, while his detractors accused him of ignoring key parts of the Gospel.\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: 'A very Christian concept'\n\nChristian theologians through the ages have indeed articulated versions of this principle-called ordo amoris , or \"the order of love\"-including Church fathers such as Saint Augustine in the fourth century (\"Since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you\") and Saint Thomas Aquinas in the 13th (\"We ought to love more specially those who are united to us by ties of blood\"). True Christian love, the principle suggests, is guided not by an impulse to maximize utility but by a compassionate preference toward the personal and proximate.\n\nMany of those same Catholic theologians, however, believed that this preference is conditional, not absolute. As Aquinas himself wrote in the Summa Theologiae : \"In certain cases one ought, for instance, to succor a stranger, in extreme necessity, rather than one's own father, if he is not in such urgent need.\" Rightly ordered love prioritizes close kinship-all things being equal. But it's not ignorant of context or necessity.\n\nBased on the outcry that followed Francis's letter, you'd be forgiven for thinking it marked a dramatic departure from the views of his predecessors. It didn't. \"To welcome\" the undocumented migrant \"and to show him solidarity is a duty of hospitality and fidelity to Christian identity itself,\" Pope John Paul II said in 1995. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, remarked that immigrants and native-born people alike \"have the same right to enjoy the goods of the earth whose destination is universal, as the social doctrine of the Church teaches.\" In 2010, he selected \"one human family\" as the theme for the World Day of Migrants and Refugees.\n\nTo be sure, none of the three most recent pontiffs argued that immigration is an unbounded good. Benedict XVI granted that nations are entitled to \"regulate migration flows,\" while John Paul II thought that \"illegal immigration should be prevented.\" Francis himself noted in his letter \"the right of a nation to defend itself and keep communities safe\" from violent criminals, and he stressed the need for \"policy that regulates orderly and legal migration.\"\n\nStill, some of Francis's critics interpreted the letter as a declaration that countries should admit every migrant who doesn't have a criminal record. They typically cited this line: \"The rightly formed conscience\" should not equate the \"illegal status of some migrants with criminality.\" But Francis has previously acknowledged that stricter enforcement can be necessary. In a 60 Minutes interview last year, the pope said that a migrant should be received initially but, in certain situations, \"maybe you have to send him back.\"\n\nSome might reasonably find all of this to be another instance of Francis's imprecision -as a Catholic myself, I understand their frustration-or think it imprudent for him to intervene in such a contested and complicated political matter. True enough, his letter wasn't primarily concerned with balancing competing interests; his goal, it seems, was to emphasize what he regards as the moral error that underlies much of the immigration debate in the United States. If in doing so the pope is guilty of eschewing some nuance, his critics seem altogether uninterested in the deficiency he was pointing out.\n\nThey wouldn't have to look very far. The first Trump administration enforced a brutal policy that separated thousands of parents from their children, as my colleague Caitlin Dickerson reported . (In October, a journalist asked Homan whether there's a way to carry out mass deportations without separating families; he replied, \"Sure there is: Families can be deported together.\") In many cases, restrictionist sentiment has given way to outright xenophobia, perhaps most memorably during Trump's 2024 campaign, when he scapegoated Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. (Matt Walsh contributed to the panic in a video titled \"Third World Immigrants Are Ruining Our Towns and Eating Our Pets.\") And as the second Trump administration froze funds for initiatives such as the USCCB's refugee-resettlement program, the bishops' conference laid off 50 workers last month . (Responding to pushback from the USCCB over the administration's loosened ICE guidelines, Vance suggested that the bishops are more \"worried about their bottom line\" than about caring for migrants.)\n\nWhile the White House posts deportation ASMR videos and ICE ramps up raids that sometimes mistakenly detain citizens , it's hard to read Francis's letter as gratuitous pining for a borderless utopia. Rather, the pope seems to be making a plea for rhetoric and policies that respect the dignity of every human life-a long-standing Catholic concern that U.S. immigration-policy debates so often ignore."

      "text": "Why Friendship Is Like Improv\n\n\"If I'm onstage with people I've been performing with for 20-some years ... I never get left hanging.\"\n\nEvery week, The Friendship Files features a conversation between The Atlantic 's Julie Beck and two or more friends, exploring the history and significance of their relationship.\n\nThis week, she talks with three of the co-founders of the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch-comedy and improv troupe. Matt Besser, Matt Walsh, and Ian Roberts-along with Amy Poehler-took the group from the Chicago improv scene to New York, onto television with a sketch show in the '90s, and turned it into the big business it is today. UCB now has theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, and also offers improv classes, whose alumni include many other famous comedians, such as Aubrey Plaza and Donald Glover. In this interview, Besser, Walsh, and Roberts discuss UCB's origins, how the improv social scene has changed over time, and how the nature of improvisation makes friendship among performers necessary and inevitable.\n\nMatt Besser , 51, an actor and a co-founder of the Upright Citizens Brigade who lives in Los Angeles. He hosts the comedy podcast Improv4humans With Matt Besser . Ian Roberts , 53, an actor, a writer, and a co-founder of UCB who lives in Los Angeles. He served as the showrunner for the Comedy Central show Key and Peele and the TV Land show Teachers. Matt Walsh , 54, an actor and a co-founder of UCB who lives in Los Angeles. He recently starred in the HBO show Veep.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJulie Beck: Let's go back to the very beginning: When and how did you guys first meet?\n\nMatt Besser: In Chicago. Even before I knew about improv, I was going to this place called the Roxy, which was a stand-up open mic where people would do sketches and stuff. Walsh, would you agree? Is that where we met? At the Roxy?\n\nMatt Walsh: Yeah that's about right. I remember meeting Ian on my back porch-\n\nIan Roberts: I need to jump in here about your first meeting, because I've heard that story before and you're leaving out a funny element: that Besser apparently gave you a packet of sketches.\n\nBesser: Oh, yeah-I wrote all these sketches for my thesis in college. I liked Walsh, and offstage [at the Roxy] I was like, \"Hey, read my sketches; let's do these.\" I think you didn't respond. You never read them, right?\n\nWalsh: No, I never read them. And then you were like, \"Dude, can I get my sketches back?\" That was in the day when sketches were your scripts, sort of.\n\nBesser: I had to drive 30 miles to get to a printer. Give me my fucking sketches back, man.\n\nWalsh: I felt not great about that. Is this phone call about getting the sketches back?\n\nBesser: I'll meet you in the parking lot.\n\nRoberts: The first time I was around [you two] was probably a year after you met. I met Matt Besser; we ended up on a team together at the ImprovOlympic, which was an improv theater in Chicago. Matt Walsh and I ended up in the same touring company at Second City.\n\nBesser: The improv scene was at its nascent moment when we joined. It exploded over those next few years, but it was kind of small at that point. If you were interested in improv, you knew everybody. It revolved around ImprovOlympic and the Annoyance Theatre, with everybody having dreams to be in Second City.\n\nRoberts: When all of us ended up working together-Matt Walsh, Matt Besser, and myself-it was kind of in opposition to Second City. Second City was perceived by most of us as being a little staid and it was hard to break into.\n\nBesser: Kids in the Hall was real popular right then. They were definitely my favorite group, and seeing them get a TV show was inspirational to groups like us. Most people either want to be on SNL or have their own sketch group, and we were on the path of having our own group. Maybe that did make us tighter, because we were united in a long-term goal.\n\nRoberts: A lot of the aesthetic of our shows was anti-authority. Back then, there was this [practice] of being a dishwasher or working the door at Second City and you could work your way up. Fuck all that; I'm not going to hang around and be a toady at this place. I'm going to do my own thing. They had a nice theater, and we'd be in some crappy café with no food license. [Second City] was the place where everyone from the suburbs and out of town came. We were for the kids who were living in Wicker Park apartments with no heat, who had no money.\n\nBeck: This is sort of a chicken-or-the-egg question-\n\nWalsh: Chicken.\n\nRoberts: You have to do the question, Matt.\n\nWalsh: Oh, sorry.\n\nBeck: Did the friendship come as a result of working together, or was the working together a result of the friendship?\n\nRoberts: For me, the friendship was a result of working together. The first time Matt Besser walked up to me and said, \"Hey, you want to be part of a sketch group?\" I was, like, medium [about it]. I was like, \"Yeah, sure.\" I got to know you guys from working with you, really.\n\nBesser: I think the improv community is pretty unique. Not only have many long-lasting friendships come out of it, but also marriages-including my own, Ian's, and Walsh's. \"Working\" doesn't even describe it. It's beyond work, because you're sharing an artistic thing together. You're sometimes sharing dreams together, like we did: the goal of a sketch show on TV. Work is maybe 9 to 5, but with improv, you're not just hanging out when you're onstage. You're going to the bar afterward, and it becomes a lot deeper than that.\n\nRoberts: It's also huge for developing that shared sensibility. There's this term that describes how we tend to interact offstage and it's doing bits . That's what we would try to encourage our students to do-you've got to be hanging out. That's how you get great. You start to know each other's rhythms. It is 24/7. You're always either rehearsing or performing or hanging out. And while you're hanging out, you're practicing your chops without trying to.\n\nBesser: Ensembles and friendships grow hand in hand. The first time, you're put together by a director, but then as you grow as a comedian you start to make your own choices. You're like, I want to perform with that person , or This person isn't jiving with our group; they need to leave. So friendship becomes an important part of the ensemble, too.\n\nRoberts: Besser and I were put on a team together, but we kind of jived better with some other people. Besser came to that realization earlier than I did. He told the woman who ran the organization, \"Look, I want to get off this team and go on this other one.\"\n\nBesser: At the end of the show she gathered all the teams together and said, \"Matt Besser has an announcement.\"\n\nRoberts: She put him in the awkward position of having to give this fake heartfelt speech about, \"Guys, I love performing with you, and we've got this chemistry. But sometimes there's another chemistry. The reactions are stronger over there, and so you move on.\" It was like, What the fuck is he talking about? I met with him afterward and he goes, \"I didn't want to give any speech! She blindsided me.\" Shortly after that, I left and joined that team. That was a bunch of the guys that ended up doing Upright Citizens Brigade.\n\nBeck: I want to hear a little more about how the way improv works intersects with friendship. For instance, do you think it's possible to do a good show with people that you aren't really friends with?\n\nWalsh: Definitely.\n\nRoberts: It is. Because there are these rules, and if you've been taught well, you all know the same rules. So you hit the ground running. I've performed with these younger improvisers who I don't know well and it's funny because it does feel like you're friends. What do friends do? Friends have a shorthand and they goof around. You get onstage with these people and you have that shorthand. It's a taught shorthand, but after one show it feels like you're a bunch of good friends.\n\nWalsh: I think you do have to like the people, or else you can't really improvise with them. I've seen a little bit of natural selection. I've seen shows as a fan where I'm like, Oh, that poor guy got stuck with that person. You can feel it.\n\nBesser: I agree with you; there's no way you can be on a team with anybody you despise. But I can think of people who didn't hang after shows but were proficient onstage. Long term, it's not about what's happening onstage as much as what's happening in the greenroom. Like, Why is he always giving everybody notes? Or, When we go on tour, why does he act like he's the boss? That kind of drama.\n\nRoberts: I had a funny situation, and I won't name names, but in my early days of improv, I didn't know the way the organization worked. One day I said, \"You know that guy who's the captain of my team?\" And Besser said, \"What are you talking about?\" I said, \"The guy who's in charge and gives notes and everything.\" He goes, \"Dude, there's no captains of teams.\" It was like a veil dropped.\n\nBesser: He's not the captain; he's the asshole of the team.\n\nRoberts: Once I knew that, I went from being neutral toward this guy to hating his guts.\n\nBeck: Could you take me through the different eras of UCB? Chicago, New York, etc.? Did those coincide with different eras of your friendship?\n\nBesser: UCB was simultaneous with when we were doing improv. It was all happening at the same time: getting involved in improv, doing stand-up, developing a sketch show. That was the early '90s.\n\nRoberts: For the longest time, it seemed like all the shows kind of felt like art for art's sake and to hell with them being marketable. I think of this one show, \" Thunderball ,\" that was a reaction to the [1994] baseball strike. We created a sport that was an alternative to baseball. It was this experience; we went out on the street.\n\nBesser: We went in front of Wrigley Field and protested.\n\nRoberts: At a certain point, when the group coalesced into the cast that ended up on TV, I guess we were just getting to the age where you had to think, Okay man, someday we got to enter the grown-up world. We've got to make money for this stuff.\n\nBesser: We had to get serious, and that's when we decided to move to New York.\n\nRoberts: The four of us. It's Amy [Poehler], Matt Besser, Matt Walsh, and me. At that point, we made a promise to each other. You can go do a commercial, you can do a day at work on a show, but don't anybody go taking a regular [role] on a sitcom, because we're committed to each other. That's why a lot of groups can't succeed. They get cherry-picked; they don't make a commitment like that. It was rough for different people for different reasons. Matt Walsh, his whole family was in Chicago. And Amy Poehler had a pretty solid offer to get on the main stage at Second City.\n\nBeck: What were the terms of the agreement? Was it time-delineated?\n\nRoberts: It was indeed. I think it was a year.\n\nWalsh: I think it was shorter. I think we said, \"Let's give New York six months and we'll revisit this conversation.\" Then we never revisited it. We just started having success.\n\nBeck: Once you were in business with your close friends, how did that change things?\n\nBesser: We never really entered it as a business, but it certainly became that. At the time, everything was very low stakes. It was more this organic, gradual growth that we experienced together. We never counted on it to be a living business for us. It was more like a hobby and a community.\n\nRoberts: We found a former strip club that got put out of business because Rudy Giuliani was cracking down on all the red-light stuff. We had no money. We took [the strip club's] runway stage, chopped it up, made it into a regular stage, and turned a club into a theater. We put shows up there that would make just enough to make the rent.\n\nNowadays, you come into an organization and you're not necessarily going to feel this incredible bond with everyone instantly. Back in the day, you did, because you were all involved in the same struggle. There's no construction team putting this theater together. It's, Everyone show up, bring tools, help us build this theater.\n\nBesser: Literally. You're not speaking figuratively. It's closer to a barn-raising than opening a business.\n\nRoberts: There wasn't a lot of stress, because we were too stupid to know that there should've been stress.\n\nBeck: At what point did it stop feeling like this scrappy random thing that you guys were doing with your friends and become something bigger?\n\nRoberts: I'd say when our [first] theater closed. We fell into that; it was available because of the Giuliani thing. It got closed down, so we regrouped and started this [other] theater, which became the one we were in for, like, 15 years. We had to make a real commitment to keep going. At that point it was like, Is this the end, or do we figure this out? For me, it felt like a step forward to getting serious.\n\nWalsh: I think for me [it was] the L.A. theater opening. Having places on two coasts was the thing that made me feel like, Oh, this is grown-up.\n\nBesser: To me, it was when I gave my senior thesis, of which there was only one copy, to Walsh and never got it back.\n\nWalsh: I don't save paper anymore; everything's shredded. I don't know what to tell you.\n\nBesser: Oh, like it didn't end up in improv on Veep.\n\nRoberts: Matt, would you be willing, if we could hypnotize you, to see what we can get out? What you still have in there?\n\nWalsh: No. Absolutely not.\n\nRoberts: I think this may be the end. How are we going to get over this?\n\nBeck: How involved are you still with UCB? How often are you still in touch with one another?\n\nBesser: Well, we have the Del Close Marathon, which is our little comedy festival that we've kept alive for 21 years. That's a ritual we do every year. It's obviously a challenging thing to pull off, but it's also exciting because you get to see people you often don't see, even though you live in the same town, you work in the same business. It's like our summertime Christmas.\n\nWalsh: That is the reunion time for the theater, where everyone does come back. Many of us from the early days have moved on and have families and kids and all that. So you don't have the free time you did in your 20s to hang out.\n\nRoberts: We've [also] been doing a show called \"Asssscat,\" which is a show for veterans to get together. It's like pickup basketball and it's been going forever. We've always kept in touch through that show. For me, it's the only show I've remained involved with all throughout the years no matter what else I've done. I saw Walsh this past weekend there.\n\nBeck: Does it feel different when you guys perform together, as opposed to other things you work on?\n\nBesser: I think Ian's point earlier about shorthand really describes the uniqueness of friendships that come out of improv. As the years go by, that shorthand can only grow.\n\nBeck: Do you three have any particular shorthands that come to mind?\n\nWalsh: I get frustrated when Ian doesn't know how to play games. He can't be playful in a formalized way. It's always off; you're always trying to handle him.\n\nBesser: That sounds like a criticism more than a shorthand.\n\nRoberts: [My problem] with Matt Walsh is, he completely understands the form but he's not intrinsically funny. But that's what's interesting about the relationship, right?\n\nBesser: Maybe we don't know what shorthand means.\n\nBeck: Yeah, maybe not. I meant phrases or inside jokes.\n\nBesser: When you hang with people a lot, there are unconscious tendencies you can anticipate. You can play to their strengths.\n\nRoberts: If I'm onstage with people I've been performing with for 20-some years, like Matt Walsh and Matt Besser, I don't even need to count on one hand how many times something has been missed. You just don't miss stuff. You know exactly what you want. When you initiate a scene, it's like Legos. I need you to be the other side of this. And you're like, I got it; you want me to be a straight guy and be frustrated by this thing you do . I never get left hanging.\n\nBesser: That's something anyone can understand as a friend. The closer you are, the longer you know someone, the more you know what they want. And that applies to our improv forms too.\n\nWalsh: A lot of Ian's scenes are about Legos. Most of them. Lego-based comedy.\n\nBesser: We know he can only make a metaphor if it involves Legos.\n\nBeck: Well, that's probably big with your kids right?\n\nBesser: That's why he had kids.\n\nRoberts: You see how that worked, though? I made my comment, and just like a Lego, it let them take it to this level where they describe the way that I work.\n\nBeck: How have you guys seen the broader improv social scene change over the years?\n\nWalsh: It was a very small community when we started and very homogenous. Now it's really diverse, at least in the New York and L.A. scenes at UCB.\n\nBesser: That's a great point. With that team we were telling you about earlier that formed as an improv group, not only were we all straight men and five of the six of us white, but I'm pretty sure we were all over 6 foot 2.\n\nRoberts: Amy talked about that in her book. She described our team and she said [something like], \"They were giants of improv,\" and she says, \"I mean that literally.\"\n\nA slight difference is, I felt like everybody knew everybody when we first started UCB. The bond was so tight. Everybody helped build the theater; it was very small, 30 or 40 people. That's lightning in a bottle. This is almost one tribe of people. There's probably [multiple] groups like that of 30 or 40 within our organization now. You cannot have as much buy-in. It becomes a little more abstract. There gets to be a little bit more distance between you and [other] people in the organization, I think.\n\nBeck: Was there anything else you wanted to mention about your friendship, improv, or grievances you wanted to air?\n\nRoberts: The main one has been brought up. Walsh has to make a decision of what he's going to do. You've got someone's scenes, Matt.\n\nBesser: Intellectual property.\n\nWalsh: I guess I have to ask why was I entrusted with the master copies. Why is that my burden?\n\nBesser: That's easy to say now. That was back in the day. Why weren't there two Declarations of Independence?\n\nRoberts: I don't think that's a grandiose analogy. Matt is a very good scene writer. You basically had the equivalent of the Declaration of Independence in sketches.\n\nWalsh: I just don't think they exist anymore and I don't remember-\n\nRoberts: I know we'll continue to be friends and work together, but you need to hear this. Shame on you, Matt Walsh; shame on you.\n\nIf you or someone you know should be featured on The Friendship Files, get in touch at friendshipfiles@theatlantic.com and tell us a bit about what makes the friendship unique."

      "text": "This Is How Political Violence Goes Mainstream\n\nThe UnitedHealthcare shooting marks a new moment of normie extremism.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nIt is tempting to think of political extremists as those who have had their brain flambéed by a steady media diet of oddball podcasters, fringe YouTubers, and \"do your own research\" conspiracists. Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, was known to hang out in white-supremacist forums. Robert Bowers frequently posted racist content on the right-wing site Gab, where he wrote \"Screw your optics, I'm going in\" just before murdering 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. Brenton Tarrant's manifesto explaining why he murdered 51 people in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 was filled with 4chan jokes and memes, suggesting that he had spent ample time on the platform.\n\nYet at first glance, Luigi Mangione, the suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, doesn't seem to fit this mold. Mangione was active on social media-but in the most average of ways. He seemingly posted on Goodreads and X, had public photos of himself on Facebook, and reportedly spent time on Reddit discussing his back pain. Perhaps more details will emerge that complicate the picture, but however extreme his political views were-he is, after all, charged with murdering a man in Midtown Manhattan, and reportedly wrote a manifesto in which he called health insurers \"parasites\"-this does not appear to be a man who was radicalized in the fever swamps of some obscure corner of the dark web. On the surface, Mangione may have just been a fundamentally normal guy who snapped. Or maybe the killing demonstrates how mainstream political violence is becoming.\n\nRead: Decivilization may already be under way\n\nA Goodreads profile that appears to have been Mangione's showed that he had read books written by the popular science writer Michael Pollan and by Dr. Seuss (he gave The Lorax a five-star review). On what is believed to be his X account, he followed a mélange of very popular (and ideologically mixed) people, including Joe Rogan, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ezra Klein, and Edward Snowden. In at least one instance, he praised Tucker Carlson's perspectives on postmodern architecture. His most extreme signal was a sympathetic review he gave to the manifesto written by Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. But as the writer Max Read points out , that's not uncommon for a lot of younger politically active people who identify with Kaczynski's environmentalist and anti-tech views, though it's unlikely many of them are in lockstep with the Unabomber's tactics.\n\nAgain, there are many unknowns about Mangione. Yet that has not stopped people from celebrating his purported cause; in fact, his bland social-media presence may only have made him easier to identify with. Jokes about Thompson's death have gone viral on virtually every social-media platform, and they have not stopped in the week since the shooting. People filled comment sections for videos and posts about the shooting with unsympathetic replies, pointing out UnitedHealthcare's reputation for denying claims, and ruminating on how much suffering Thompson was responsible for at the helm of the company. The Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit that monitors and analyzes online extremism, found that six of the top 10 most engaged-with posts on X about Thompson or UnitedHealthcare in the shooting's aftermath \"expressed explicit or implicit support for the killing or denigrated the victim.\" These responses weren't politically divided either. When the conservatives Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro made videos complaining about people dancing on Thompson's grave, people pushed back in the comments and called the commentators out of touch.\n\nIn this way, Mangione's act and the response demarcate a new moment, one in which acts of political violence are no longer confined to extremists with fringe views, but widely accepted. This has been bubbling up for years: Jokes about \"eat the rich,\" guillotines, and class war have been memes for the young, online left since the late 2010s. Milder versions of this sentiment occasionally seeped out to wider audiences, such as last year, when people online applauded orca whales for attacking yachts in the Iberian Peninsula. Many young people are furious about the economic lot they have drawn by being born into an era of significant wealth inequality, and have made winking jokes about addressing it through violence. After Thompson's murder, this sentiment broke out of its containment walls, flooding comment sections and social-media feeds.\n\nThis response probably isn't an aberration, but instead is ascendant. America isn't yet experiencing its own Years of Lead -a period in Italy from the 1960s to the 1980s in which political violence and general upheaval became the norm in response to economic instability and rising extremism-but political violence in the U.S. is slowly yet steadily becoming more common. In the past several years , it has surged to the highest levels since the 1970s , and the majority of ideologically motivated homicides since 1990 have been committed by far-right extremists.\n\nRead: The new anarchy\n\nExperts have different theories as to what's driving this, but many agree that we're due for more acts of political violence before the trend dissipates. The response to Thompson's death isn't just people reveling in what they believe is vigilante justice-it may also be a sign of what's coming. As my colleague Adrienne LaFrance has written , \"Americans tend to underestimate political violence, as Italians at first did during the Years of Lead.\" Mangione's alleged act and the public response suggest that there's appetite for political, cause-oriented violence; that these acts may not be committed or applauded just by terminally online weirdos. There are millions of guys who view the world the way Mangione does, and millions more willing to cheer them on."

      "text": "The Coming Attack on an Essential Element of Women's Freedom\n\nNo-fault divorce has improved the lives of millions. Now some extreme Republicans want to abandon it.\n\nFor the past half century, many women in America have enjoyed an unprecedented degree of freedom and legal protection, not because of Roe v. Wade or antidiscrimination laws but because of something much less celebrated: \"no fault\" divorce. Beginning in the early 1970s, no-fault divorce enabled millions of people, most of them women , to file for divorce over \"irreconcilable differences\" or the equivalent without having to prove misconduct by a spouse-such as adultery, domestic violence, bigamy, cruelty, abandonment, or impotence.\n\nBut now conservative politicians in states such as Texas and Louisiana , as well as a devoutly Catholic husband who tried to halt his wife's divorce efforts in Nebraska , are attacking no-fault divorce. One of the more alarming steps taken in that direction came from the Texas Republican Party, whose 2022 platform called on the legislature to \"rescind unilateral no-fault divorce laws and support covenant marriage.\" Given the Republican Party's control of the offices of governor, secretary of state, and attorney general, and both chambers of the state legislature, Texas has a chance of actually doing it.\n\nUntil 1857 , divorce in England-whose ecclesiastical laws formed the basis of divorce laws in most American colonies outside New England-was available only through an act of Parliament. A total of 324 couples managed to secure one; only four of those were initiated by women. Husbands could divorce their wives based solely on adultery, but women had to prove additional aggravating circumstances. Proof of brutality, rape, or desertion was considered insufficient to support a divorce. Not until 1801 did a woman, Jane Addison, finally win a divorce based on adultery alone.\n\nHelen Lewis: The conservative case for liberalizing divorce\n\nDivorce in the American colonies was often decided by governors , while colonial courts required the innocent spouse to prove marital fault by the other, making divorce virtually nonexistent. Married women were mostly bound by laws of \" coverture ,\" which, in the words of the English jurist William Blackstone, meant that \"by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in the law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband: under whose wing, protection, and cover, she performs every thing.\" As recounted by the historian Catherine Allgor, American women had no right to enter into contracts or independently own property, including their own wages and \"the clothes on their backs.\" Mothers lacked basic parental rights, too, \"so that if a wife divorced or left a husband, she would not see her children again.\"\n\nState standards for divorce varied, including the number of times a man could assault his wife before divorce was allowed. (Marital rape was not illegal in all 50 states until 1993.) In 1861 , a judge in New York City ruled that \"one or two acts of cruel treatment\" were not sufficient grounds to grant a woman a divorce, even after her husband beat her unconscious with a piece of wood during a fight over the family dog sleeping in their bed. The judge wrote that \"the wife should not seek on slight provocation to dissolve that sacred tie which binds her to her husband for life, for better or worse.\" As if the privacy intrusions of a trial were not enough, newspapers routinely publicized divorce cases, often blaming the woman without mentioning her abuse. Norms of \"regular marriage\" even made their way into national politics when, two months before the Civil War began, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the analogy in a speech accusing the South of wanting a \"'free love' arrangement\" based on \"passional attraction\" rather than fidelity to the Union.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, conservative commentators today claim that no-fault-divorce laws destroy the sanctity of marriage and disfavor men. The blogger and Daily Wire host Matt Walsh tweeted this year that no-fault divorce should be abolished. He once tweeted that \"no fault divorce grants one person the ability to break the contract without the consent of the other. What kind of contract is that?\" The right-wing YouTube personality Steven Crowder has argued that \"no-fault divorce ... means that in many of these states if a woman cheats on you, she leaves, she takes half. So it's not no-fault, it's the fault of the man.\" Elsewhere, he claimed, \"If you're a woman that comes from meager means, and you want to get wealthy-you've never worked, you didn't get a degree, you have no skill set, but you're good-looking-your best path to victory is simply to marry a man, leave him, and take half.\"\n\nRepublican Senator J. D. Vance of Ohio picked up the argument on the campaign trail last September, stating, \"One of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace ... is the idea that, like, 'Well, okay, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy. And so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that's going to make people happier in the long term.'\"\n\nOlga Khazan: The high cost of divorce\n\nExcept no-fault-divorce laws did make women happier. Prior to California's Family Law Act of 1969, which was signed into law by then-Governor Ronald Reagan, all states followed a fault-based system in which divorces were granted very sparingly under strict criteria. Women who wanted out of a bad marriage had little choice but to stay, because most were family caregivers who would wind up destitute without a judicial division of assets. The tight legal controls also led to highly adversarial proceedings and regularized lying in order to secure a divorce decree. Estranged couples fled to more liberal states known as \"divorce colonies\" simply to end a marriage. It was not until 1949 that divorce was legal at all in South Carolina. Although many states still retain the option of fault-based grounds for divorce, which arguably can carry the benefits of avoiding mandatory separation periods and a greater share of marital assets for the spouse who files for divorce, the last to abandon mandatory proof of fault was New York , in 2010. Late-stage opponents responsible for New York's delay in the movement included the Roman Catholic Church and some women's-rights groups fearful that no-fault divorce would diminish women's leverage to obtain favorable alimony or child-support awards.\n\nNo-fault divorce managed to meaningfully shift the power balance in marriage relationships: Women now had the option of leaving without their husband's permission. From 1976 to 1985, states that adopted no-fault divorce saw their overall domestic-violence rates plummet by a quarter to one-half, including in relationships that did not end in divorce. The number of women murdered by \"intimates\" declined by 10 percent. Female suicide rates also fell immediately in states that moved to unilateral divorce, a downward trend that continued for the next decade. Researchers have theorized that many women \"derive a life-preserving benefit from divorce,\" because under the threat of divorce, \"the husband ... behaves himself, thereby reducing the incidence of domestic violence and spousal homicide.\"\n\nFederal law allows for state legislatures to easily roll back women's ability to initiate divorce without spousal consent or proof of abuse. Although the Supreme Court recognized in 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges that state laws must yield to federal rights protecting same-sex marriage, nothing in the Constitution or the Court's precedent clearly prevents states from reversing no-fault divorce.\n\nThe writer and attorney Beverly Willett, an opponent of no-fault divorce, has argued that \"unilateral no-fault divorce clearly violates the 14th Amendment,\" supposedly depriving defendants in divorce cases \"of life, liberty, and property without due process of law.\" This argument has it exactly backwards. There is no express \"right\" to marriage in the Constitution. Although troubling vestiges of legal coverture still linger in American law, women these days are not considered legal \"property\" to which a man's constitutional due-process rights could conceivably attach.\n\nAs for due-process protections for liberty (which the Supreme Court has described as \"not confined to mere freedom from bodily restraint,\" but instead inclusive of \"the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue\"), that right more compellingly protects the person seeking to end a marriage-and to do so without having to prove to the government that she deserves it."

      "text": "Twitter Is a Far-Right Social Network\n\nIt can no longer be denied.\n\nTwitter has long been described, even by its most ardent users, as a hellsite. But under Elon Musk, Twitter has evolved into a platform that is indistinguishable from the wastelands of alternative social-media sites such as Truth Social and Parler. It is now a right-wing social network.\n\nIn December, I argued that if we are to judge Musk strictly by his actions as Twitter's owner, it is accurate to call him a far-right activist. As a public figure, he has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the right's culture war against progressivism-which he refers to as \"the woke mind virus\"-and his $44 billion Twitter purchase can easily be seen as an explicitly political act to advance this specific ideology. Now the site itself has unquestionably transformed under his leadership into an alternative social-media platform-one that offers a haven to far-right influencers and advances the interests, prejudices, and conspiracy theories of the right wing of American politics.\n\nRead: Elon Musk is a far-right activist\n\nEarlier today, NBC News reported that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is slated to kick off his 2024 presidential campaign in a Twitter Spaces event with Musk. Twitter, quite literally, is a launch pad for right-wing political leaders. Also today, The Daily Wire , the conservative-media juggernaut that is home to Ben Shapiro as well as the political commentators Matt Walsh and Michael Knowles, who are known for arguing against trans rights, announced it would bring its entire slate of podcasts to Twitter starting next week. And earlier this month, the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson announced that he would take his prime-time-show format-a dog-whistling broadcast style known for its fearmongering and bigotry-to Musk's platform.\n\nBoth Carlson and certain Daily Wire hosts have been deplatformed elsewhere-Carlson, of course, only recently lost his sinecure on cable, and Walsh had his popular YouTube channel demonetized over his transphobic commentary. And although they reportedly haven't brokered official deals with the platform, Carlson and The Daily Wire will likely make use of Twitter's new subscription features and ad-revenue sharing to monetize their audiences.\n\nThis should feel familiar. Twitter is essentially following the playbook of platforms like Rumble , which used to be the go-tos for canceled and deplatformed right-wingers seeking a soft landing and the promise of revenue. Like Rumble, which pivoted from a struggling YouTube alternative into a full-fledged far-right platform in the late 2010s, Twitter appears to be dipping into the well of popular right-wing shock jocks as a way to revive the financially adrift website.\n\nRead: What if Rumble is the future of the social web?\n\nThe move makes sense. In just a few months, Musk has actively worked to elevate a particular right-wing, anti-woke ideology. He has reinstated legions of accounts that were previously banned for violating Twitter's rules and has emboldened trolls, white-nationalist accounts, and January 6 defendants. Musk's own rhetoric has moved from trolling to dog whistling to outright conspiracy peddling, and it has intensified in recent months, culminating in his recent anti-Semitic remarks about George Soros. A stroll through Musk's replies on the site reveals the extent to which one of the richest men in the world spends his time replying to far-right influencers and nodding in approval to their racist memes.\n\nA social-media platform will always reflect the values of its owners, and Twitter's credo is nearly identical to that of the lesser-known alt-tech sites. Despite appearing to cave to the demands of autocratic governments and censoring links to competing platforms, Musk has attempted to position himself as a free-speech absolutist, similar to his right-wing-activist peers. Before shutting down after a failed acquisition by Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) , Parler billed itself as the \"free-speech social platform.\" Truth Social, a website backed in part by Donald Trump, says it encourages \"an open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating on the basis of political ideology.\" This language is indistinguishable from the way that Carlson spoke of Musk's Twitter, arguing that \"there aren't many platforms left that allow free speech,\" and that the site is \"the last big one remaining in the world.\" If it acts like a right-wing website and markets itself as a right-wing website, it just might be a right-wing website.\n\nTwitter has so fully assumed the role of a far-right platform that it might be killing its competitors. When Parler shut down in April, its parent company noted that \"no reasonable person believes that a Twitter clone just for conservatives is a viable business any more.\" Left unspoken is the reason: Twitter has become a right-wing echo chamber.\n\nIf Musk weren't too preoccupied lapping up approval from trolls, reactionaries, and Dogecoin enthusiasts-a few of the constituencies left on his site that still seem to adore him-the Parler statement should worry him. Right-wing alt-tech platforms may attract investors and a flood of indignant new users with persecution complexes, but they are, ultimately, bad businesses. That's precisely because they lack the one thing that fuels far-right discourse: a way to own the libs. A culture war is no fun if there's no actual conflict, and although some journalists and pundit diehards remain, many of Twitter's prolific users are posting less and on different platforms. Social-media platforms that cater to the right's ideology eventually become tired and predictable-the result of the same loud people shaking their fist at digital clouds. History has shown us that there are plenty of ways a social network can die, but the quickest way is boredom."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe morning after the election, a second result emerged beside the blindingly obvious one that Donald Trump will once again be president of the United States: In some places, abortion rights remained a winning issue.\n\nBallot measures to expand abortion access passed in seven states, including Missouri, Arizona, and Montana, three places that Trump won. Previous polling and election outcomes had shown that most Americans support abortion rights. Less clear was how they'd behave with Trump on the ballot. The issue of abortion may have shed its partisan salience-just not in a way that helped Kamala Harris and other Democrats. Abortion access \"is becoming less partisan, ironically, in the sense that Republicans and independents are more likely to support abortion rights,\" Mary Ziegler, a law professor at UC Davis and an Atlantic contributor, told me, \"while not translating that into support for Democratic candidates.\"\n\nFor Democrats and abortion-rights activists, last night's referenda were glittering pinpricks of light in an otherwise long, dark night of defeats. The White House-gone; control of the Senate-gone; the House of Representatives- clearly leaning Republican. Missouri, which went for Trump by 18 percent and had one of the strictest abortion bans in America, voted 52 to 48 percent to establish a constitutional guarantee to the \"fundamental right to reproductive freedom.\" Similar measures passed in Arizona and Montana, by 23 and 15 points so far, respectively. Four other states-Nevada, Maryland, New York, and Colorado-passed their own abortion measures, though these were less politically revealing, given the existing abortion-rights protections there.\n\nNot all the news was rosy for abortion-rights activists. Ballot measures failed in Nebraska by 2.6 points and in South Dakota by 17. Different reasons might account for those losses, Ziegler said. Nebraska had two abortion referenda on the ballot, each proposing contrary changes to state law, which could easily have confused voters. In Florida, a large majority of voters did support an effort to overturn the state's six-week abortion ban-but it fell a few points short of the 60 percent needed to pass.\n\nThose three state results were the biggest wins the anti-abortion movement has achieved since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Expect to hear this example touted more widely, Ziegler said. \"Activists will take that to Republicans and say, 'Hey, you don't need to be afraid of being pro-life. You can take aggressive positions,'\" she told me. \"This should be a huge encouragement to the pro-life movement,\" the conservative political commentator Matt Walsh wrote on X yesterday afternoon. \"We have a lot of work to do. But the people are on our side.\"\n\nThat would be an overstatement, based on last night's results. Harris had worked to make abortion rights a strong campaign issue-though not enough, evidently, to carry her party to victory. But abortion-rights groups achieved victories in spite of the Democrats' failed presidential efforts. Several factors are involved: Abortion access is popular. And Trump, through his chaotic and confusing abortion tightrope walk, may have successfully neutralized the issue for now, for his voters: assuring enough pro-choice voters that he would protect their reproductive rights, while hanging on to pro-life base voters who want him to further restrict abortion access. \"Trump created this possibility of being all things to all people,\" Ziegler told me.\n\nListen: Are we living in a different America?\n\nBut when you're president, you have to pick. A near future in which Trump continues to downplay any talk of restricting abortion and focuses instead on issues that do not divide his voter coalition, such as immigration, is easy to imagine. \"And then there's a scenario where he doesn't, and the partisan divide springs back as ever,\" Ziegler said. If that happens, then what the anti-abortion movement will be demanding from a second Trump administration is immediate executive action to restrict abortion. That could mean appointments of committed anti-abortion officials to important Cabinet positions-former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell for attorney general, say, or Heritage Foundation adviser Roger Severino as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. It could also involve a reinterpretation of the Comstock Act, which could see abortion banned across the country de facto, without any congressional legislative action at all.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement may not be successful in these maneuvers. Little suggests, right now, that Trump is interested in cementing his legacy as the most pro-life president in history. But the one thing Americans can almost certainly count on is a slew of new anti-abortion judges appointed to the federal courts. Conservative groups are already floating favored names-such as the Fifth Circuit's James Ho and Kristen Waggoner, the chief executive of the pro-life group Alliance Defending Freedom-for the Supreme Court. With a Republican Senate, these could be easy appointments. \"That may be how Trump has his cake and eats it too,\" Ziegler said. \"Put conservatives on the courts, and their decisions may not happen until years after he's no longer in office.\"\n\nAfter last night, abortion-rights activists can take a measure of comfort in the confirmation that their position is still popular. But cutting against that is the fact that abortion rights are no cure-all for Democrats-especially when the leader of the Republican Party has apparently managed to detoxify the issue."

      "text": "Trump's Followers Are Living in a Dark Fantasy\n\nMAGA adherents deny and dismiss what they are a part of, but they believe Trump's lies, and will support him until the end.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nA t a rally just outside Atlanta in late October, thousands of Donald Trump supporters lined up in the punishing southern sun to see their hero; some had driven hours from out of state. Vendors hawked T-shirts with slogans such as Say no to the ho , and Roses are red, Hunter smokes crack, Joe Biden has dementia and Kamala isn't Black , sometimes chanting the phrases out loud to amused onlookers.\n\nHundreds of people still standing in the winding queue shuffled off into a disappointed crowd when told that the venue was now full. Many hung around outside, browsing the vendors' wares or grabbing a bite at one of the nearby food trucks. They were there to see Trump, but also to enjoy the sense of belonging that comes from being surrounded by the like-minded. They were there to see and be seen, dressed in MAGA hats, MAGA shirts, MAGA tights. Service dogs decked out in stars and stripes, men in silk shirts printed with an image of a bloodied Trump raising his fist. As \"Y.M.C.A.\" blared from inside the venue, Trump supporters stopped their conversations to sing along and shape their arms with the chorus.\n\nThe first time Trump ran for president as a Republican, when I spoke with his followers I encountered a superficial denial of Trump's prejudice that suggested a quiet approval of it. They would deny that Trump made bigoted remarks or proposed discriminatory policies while also defending those remarks and policies as necessary. What I found this time around were people who were far more deeply embedded in an unreality carefully molded by the Trump campaign and right-wing media to foment a sense of crisis-and a belief that they were being exploited by a shadowy conspiracy that Trump alone could vanquish. Whereas many supporters I spoke with at rallies in 2016 rationalized or dismissed Trump's yarns as exaggerations or bombast, in 2024 they would repeat them solemnly and earnestly, as gospel.\n\nThe conspiracy theories, particularly surrounding immigration, are significant because they justify extreme measures-Trump's promises to strip critical news outlets of their broadcast licenses, prosecute political rivals, and purge the federal government of \"the enemy within.\" Yet some supporters I spoke with also seemed either unaware or disbelieving of the plans that Trump and his allies have for a second administration. There is a disconnect between what Trump and his allies intend to do in power and what many of the people who would vote him in believe he would do.\n\nThis disconnect was apparent earlier in the 2024 campaign, when Democrats began attacking Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation \"blueprint\" for a second Trump administration. The agenda contemplates not only a political purge of the federal government, and a president who can order the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies, but drastic limits on abortion; drastic cuts to education, the social safety net, and efforts to fight climate change; and using federal powers to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Although Project 2025 was not affiliated with the campaign, it was largely a Trumpworld project, conceived by former Trump aides . Trump surmised that his own followers would not support what was in Project 2025 and distanced himself from it, posting late one night in July that he knew \"nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and unlike our very well received Republican Platform, had nothing to do with it.\" (CNN reported that at least 140 people who worked for Trump were involved in the project, including six of his former Cabinet members.) Its architects were left to quietly reassure their fellow travelers that he was saying this for political reasons. \"He's running against the brand,\" Russell Vought , a Project 2025 contributor and potential future Trump chief of staff , told an undercover reporter. \"He's very supportive of what we do.\"\n\nI noticed a particular disconnect on immigration; people I spoke with emphasized their support for legal immigration and, unlike Trump, did not single out particular ethnicities or nationalities for scorn. They said they would welcome anyone as long as they came legally. It's possible that this was merely something they were telling themselves they believed so as not to interrogate their own motives further. They were ultimately also in thrall to Trump's narrative about how Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were conspiring to repopulate the country with undocumented immigrants living on the dole at their expense. That fiction was not just a source of rage but a predicate for whatever radical action might be needed to rectify it.\n\nOne Trump voter I met among the cheerful crowd of supporters milling around outside a packed rally outside Atlanta, who identified himself only as Steve and said he worked in telecommunications, managed to touch on virtually every immigration conspiracy theory put forth by the Trump campaign in about 30 seconds. Yet even Steve told me the issue was people coming in illegally, not that they were coming in at all. \"You're not coming in legally; you're not pledging to the country; you're not saying you're going to support that country,\" Steve said.\n\nAdam Serwer: The cruelty is the point\n\nAnother Trump supporter named Rebecca Cruz told me, \"We need immigration in this country, but we need safe, safe immigration.\" Referring to the Biden administration, she explained that \"they take them from other countries, bringing them. They're going into certain countries, and they fly them in here ... because they want to destroy America. They hate what America stands for.\"\n\nA few days earlier, at another Trump rally, in Greenville, North Carolina, the crowd cheered when Trump demanded that news outlets be taken off the air for criticizing him or for giving positive coverage to Harris. They laughed when Trump played a bizarre video mocking trans people in the military. They cheered for the death penalty. They booed when Senator Ted Budd warned that Harris would let \"the illegals who are here ... use your taxpayer dollars for transgender surgeries.\" Trump insisted that \"Kamala Harris has imported an army of illegal-alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, not just South America.\" Trump repeated \"the Congo\" three times, in case the audience didn't understand that the immigrants he was attacking were Black. He would occasionally pay lip service to legal immigration, or vow to defend Americans of \"any color and creed,\" but this was only after invoking a litany of stereotypes designed to justify state violence against whichever marginalized group he had just finished demonizing.\n\nWhen I spoke with people one-on-one, they reflected back to me Trump's rhetoric, occasionally with a somewhat more human touch. A retired English teacher who did not want to give her name emphasized that \"I believe in immigration, but do it legally. Don't make your first act of coming to America be coming illegally ... We're taking away from servicing children who don't even get to eat because you're giving housing to the people coming in.\" Another retiree in North Carolina, named Theresa Paul, gave me a hard look and said she was supporting Trump because \"when you take illegals over our citizens, that's treason ... We're being worked to death, taxed to death, and for what? So we can put up people that's coming in illegally, and putting them up way superior to us.\" I asked her why she thought the Biden administration would want to do that. She grasped my arm lightly and said, \"To replace us, right?\"\n\nI began to realize that these Trump fans-diehards though they may be-represent a distinct space in the MAGA landscape. They enjoy his cruelty, seeing it as righteous vengeance for the constellation of wrongs they have been told they are the victims of, but they aren't the architects of these conspiracy theories, and neither do they stand to profit from them. Their conspiracism serves to distract them from Trump's actual policy agenda and his authoritarian ambitions.\n\nThere are, I've come to see, three circles of MAGA that make up the Trump coalition. The innermost circle comprises the most loyal Trump allies, who wish to combine a traditional conservative agenda of gutting the welfare state and redistributing income upward while executing by force a radical social reengineering of America to resemble right-wing nostalgia of the 1950s. Trump's advisers and other conservative-movement figures understand Trump's populism as a smoke screen designed to conceal their agenda of cutting taxes for the wealthy , banning abortion , eviscerating the social safety net, and slashing funding for education , health care , and other support for low-income people . All of this is consistent with how Trump governed when he was in the White House , although many people seem to have forgotten what he was actually like. This faction wants a government that works to preserve traditional hierarchies of race, gender, and religion, or at least one that does not seek to interfere with what it sees as the natural order of things.\n\nThis innermost circle includes legislative allies such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act; policy aides such as Vought, who has spoken of mass deportation as a means to \" end multiculturalism \"; and elite backers such as Elon Musk, who hopes to use his influence to inflict hardship on Americans by dramatically cutting the welfare state so that he can reduce his own tax burden . It is no coincidence that Musk has transformed the social network formerly known as Twitter into a haven for racist pseudoscience that he himself consciously amplifies.\n\nThis faction also includes those far-right figures who are not official members of Trumpworld but who see the reality-show star as a champion of a resurgent white-nationalist identity. These people understand what Trumpism's goals are, and most of them also understand that, absent the particular devotion Trump inspires, their plans would not be politically viable.\n\nThere is a second, slightly larger circle around this first one, comprising devoted Trump fans. These fans are the primary target for a sanitized version of the \"Great Replacement\" theory, which holds that American elites have conspired to dispossess them of what they have in order to give it to unauthorized immigrants who do not belong. They are not ideologically hostile to the welfare state-indeed, many of them value it-but they believe it is being wasted on those who have no claim to it. People in this circle are acting rationally in response to conspiracy theories they have chosen to believe, and are bewildered by those who refuse to acknowledge what they are certain is true. This bewilderment serves only to further cement their feeling that they are the victims of an elite plot to take from them that which they deserve. This is the group you might refer to as true believers.\n\nIn a different political and informational environment, many of these true believers would be unlikely to support the Project 2025 agenda-or at least not much of it-but here they are so isolated from mainstream news sources that they believe Trump's claims that he has no ties to it, and that he has their best interests in mind because \"he cannot be bought\" by the same elites they believe are responsible for their hardships.\n\nThen there is the outer circle: Americans with conservative beliefs who may be uneasy about Trump but whose identification with conservative principles and the Republican Party mean they wish to persuade themselves to vote for the Republican candidate. They may be ardently anti-abortion, or small-business owners, or deeply religious. They do not believe everything Trump says; in fact, their approach to the man is dismissiveness. These are voters who fall into what my colleague David Graham calls the \"believability gap.\" They don't like Trump's authoritarian rhetoric but also don't think he will follow through with it. This is the \" What's the downside for humoring him? \" faction.\n\nThis group of Trump voters treat his authoritarianism as mere bombast or as exaggerations from the media, seeing this election as an ordinary one in which a party with a bad economic record should be replaced by a party with a better one, not an election in which a man who tried to destroy American democracy is running for a chance to finish the job.\n\nDenial is the mortar that holds the three MAGA circles together. The innermost circle denies the radicalism of its agenda to the middle ring of fervent Trump supporters, presenting any criticism as the lies of the same liberal elites responsible for dispossessing real Americans of what is owed them. The outer circle treats Trump's authoritarianism and racism as regrettable and perhaps too colorful, but equivalent or similar to other common character defects possessed by all politicians. To acknowledge the liberal critique of Trump as correct would amount to a painful step away from a settled political identity that these outer-circle members are not willing to take-they would have to join the Never Trumpers in exile.\n\nAs different as some of the people I spoke with at these Trump rallies could be, when they went into the crowd, they experienced the ecstasy of the cruelties they would perhaps not allow themselves to indulge in alone. The rationalizations and explanations and denial melted away. They understood that they were there to mock and condemn those they hate and fear, and to listen to all of Trump's vows to punish them.\n\nA person, alone in conversation, can be rational. People, in a crowd, become something else.\n\nC onspiracism is not an inherently right-wing indulgence. After September 11, many in liberal circles fell for nonsense alleging that the Bush administration was secretly behind the attacks. After George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, some liberals indulged absurd theories about voting machines in Ohio switching votes and thus delivering the state to Bush. More recently, conspiracy theories about the assassination attempt on Trump being staged spread in certain liberal circles online .\n\nPolitical leaders, intellectuals, and public figures can play a crucial role in containing such conspiracism. Democratic leaders shamed 9/11 truthers out of the party. John Kerry conceded the election rather than champion baseless allegations about voter fraud. Unlike Trump, who gleefully promoted conspiracy theories around the violent assault on Nancy Pelosi's husband, no prominent Democrats embraced any of the conspiracy theories that emerged about the attempt on Trump's life. But when elites cultivate and indulge conspiracism-when they exploit it-they can create the conditions for authoritarianism and political violence.\n\n\"In social movements ... conspiracy theories that may be absurd and specious on their face nevertheless contain valid information about the motivations, grievances, insecurities, and even panics among their promoters, so they cannot be simply dismissed,\" the historian Linda Gordon wrote in The Second Coming of the KKK . \"Among Klan leaders, conspiracy theories also did a great deal of organizing work: they provided identifiable and unifying targets, supplying a bonding function that explanations based on historical analyses do not deliver.\" Political and national identities of any ideology can be forged by the sense that some part of your identity is under assault. When that assault does not truly exist, conspiracism can provide it.\n\nTrumpist conspiracy theories perform a similar function. In his stump speeches, the former president calls the United States an \"occupied country\" that will be \"liberated\" from criminal migrants when he retakes power. He tells his audience that crime by undocumented immigrants is not simply a social problem that might be solved with more restrictive immigration policy but a deliberate plan by those in office. \"Kamala is importing millions of illegals across our borders and giving them taxpayer benefits at your expense,\" Trump declared in Greenville.\n\nHumiliation is an essential part of the Trumpist style. Trump appeals to his audiences' pride by telling them they have been hoodwinked by their adversaries, but that he has the power to avenge this injustice. Invoking that sense of humiliation is part of how he primes his audiences to be manipulated, knowing that their sense of shame will make them both angry and eager to reassert that pride. It is one of the most obvious con-man tricks in history-you got scammed, you paid too much, but if you give me your money, I'll get you a better deal-and it has worked on tens of millions of Americans for a decade.\n\nRead: The malignant cruelty of Donald Trump\n\nThese conspiracy theories create communities that are hostile to dissenters, and they legitimize radical, even violent actions. This is how thousands of Trump supporters ended up ransacking the Capital on January 6, 2021, hoping to overturn an election on the basis of a conspiracy theory about voting machines, spread by elite figures who knew it to be false . The Dominion lawsuit against Fox News and the c ongressional inquiry into January 6 revealed that although much of the right-wing leadership class understand they have created a monster they cannot control, they lack the courage to confront it. Trump and his closest aides, by contrast, are well aware of the hold they have on their audience and see it as useful for their own purposes.\n\n\"Before they seize power and establish a world according to their doctrines,\" Hannah Arendt wrote, \"totalitarian movements conjure up a lying world of consistency which is more adequate to the needs of the human mind than reality itself; in which, through sheer imagination, uprooted masses can feel at home and are spared the never-ending shocks which real life and real experiences deal to human beings and their expectations.\" Trumpism is neither Nazism nor Stalinism, but Arendt's observation about people living in a universe of complete unreality still applies.\n\nAll of us navigate the world on the basis of information sources we trust, and millions of people trust Donald Trump. Understanding his longevity is perhaps impossible absent an information environment in which people come to passionately believe things that are not true. This is not a false-consciousness argument. If banning abortion matters more to you than raising the minimum wage, and you make your choice with that in mind, that is your right as a voter. But that decision should be based on values, not on a universe of unreality.\n\nThe former president and his surrogates have woven a totalizing conspiracy theory in which virtually every problem facing the nation can be laid at the feet of immigration. Violent crime is rising because of immigrants ( it isn't ). Democrats are chartering planes from other countries to bring in illegal immigrants ( they aren't ), whom they are paying to come ( it's not happening ) and who are smuggling in fentanyl (it's overwhelmingly citizens who are doing the smuggling, actually) , in the hopes that these illegal immigrants will vote for them ( they can't vote , and they wouldn't necessarily vote for Democrats if they could ). Immigrants are the main reason for the housing crisis (they aren't- it's a lack of supply ); they're getting FEMA money meant for citizens affected by the hurricanes in the South ( wrong ); and none of this would have happened if Biden and Harris hadn't opened the border (the Biden administration is on pace to match Trump's border deportations ) to undocumented immigrants who don't pay taxes ( false ). There really was a rise in illegal border crossings after the pandemic , but the response of the Democratic Party was to move closer to Trump's positions on immigration.\n\nNor will mass deportation, framed as a means to fight crime, resolve any of these issues. Mass deportation will not raise wages . It will not make housing less expensive . It will not create jobs . It will not make the welfare state more generous to those who need its assistance. And indeed, during Trump's term as president, his administration shirked prosecuting undocumented criminals in favor of destroying families and removing as many people as possible, regardless of what roots they might have established. Trump aides are planning an attack on the kind of legal immigration that supporters at his rallies repeatedly told me they wanted-an attack that, if prior experience holds, will take precedence over enforcing the law against criminals.\n\nBut for some today, just as in the past, the presence of immigrants threatens a \"dominance\" that, as Gordon wrote of the 1920s, \"many white native-born Protestants considered a form of social property.\" It is an odd but insufficient sign of progress that such status anxiety is no longer confined to white, Protestant, or native-born people-the irony is that America is such a powerful machine of assimilation that the ascendant reactionary coalition includes millions of people descended from those once deemed unassimilable aliens by their predecessors movements. Unfortunately, lies and conspiracy theories directed at those we see as unlike us are far more likely to be believed.\n\nLike Trump's lies about voter fraud in 2020, the conspiracy theories about immigration are important not because there is truth to them but because they forge a political identity that is not amenable to fact-checking or correction. It does not matter if the \"voter fraud\" in 2020 did not happen; believing that it did expresses the symbolic view that the opposing coalition should not be considered truly American. To point out that very little of what Trump and his allies say about immigration is factual cannot dispel the worldview that causes one to embrace it: that the America you know has been stolen by people who have no claim to it.\n\nThe workings of American immigration policy are complicated, though, and any sufficiently complicated process can appear to someone who doesn't understand it as a conspiracy-if you don't understand the weather, for example, you might think the U.S. government has a hurricane gun it can aim with pinpoint accuracy at Republican-majority districts . If you don't understand something-and if understanding it might leave your conception of your own identity teetering, Jenga-like-it is much easier to believe what the people you love and trust are telling you, even if that thing is untrue.\n\nPerhaps most important, the breadth of the conspiracy and the power of the conspirators place any solutions beyond the reach of ordinary politics. At the rally prior to the storming of the Capitol, Trump warned the audience that \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Then he retreated to the safety of the White House and watched the mob attack Congress, hoping that by some miracle his supporters would succeed in keeping him in power by force. In such dire circumstances, only a messianic figure will rescue the virtuous from the corrupt. The logic of grand conspiracy thus elevates the strongman.\n\nIn the conspiracist mind, Trump is not simply the only logical solution but the only hope, the only man not compromised by the grand cabal that opposes him and its puppet politicians. Trump's followers are convinced that Trump's wealth means he cannot be bought. Few politicians have ever been more clearly for sale .\n\nD oubtlessly , many liberals would deny a distinction between the devotion of Trump supporters who flock to his rallies and the ideological vanguard that aims to use him as a vehicle to remake the country. While I was out reporting this story, The Atlantic published an account of how, according to Trump's former chief of staff General John Kelly, Trump spoke admiringly of Adolf Hitler and his generals . Typically, when I go out to rallies, I do not argue with voters or offer my own views, because I am there to find out what they believe and why. But because of my affiliation with The Atlantic , several people I spoke with asked me to explain my views-occasionally referring to the story as \"fake news\" or \"Democrats calling Trump Hitler,\" having heard the story wrongly characterized this way.\n\nIn one exchange, I mentioned that as a man married to a woman born to a West African immigrant father, I did not appreciate Trump's remarks about Black immigrants, and recounted the story of Trump complaining about not wanting immigrants from \"shithole countries.\" The Trump supporter had not heard of the 2018 incident and refused to believe that it had occurred as I relayed it.\n\nIn two other conversations, when asked about my views, I explained that, as a Texan, if I choose to have another child, I have to worry that if something goes wrong, doctors may refuse to treat my wife because of the state's abortion ban. Doctors in Texas are afraid to provide lifesaving medical care to mothers with pregnancy complications because the Republican-controlled state government has passed laws that punish abortion providers with steep fines, loss of their medical license, and jail time. The Texas courts have repeatedly refused to clarify or expand the exceptions to the ban-these exceptions are simply meant to ensure sufficient political support for those bans. Because of this, Texas parents have to roll the dice with a pregnancy, knowing that their existing children may end up without a mother.\n\nNot only did the people I spoke with react in disbelief that an abortion ban would be so strict; they did not believe that a doctor would refuse to treat a woman until she was at death's door. Last week, ProPublica reported that a Texas mother, Josseli Barnica, died after doctors thought it would be a \"crime\" to treat her while she was having a miscarriage. ProPublica also reported that in 2023, a pregnant teenager from Vidor, Nevaeh Crain, died after three emergency rooms refused to treat her. Texas has fought the Biden administration's attempt to set federal rules allowing emergency abortions. Last month, the Supreme Court let a ruling siding with Texas remain in place.\n\nRead: Gullible Mr. Trump\n\nThere is a distance between the views of many of the most ardent Trump fans and the policy goals of the people they would put in power. The innermost MAGA circle understands this, even if many of the people whose votes they rely on don't. This is why the role played by Fox News and other conservative media outlets is so crucial-not only in maintaining a sense of conspiracism and emotional siege but in ensuring that stories about women like Barnica and Crain never reach the eyes and ears of their audience.\n\nThis is an observation, not an excuse. In a democracy, citizens are responsible for knowing the consequences of their votes. They are responsible for not being enthralled by a jumped-up con man who tells them flattering lies. They are responsible for knowing the difference between fact and fiction. And yet few of us would find it easy to extract ourselves from a social universe in which belief in those fictions is a requirement for good standing.\n\nTrump rallies are where the mask usually comes off. At the rallies, the different circles of MAGA lose their distinctiveness; in the anonymity and unity of the crowd, they can indulge the feelings of anger and hatred without the oversensitive, judgmental liberals of the outside world making them feel ashamed. Here, they can be themselves.\n\nThis is why the insult comedian Tony Hinchcliffe thought he was in the right place to call Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage\" at Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden in late October. \"These are the kind of jokes that normal people tell,\" the conservative media figure Matt Walsh declared . Hinchcliffe was hardly an outlier. Other speakers that night called Harris a prostitute, \"the anti-Christ,\" \"the devil.\" The disgraced former Fox News host Tucker Carlson mocked Harris as \"the first Samoan Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president.\"\n\nThe big mistake made by Hinchcliffe was that, in wrestling parlance, he broke kayfabe. The Trump campaign has fine-tuned its line-stepping over the years, invoking racist stereotypes with just the thinnest veneer of deniability, the better to cast liberal criticism as hypersensitive hysteria. In 2016, Trump campaigned on banning Muslims writ large, not just jihadist terrorists. In 2020, he publicly vowed to meet the nationwide Black-rights protests with violence. In 2024, Trumpism remains a politics of bullying marginalized groups and framing those unwilling to do so as possessing a lack of virtue. Do you want to coddle murderous illegal aliens? Do you want men in women's sports? Why are you okay with gangs taking over our cities?\n\nTrump's agenda of using state power to maintain traditional American hierarchies of race, religion, and gender has not changed. But for much of his 2024 run, the sweeping generalizations of previous outings resembled more traditional dog whistling with superficially plausible connections to actual policy concerns. The shift can be imperceptible to people who have paid close attention to politics-Trump's personality and ideology have not really changed-but to those who have not, his racial animus and misogyny are less obvious. About two-thirds of Hispanic voters in one recent poll said that Trump's attacks on immigration were not directed at them.\n\nThe rightward shift of some Hispanic and Black voters seems to have persuaded the Trump campaign to tone down the explicit racial stereotyping of his previous campaigns, though not the promises to use state power to crush his political enemies. But when you put a guy in front of a Trump campaign sign to warm up the crowd with hacky jokes about Black people liking watermelon, it gets harder to suspend disbelief.\n\nAmid the comedian's insult to Puerto Rico and the barrage of racist stereotypes-not only about Black people and Puerto Ricans, but about Jews being cheap and Palestinians being terrorists-the word routine takes on another meaning: dull, tedious, boring. Yet the line about Puerto Rico broke through, and a growing list of Puerto Rican celebrities are now endorsing Harris, and perhaps moving crucial Hispanic votes in key swing states to her column.\n\nThe crisis caused by Hinchcliffe's routine and remarks by other speakers that night is that they troubled voters in that outer MAGA circle by briefly revealing what Trump's entourage actually believes-that when Stephen Miller says \" America is for Americans and Americans only ,\" he is referring to a very limited number of people. The event pierced the veil of denial for those who are otherwise inclined to dismiss such criticisms as the tedious whining of an oversensitive age.\n\nThe Puerto Rican Reggaeton singer Nicky Jam renounced his support for Trump after the rally, saying, \"Never in my life did I think that a month [after I appeared at a rally to support Trump] a comedian was going to come to criticize my country and speak badly of my country and therefore, I renounce any support for Donald Trump, and I sidestep any political situation.\" Those people who renounced their support for Trump after realizing that the contempt he has expressed for others also applies to people like them must understand: He was always talking about people like you, even when you didn't want to believe it.\n\nAt Trump rallies, the denial and the dismissal cease, and the nature of Trumpism is revealed. This is why, despite the fact that the Puerto Rico \"joke\" bombed at a comedy club the night before, Hinchcliffe thought everyone at the rally would love it . His set was not a divergence from Trumpism. It was ... Well, it was routine."

      "text": "The Real Christian Debate on Transgender Identity\n\nSome conservatives have made mocking remarks about Caitlyn Jenner, but their attitudes obscure deep, meaningful questions about the meaning of gender.\n\nThe two little letters carry a world of significance: he . Amid the wave of reaction to Caitlyn Jenner's announcement that she is a transgender woman, and her upcoming cover story in Vanity Fair , pronoun use has become a symbol of deep cultural divisions: Calling Jenner \"he\" versus \"she\" has important implications for the speaker's understanding of gender identity.\n\nSometimes, as Megan Garber wrote on Tuesday , pronoun awkwardness is a matter of confusion or lack of education; even well-meaning media outlets have made mistakes in covering Jenner's debut as a woman. But some reactions, particularly from conservative Christians, have reflected skepticism about the deeper claims of transgender identity.\n\nMatt Walsh, an often polemical conservative Christian blogger, wrote an article for The Blaze headlined, \"Bruce Jenner Is Not a Woman. He Is a Sick and Delusional Man.\" The charismatic Christian magazine Charisma News ran a story called \"Celebrating Confusion: The Crisis of Bruce (Not Caitlyn) Jenner.\" The pastor who ministers to the members of the ultra-conservative Duggar family, who star in the reality-television show 19 Kids and Counting and are currently experiencing their own share of media attention , said about Jenner, \"What's remarkable about this is the world is applauding.\" And speaking more broadly on transgender issues earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said , \"Now I wish that someone told me that when I was in high school that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take showers in PE. I'm pretty sure that I would have found my feminine side and said, 'Coach, I think I'd rather shower with the girls today.'\"\n\nAlthough many of these statements have come from conservative evangelical Christians, there's evidence that those in other denominations are also inclined to reject transgender identity. On Wednesday, the archbishop of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone, responded to the news of Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover at a conference, saying , \"The clear biological fact is that a human being is born either male or female.\" According to David Gibson of Religion News Service, \"Cordileone said a friend recently pointed out to him that a major university advertised housing 'for a grand total of 14 different gender identities. ... I'm sure even more will be invented as time goes on,' he said, prompting laughter from the audience of about 200.\"\n\nUnderstandably, these kinds of responses have prompted anger and hurt and condemnation from the LGBT community and beyond. There's a strong element of tone-deafness, even trolling, in calling someone who goes through this kind of vulnerable, public transition \"sick and delusional.\" But these negative reactions also suggest an important difference in understandings about what gender identity and sexuality actually mean-and indicate how difficult it will be to reconcile transgender identity with the beliefs of certain Christians, both culturally and politically.\n\nAfter Jenner revealed her struggle with gender identity in an interview with Diane Sawyer , the head of the ethics organization of the Southern Baptist Convention, Russell Moore, wrote, \"We do not see our transgendered neighbors as freaks to be despised. They feel alienated from their identities as men or women ... In a fallen universe, all of us are alienated, in some way, from who we were designed to be.\" But this empathy was accompanied by a statement of belief: Rejecting your gender, and particularly taking hormones or undergoing sex-change surgeries, does not fit with the Southern Baptist understanding of theology.\n\nMoore framed his position with the rhetoric of the culture war. \"The cultural narrative behind the transgender turn ... is rooted in the ancient heresy of Gnosticism, with the idea that the 'real' self is separate from who one is as an embodied, material being,\" he wrote. \"Our transgender neighbors experience real suffering ... the answers the culture and the Sexual Revolution-Industrial Complex offer can't relieve that suffering.\"\n\nSetting the initial-capped \"Sexual Revolution-Industrial Complex\" aside, this is a straightforward claim about the nature of existence: Individuals can't define the nature of their \"self\"; only God can. Feeling discomfort with yourself and alienated from the world is a normal part of being human, Moore is saying, but living as a Christian means accepting that Jesus, and not alterations of the body, is the salve to that feeling of alienation.\n\nThis is one person's interpretation of theology and how Christians should respond to transgender identity. There are also many , many , examples of Christians welcoming members of the trans community. Jenner herself identifies as a Christian and has at times been a regular church attendee. But these reactions also point to the challenges ahead as transgender issues-and individuals-become a more prominent part of culture.\n\n\"Many evangelicals, and probably most Americans, [believe] that sex and gender are the very same thing,\" said Sara Moslener, a professor at Central Michigan University who studies religion and sexuality. Outside of the LGBT community, many people haven't had significant exposure to transgender issues. And for those who look to their church and faith for guidance on sexuality and gender, Biblical teachings don't necessarily speak to the complexity of transgender identity. \"When evangelical Christians look at the Bible, they go to the creation story and say this is the story of Adam and Eve, this is how God created it,\" Moslener said.\n\nThese first-principle disagreements about the nature of gender and sexuality might stay contained within their respective spheres-some culturally conservative Christians will reject the choices of Caitlyn Jenner and her transgender peers, while many other Americans will choose to celebrate them. But from a legal perspective, the challenges are just beginning. In a panel discussion at a conference on religion and politics I attended this spring, John Inazu, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said transgender issues pose \"conceptual challenges\" to both liberals and conservatives: Equality for transgender people is a question of identity, not sexual practice. \"This plays out in institutional policies that are down to how many and where the bathroom is going to be and who plays on the sports teams,\" he added. \"These are all binary decisions, and they're zero sum, in some sense.\"\n\nIn other words, refusing to call Caitlyn Jenner \"she\" isn't just a question of etiquette or philosophy; it could have real implications for how policies are created in everyday communities. This is about being able to find a person at the DMV to change an \"M\" to an \"F;\" letting transgender girls join Girl Scout troops, creating protections against harassment and unequal treatment; and making sure people can get adequate medical care during a gender transition, if they so choose, and after.\n\nAnd in some cases, it may be about preventing irreversible tragedy. Late last year, 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn, a transgender teen from Ohio, committed suicide. In a note she posted to Tumblr, she wrote about her conservative Christian mother's reaction to her desire to start transitioning to a female identity: \"God doesn't make mistakes.\"\n\n\"I'm not against anybody. I'd just like for somebody to bring their brain to work some day and not leave it on the bed stand when they show up to govern,\" said Huckabee about recent ordinances concerning gender-neutral bathrooms. There is a difference between allowing people to hold their beliefs and allowing those beliefs to shape public policy; and there is a difference between holding beliefs and mocking those who believe differently. The adjustment period on this issue will be complicated. And as the response to Caitlyn Jenner has shown, it's only just beginning."

      "text": "DeSantis Is Making the Same Mistake Democrats Did in 2020\n\nTwitter is real life for the people who are on it, but most people are not. Politicians ignore this at their peril.\n\nRon DeSantis is the governor of one of the most scenic states in America. Reelected by eye-popping margins in 2022, he does not lack for superfans. And yet, instead of launching his presidential campaign in front of palm trees and adoring crowds, he did so last night on Twitter, in an awkward audio-only exchange with Elon Musk that took place after 25 minutes of excruciating technical difficulties.\n\nIt might seem strange for a presidential candidate who is arguing that Republicans should not tie their fortunes to an impulsive, internet-poisoned millionaire to announce his campaign by wedding it to an impulsive, internet-poisoned billionaire. But DeSantis's choice of venue makes sense in context: It is the latest in a series of appeals to his party's most online activists, who idolize individuals such as Musk and monopolize Twitter, the social-media site that Musk owns. Cultivating the base and wealthy donors is smart politics, and DeSantis is a better politician than both his progressive and pro-Trump critics admit. But as the Twitter-launch fiasco demonstrated, his obsession with the online could seriously hamper his prospects offline. Campaigns that mistake social-media virality for electoral reality tend to end poorly.\n\nOne of the many misguided lessons that politicians learned from Donald Trump's 2016 success was that Twitter wins elections. But in fact, Trump's first victory owed little to social media and more to traditional media. His candidacy capitalized on a decades-old reputation for business acumen that he had built through reality TV and the tabloids. The telegenic Trump then overwhelmed his Republican primary opponents by garnering ample media coverage, with cable news channels racing to air his raucous rallies live.\n\nBy contrast, one of the few things that even Trump's own supporters repeatedly told pollsters that they didn't like about him was ... his tweets . This shouldn't surprise. Social-media sites- and Twitter in particular -are rife with conspiracy theories, hoaxes, and niche jargon that have little resonance in the real world. This is why when politicians start talking like Twitter feeds, they start losing voters-which is exactly what happened to many Democrats in 2020.\n\nDavid Frum: DeSantis's launch was not the only thing that crashed\n\nConsider the case of \"Defund the police.\" That mantra, alongside its more radical cousin \"Abolish the police,\" emerged as a rallying cry during the 2020 protests after the killing of George Floyd, momentarily turning a previously marginal approach to policing into a mainstream one. Channeling righteous anger into a radical proposal, \"Defund\" quickly became an online litmus test, and many progressive politicians racked up retweets by embracing it. Judging by its online impact, the slogan was a smashing success.\n\nIt's also not how anyone in the Democratic Party talks today. \"I think allowing this moniker, 'defund the police,' to ever get out there, was not a good thing,\" Keith Ellison, the progressive Minnesota attorney general, told the Washington Post reporter David Weigel in November 2021. \"We should all agree that the answer is not to defund the police,\" said President Joe Biden in his first State of the Union address, to a bipartisan standing ovation. \"It's to fund the police-fund them!\" In late 2021, New York City elected Mayor Eric Adams, a Black former cop who promised to invest more in law enforcement, not less. This month, Philadelphia's Democratic primary voters picked Cherelle Parker, a Black city-council member with an uncompromising tough-on-crime platform , to be the city's likely next mayor. Meanwhile, Brandon Johnson, the newly elected mayor of Chicago, backed away from his previous \"defund\" position to secure his victory.\n\nWhat happened? It turned out that although defunding was popular among the activists who disproportionately drive online progressive discourse, it was deeply unpopular with voters. Polls found that most Americans, including Black voters , overwhelmingly rejected defunding the police, and the slogan proved to be a millstone around the neck of many candidates, even in relatively progressive regions. The Democratic lawmakers and donors who echoed this rhetoric neglected one basic truth: Twitter is real life for the people who are on it, but most people are not on Twitter. According to the Pew Research Center , just 23 percent of U.S. adults use Twitter, and of those , \"the most active 25% ... produced 97% of all tweets.\" Simply put, almost all tweets come from less than 6 percent of American adults-far from a representative slice of the broader public.\n\nRead: Twitter is a far-right social network\n\nBut one Democrat didn't fall into the Twitter trap. Not coincidentally, Joe Biden is now the president. In the 2020 Democratic primary, while his rivals competed to cater to the latest enthusiasms of the online left, the former vice president consolidated the party's more moderate mainstream. In the general election, Biden's aggressively offline campaign helped Democrats avoid the worst consequences of their 2020 Twitter excesses, as he was not implicated in them, and tended to treat social media as a place to be managed by staffers, not mirrored by the candidate. Trump, on the other hand, dove down every internet rabbit hole, ranting during speeches and debates about obscure bit players in online conspiracy theories at a time when a pandemic was ravaging the country. He lost by 7 million votes.\n\nNo politician can or should ignore social media, which still drives a lot of public discourse and engages many activists. The sweet spot is rather to be aware of the internet but not consumed by it. My colleague Derek Thompson refers to this as being \" optimally online .\" And for a while, it looked like Ron DeSantis had mastered this maneuver. He hired an army of pugilistic spokespeople, most notably his former press secretary Christina Pushaw , who reveled in trolling reporters and liberals on Twitter, including labeling Democratic politicians \" groomers .\" By delegating this operation to staff, DeSantis was able to appeal to his party's most rabid Twitterati while maintaining distance and deniability from their actions, preserving his appeal to everyday voters even as he provided virtual red meat to the online base.\n\nNow, however, it's starting to look like this was not a strategy but just the first stage of internet poisoning that threatens to overwhelm DeSantis's presidential campaign. In recent months, the governor has sounded less like a populist politician and more like an instantiation of his party's worst Twitter talkers. Take DeSantis's hard turn against transgender rights. \"Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely,\" declared The Daily Wire 's Michael Knowles, who has nearly 1 million followers on Twitter, in March. His colleague Matt Walsh regularly dubs transition care for minors \" abuse \" and \" mutilation \" to his 1.8 million followers. But what excites reactionary Twitter doesn't move voters: Most Americans oppose discrimination against transgender people, even as they express apprehension about medical transition for minors or the participation of trans athletes in women's sports. And yet, earlier this month, DeSantis signed and celebrated a bill that, in his words , \"permanently outlawed the mutilation of minors.\"\n\nIn other words, the ill-fated launch event with Musk wasn't a one-off miscalculation. It was the latest instance of DeSantis losing sight of the electorate in favor of online obsessions. Tellingly, in his 67-minute appearance last night, the governor repeatedly derided the \"woke\" left but never mentioned Trump-the candidate DeSantis must dethrone if he is to claim the nomination."

It's an absurd, juvenile statement, but it was also par for the course on the new American right.\n\nZelensky's visit to the United States triggered an astonishing outpouring of raw vitriol from some of the most prominent right-wing voices in the land. Donald Trump Jr. called Zelensky an \" international welfare queen .\" In a furious monologue on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson said that Zelensky-who wore fatigues similar to the ones he's worn since the conflict started-\" dressed like the manager of a strip club .\" The Daily Wire 's Matt Walsh told his 1.2 million Twitter followers that Zelensky was a \" grifting leech .\"\n\nThe list goes on.

I simply highlighted a few of the people with huge platforms on the right. If you want an even more complete roundup, I'd suggest reading Cathy Young's outstanding report over at The Bulwark .\n\nIn fact, Cathy and I are doing much the same thing.

Here's Cathy's smart take:\n\nI agree with all of her explanations. Each element is in the mix to a greater or lesser degree, but I want to drill down on her first point. Partisan polarization doesn't just explain the fact of right-wing opposition to Ukraine; it also explains its raw intensity.\n\nSimply put, it's not about Ukraine. It's about you. A key reason why the new right hates Zelensky is that the new right hates you . You are the real enemy, and anything or anyone you like, they will hate. And, to be clear, I'm not just talking about polarization between Republicans and Democrats. Most Americans (including most Republicans) still support sending additional arms to Ukraine .\n\nThis is about polarization against the Democrats, against the Republican establishment, and against traditional Reagan conservatives like me-a coalition the new right calls the \"uniparty.\" What the alleged uniparty supports, the new right opposes, and it doesn't just oppose positions; it opposes the people within the alleged uniparty with an almost primal ferocity. Just watch a typical Carlson monologue. It's peppered with schoolyard insults and juvenile name-calling.\n\nAlong with the vitriol, there is a kind of potpourri of positions that goes along with membership in the new right, including vaccine skepticism (or outright opposition) and election denial. No, not every person shares the same position, but the overlap is tremendous-including among most of the public voices I highlighted above.\n\nKirk, for example, spent much of yesterday tweeting against Zelensky and in support of Kari Lake's hopeless effort to reverse the results of the Arizona gubernatorial election, which Lake lost. There are few more prominent opponents of the COVID vaccine than Owens . Carlson has also relentlessly criticized COVID vaccines.\n\nAt first glance, these issues might seem to be completely disconnected. But scratch beneath the surface, and they all share the same fundamental characteristic: furious defiance of majority consensus. Again, what the \"uniparty\" is for, the new right is against.\n\nAnd this defiance makes a difference in people's decisions. Republicans are less likely to get vaccinated against COVID, and now there's evidence that this was a deadly choice. A study of voters in Ohio and Florida has revealed some startling facts: \"The fates of Republicans and Democrats began to diverge markedly after the introduction of vaccines in April of 2021. Between March 2020 and March 2021, excess death rates for Republicans were 1.6 percentage points higher than for Democrats. After April 2021, the gap widened to 10.6 percentage points.\"\n\nThat defiance is also making a difference in American support for Ukraine. The same poll I cited above, which indicates that a majority of Republicans still support additional arms for Ukraine, also shows that support for arms and economic assistance to Ukraine has dropped far more with Republicans than with Democrats or independents.\n\nI've written about right-wing contrarianism before , but it's important to identify each time it arises. And it's important to identify the sheer amount of hatred that animates new-right discourse. You don't compare foreign leaders to strip-club owners, call them leeches or welfare queens, or fantasize about punching them if you're simply holding a different opinion about a complex and difficult point of policy.\n\nThat's why it's become particularly difficult to discuss policy. The new right's objections to supporting Ukraine, or taking a vaccine, or accepting the results of an election are largely born out of hatred-the conviction that the evil \"they\" are out to destroy \"us\"; it's difficult to reasonably debate policy differences against the backdrop of such extreme animosity. If the new right believes its Democratic and Republican opponents are fundamentally evil, then of course it will believe that the policies and people they support are evil as well.\n\nWe saw this animosity again yesterday, when 18 Republicans joined Democrats in the Senate to pass an omnibus spending package that included a substantial increase in aid to Ukraine. And how did Johnson react? \" Senate Republicans are traitors ,\" he tweeted. Carlson hosted a segment called \" adventures in idiocy \" in which his guest, yes, decried the \"uniparty\" and called the bill a \"betrayal of the American people.\"\n\nOf course, not every opponent of Ukraine aid shares these dark motivations. There are thoughtful people who raise serious concerns about escalation, or about the increasing financial costs of our support. But right-wing infotainment doesn't feature reasoned argument. Instead it sensationalizes. It insults. It provokes. And those insults and provocations have far more reach than reasoned arguments.\n\nThe longer I write about American politics and culture, the more I realize that animosity is our real enemy. The anger in so many American hearts blinds them to the truth, renders them vulnerable to conspiracies, and tempts them into dehumanizing their opponents.\n\nThat's what we saw unfold online this week during Zelensky's visit. It wasn't the new right rising in reasoned opposition to American policy, but rather hysterical rage animated by very real hate. And the hatred isn't truly against the people of Ukraine or even necessarily against Zelensky himself. It's against you. It's against me. It's against the people of this country who the new right believes are rotten to our very core."

It marks the first time a federal court has allowed such a ban on transition care to fully take hold in the United States, amid a wave of Republican-led attacks on trans rights targeting medical care, education, sports and beyond. \"This is going to cause very serious harm to transgender adolescents,\" says attorney Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is among the groups suing Tennessee over the law. We also speak with journalist Holly McCall, editor-in-chief of the Tennessee Lookout , which recently revealed how Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office has sought and received patient records and other sensitive information from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center related to its gender-affirming care.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman. We turn now to Tennessee, where a panel of federal appeals court judges ruled 2 to 1 late Friday to allow a new state law banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth to take effect immediately. The anti-trans measure was previously blocked by a lower court following an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of three families and a doctor. The ruling marks the first time a federal court has allowed a ban on gender-affirming care to be enforced in the U.S. The decision came in response to an emergency appeal from Republican Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, who called the ruling \"a big win.\" It ignores the guidance of major medical organizations. Similar legislation enacted by Republican-controlled legislatures in at least 20 states since 2021 has been blocked by federal courts in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nFor more, we go to New York to be joined by Chase Strangio, deputy director for trans justice with the ACLU LGBTQ & HIV Project. And in Nashville, Tennessee, we're going to Holly McCall, editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news outlet Tennessee Lookout .\n\nChase, respond to this ruling.\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Hi, Amy. Thanks so much.\n\nIt is truly a devastating ruling. And it is, in some senses, feeling deliberately obtuse. The court had to distort legal precedent, the underlying factual record and, really, common sense in order to rule against the transgender adolescents, their parents and their doctors. There are large portions of this decision that have no citations because there's no citations to be had.\n\nAnd, of course, what this means practically is that this law, that goes against everything we know about gender-affirming care, that goes against the well-studied views of every major medical association, is now in effect. Families are terrified. And this is, of course, something that's happening across the country. Thankfully, when judges actually look at the evidence, they have been blocking these laws. And we are going to, of course, continue to fight this decision on appeal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain exactly what happened Friday night, how you learned of this and why this is so unusual. People might be saying there are anti-trans bills being passed across the country. What makes this so different?\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah, so, what's happening across the country is we have these bills that are being pushed and passed by Republican-led legislatures - of course, gerrymandered and voter-suppressed legislatures. And in this situation, you had a court, the district court, block the piece of legislation. The attorney general of Tennessee then filed for an emergency stay at the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. This is sort of akin to what we see in the shadow docket at the Supreme Court, where you're just getting these rushed opinions in the course of perhaps 24 hours or less, in some instances, putting this decision from the district court on pause while the case is proceeding. And, of course, this then allows the law to go into effect.\n\nBut the court isn't close to the record. There were hundreds and hundreds of pages of expert declarations, plaintiff declarations filed in this case. And, in fact, the appeals court admits they may have got it wrong because it was rushed, which means, of course, they shouldn't have done this in the first instance. This was not a comprehensive, briefed appeal. This was an abbreviated process wherein the court interjected itself and, again, in many cases, had no citations and admitted that it may have got it wrong. But the consequence of that is that hundreds of trans adolescents in Tennessee are now without the medical care that they need.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about the medical organizations that are opposed to this.\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah, every major medical association in the United States has opposed this type of legislation. And that includes the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the Endocrine Society, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Psychiatric Association. We're talking every mainstream medical association in the United States is opposed to this legislation and believes and knows, from evidence and clinical experience, that this is going to cause very serious harms to transgender adolescents.\n\nAnd, of course, the states are raising arguments in defense of these laws that make absolutely no sense when tested by courts that are actually looking at the evidence, arguments like the care has side effects, when we know that every medication has side effects. No intervention is perfect, but that doesn't mean that we have states banning that form of care. And, of course, these are the same states and the same individuals that pushed for the permission to have ivermectin to treat COVID , when it had absolutely no evidence of efficacy, and are pushing against vaccines and masks in schools. And so, this is, of course, we know to be, a political argument in these states that are just categorically opposed to transgender people living full and thriving lives.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to bring in Holly McCall, editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news outlet Tennessee Lookout , which has been following this case, as well as Tennessee Attorney General's Office demanding that Vanderbilt University Medical Center hand over medical records of patients at its clinic for gender-affirming care. Holly, can you talk about the significance of this, and the fact that Tennessee law grants the Attorney General's Office authority to issue civil investigative demands? Explain what we're talking about here. Patients' information is being handed over to the attorney general?\n\nHOLLY McCALL: Yes. And this attorney general is the definition of an activist. You know, we often hear Republican legislators who do not like judicial decisions talk about an activist judge or a judge who's legislating from the bench. But I think, in reality, we have an attorney general who is an activist AG. He has spoken at anti-transgender events that were held in Nashville. He has not only requested the records of patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which he claims is part of a Medicare - or, excuse me, Medicaid investigation of Medicaid fraud, but he has also asked for records of people who volunteered to be buddies to people going through gender-affirming care. He's asking for this broad swath of documents that really would have nothing to do with Medicaid fraud.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And asking for emails sent to and from a public portal for questions about LGBTQ health?\n\nHOLLY McCALL: That is correct. And I think it's clear that, as Chase remarked, this is not just a Tennessee issue. This sort of activity is going on around the country. There is obviously an effort to target LGBTQ Americans. This attorney general, you know, he set up a special litigation unit just to take on issues like this, to address issues that could be addressed at the federal level. So, this is - I think this is extraordinary even for him. We have not seen this kind of, I think, a gross overreach into people's personal lives.\n\nI have an acquaintance whose daughter volunteers, has sent in a couple of emails. She is now worried that her records are going to be open to the state, worried about what might happen to her. Will she face persecution? She is not an LGBTQ American. She is a Tennesseean who wants to be supportive of her friends in the LGBT community. And now she feels that she is at risk.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Vanderbilt notified patients over the Juneteenth weekend that their confidential medical records are now in the possession of the state attorney general? Your newspaper, Tennessee Lookout , you called Vanderbilt to ask them if, in fact, they are handing over these records?\n\nHOLLY McCALL: Yes, we did. One of our reporters, Anita Wadhwani, has been tracking this very carefully. Vanderbilt has been a little cagey about what records they handed over. They are very - Vanderbilt is not the easiest institution to communicate with. And so, we still don't know exactly what they have handed over and what they have not. After we published our original story on this, they did come back and say, \"Well, we didn't hand everything over that easily.\" But we still don't know exactly what they have handed over.\n\nYou know, Vanderbilt University Medical Center has been in the sights of the right wing for almost a year now. In September of last year, Matt Walsh, with the very right-wing outlet The Daily Wire , posted, you know, spliced videos online, heavily edited videos online, of Vanderbilt doctors talking about transgender and gender-affirming care. And in one clip, you had a physician who was saying - talking about the financial aspects of gender-affirming care. Well, that is kind of what started the whole ball rolling in Tennessee, because then the right took that to say, \"Oh, Vanderbilt is just trying to make money. They are permitting genital surgery, a top surgery, to just about any minor who comes through the center.\" Of course, that is not true. They are not doing any genital surgeries. But they have been on the hot seat for more than a year. And I think at this point they are in a cover-your-you-know-what mode.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have the prominent trans activist Roberto Che Espinoza leaving Tennessee. You're the editor-in-chief of a newspaper, Tennessee Lookout . How often is this happening? Are people, just as - as Roberto Che Espinoza said, \"It's not a way to live.\"\n\nHOLLY McCALL: You know, it's no way to live. And he's not the only transgender individual who is leaving the state. We have a story coming this week about families who are leaving the state of Tennessee, including a friend of mine who has a 15-year-old transgender child. And they do not feel safe to live in the state anymore. And I can't say that I blame them. If you cannot access care, if you are under a microscope, if the Legislature and the attorney general has targeted your family, I think it's clear that this is probably not a safe place to live.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, let me go back to Chase Strangio. What rights do Vanderbilt Hospital, this prominent hospital not only in Tennessee but in the country, have to just say no to handing over that information to the state attorney general?\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : I think, taking a step back, what's important here is this is a playbook that we've seen over and over again. It looks exactly like the anti-abortion playbook from attorney generals that started to investigate medical providers, to threaten medical providers. And what we're seeing here is we have even the state of Tennessee making arguments in court that they will go after doctors who provide care when a preliminary injunction is in place, even if it's subsequently overturned. The threats on these doctors are astounding. And this looks a lot like the anti-abortion context. And we need to be vigilant here, because this has many forms. It is the legislation. It is the threats from attorney generals. And then, of course, it's the extralegal threats of violence that are impacting our communities across the country. And this is obviously devastating for transgender people, our families and our doctors.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you both for being with us. Chase Strangio is with the ACLU LGBTQ & HIV Project, deputy director for trans justice. And Holly McCall, editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news outlet, Tennessee Lookout .\n\nNext up, we speak to Democratic state Senator Sarah McBride, who's now running to be the first openly transgender member of Congress. She's running from Delaware. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Wiles, quien dirigió la campaña presidencial de Trump de 2024 y estuvo al frente en 2016 de su campaña en Florida, se convertirá en la primera mujer en ocupar el cargo de jefa de gabinete. Asimismo, Wiles también trabajó en la campaña del gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis.\n\nDurante la noche del jueves, varios medios de comunicación pronosticaron que Trump ganará en el estado de Nevada, por lo que el presidente electo se haría con 301 votos del Colegio Electoral. Trump lleva la delantera en el estado de Arizona, lo cual hace que sea probable que consiga arrasar en los estados decisivos.\n\nLos aliados de Trump están celebrando la victoria electoral del martes con llamados a implementar el plan de políticas de extrema derecha denominado \"Proyecto 2025\", que tiene como objetivo llevar a cabo una renovación del Gobierno federal. El miércoles, el exasesor de la Casa Blanca durante el primer mandato de Trump Steve Bannon amplificó en su pódcast un mensaje del presentador ultraderechista de pódcast Matt Walsh, quien escribió en la red social X, antes conocida como Twitter: \"Ahora que las elecciones terminaron, creo que finalmente podemos decir que sí, en realidad el Proyecto 2025 es la agenda [del Gobierno], jajaja\".\n\nEl juez federal designado por Trump J. Campbell Barker anuló el jueves una política del Gobierno de Biden que otorgaba a los cónyuges de ciudadanos estadounidenses la posibilidad de iniciar el proceso para obtener la ciudadanía sin la necesidad de que deban salir primero del país. Barker falló a favor de Texas, así como de más de una docena de otros estados liderados por republicanos, y declaró ilegal la citada política. Se esperaba que el programa Keeping Families Together (Mantener a las Familias Unidas) beneficiara a alrededor de medio millón de familias de estatus legal mixto. Incluso si el Departamento de Justicia del Gobierno de Biden apela el fallo, es probable que el caso se extienda hasta después de que Trump, quien está en contra de los inmigrantes, asuma la presidencia del país.\n\nEn Estados Unidos, Donald Trump dijo el jueves a la cadena NBC News que \"no se le puede poner un precio\" a sus planes de iniciar las deportaciones masivas tan pronto como asuma la presidencia. El Comité Estadounidense para Refugiados e Inmigrantes estima que un plan de este tipo costaría casi un billón de dólares en el transcurso de diez años.\n\nEn Nueva York, cientos de activistas en defensa de la justicia para las personas migrantes y personas aliadas de su causa se congregaron el jueves por la noche en la zona del bajo Manhattan, donde se comprometieron a proteger a los inmigrantes neoyorquinos y luchar contra el Gobierno entrante. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el líder comunitario Jorge Paz Reyes.\n\nJorge Paz Reyes : \"Donald Trump ha denigrado y seguirá denigrando nuestras historias, nos ha pintado como personas indignas. Y su agenda de deportación busca dividir y crear caos dentro de nuestras comunidades. Es por ello que debemos mantenernos unidos y declarar que los inmigrantes no somos el problema. Somos la solución\".\n\nIsrael continúa bombardeando la Franja de Gaza, donde se han reportado casi una veintena de muertes desde el amanecer. Esto se produce luego de que Israel lanzara el jueves un ataque contra una escuela que alberga a personas desplazadas en el campamento de refugiados de Shati, en la ciudad de Gaza, donde mató al menos a doce palestinos e hirió a otros 30. Las personas sobrevivientes dijeron que el bombardeo se produjo sin previo aviso.\n\nUmm Hani : \"Estábamos horneando pan y nuestros hijos e hijas estaban sentados alrededor nuestro. Estábamos abajo, no vimos a nadie, y el suelo tembló. La bomba cayó y todas las tiendas de campaña quedaron destruidas. La gente corría. Algunas personas fueron martirizadas y quedaron tiradas por el suelo. Los escombros cayeron sobre nosotros y la gente quedó despedazada. ¿Dónde está la humanidad? ¿Dónde está el resto del mundo? ¿Dónde está la misericordia? Nunca hemos visto a ningún país librar una guerra contra niños. Tengo 65 años y nunca he visto a ningún país librar una guerra contra niños\".\n\nDurante las últimas siete semanas, Israel no ha permitido prácticamente ningún ingreso de alimentos ni de ayuda humanitaria al norte de Gaza. Esto se produce al tiempo que la ONU ha advertido en repetidas oportunidades que la población del norte del enclave corre un \"riesgo inminente de muerte\".\n\nMientras tanto, la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos informa que casi el 70% de los más de 43.000 palestinos que murieron en los últimos 13 meses a manos de Israel son mujeres, niños y niñas.\n\nEl Ejército de Israel dijo el jueves que había adquirido 25 aviones de combate F-15 de última generación de la compañía Boeing. El acuerdo de 5.200 millones de dólares es parte de un paquete de financiación militar para Israel más amplio que fue aprobado por el Congreso estadounidense y proporcionado por el Gobierno de Biden y Harris. Muchos residentes de Gaza temen que la victoria electoral de Donald Trump no ponga fin al flujo de armas hacia Israel que ha posibilitado la devastación de gran parte del enclave palestino.\n\nWalid Abdul Wahab : \"Como saben, Biden envió muchas armas, misiles y bombas. Esas armas ayudaron a las fuerzas de ocupación israelí a llevar a cabo sus actos vergonzosos contra el pueblo palestino y, particularmente, contra los habitantes de Gaza\".\n\nEspaña ha denegado la escala en el puerto de Algeciras a dos buques de la compañía danesa Maersk que, según se cree, transportan armamento para Israel. El periódico español El País informa que los buques zarparon desde Nueva York.\n\nEl jueves, el embajador de Turquía ante la ONU , Ahmet Yildiz, habló ante la prensa en Naciones Unidas, donde volvió a pedir a todos los países que dejen de vender armamento a Israel. Turquía y otros 50 países enviaron recientemente una carta conjunta a la ONU en la que instan a que se ponga fin a las transferencias de armas a Israel.\n\nAhmet Yildiz : \"No podemos enfatizar lo suficiente que el asombroso costo de vidas civiles; que afecta predominantemente a mujeres, niños y niñas, y resulta de las constantes violaciones del derecho internacional humanitario y de los derechos humanos; es inaceptable e intolerable\".\n\nPor su parte, dos ciudadanos canadienses de origen palestino están demandando al Gobierno de Canadá por violar su deber de prevenir el genocidio. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el abogado Shane Martínez.\n\nShane Martínez : \"Nuestra demanda alega que Canadá, al no cumplir con su deber legal de tomar todas las medidas razonables para prevenir el crimen de genocidio contra el pueblo palestino en Gaza, contribuyó a las violaciones de los derechos de nuestros clientes en virtud de la Carta Canadiense de los Derechos y las Libertades\".\n\nLos demandantes en el caso han perdido a miembros de su familia debido a los ataques de Israel contra Gaza, que, según afirman, Canadá ha apoyado de manera ilegal.\n\nActivistas en Nueva York se han unido a un movimiento global de huelga de hambre que reclama el fin de la guerra en Gaza. Los activistas están realizando este viernes vigilias frente a la sede de la ONU , las cuales se extenderán durante todo el fin de semana, para concientizar sobre el impacto catastrófico de los ataques que Israel ha estado llevando a cabo desde hace 13 meses contra Gaza. Decenas de activistas en la ciudad jordana de Amán iniciaron su huelga de hambre hace una semana. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por Mohammed Al-Tobasy.\n\nMohammed Al-Tobasy : \"Se nos ocurrió esta idea como respuesta a los llamamientos internacionales para ejercer presión a través de una huelga de hambre mundial a fin de que se termine con el asedio al norte de Gaza. Teniendo en cuenta eso, nadie tiene nada más preciado que su salud, así que decidimos utilizar nuestra salud como una forma para ejercer presión. La huelga de hambre, como todos sabemos, es una herramienta de presión y resistencia pacífica que se utiliza para conseguir lo que se reclama\".\n\nEl Ejército de Israel continúa lanzando mortíferos ataques contra el sur del Líbano. Un ataque aéreo israelí contra la ciudad de Sidón mató a tres civiles e hirió a cinco miembros de las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz de la ONU . Mientras tanto, un ataque israelí contra el este del valle de Bekaa destruyó el jueves el histórico edificio Al-Manshiya, una estructura de la época otomana que se encuentra situada a pocos metros de los templos romanos de Baalbek, un lugar que ha sido catalogado como Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la Unesco. Los ataques israelíes contra Líbano han matado a más de 3.100 personas.\n\nEn noticias sobre el clima, un nuevo informe de la ONU revela que el flujo de financiación proveniente de los países ricos para ayudar a los países más pobres a adaptarse a la crisis generada por el cambio climático alcanzó un total de 28.000 millones de dólares en 2022, muy por debajo de los 359.000 millones de dólares que se necesitan para llevar a cabo dicha adaptación. El informe se publicó días antes de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, que se celebra la próxima semana en Azerbaiyán y donde la financiación será un tema clave. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el secretario general de la ONU , António Guterres.\n\nSecretario general António Guterres : \"La catástrofe climática está afectando la salud, ampliando las desigualdades, perjudicando el desarrollo sostenible y sacudiendo los cimientos de la paz. Los más vulnerables son los más afectados, y los contribuyentes están pagando la factura, mientras que los responsables de toda esta destrucción, en particular la industria de los combustibles fósiles, obtienen enormes beneficios y subsidios. Mientras tanto, se dice que, para el año 2030, la brecha entre los fondos necesarios para lograr la adaptación y los fondos disponibles para los países en desarrollo llegará a ser de hasta 359.000 millones de dólares estadounidenses por año\".\n\nEn Bolivia, los incendios forestales han destruido más de 30.000 hectáreas del Parque Nacional Madidi. La mitad de esa superficie son pampas o sabanas húmedas. El parque alberga más de 1.200 especies de aves, 270 tipos de mamíferos y cientos de especies de peces, anfibios y reptiles. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por un guardaparques.\n\nRadamir Sevillanos : \"Cuidamos una joya natural, ¿no? Tanto en biodiversidad, en paisajes, en culturas. Y es por ello que el Parque Madidi es catalogado como uno de los diez parques nacionales más biodiversos en todo el mundo. El lugar que se está quemando específicamente, también es un lugar muy importante porque está catalogado como el segundo lugar con mayor población de jaguares en Sudamérica\".\n\nEn Mozambique, la policía lanzó el jueves gas lacrimógeno y disparó balas de goma contra miles manifestantes en medio de la agitación social que azota el país tras las elecciones presidenciales. La represión dejó un saldo de cinco personas muertas y 120 heridas. El partido Frelimo, que gobierna Mozambique desde hace varios años, se declaró en octubre ganador de las elecciones presidenciales, lo que desencadenó protestas y acusaciones de fraude electoral por parte del líder opositor Venâncio Mondlane y sus simpatizantes. Según un grupo local de derechos humanos, más de 24 personas han muerto durante las protestas generalizadas. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por una residente de la ciudad de Maputo.\n\nSheila Mavale : \"Yo considero que la situación es terrible. Para bien o para mal, lo que está ocurriendo está perjudicando a la población. Nosotros somos los que estamos sufriendo. Creo que las partes deberían sentarse y hablar, por el bien del pueblo, porque es el pueblo el que está sufriendo\".\n\nAustralia podría convertirse pronto en el primer país en prohibir el acceso a las redes sociales a niños y niñas menores de 16 años. Si la propuesta del Gobierno es aprobada por el Parlamento, la prohibición podría entrar en vigor dentro de aproximadamente un año. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el primer ministro australiano, Anthony Albanese.\n\nPrimer ministro Anthony Albanese : \"Las redes sociales están causando daño social a nuestros jóvenes australianos. Y voy a terminar con esto. La seguridad y la salud mental de nuestros jóvenes debe ser una prioridad. Y mi Gobierno hará todo lo que esté a su alcance para proteger a nuestros jóvenes australianos, así como para brindar apoyo a los padres, madres y docentes, que son quienes están lidiando con estos problemas\"."

Incluso si el Departamento de Justicia del Gobierno de Biden apela el fallo, es probable que el caso se extienda hasta después de que Trump, quien está en contra de los inmigrantes, asuma la presidencia del país.\n\nEn Estados Unidos, Donald Trump dijo el jueves a la cadena NBC News que \"no se le puede poner un precio\" a sus planes de iniciar las deportaciones masivas tan pronto como asuma la presidencia. El Comité Estadounidense para Refugiados e Inmigrantes estima que un plan de este tipo costaría casi un billón de dólares en el transcurso de diez años.\n\nEn Nueva York, cientos de activistas en defensa de la justicia para las personas migrantes y personas aliadas de su causa se congregaron el jueves por la noche en la zona del bajo Manhattan, donde se comprometieron a proteger a los inmigrantes neoyorquinos y luchar contra el Gobierno entrante. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el líder comunitario Jorge Paz Reyes.\n\nJorge Paz Reyes : \"Donald Trump ha denigrado y seguirá denigrando nuestras historias, nos ha pintado como personas indignas. Y su agenda de deportación busca dividir y crear caos dentro de nuestras comunidades. Es por ello que debemos mantenernos unidos y declarar que los inmigrantes no somos el problema. Somos la solución\".\n\nIsrael continúa bombardeando la Franja de Gaza, donde se han reportado casi una veintena de muertes desde el amanecer. Esto se produce luego de que Israel lanzara el jueves un ataque contra una escuela que alberga a personas desplazadas en el campamento de refugiados de Shati, en la ciudad de Gaza, donde mató al menos a doce palestinos e hirió a otros 30. Las personas sobrevivientes dijeron que el bombardeo se produjo sin previo aviso.\n\nUmm Hani : \"Estábamos horneando pan y nuestros hijos e hijas estaban sentados alrededor nuestro. Estábamos abajo, no vimos a nadie, y el suelo tembló. La bomba cayó y todas las tiendas de campaña quedaron destruidas. La gente corría. Algunas personas fueron martirizadas y quedaron tiradas por el suelo. Los escombros cayeron sobre nosotros y la gente quedó despedazada. ¿Dónde está la humanidad? ¿Dónde está el resto del mundo? ¿Dónde está la misericordia? Nunca hemos visto a ningún país librar una guerra contra niños. Tengo 65 años y nunca he visto a ningún país librar una guerra contra niños\".\n\nDurante las últimas siete semanas, Israel no ha permitido prácticamente ningún ingreso de alimentos ni de ayuda humanitaria al norte de Gaza. Esto se produce al tiempo que la ONU ha advertido en repetidas oportunidades que la población del norte del enclave corre un \"riesgo inminente de muerte\".\n\nMientras tanto, la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos informa que casi el 70% de los más de 43.000 palestinos que murieron en los últimos 13 meses a manos de Israel son mujeres, niños y niñas.\n\nEl Ejército de Israel dijo el jueves que había adquirido 25 aviones de combate F-15 de última generación de la compañía Boeing. El acuerdo de 5.200 millones de dólares es parte de un paquete de financiación militar para Israel más amplio que fue aprobado por el Congreso estadounidense y proporcionado por el Gobierno de Biden y Harris. Muchos residentes de Gaza temen que la victoria electoral de Donald Trump no ponga fin al flujo de armas hacia Israel que ha posibilitado la devastación de gran parte del enclave palestino.\n\nWalid Abdul Wahab : \"Como saben, Biden envió muchas armas, misiles y bombas. Esas armas ayudaron a las fuerzas de ocupación israelí a llevar a cabo sus actos vergonzosos contra el pueblo palestino y, particularmente, contra los habitantes de Gaza\".\n\nEspaña ha denegado la escala en el puerto de Algeciras a dos buques de la compañía danesa Maersk que, según se cree, transportan armamento para Israel. El periódico español El País informa que los buques zarparon desde Nueva York.\n\nEl jueves, el embajador de Turquía ante la ONU , Ahmet Yildiz, habló ante la prensa en Naciones Unidas, donde volvió a pedir a todos los países que dejen de vender armamento a Israel. Turquía y otros 50 países enviaron recientemente una carta conjunta a la ONU en la que instan a que se ponga fin a las transferencias de armas a Israel.\n\nAhmet Yildiz : \"No podemos enfatizar lo suficiente que el asombroso costo de vidas civiles; que afecta predominantemente a mujeres, niños y niñas, y resulta de las constantes violaciones del derecho internacional humanitario y de los derechos humanos; es inaceptable e intolerable\".\n\nPor su parte, dos ciudadanos canadienses de origen palestino están demandando al Gobierno de Canadá por violar su deber de prevenir el genocidio. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el abogado Shane Martínez.\n\nShane Martínez : \"Nuestra demanda alega que Canadá, al no cumplir con su deber legal de tomar todas las medidas razonables para prevenir el crimen de genocidio contra el pueblo palestino en Gaza, contribuyó a las violaciones de los derechos de nuestros clientes en virtud de la Carta Canadiense de los Derechos y las Libertades\".\n\nLos demandantes en el caso han perdido a miembros de su familia debido a los ataques de Israel contra Gaza, que, según afirman, Canadá ha apoyado de manera ilegal.\n\nActivistas en Nueva York se han unido a un movimiento global de huelga de hambre que reclama el fin de la guerra en Gaza. Los activistas están realizando este viernes vigilias frente a la sede de la ONU , las cuales se extenderán durante todo el fin de semana, para concientizar sobre el impacto catastrófico de los ataques que Israel ha estado llevando a cabo desde hace 13 meses contra Gaza. Decenas de activistas en la ciudad jordana de Amán iniciaron su huelga de hambre hace una semana. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por Mohammed Al-Tobasy.\n\nMohammed Al-Tobasy : \"Se nos ocurrió esta idea como respuesta a los llamamientos internacionales para ejercer presión a través de una huelga de hambre mundial a fin de que se termine con el asedio al norte de Gaza. Teniendo en cuenta eso, nadie tiene nada más preciado que su salud, así que decidimos utilizar nuestra salud como una forma para ejercer presión. La huelga de hambre, como todos sabemos, es una herramienta de presión y resistencia pacífica que se utiliza para conseguir lo que se reclama\".\n\nEl Ejército de Israel continúa lanzando mortíferos ataques contra el sur del Líbano. Un ataque aéreo israelí contra la ciudad de Sidón mató a tres civiles e hirió a cinco miembros de las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz de la ONU . Mientras tanto, un ataque israelí contra el este del valle de Bekaa destruyó el jueves el histórico edificio Al-Manshiya, una estructura de la época otomana que se encuentra situada a pocos metros de los templos romanos de Baalbek, un lugar que ha sido catalogado como Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la Unesco. Los ataques israelíes contra Líbano han matado a más de 3.100 personas.\n\nEn noticias sobre el clima, un nuevo informe de la ONU revela que el flujo de financiación proveniente de los países ricos para ayudar a los países más pobres a adaptarse a la crisis generada por el cambio climático alcanzó un total de 28.000 millones de dólares en 2022, muy por debajo de los 359.000 millones de dólares que se necesitan para llevar a cabo dicha adaptación. El informe se publicó días antes de la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático, que se celebra la próxima semana en Azerbaiyán y donde la financiación será un tema clave. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el secretario general de la ONU , António Guterres.\n\nSecretario general António Guterres : \"La catástrofe climática está afectando la salud, ampliando las desigualdades, perjudicando el desarrollo sostenible y sacudiendo los cimientos de la paz. Los más vulnerables son los más afectados, y los contribuyentes están pagando la factura, mientras que los responsables de toda esta destrucción, en particular la industria de los combustibles fósiles, obtienen enormes beneficios y subsidios. Mientras tanto, se dice que, para el año 2030, la brecha entre los fondos necesarios para lograr la adaptación y los fondos disponibles para los países en desarrollo llegará a ser de hasta 359.000 millones de dólares estadounidenses por año\".\n\nEn Bolivia, los incendios forestales han destruido más de 30.000 hectáreas del Parque Nacional Madidi. La mitad de esa superficie son pampas o sabanas húmedas. El parque alberga más de 1.200 especies de aves, 270 tipos de mamíferos y cientos de especies de peces, anfibios y reptiles. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por un guardaparques.\n\nRadamir Sevillanos : \"Cuidamos una joya natural, ¿no? Tanto en biodiversidad, en paisajes, en culturas. Y es por ello que el Parque Madidi es catalogado como uno de los diez parques nacionales más biodiversos en todo el mundo. El lugar que se está quemando específicamente, también es un lugar muy importante porque está catalogado como el segundo lugar con mayor población de jaguares en Sudamérica\".\n\nEn Mozambique, la policía lanzó el jueves gas lacrimógeno y disparó balas de goma contra miles manifestantes en medio de la agitación social que azota el país tras las elecciones presidenciales. La represión dejó un saldo de cinco personas muertas y 120 heridas. El partido Frelimo, que gobierna Mozambique desde hace varios años, se declaró en octubre ganador de las elecciones presidenciales, lo que desencadenó protestas y acusaciones de fraude electoral por parte del líder opositor Venâncio Mondlane y sus simpatizantes. Según un grupo local de derechos humanos, más de 24 personas han muerto durante las protestas generalizadas. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por una residente de la ciudad de Maputo.\n\nSheila Mavale : \"Yo considero que la situación es terrible. Para bien o para mal, lo que está ocurriendo está perjudicando a la población. Nosotros somos los que estamos sufriendo. Creo que las partes deberían sentarse y hablar, por el bien del pueblo, porque es el pueblo el que está sufriendo\".\n\nAustralia podría convertirse pronto en el primer país en prohibir el acceso a las redes sociales a niños y niñas menores de 16 años. Si la propuesta del Gobierno es aprobada por el Parlamento, la prohibición podría entrar en vigor dentro de aproximadamente un año. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por el primer ministro australiano, Anthony Albanese.\n\nPrimer ministro Anthony Albanese : \"Las redes sociales están causando daño social a nuestros jóvenes australianos. Y voy a terminar con esto. La seguridad y la salud mental de nuestros jóvenes debe ser una prioridad. Y mi Gobierno hará todo lo que esté a su alcance para proteger a nuestros jóvenes australianos, así como para brindar apoyo a los padres, madres y docentes, que son quienes están lidiando con estos problemas\"."

      "text": "This State Tried To Pass Anti-Trans Laws For Years. Then A Right-Wing Media Star Got Involved.\n\nLast September, Riley headed to their clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which was usually brimming with chatter about the day's research and patient needs.\n\nBut that fall morning, Vanderbilt was thrown into chaos, and the clinic for gender-affirming surgeries, which serviced both trans youth and adults, had been shut down for the day. The health care worker, who is using a pseudonym in fear of retaliation from their employer, said the atmosphere among their colleagues in the trans health clinic was a mix of \"fear and concern.\"\n\nRiley's clinic remained open, and their colleagues debated whether they were safe at work or should go home. Riley said local police were lined up outside the medical center's doors, serving as extra security for employees.\n\nAll day people whispered about the social media posts by right-wing blogger Matt Walsh, which had gone viral the day before for claiming that doctors at Vanderbilt's transgender health clinic \"castrate\" and \"sterilize\" children.\n\nAt the time, Riley hadn't heard of Walsh. They didn't have social media and rarely watched the news.\n\nBut over the next year, Riley would witness firsthand - again and again - how misinformation and right-wing attacks on the transgender health clinic severely restricted the kinds of care they could provide at Vanderbilt. In those months, trans Tennesseans have felt more intimidated and desperate than ever, as they have been forced to decide whether to pack up their lives to find a place where they can exist without the fear of the government, or right-wing provocateurs, meddling in their private medical information.\n\nOne of the first changes Riley saw was Vanderbilt moving the stand-alone transgender health clinic inside the university's main campus in Nashville, Tennessee. The clinic also adopted new security measures, including an armed guard behind the desk, and required patients and providers to be buzzed inside.\n\nRiley said the medical center has even canceled appointments for certain surgeries for cisgender youth that currently do not fall into the category of gender-affirmation but that critics could see as \"pathways to gender affirmation.\"\n\nBy the end of September 2022, Tennessee's attorney general, John Skrmetti, said his office had opened an investigation into Vanderbilt's transgender health clinic. Over the next few months, Skrmetti broadened the scope, first requesting specific patient medical records, and then information on Vanderbilt employees and volunteers at the transgender health clinic. The following spring, Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender children, effectively suspending all operations at VUMC's pediatric transgender clinic.\n\nRiley said they were one of more than a dozen clinicians who were told by Skrmetti's office that their emails could be subpoenaed as part of the investigation.\n\n\"It feels like a witch hunt,\" Riley told HuffPost. \"What are you going to find in my emails? Obviously, there's not a conspiracy here.\"\n\nIn September 2022, Walsh, a prominent Nashville-based right-wing talk show host and blogger, accused Vanderbilt University Medical Center's transgender health clinic of only existing to turn a profit. He also claimed that Vanderbilt doctors \"castrate, sterilize, and mutilate minors.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, Walsh argued that the clinic was drugging and sterilizing children, and used language that LGBTQ+ advocates and Vanderbilt employees say grossly distorted the reality of pediatric transgender care. Walsh posted a video of one Vanderbilt doctor ― Dr. Shayne Taylor, who founded the clinic in 2018 ― discussing how gender-affirming surgeries, like double mastectomies and genital surgeries, could bring in \"a lot of money\" for the medical center. (In this video, Taylor, who did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment, was mostly referencing surgeries for trans adults, as Vanderbilt never performed genital surgeries for minors.)\n\nIn another video Walsh posted, a different doctor cautions that employees who don't want to treat transgender patients on the grounds of religious objections \"probably shouldn't work at Vanderbilt.\" At the end of the thread, Walsh wrote that the clinic's peer support group, Trans Buddy Program, was in fact a \"gang of trans activists\" acting as \"surveillance in order to force compliance.\"\n\nWalsh tweeted later that evening that his \"report\" was just the beginning. \"We are not going to let up,\" he wrote. \"We will shut this down.\"\n\nThe next day, Vanderbilt released a statement refuting Walsh's claims. \" Vanderbilt University Medical Center is now the subject of social media posts and a video that misrepresent facts about the care the Medical Center provides to transgender patients,\" the statement read. \"VUMC began its Transgender Health Clinic because transgender individuals are a high-risk population for mental and physical health issues and have been consistently underserved by the U.S. health system.\"\n\nWalsh did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this story.\n\nEven when gender-affirming medical care for minors was legal in Tennessee, the first step was still typically social transition, such as a change in name, pronouns, dress or hairstyle. Once a child hit puberty, their families might begin the long process of consulting with behavioral health specialists, endocrinologists and primary care doctors about taking puberty blockers ― medication to temporarily pause the effects of puberty ― while weighing whether hormone replacement therapy might ease a child's gender dysphoria later in their teens.\n\nOver 30 major medical associations have deemed these standards of care medically necessary and \"lifesaving.\"\n\nPuberty blockers, which stop the body from making sex hormones, help slow unwanted secondary sex characteristics. They do not, as Walsh suggested, \"sterilize\" or \"castrate\" children, though the medication could pose some risks to fertility if they are administered too early in puberty. Studies show the effects are largely reversible, and the World Professional Association of Transgender Health recommends that providers talk with patients and their families about fertility preservation before starting medication.\n\nIn the years since VUMC began providing gender-affirming care for transgender youth and adults, it grew into a holistic network of care, not only involving health care providers, but also spiritual care from a staff chaplain, weekly support groups, and insurance specialists, according to a panel of VUMC practitioners at an LGBTQ+ health equity conference this fall.\n\nVUMC performed fewer than a dozen top surgeries, or double mastectomies, each year for transmasculine patients in their late teens, according to Riley. Such surgeries require patients to undergo months of therapy beforehand, and a study published this summer showed that top surgery patients had little to no regrets decades after the operation. Both Riley and a VUMC executive, C. Wright Pinson, said that the hospital never performed \"genital procedures\" on minors.\n\nBut Walsh's claims caught the eye of Republicans in Tennessee, which, with its Republican-controlled legislature, had become a paragon of a one-party state.\n\nHours after the tweets, Lee called for a \"thorough investigation\" into VUMC, and Skrmetti vowed to use the \"full scope of his authority\" to ensure the medical center was complying with state law.\n\nThe investigation appears to have started as early as the following morning, according to emails from Republican state Sen. Jack Johson, which HuffPost obtained through a public records request. \" The Governor has already opened an investigation into Vanderbilt and I will be filing legislation to prohibit this when we come back into Session in January,\" Johnson wrote to one supporter on Sept. 21, the morning after Walsh's tweets . (The governor's office told The Associated Press that day that it had passed along concerns about VUMC to the attorney general. Lee's office recently told HuffPost over email that the attorney general has the \"statutory authority\" to open an investigation.)\n\nThe following day, Johnson responded to emails from supporters who were shocked by Walsh's allegations, reassuring them that he was on the case - and had help.\n\n\"I absolutely agree that these surgeries should not be allowed on children,\" Johnson wrote to one. \"That is why I am working with Matt Walsh to introduce legislation in our upcoming legislative session to ban these transgender surgeries on children in Tennessee .\"\n\nSkrmetti's office has said it began its probe in September 2022 after receiving a report about a Vanderbilt doctor who \"publicly described her manipulation of medical billing codes to evade coverage limitations on gender-related treatment,\" which raised concerns about possible fraud in the state's Medicaid plan, TennCare. (The plan specifically excludes \"sex change or transformation surgery.\")\n\nIn August 2023, a reporter with Nashville's News Channel 5 interviewed Skrmetti. The segment showed portions of the video that Skrmetti says instigated the report: In it, Taylor discussed how she supports patients whose insurance plans don't cover transgender health care, including saying she might write that a patient has a hormonal disorder for billing purposes so that she can order lab work for patients.\n\nSkrmetti, in the interview, said it was \"very easy\" to initiate the investigation because his office was \"already aware of the potential billing issues there.\" He acknowledged that the probe into medical records is \"probably terrifying\" for patients but said there is \"no political exception to the fraud laws.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment , Skrmetti's office referred HuffPost to the interview with News Channel 5 and did not respond to other questions for this story.\n\nAs the investigation went on, Skrmetti requested the private medical records of more than 150 Vanderbilt patients who used TennCare. John Howser, a Vanderbilt spokesperson, said the clinic was \"compelled\" to produce copies of the records, while also complying with state and federal law including HIPAA. However, many LGBTQ+ and privacy advocates across the state and country signaled they were upset that VUMC didn't fight harder to prevent turning over patient information in the investigation.\n\nRiley said they were \"flabbergasted\" to learn about the attorney general's inquiry into the center's billing process. \"There's so many levels of oversight and protection from that kind of false billing,\" they said. \"It doesn't pass the test of reason. Providers don't do the billing. There's a whole department of people that review the documentation and the code.\"\n\nPatients were not told until June of this year that their records had been turned over to the attorney general. Skrmetti's office had said it kept its \"run-of-the-mill\" investigation private in an attempt to avoid a \"media circus\" - even as it continued to broaden the scope. The attorney general requested additional patient and employee data, including the names of patients who had been referred to VUMC's trans clinic but did not seek treatment there; information on insurance claims to TennCare; employee tax forms and emails about gender-affirming care, as well as employees' resumes and employment contracts; and information about the clinic's Trans Buddy volunteers.\n\nSkrmetti's investigation and Vanderbilt's release of records have been criticized as an egregious overstep, and the latest ― and largest ― use of data requests by a state to undermine access to gender-affirming care.\n\n\" Trust between patients and their doctors is essential to quality care, and we regret any concern this may have caused for our patients,\" Howser said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\nIn the past year, as Republican-led states have increasingly passed anti-trans legislation, GOP officials nationwide have leveraged data requests about transgender residents as one of their many tools to restrict access to medical care. In Missouri , the attorney general requested and failed to obtain medical records on trans youth, while in Florida , Gov. Ron DeSantis probed state universities for data on how many students sought out gender-affirming care on campus clinics. More recently, 19 Republican attorneys general ― including Skrmetti ― signed a letter pushing back against a federal rule that would shield states from requesting data on patients seeking abortion out of state.\n\nMany trans health advocates inside and outside the state said Walsh's posts about Vanderbilt not only seemed to provide pretext for the probe and ban on gender-affirming care, but that his inflammatory language and framing took the doctors' words out of context and grossly mischaracterized the kinds of care that minors were receiving at the clinic.\n\n\"The biggest thing I've seen is just the sheer amount of terror of families of trans youth. People are really terrified that the state is going to either try to take away their children from them or put them on some kind of watch list or try to invade their privacy. There's just a lot of fear in Tennessee right now with families,\" Lucas Cameron-Vaughn, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Tennessee, told HuffPost in July.\n\nCameron-Vaughn is one of the attorneys representing the families of trans kids in L.W. v. Skrmetti , the American Civil Liberties Union's ongoing lawsuit against the state's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The ban was recently upheld by a federal appeals court ruling.\n\n\"It may sound extreme to you when I say that we're living in a totalitarian state,\" Democratic state Sen. Heidi Campbell told HuffPost. \"Before I became a state senator I don't think those words would have come out of my mouth. But it's really just the truth. There are no checks and balances in this government anymore. We're seeing that with Skrmetti, who is hired by us to protect the people who live in this state, and is actively attacking our own citizens.\"\n\nOn Sept. 21, 2022, just one day after Walsh's initial \"report\" about VUMC, he tweeted that he had met with Johnson and Republican state Rep. William Lamberth to work on a bill to end gender-affirming care for youth. A few weeks later, ahead of the state's midterm election on Nov. 8, Lamberth penned an opinion piece promising he would \"partner\" with Walsh to halt that care for minors if he were reelected to the House.\n\nCameron-Vaughn wasn't surprised that Walsh's posts lined up neatly ahead of the state's election. \"It seems like this sort of campaign against Vanderbilt was designed to scandalize Vanderbilt University Medical Center's gender clinic by creating a deliberately false narrative right before the election,\" he said.\n\nLamberth and Johnson both won their bids for reelection, and filed identical bills to ban care for minors months before the start of the 2023 legislative session. In February, as the bill passed swiftly through committee meetings, Walsh attended a House meeting to give an expert testimony.\n\nState Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat who represents Nashville, was one of few legislators to question Walsh's expertise and knowledge of best practices for transgender youth during a committee meeting on health.\n\n\"What qualifies me is that I am a human being with a brain and common sense and a soul, and therefore I think it's a really bad idea to chemically castrate children,\" Walsh said during questioning.\n\n\"You don't use [your research] to get clicks on your publication?\" Clemmons asked.\n\nWhen the bill passed swiftly through each chamber of Tennessee's government, it was clear to Clemmons that Walsh was something new. He was the gasoline reigniting an already burning fire in Tennessee. Republicans had long been trying to pass various bans on gender-affirming care, but had been largely unsuccessful. In 2021, Tennessee succeeded in barring doctors from prescribing hormone therapy for prepubescent minors - which in reality, advocates say, was not even happening in the state.\n\nBut this opened the door for Lamberth and Johnson to go further. Their legislation allows the state to ban puberty blockers, hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries for all transgender minors. Youth who are already receiving care will have to terminate it by March of next year, and providers have already begun weaning adolescents off hormones.\n\nWalsh's voice had eclipsed the dozens of opponents to the bills ― including transgender youth and their parents, LGBTQ+ advocates, and clinicians ― who showed up each week at the statehouse to share their stories about how access to gender-affirming care was very often the buffer between life and death.\n\nClemmons said he watched with horror as Walsh and his media outlet, the Daily Wire, helped steer conversations among some of his colleagues.\n\n\"Obviously the attorney general in this state is taking marching orders from him, which is embarrassing considering he's not even elected,\" Clemmons told HuffPost, referring to Walsh. \"This is a new brand of extremism that's very dangerous, that openly admits to wanting to burn books on the House floor, that openly admits to wanting to limit people's rights. It's scary.\"\n\n\"This is state-sponsored intimidation and that's never played out well in history,\" he added.\n\nThe attorney general's office declined to comment on its relationship with Walsh.\n\nLee, the governor, signed the ban into law at the beginning of March.\n\n\"This kind of bill had been filed in previous years and did not pass because there were divisions among Republicans on intervening in medical decisions. But there was an almost complete lockstep unanimity that they were going to pass the bill in 2023,\" said Chris Sanders, the executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project.\n\n\"So Mr. Walsh is the first mover on this in a lot of ways in terms of getting a consensus built in the Republican caucus. He is not the first to think of it, but he's partly responsible for jelling the consensus in Tennessee.\"\n\nBy the end of the session in April, Tennessee had also become the first state to pass a ban on drag performances, in addition to enacting laws that defined sex as a person's \"immutable biological sex,\" and allowed teachers to misgender students.\n\nSince 2015, Tennessee has enacted 19 anti-LGBTQ+ laws , more than any other state in the country.\n\nThis all might not have been possible if Walsh's workplace hadn't been given a royal welcome to the Volunteer State.\n\nThe Daily Wire, a one-stop-shop of conservative entertainment and merch - including original documentaries, TV shows, children's programming and \"woke free\" razor blades ― has been likened to the right's answer to Hollywood with a roster of conservative hosts including Walsh, Candace Owens and Jordan Peterson.\n\nThe company, which was co-founded by columnist Ben Shapiro, relocated its headquarters from Los Angeles to Nashville in 2020. The next year, Tennessee state lawmakers passed a resolution to embrace Shapiro and his \"truth seekers,\" and celebrate their move out of \"liberal California.\"\n\n\"We congratulate Ben Shapiro and his associates at The Daily Wire on their relocation to Tennessee and extend to them our best wishes for continued success in discovering and disseminating the truth,\" the resolution stated.\n\nCampbell is highly critical of how her colleagues rolled out the welcome mat for the conservative company. \"This is an attempted hostile takeover of Nashville because they really want Nashville to be their first right-wing big city,\" she said.\n\nBy the time Walsh moved his family to Nashville, he was already practiced in \"exposing\" the ills of same-sex marriage and laws that protected transgender Americans' rights to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender.\n\n\"Millions of Americans have lost their grip on reality,\" he wrote in a 2014 blog post arguing that trans people don't exist. \"This is the real crisis, and it's far more urgent than most of what they're talking about on the news right now. \"\n\nIn the past few years, however, Walsh has turned toward a \"just asking questions\"-style attack on trans people. He built up mainstream notoriety and a career of lecturing at colleges after the release of his 2022 documentary, \"What is A Woman,\" which also sows doubt about the existence of transgender people. A self-described \"theocratic fascist,\" Walsh has also argued that trans people are \"groomers\" and part of a cult, and made posts mocking immigrants and Black people .\n\nAnd last August, Walsh responded after the right-wing account LibsofTikTok posted a barrage of false claims about the care Boston Children's Hospital provides. He called on his followers for \"an organized effort to fight back against the drugging and mutilating of children.\" Then the hospital, which is the country's first pediatric transgender health program, received two separate bomb threats. Walsh brushed off the threats as a \"leftist hoax.\"\n\nTennessee Republicans have echoed similar anti-trans rhetoric.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Tennessee Republican Caucus sent out a survey, asking constituents for their opinions about a number of issues including abortion and parental rights in schools. In a section called \"protecting children,\" the survey asks conservatives if they favor policies preventing \"minors from cutting off healthy body parts in order to change their gender identity.\" There weren't any questions about guns or firearm reform in the survey, even though the Tennessee Department of Health found that the leading cause of death for children in the state was homicide, 86% of which were due to gun violence .\n\nLate last October, Nashvillians had a glimpse of what Walsh's version of the Music City might look like when he held his \"Rally to End Child Mutilation\" at the state Capitol, which garnered around 1,500 protesters , including some Proud Boys.\n\nThere was Walsh, the bespectacled and bearded 37-year-old, standing on stage alongside Johnson and Lamberth, as well as other conservative figures including Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party last year. Other right-wing media stars, including Chloe Cole , an 18-year-old detransitioner who has testified across the country in support of bans on transition care for minors, also took the stage to speak.\n\n\"We are all here today because of this information that Matt brought forward and showed what was taking place just down the street right here in Nashville, and showing how the radical left is trying to put their woke agenda on every single family in this country,\" Blackburn told the crowd .\n\nState Sen. Janice Bowling (R) was also present, passing out fliers with what she called \"graphic\" photos of genital reconstruction surgeries some transgender people may choose to undergo . After the event, she wrote to Johnson that many of the rally's attendees didn't know \"about the assaults these surgeries are on the bodies of these children,\" according to emails obtained by HuffPost. (Two Vanderbilt employees have confirmed to HuffPost that the center never performed genital surgeries on children, as is standard among clinicians of trans care.)\n\n\"Upon looking at the photos, their resolve to 'stay the course in our opposition' was magnified,\" Bowling wrote. \"A picture is truly worth a thousand words.\"\n\nPatients were shocked to find out that their personal medical information had been shared with the attorney general - and some experienced emotional whiplash when they learned they might have been misinformed about their records being turned over. One family of a trans teen who spoke to HuffPost was first notified in June that Vanderbilt had turned over the teen's records; two months later, the medical center told the family the teen's records weren't among those given to Skrmetti.\n\nBy then, the family, which requested to remain anonymous due to concerns for their safety, had already driven hundreds of miles to North Carolina to make sure their child could continue hormone therapy.\n\n\"We depend on our care providers to be honest with us,\" the mother told HuffPost. \"They have precious lives in their hands. I don't know whether to believe this or not.\"\n\nIn early September this year, a spokesperson at Vanderbilt confirmed that not all of the 150 records that were originally requested by Skrmetti were shared with his office.\n\n\"We have since confirmed that records for only 82 of these patients were provided to the Attorney General's office,\" said Howser, the spokesperson for VUMC, in an emailed statement to HuffPost. \"After learning of this, we notified the remaining patients, whose records were requested but not provided, that their records have not been produced to the Attorney General's office.\"\n\nHowser did not respond to further questions about why only 82 records were shared and whether the records of the remaining patients could be shared with the attorney general in the future.\n\n\"Obviously the attorney general in this state is taking marching orders from [Walsh], which is embarrassing considering he's not even elected.\"\n\nThe chaos, fear and lack of clarity surrounding the investigation has affected how VUMC operated over the last year. In addition to changes in health care offered, the medical center has removed some information about gender-affirming care from its website.\n\nRiley said they can understand why Vanderbilt did what it could to avoid unwanted attention ― but said such changes did a disservice to those who might look to the clinic as a resource.\n\n\"Because of people like Matt Walsh, it forces that whole practice into the shadows, which has a negative impact on patients in that now they may not know about the practice because there's no media presence about it,\" Riley said.\n\nEven with multiple statements rejecting Walsh's claims, it has been an uphill battle to dispel the factual errors about the clinic. \"Misinformation is like a snake,\" Riley said. \"It just moves and shifts and you can say anything you want about facts and have all the patients that have had excellent outcomes...but it doesn't make a bit of difference to the attorney general.\"\n\nThough the clinic can no longer provide gender-affirming medical treatment for youth, Riley said they and their colleagues are \"more in it than ever before\" as they continue to service trans adults.\n\n\"We're more supportive even if we're not able to do all the things we were able to before. It kind of galvanizes a community of people to say, 'This is wrong. We're going to keep doing the right thing,'\" they said, emphasizing that the care they provide complies within the bounds of the state's law.\n\nClemmons believes that Skrmetti is \"abusing his discovery powers that require no judicial oversight,\" and the state's actions are ushering in \"a whole new day of invasion of privacy.\" But he is hopeful that the time will come, not too far down the line, when the flames fan out.\n\nThe results of the national midterm elections showed that running on anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric has been a losing battle for Republicans.\n\nStill, right-wing media continues to influence voters in a way that has shifted their political ideology to further extremes ― and now politicians are trying to play catch-up.\n\nAri Drennen, the LGBTQ program director at Media Matters, who has spent much of her time tracking Walsh's rise, said Walsh was able to capitalize on his boost in followers after the Boston Children's Hospital incident and translate that into a similar push of vitriol in his home state.\n\n\"I think part of the dynamic is that many Republican politicians, including in the presidential race, are competing in a field of voters who've been radicalized by personalities like Matt Walsh and who are expecting to hear the same rhetoric from politicians that they're hearing in podcasts and on YouTube,\" she said. \"And so I would say that it's a case of politicians chasing Walsh's audience more than the other way around.\"\n\n\"Nashville has fought hard to be a community that welcomes everyone, and Matt Walsh has just come in and disregarded that by homogenizing the politics in the city.\"\n\nThe impact of Walsh's rhetoric ― and Skrmetti's ongoing investigation ― could not be any more palpable than in the stories of transgender youth and adults who are trying to find the ways to relocate to more trans-friendly states or venture on long journeys to receive medical care elsewhere.\n\nThe Tennessee family of a trans teen said their out-of-state trip was only possible with the help of a $500 grant from a nonprofit. They worry about future appointments, which will be expensive and are increasingly challenging to find. States across the South - including North Carolina, which had for many been a safe haven in the region - are banning transition care for youth.\n\n\"We'll probably have to shuffle some things around to pay for it,\" the mother said. \"We will still have electricity and running water and a house to live in. There may not be as many fun or extra things going on.\"\n\nVanderbilt is now the subject of a larger federal investigation by the Department of Human Health Services for its allegedly \"unauthorized\" release of medical records. And in July, two former Vanderbilt patients filed a class-action lawsuit against the medical center, alleging it had violated their privacy by turning their records to Skrmetti. The suit is ongoing but VUMC's attorney has filed motions to ask the judge to dismiss the case.\n\nHowser, the Vanderbilt spokesperson, declined to comment on the federal investigation or the class-action suit.\n\nFor some Tennesseans, the only path forward is to leave.\n\nRoberto Che Espinoza, a trans divinity scholar and Baptist clergyperson, left the state last month after learning his medical records had been shared with the attorney general. (Espinoza, who is in his 40s, has not received an update about his records from Vanderbilt.)\n\nEspinoza lived in Nashville for six years. He was active in the local LGBTQ+ community and often participated in social justice movements across the South, including protesting against white supremacists at the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nWhen Espinoza saw Walsh's posts about Vanderbilt, he went on Twitter to speak up about what he saw as a hateful distortion of Christianity.\n\n\"I was really vocal about the weaponization of religion and the dehumanization that the extreme right is peddling,\" he told HuffPost. \"I just tried to do my part as both a Christian minister and for my fellow trans comrades who are just trying to live their fucking lives.\"\n\nAfter that, Espinoza said he started getting harassed on Twitter.\n\n\"Nashville has fought hard to be a community that welcomes everyone, and Matt Walsh has just come in and disregarded that by homogenizing the politics in the city,\" he said.\n\nThe week before he was set to receive gender-affirming surgery at Vanderbilt, Espinoza said the Proud Boys targeted him on Telegram. His wife told him, \"I don't know how much longer I have with you.\"\n\nEspinoza said he went from being active in Nashville's queer religious community to feeling like a prisoner in his own home: \"It was a very scary time and no way to live.\"\n\nThe release of his medical records this summer was the last straw. Espinoza crowdfunded $12,000 to leave the South.\n\nHe and his wife have been building a new community in the woods. Espinoza has been enjoying grilling outside and lifting weights, and is grateful for the mundane moments of life. \"I am sleeping at night and eating three meals a day,\" he said. \"I am able to leave my house without anxiety. It's wonderful.\"\n\nAt certain times of day, Espinoza cannot help but feel those twitches of grief. He never wanted to leave the South. He misses the \"slow time.\" He misses porch visits. But he would rather be \"exiled\" in the north than feel the weight of fear and anxiety he shouldered not too long ago.\n\nRiley, however, is determined to remain in Tennessee, even as they worry that they and their colleagues will one day be pushed out of the state because of fear for their own personal and professional safety.\n\n\"I think the right thing to do is to stay,\" they said. \"If we all leave, then that's exactly what they want. It just becomes one homogenous place.\""

      "text": "This State Tried To Pass Anti-Trans Laws For Years. Then A Right-Wing Media Star Got Involved.\n\nLast September, Riley headed to their clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which was usually brimming with chatter about the day's research and patient needs.\n\nBut that fall morning, Vanderbilt was thrown into chaos, and the clinic for gender-affirming surgeries, which serviced both trans youth and adults, had been shut down for the day. The health care worker, who is using a pseudonym in fear of retaliation from their employer, said the atmosphere among their colleagues in the trans health clinic was a mix of \"fear and concern.\"\n\nRiley's clinic remained open, and their colleagues debated whether they were safe at work or should go home. Riley said local police were lined up outside the medical center's doors, serving as extra security for employees.\n\nAll day people whispered about the social media posts by right-wing blogger Matt Walsh, which had gone viral the day before for claiming that doctors at Vanderbilt's transgender health clinic \"castrate\" and \"sterilize\" children.\n\nAt the time, Riley hadn't heard of Walsh. They didn't have social media and rarely watched the news.\n\nBut over the next year, Riley would witness firsthand - again and again - how misinformation and right-wing attacks on the transgender health clinic severely restricted the kinds of care they could provide at Vanderbilt. In those months, trans Tennesseans have felt more intimidated and desperate than ever, as they have been forced to decide whether to pack up their lives to find a place where they can exist without the fear of the government, or right-wing provocateurs, meddling in their private medical information.\n\nOne of the first changes Riley saw was Vanderbilt moving the stand-alone transgender health clinic inside the university's main campus in Nashville, Tennessee. The clinic also adopted new security measures, including an armed guard behind the desk, and required patients and providers to be buzzed inside.\n\nRiley said the medical center has even canceled appointments for certain surgeries for cisgender youth that currently do not fall into the category of gender-affirmation but that critics could see as \"pathways to gender affirmation.\"\n\nBy the end of September 2022, Tennessee's attorney general, John Skrmetti, said his office had opened an investigation into Vanderbilt's transgender health clinic. Over the next few months, Skrmetti broadened the scope, first requesting specific patient medical records, and then information on Vanderbilt employees and volunteers at the transgender health clinic. The following spring, Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a ban on gender-affirming care for transgender children, effectively suspending all operations at VUMC's pediatric transgender clinic.\n\nRiley said they were one of more than a dozen clinicians who were told by Skrmetti's office that their emails could be subpoenaed as part of the investigation.\n\n\"It feels like a witch hunt,\" Riley told HuffPost. \"What are you going to find in my emails? Obviously, there's not a conspiracy here.\"\n\nIn September 2022, Walsh, a prominent Nashville-based right-wing talk show host and blogger, accused Vanderbilt University Medical Center's transgender health clinic of only existing to turn a profit. He also claimed that Vanderbilt doctors \"castrate, sterilize, and mutilate minors.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets, Walsh argued that the clinic was drugging and sterilizing children, and used language that LGBTQ+ advocates and Vanderbilt employees say grossly distorted the reality of pediatric transgender care. Walsh posted a video of one Vanderbilt doctor ― Dr. Shayne Taylor, who founded the clinic in 2018 ― discussing how gender-affirming surgeries, like double mastectomies and genital surgeries, could bring in \"a lot of money\" for the medical center. (In this video, Taylor, who did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment, was mostly referencing surgeries for trans adults, as Vanderbilt never performed genital surgeries for minors.)\n\nIn another video Walsh posted, a different doctor cautions that employees who don't want to treat transgender patients on the grounds of religious objections \"probably shouldn't work at Vanderbilt.\" At the end of the thread, Walsh wrote that the clinic's peer support group, Trans Buddy Program, was in fact a \"gang of trans activists\" acting as \"surveillance in order to force compliance.\"\n\nWalsh tweeted later that evening that his \"report\" was just the beginning. \"We are not going to let up,\" he wrote. \"We will shut this down.\"\n\nThe next day, Vanderbilt released a statement refuting Walsh's claims. \" Vanderbilt University Medical Center is now the subject of social media posts and a video that misrepresent facts about the care the Medical Center provides to transgender patients,\" the statement read. \"VUMC began its Transgender Health Clinic because transgender individuals are a high-risk population for mental and physical health issues and have been consistently underserved by the U.S. health system.\"\n\nWalsh did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this story.\n\nEven when gender-affirming medical care for minors was legal in Tennessee, the first step was still typically social transition, such as a change in name, pronouns, dress or hairstyle. Once a child hit puberty, their families might begin the long process of consulting with behavioral health specialists, endocrinologists and primary care doctors about taking puberty blockers ― medication to temporarily pause the effects of puberty ― while weighing whether hormone replacement therapy might ease a child's gender dysphoria later in their teens.\n\nOver 30 major medical associations have deemed these standards of care medically necessary and \"lifesaving.\"\n\nPuberty blockers, which stop the body from making sex hormones, help slow unwanted secondary sex characteristics. They do not, as Walsh suggested, \"sterilize\" or \"castrate\" children, though the medication could pose some risks to fertility if they are administered too early in puberty. Studies show the effects are largely reversible, and the World Professional Association of Transgender Health recommends that providers talk with patients and their families about fertility preservation before starting medication.\n\nIn the years since VUMC began providing gender-affirming care for transgender youth and adults, it grew into a holistic network of care, not only involving health care providers, but also spiritual care from a staff chaplain, weekly support groups, and insurance specialists, according to a panel of VUMC practitioners at an LGBTQ+ health equity conference this fall.\n\nVUMC performed fewer than a dozen top surgeries, or double mastectomies, each year for transmasculine patients in their late teens, according to Riley. Such surgeries require patients to undergo months of therapy beforehand, and a study published this summer showed that top surgery patients had little to no regrets decades after the operation. Both Riley and a VUMC executive, C. Wright Pinson, said that the hospital never performed \"genital procedures\" on minors.\n\nBut Walsh's claims caught the eye of Republicans in Tennessee, which, with its Republican-controlled legislature, had become a paragon of a one-party state.\n\nHours after the tweets, Lee called for a \"thorough investigation\" into VUMC, and Skrmetti vowed to use the \"full scope of his authority\" to ensure the medical center was complying with state law.\n\nThe investigation appears to have started as early as the following morning, according to emails from Republican state Sen. Jack Johson, which HuffPost obtained through a public records request. \" The Governor has already opened an investigation into Vanderbilt and I will be filing legislation to prohibit this when we come back into Session in January,\" Johnson wrote to one supporter on Sept. 21, the morning after Walsh's tweets . (The governor's office told The Associated Press that day that it had passed along concerns about VUMC to the attorney general. Lee's office recently told HuffPost over email that the attorney general has the \"statutory authority\" to open an investigation.)\n\nThe following day, Johnson responded to emails from supporters who were shocked by Walsh's allegations, reassuring them that he was on the case - and had help.\n\n\"I absolutely agree that these surgeries should not be allowed on children,\" Johnson wrote to one. \"That is why I am working with Matt Walsh to introduce legislation in our upcoming legislative session to ban these transgender surgeries on children in Tennessee .\"\n\nSkrmetti's office has said it began its probe in September 2022 after receiving a report about a Vanderbilt doctor who \"publicly described her manipulation of medical billing codes to evade coverage limitations on gender-related treatment,\" which raised concerns about possible fraud in the state's Medicaid plan, TennCare. (The plan specifically excludes \"sex change or transformation surgery.\")\n\nIn August 2023, a reporter with Nashville's News Channel 5 interviewed Skrmetti. The segment showed portions of the video that Skrmetti says instigated the report: In it, Taylor discussed how she supports patients whose insurance plans don't cover transgender health care, including saying she might write that a patient has a hormonal disorder for billing purposes so that she can order lab work for patients.\n\nSkrmetti, in the interview, said it was \"very easy\" to initiate the investigation because his office was \"already aware of the potential billing issues there.\" He acknowledged that the probe into medical records is \"probably terrifying\" for patients but said there is \"no political exception to the fraud laws.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment , Skrmetti's office referred HuffPost to the interview with News Channel 5 and did not respond to other questions for this story.\n\nAs the investigation went on, Skrmetti requested the private medical records of more than 150 Vanderbilt patients who used TennCare. John Howser, a Vanderbilt spokesperson, said the clinic was \"compelled\" to produce copies of the records, while also complying with state and federal law including HIPAA. However, many LGBTQ+ and privacy advocates across the state and country signaled they were upset that VUMC didn't fight harder to prevent turning over patient information in the investigation.\n\nRiley said they were \"flabbergasted\" to learn about the attorney general's inquiry into the center's billing process. \"There's so many levels of oversight and protection from that kind of false billing,\" they said. \"It doesn't pass the test of reason. Providers don't do the billing. There's a whole department of people that review the documentation and the code.\"\n\nPatients were not told until June of this year that their records had been turned over to the attorney general. Skrmetti's office had said it kept its \"run-of-the-mill\" investigation private in an attempt to avoid a \"media circus\" - even as it continued to broaden the scope. The attorney general requested additional patient and employee data, including the names of patients who had been referred to VUMC's trans clinic but did not seek treatment there; information on insurance claims to TennCare; employee tax forms and emails about gender-affirming care, as well as employees' resumes and employment contracts; and information about the clinic's Trans Buddy volunteers.\n\nSkrmetti's investigation and Vanderbilt's release of records have been criticized as an egregious overstep, and the latest ― and largest ― use of data requests by a state to undermine access to gender-affirming care.\n\n\" Trust between patients and their doctors is essential to quality care, and we regret any concern this may have caused for our patients,\" Howser said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\nIn the past year, as Republican-led states have increasingly passed anti-trans legislation, GOP officials nationwide have leveraged data requests about transgender residents as one of their many tools to restrict access to medical care. In Missouri , the attorney general requested and failed to obtain medical records on trans youth, while in Florida , Gov. Ron DeSantis probed state universities for data on how many students sought out gender-affirming care on campus clinics. More recently, 19 Republican attorneys general ― including Skrmetti ― signed a letter pushing back against a federal rule that would shield states from requesting data on patients seeking abortion out of state.\n\nMany trans health advocates inside and outside the state said Walsh's posts about Vanderbilt not only seemed to provide pretext for the probe and ban on gender-affirming care, but that his inflammatory language and framing took the doctors' words out of context and grossly mischaracterized the kinds of care that minors were receiving at the clinic.\n\n\"The biggest thing I've seen is just the sheer amount of terror of families of trans youth. People are really terrified that the state is going to either try to take away their children from them or put them on some kind of watch list or try to invade their privacy. There's just a lot of fear in Tennessee right now with families,\" Lucas Cameron-Vaughn, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Tennessee, told HuffPost in July.\n\nCameron-Vaughn is one of the attorneys representing the families of trans kids in L.W. v. Skrmetti , the American Civil Liberties Union's ongoing lawsuit against the state's ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The ban was recently upheld by a federal appeals court ruling.\n\n\"It may sound extreme to you when I say that we're living in a totalitarian state,\" Democratic state Sen. Heidi Campbell told HuffPost. \"Before I became a state senator I don't think those words would have come out of my mouth. But it's really just the truth. There are no checks and balances in this government anymore. We're seeing that with Skrmetti, who is hired by us to protect the people who live in this state, and is actively attacking our own citizens.\"\n\nOn Sept. 21, 2022, just one day after Walsh's initial \"report\" about VUMC, he tweeted that he had met with Johnson and Republican state Rep. William Lamberth to work on a bill to end gender-affirming care for youth. A few weeks later, ahead of the state's midterm election on Nov. 8, Lamberth penned an opinion piece promising he would \"partner\" with Walsh to halt that care for minors if he were reelected to the House.\n\nCameron-Vaughn wasn't surprised that Walsh's posts lined up neatly ahead of the state's election. \"It seems like this sort of campaign against Vanderbilt was designed to scandalize Vanderbilt University Medical Center's gender clinic by creating a deliberately false narrative right before the election,\" he said.\n\nLamberth and Johnson both won their bids for reelection, and filed identical bills to ban care for minors months before the start of the 2023 legislative session. In February, as the bill passed swiftly through committee meetings, Walsh attended a House meeting to give an expert testimony.\n\nState Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat who represents Nashville, was one of few legislators to question Walsh's expertise and knowledge of best practices for transgender youth during a committee meeting on health.\n\n\"What qualifies me is that I am a human being with a brain and common sense and a soul, and therefore I think it's a really bad idea to chemically castrate children,\" Walsh said during questioning.\n\n\"You don't use [your research] to get clicks on your publication?\" Clemmons asked.\n\nWhen the bill passed swiftly through each chamber of Tennessee's government, it was clear to Clemmons that Walsh was something new. He was the gasoline reigniting an already burning fire in Tennessee. Republicans had long been trying to pass various bans on gender-affirming care, but had been largely unsuccessful. In 2021, Tennessee succeeded in barring doctors from prescribing hormone therapy for prepubescent minors - which in reality, advocates say, was not even happening in the state.\n\nBut this opened the door for Lamberth and Johnson to go further. Their legislation allows the state to ban puberty blockers, hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries for all transgender minors. Youth who are already receiving care will have to terminate it by March of next year, and providers have already begun weaning adolescents off hormones.\n\nWalsh's voice had eclipsed the dozens of opponents to the bills ― including transgender youth and their parents, LGBTQ+ advocates, and clinicians ― who showed up each week at the statehouse to share their stories about how access to gender-affirming care was very often the buffer between life and death.\n\nClemmons said he watched with horror as Walsh and his media outlet, the Daily Wire, helped steer conversations among some of his colleagues.\n\n\"Obviously the attorney general in this state is taking marching orders from him, which is embarrassing considering he's not even elected,\" Clemmons told HuffPost, referring to Walsh. \"This is a new brand of extremism that's very dangerous, that openly admits to wanting to burn books on the House floor, that openly admits to wanting to limit people's rights. It's scary.\"\n\n\"This is state-sponsored intimidation and that's never played out well in history,\" he added.\n\nThe attorney general's office declined to comment on its relationship with Walsh.\n\nLee, the governor, signed the ban into law at the beginning of March.\n\n\"This kind of bill had been filed in previous years and did not pass because there were divisions among Republicans on intervening in medical decisions. But there was an almost complete lockstep unanimity that they were going to pass the bill in 2023,\" said Chris Sanders, the executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project.\n\n\"So Mr. Walsh is the first mover on this in a lot of ways in terms of getting a consensus built in the Republican caucus. He is not the first to think of it, but he's partly responsible for jelling the consensus in Tennessee.\"\n\nBy the end of the session in April, Tennessee had also become the first state to pass a ban on drag performances, in addition to enacting laws that defined sex as a person's \"immutable biological sex,\" and allowed teachers to misgender students.\n\nSince 2015, Tennessee has enacted 19 anti-LGBTQ+ laws , more than any other state in the country.\n\nThis all might not have been possible if Walsh's workplace hadn't been given a royal welcome to the Volunteer State.\n\nThe Daily Wire, a one-stop-shop of conservative entertainment and merch - including original documentaries, TV shows, children's programming and \"woke free\" razor blades ― has been likened to the right's answer to Hollywood with a roster of conservative hosts including Walsh, Candace Owens and Jordan Peterson.\n\nThe company, which was co-founded by columnist Ben Shapiro, relocated its headquarters from Los Angeles to Nashville in 2020. The next year, Tennessee state lawmakers passed a resolution to embrace Shapiro and his \"truth seekers,\" and celebrate their move out of \"liberal California.\"\n\n\"We congratulate Ben Shapiro and his associates at The Daily Wire on their relocation to Tennessee and extend to them our best wishes for continued success in discovering and disseminating the truth,\" the resolution stated.\n\nCampbell is highly critical of how her colleagues rolled out the welcome mat for the conservative company. \"This is an attempted hostile takeover of Nashville because they really want Nashville to be their first right-wing big city,\" she said.\n\nBy the time Walsh moved his family to Nashville, he was already practiced in \"exposing\" the ills of same-sex marriage and laws that protected transgender Americans' rights to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender.\n\n\"Millions of Americans have lost their grip on reality,\" he wrote in a 2014 blog post arguing that trans people don't exist. \"This is the real crisis, and it's far more urgent than most of what they're talking about on the news right now. \"\n\nIn the past few years, however, Walsh has turned toward a \"just asking questions\"-style attack on trans people. He built up mainstream notoriety and a career of lecturing at colleges after the release of his 2022 documentary, \"What is A Woman,\" which also sows doubt about the existence of transgender people. A self-described \"theocratic fascist,\" Walsh has also argued that trans people are \"groomers\" and part of a cult, and made posts mocking immigrants and Black people .\n\nAnd last August, Walsh responded after the right-wing account LibsofTikTok posted a barrage of false claims about the care Boston Children's Hospital provides. He called on his followers for \"an organized effort to fight back against the drugging and mutilating of children.\" Then the hospital, which is the country's first pediatric transgender health program, received two separate bomb threats. Walsh brushed off the threats as a \"leftist hoax.\"\n\nTennessee Republicans have echoed similar anti-trans rhetoric.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Tennessee Republican Caucus sent out a survey, asking constituents for their opinions about a number of issues including abortion and parental rights in schools. In a section called \"protecting children,\" the survey asks conservatives if they favor policies preventing \"minors from cutting off healthy body parts in order to change their gender identity.\" There weren't any questions about guns or firearm reform in the survey, even though the Tennessee Department of Health found that the leading cause of death for children in the state was homicide, 86% of which were due to gun violence .\n\nLate last October, Nashvillians had a glimpse of what Walsh's version of the Music City might look like when he held his \"Rally to End Child Mutilation\" at the state Capitol, which garnered around 1,500 protesters , including some Proud Boys.\n\nThere was Walsh, the bespectacled and bearded 37-year-old, standing on stage alongside Johnson and Lamberth, as well as other conservative figures including Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), who announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party last year. Other right-wing media stars, including Chloe Cole , an 18-year-old detransitioner who has testified across the country in support of bans on transition care for minors, also took the stage to speak.\n\n\"We are all here today because of this information that Matt brought forward and showed what was taking place just down the street right here in Nashville, and showing how the radical left is trying to put their woke agenda on every single family in this country,\" Blackburn told the crowd .\n\nState Sen. Janice Bowling (R) was also present, passing out fliers with what she called \"graphic\" photos of genital reconstruction surgeries some transgender people may choose to undergo . After the event, she wrote to Johnson that many of the rally's attendees didn't know \"about the assaults these surgeries are on the bodies of these children,\" according to emails obtained by HuffPost. (Two Vanderbilt employees have confirmed to HuffPost that the center never performed genital surgeries on children, as is standard among clinicians of trans care.)\n\n\"Upon looking at the photos, their resolve to 'stay the course in our opposition' was magnified,\" Bowling wrote. \"A picture is truly worth a thousand words.\"\n\nPatients were shocked to find out that their personal medical information had been shared with the attorney general - and some experienced emotional whiplash when they learned they might have been misinformed about their records being turned over. One family of a trans teen who spoke to HuffPost was first notified in June that Vanderbilt had turned over the teen's records; two months later, the medical center told the family the teen's records weren't among those given to Skrmetti.\n\nBy then, the family, which requested to remain anonymous due to concerns for their safety, had already driven hundreds of miles to North Carolina to make sure their child could continue hormone therapy.\n\n\"We depend on our care providers to be honest with us,\" the mother told HuffPost. \"They have precious lives in their hands. I don't know whether to believe this or not.\"\n\nIn early September this year, a spokesperson at Vanderbilt confirmed that not all of the 150 records that were originally requested by Skrmetti were shared with his office.\n\n\"We have since confirmed that records for only 82 of these patients were provided to the Attorney General's office,\" said Howser, the spokesperson for VUMC, in an emailed statement to HuffPost. \"After learning of this, we notified the remaining patients, whose records were requested but not provided, that their records have not been produced to the Attorney General's office.\"\n\nHowser did not respond to further questions about why only 82 records were shared and whether the records of the remaining patients could be shared with the attorney general in the future.\n\n\"Obviously the attorney general in this state is taking marching orders from [Walsh], which is embarrassing considering he's not even elected.\"\n\nThe chaos, fear and lack of clarity surrounding the investigation has affected how VUMC operated over the last year. In addition to changes in health care offered, the medical center has removed some information about gender-affirming care from its website.\n\nRiley said they can understand why Vanderbilt did what it could to avoid unwanted attention ― but said such changes did a disservice to those who might look to the clinic as a resource.\n\n\"Because of people like Matt Walsh, it forces that whole practice into the shadows, which has a negative impact on patients in that now they may not know about the practice because there's no media presence about it,\" Riley said.\n\nEven with multiple statements rejecting Walsh's claims, it has been an uphill battle to dispel the factual errors about the clinic. \"Misinformation is like a snake,\" Riley said. \"It just moves and shifts and you can say anything you want about facts and have all the patients that have had excellent outcomes...but it doesn't make a bit of difference to the attorney general.\"\n\nThough the clinic can no longer provide gender-affirming medical treatment for youth, Riley said they and their colleagues are \"more in it than ever before\" as they continue to service trans adults.\n\n\"We're more supportive even if we're not able to do all the things we were able to before. It kind of galvanizes a community of people to say, 'This is wrong. We're going to keep doing the right thing,'\" they said, emphasizing that the care they provide complies within the bounds of the state's law.\n\nClemmons believes that Skrmetti is \"abusing his discovery powers that require no judicial oversight,\" and the state's actions are ushering in \"a whole new day of invasion of privacy.\" But he is hopeful that the time will come, not too far down the line, when the flames fan out.\n\nThe results of the national midterm elections showed that running on anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric has been a losing battle for Republicans.\n\nStill, right-wing media continues to influence voters in a way that has shifted their political ideology to further extremes ― and now politicians are trying to play catch-up.\n\nAri Drennen, the LGBTQ program director at Media Matters, who has spent much of her time tracking Walsh's rise, said Walsh was able to capitalize on his boost in followers after the Boston Children's Hospital incident and translate that into a similar push of vitriol in his home state.\n\n\"I think part of the dynamic is that many Republican politicians, including in the presidential race, are competing in a field of voters who've been radicalized by personalities like Matt Walsh and who are expecting to hear the same rhetoric from politicians that they're hearing in podcasts and on YouTube,\" she said. \"And so I would say that it's a case of politicians chasing Walsh's audience more than the other way around.\"\n\n\"Nashville has fought hard to be a community that welcomes everyone, and Matt Walsh has just come in and disregarded that by homogenizing the politics in the city.\"\n\nThe impact of Walsh's rhetoric ― and Skrmetti's ongoing investigation ― could not be any more palpable than in the stories of transgender youth and adults who are trying to find the ways to relocate to more trans-friendly states or venture on long journeys to receive medical care elsewhere.\n\nThe Tennessee family of a trans teen said their out-of-state trip was only possible with the help of a $500 grant from a nonprofit. They worry about future appointments, which will be expensive and are increasingly challenging to find. States across the South - including North Carolina, which had for many been a safe haven in the region - are banning transition care for youth.\n\n\"We'll probably have to shuffle some things around to pay for it,\" the mother said. \"We will still have electricity and running water and a house to live in. There may not be as many fun or extra things going on.\"\n\nVanderbilt is now the subject of a larger federal investigation by the Department of Human Health Services for its allegedly \"unauthorized\" release of medical records. And in July, two former Vanderbilt patients filed a class-action lawsuit against the medical center, alleging it had violated their privacy by turning their records to Skrmetti. The suit is ongoing but VUMC's attorney has filed motions to ask the judge to dismiss the case.\n\nHowser, the Vanderbilt spokesperson, declined to comment on the federal investigation or the class-action suit.\n\nFor some Tennesseans, the only path forward is to leave.\n\nRoberto Che Espinoza, a trans divinity scholar and Baptist clergyperson, left the state last month after learning his medical records had been shared with the attorney general. (Espinoza, who is in his 40s, has not received an update about his records from Vanderbilt.)\n\nEspinoza lived in Nashville for six years. He was active in the local LGBTQ+ community and often participated in social justice movements across the South, including protesting against white supremacists at the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nWhen Espinoza saw Walsh's posts about Vanderbilt, he went on Twitter to speak up about what he saw as a hateful distortion of Christianity.\n\n\"I was really vocal about the weaponization of religion and the dehumanization that the extreme right is peddling,\" he told HuffPost. \"I just tried to do my part as both a Christian minister and for my fellow trans comrades who are just trying to live their fucking lives.\"\n\nAfter that, Espinoza said he started getting harassed on Twitter.\n\n\"Nashville has fought hard to be a community that welcomes everyone, and Matt Walsh has just come in and disregarded that by homogenizing the politics in the city,\" he said.\n\nThe week before he was set to receive gender-affirming surgery at Vanderbilt, Espinoza said the Proud Boys targeted him on Telegram. His wife told him, \"I don't know how much longer I have with you.\"\n\nEspinoza said he went from being active in Nashville's queer religious community to feeling like a prisoner in his own home: \"It was a very scary time and no way to live.\"\n\nThe release of his medical records this summer was the last straw. Espinoza crowdfunded $12,000 to leave the South.\n\nHe and his wife have been building a new community in the woods. Espinoza has been enjoying grilling outside and lifting weights, and is grateful for the mundane moments of life. \"I am sleeping at night and eating three meals a day,\" he said. \"I am able to leave my house without anxiety. It's wonderful.\"\n\nAt certain times of day, Espinoza cannot help but feel those twitches of grief. He never wanted to leave the South. He misses the \"slow time.\" He misses porch visits. But he would rather be \"exiled\" in the north than feel the weight of fear and anxiety he shouldered not too long ago.\n\nRiley, however, is determined to remain in Tennessee, even as they worry that they and their colleagues will one day be pushed out of the state because of fear for their own personal and professional safety.\n\n\"I think the right thing to do is to stay,\" they said. \"If we all leave, then that's exactly what they want. It just becomes one homogenous place.\""

      "text": "Matt Walsh Defends White Nationalist Organization On Daily Wire Podcast\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nMatt Walsh, one of the most-listened-to podcast hosts in America, defended a well-known white nationalist organization on his Daily Wire show this week. On Tuesday's episode of his eponymous podcast, Walsh argued that VDare - a racist nonprofit listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center - was being targeted by a government investigation solely because of its \"inconvenient\" and \"unpopular\" beliefs.\n\n\"The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, is of course best known for her campaign to seize all the assets of the leading presidential candidate, Donald Trump,\" Walsh said. \"What she's not so well-known for is her campaign to target the website VDare explicitly because of its inconvenient and unpopular beliefs. This is a story that's gotten very little attention in conservative media, but it's every bit as scandalous as what Letitia James is doing to Donald Trump.\"\n\nWalsh was referring to James' ongoing investigation into whether VDare's 2020 purchase of a $1.4 million castle in West Virginia may have violated its New York nonprofit status. He also alluded to the fact that earlier this year James won a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump for falsely inflating his net worth, meaning that the former president could be on the hook for $454 million if he loses on appeal.\n\n\"VDare likes to talk about things like crime statistics and what happens in cities like Baltimore,\" Walsh said, likely referring to the VDare website's skewed, racist of coverage of \"Black crime\" in America. \"So therefore, like Donald Trump, they need to be crushed. Every real estate transaction they've ever engaged in needs to be carefully scrutinized until they're bankrupt.\"\n\nWalsh also complained that not enough conservatives were standing up for VDare. \"Is there anyone in this country who's even suggested sacrificing anything for a site like VDare?\" he asked. \"Of course not. They have unfashionable views. So they're not going to be around much longer.\"\n\nFor Walsh to claim that VDare merely has \"unfashionable,\" \"inconvenient\" and \"unpopular\" views obscures just how extreme the organization is. As noted by Angry White Men - a website that documents white supremacist rhetoric and was the first to report on Walsh's comments - VDare has \" defended the racist manifesto of the El Paso shooter \" who killed 23 people during a 2019 anti-Hispanic shooting spree at a Walmart in Texas. And a video that VDare published on YouTube called for a secessionist movement that would result in the creation of a white ethnostate .\n\nVDare's founder, Peter Brimelow, has argued that \"Hispanics do specialize in rape.\" Brimelow has also attended events with white supremacist figures such as Richard Spencer , who helped organize the deadly 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nVDare was found in contempt of court last week for failing to comply with a subpoena issued by James' office requiring the organization to turn over emails and other internal correspondences, court records show. James is investigating whether Brimelow and his wife, Lydia Brimelow, personally profited from VDare's purchase of the medieval-style castle in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia.\n\nWalsh claimed on his show that James \"admitted out in the open that she was going to ignore the First Amendment and go after people saying things online that she does not like,\" an apparent reference to a directive James issued years ago to combat a rise in antisemitism in New York state by creating a hotline to report hate crimes and calling on social media companies to \"regulate hate speech and strengthen their policies.\" An article in Haaretz about James' directive makes no mention of her planning to investigate groups like VDare.\n\nThe Daily Wire did not respond to a request for comment about Walsh's comments on James or his defense of VDare.\n\nEarlier this week HuffPost reported that Jeremy Boreing, The Daily Wire's CEO, made a cordial livestream appearance with white supremacist Nick Fuentes , telling the young fascist influencer - who has praised Adolf Hitler and called for the execution of \"perfidious Jews\" - that he's \"talented\" and \"very funny,\" even if Boreing does have some \"concerns\" about Fuentes' views.\n\nBoreing claimed during the livestream appearance that The Daily Wire, one of the biggest right-wing media outlets in America, made $220 million in revenue last year and has over 1 million subscribers to its content.\n\nThe Daily Wire's hosts frequently promote bigoted views that wouldn't look out of place on VDare's website. Walsh, for example, has embraced the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory, which claims that there is an organized, covert effort to replace white people in America and other Western countries with nonwhite immigrants. The conspiracy theory has motivated multiple white supremacist mass shootings in America.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "You're a Stay at Home Mom? What Do You Do All Day?\n\nBlogger, talk radio host, father of twins\n\nIt's happened twice in a week, and they were both women. Anyone ought to have more class than this, but women -- especially women -- should damn well know better.\n\nLast week, I was at the pharmacy and a friendly lady approached me.\n\n\"Matt! How are those little ones doing?\"\n\n\"Great! They're doing very well, thanks for asking.\"\n\n\"Good to hear. How 'bout your wife? Is she back at work yet?\"\n\n\"Well she's working hard at home, taking care of the kids. But she's not going back into the workforce, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Oh fun! That must be nice!\"\n\n\"Fun? It's a lot of hard work. Rewarding, yes. Fun? Not always.\"\n\nThis one wasn't in-your-face. It was only quietly presumptuous and subversively condescending.\n\nThe next incident occurred today at the coffee shop. It started in similar fashion; a friendly exchange about how things are coming along with the babies. The conversation quickly derailed when the woman hit me with this:\n\n\"So is your wife staying at home permanently?\"\n\n\"Permanently? Well, for the foreseeable future she will be raising the kids full time, yes.\"\n\n\"Yeah, mine is 14 now. But I've had a career the whole time as well. I can't imagine being a stay at home mom. I would get so antsy. [Giggles] What does she DO all day?\"\n\n\"Oh, just absolutely everything. What do you do all day?\"\n\n\"...Me? Ha! I WORK!\"\n\n\"My wife never stops working. Meanwhile, it's the middle of the afternoon and we're both at a coffee shop. I'm sure my wife would love to have time to sit down and drink a coffee. It's nice to get a break, isn't it?\"\n\nThe conversation ended less amicably than it began.\n\nLook, I don't cast aspersions on women who work outside of the home. I understand that many of them are forced into it because they are single mothers, or because one income simply isn't enough to meet the financial needs of their family. Or they just choose to work because that's what they want to do. Fine. I also understand that most \"professional\" women aren't rude, pompous and smug, like the two I met recently.\n\nBut I don't want to sing Kumbaya right now. I want to kick our backwards, materialistic society in the shins and say, \"GET YOUR FREAKING HEAD ON STRAIGHT, SOCIETY.\"\n\nThis conversation shouldn't be necessary. I shouldn't need to explain why it's insane for anyone -- particularly other women -- to have such contempt and hostility for \"stay at home\" mothers. Are we really so shallow? Are we really so confused? Are we really the first culture in the history of mankind to fail to grasp the glory and seriousness of motherhood? The pagans deified Maternity and turned it into a goddess. We've gone the other direction; we treat it like a disease or an obstacle.\n\nThe people who completely immerse themselves in the tiring, thankless, profoundly important job of raising children ought to be put on a pedestal. We ought to revere them and admire them like we admire rocket scientists and war heroes. These women are doing something beautiful and complicated and challenging and terrifying and painful and joyous and essential. Whatever they are doing, they ARE doing something, and our civilization DEPENDS on them doing it well. Who else can say such a thing? What other job carries with it such consequences?\n\nIt's true -- being a mom isn't a \"job.\" A job is something you do for part of the day and then stop doing. You get a paycheck. You have unions and benefits and break rooms. I've had many jobs; it's nothing spectacular or mystical. I don't quite understand why we've elevated \"the workforce\" to this hallowed status. Where do we get our idea of it? The Communist Manifesto? Having a job is necessary for some -- it is for me -- but it isn't liberating or empowering. Whatever your job is -- you are expendable. You are a number. You are a calculation. You are a servant. You can be replaced, and you will be replaced eventually. Am I being harsh? No, I'm being someone who has a job. I'm being real.\n\nIf your mother quit her role as mother, entire lives would be turned upside down; society would suffer greatly. The ripples of that tragedy would be felt for generations. If she quit her job as a computer analyst, she'd be replaced in four days and nobody would care. Same goes for you and me. We have freedom and power in the home, not the office. But we are zombies, so we can not see that.\n\nYes, my wife is JUST a mother. JUST. She JUST brings forth life into the universe, and she JUST shapes and molds and raises those lives. She JUST manages, directs and maintains the workings of the household, while caring for children who JUST rely on her for everything. She JUST teaches our twins how to be human beings, and, as they grow, she will JUST train them in all things, from morals, to manners, to the ABC's, to hygiene, etc. She is JUST my spiritual foundation and the rock on which our family is built. She is JUST everything to everyone. And society would JUST fall apart at the seams if she, and her fellow moms, failed in any of the tasks I outlined.\n\nYes, she is just a mother. Which is sort of like looking at the sky and saying, \"hey, it's just the sun.\"\n\nOf course not all women can be at home full time. It's one thing to acknowledge that; it's quite another to paint it as the ideal. To call it the ideal, is to claim that children IDEALLY would spend LESS time around their mothers. This is madness. Pure madness. It isn't ideal, and it isn't neutral. The more time a mother can spend raising her kids, the better. The better for them, the better for their souls, the better for the community, the better for humanity. Period.\n\nFinally, it's probably true that stay at home moms have some down time. People who work outside the home have down time, too. In fact, there are many, many jobs that consist primarily of down time, with little spurts of menial activity strewn throughout. In any case, I'm not looking to get into a fight about who is \"busier.\" We seem to value our time so little, that we find our worth based on how little of it we have. In other words, we've idolized \"being busy,\" and confused it with being \"important.\" You can be busy but unimportant, just as you can be important but not busy. I don't know who is busiest, and I don't care. It doesn't matter. I think it's safe to say that none of us are as busy as we think we are; and however busy we actually are, it's more than we need to be.\n\nWe get a lot of things wrong in our culture. But, when all is said and done, and our civilization crumbles into ashes, we are going to most regret the way we treated mothers and children.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nRight-wing commentator Matt Walsh has made a name for himself with his relentless, religious-inflected trans-bashing. He's a bad thinker and a bad Christian.\n\nMatt Walsh speaking during a rally against gender-affirming care in Nashville, Tennessee, in October 2022. (Seth Herald / AFP via  Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of Church of Cowards: A Wake-Up Call to Complacent Christians (Regnery Gateway, 2020) and What is a Woman? (DW Books, 2020) by Matt Walsh\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche once wrote, \"Mystical explanations are considered deep. The truth is they are not even superficial.\" By that logic the work of Matt Walsh is so superficial it barely registers as two-dimensional.\n\nA media commentator for the Daily Wire , Walsh tackles big questions like the scientificity of a black mermaid and the fertility of sixteen-year-old girls. But Walsh has become most well-known for the relentless bile he directs at the LGBTQ movement, particularly in his widely cited documentary What is a Woman? and its sister book .\n\nWhile the competition has become stiff, Walsh's truly obsessive fixation on what people do with their genitals has made him the US right's homophobe and transphobe in chief. And he pairs this bizarre preoccupation with a crusading right-wing Christianity, on full display in Church of Cowards: A Wake-Up Call to Complacent Christians .\n\nWalsh is an equal opportunity offender. When he isn't spending a curious amount of time talking about Disney movies , Walsh likes to chastise other conservative Christians for spending too much time on love and compassion. As he puts it in Church of Cowards, Walsh thinks the lamb of God would be better served by a little more hatred:\n\nI'd like to say a word about hatred. While our world proclaims easy virtues, it also condemns easy vices. Even the most limp-wristed and cowardly of pastors, the kind who will not denounce sin in any form, will still have no problem wagging his finger over the alleged evils of hatred. But hatred in and of itself is not evil. Hatred can in fact be a good thing, even a beautiful thing. We should bear in mind that indifference, not hatred, is love's opposite. Hatred is a part of love and a sign of its vitality.\n\nErgo vindicating Dante's wisdom that above the entrance to hell will be written: \"I too was created by the Might divine, the highest Wisdom and the primal Love.\" True to his word, Walsh devotes many pages to liturgizing on what he hates, which often seems to be most things and people in God's creation. A non-exhaustive list: any and all broad-minded forms of Christianity, excessive positivity, subpar evangelical films like the God's Not Dead series (no argument there), and \"cheap repentance.\" In Walsh's hands, Christianity becomes less the \"good news\" than pharisaical fire and brimstone.\n\nMuch of Walsh's animus appears motivated by his disdain for the perceived sentimentalism of liberal Christianity, which he derides as a capitulation to the secular world. His response to liberal Christian kitsch is near-Manichean Christian bloviation, where darkness and doom are omnipresent and only maximalist and masculinist discipline can deliver redemption. In one amusing chapter, Walsh chastises twenty-first-century Christians for ceasing to believe in the literal Devil, dropping in passages like:\n\nReligious leaders will attract special attention from Satan. If they are weak, he will topple them with ease. The higher on the ladder they have climbed, the farther they will fall. It takes an angel to make a demon, after all. That is another Christian doctrine that seems to be verified by experience.\n\nThis is the same guy, mind you, who excoriates leftists for not believing enough in empirical science and advancing irrational, ideologically driven views of the world.\n\nThe funniest thing about Walsh's Christianity is that I'm not convinced he takes it that intellectually seriously. For all the preening hectoring in Church of Cowards , so much of it operates at a theologically and historically surface level. Early in the book, he appeals to the nineteenth-century thinker Søren Kierkegaard to argue that \"there is no use telling a godless person to enjoy life\" because \"if there is nothing beyond this life, and no greater purpose behind it, then he is right.\"\n\nThis badly misconstrues the great Christian existentialist's account of \"spheres of life,\" which Kierkegaard divided into the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious. Kierkegaard recognized that all have their charms, and even their qualities - the title of his early Either/Or implies that we must choose which sphere to enter. At points Kierkegaard even stresses the superior intellectuality and grandeur of the aesthetic over the ethical sphere.\n\nKierkegaard would have also found bizarre Walsh's belief that a religious person should behave ethically according to socially conservative \"common sense.\" The whole point of his early masterpiece Fear and Trembling was that God's demands often appear as not only punishing, but profoundly contrary to common-sense ethical requirements. So much so that a person of faith will often feel compelled to \"teleologically suspend\" the ethical. Kierkegaard's position grew so radical near the end of his life that he took the notably anti-Walsh position of wanting a reduction in the number of Christians to save \"authentic\" Christianity from the polluting ties to \"Christendom\" - which deflated the highly individualistic demands of faith to the banalities of moralism.\n\nAnother, even lazier example of Walsh's historical fatuousness comes when he appeals to Charles Taylor's A Secular Age. Walsh whines about how \"Christ has been ripped from the center of human existence and sent out to the hinterlands.\" He refers to Taylor's notion of \"buffered selves\" by saying that secularization created a world where \"between ourselves and God lies a giant buffer that obscures the mystical light of divinity.\"\n\nIn fact, Taylor's argument about \"buffered selves\" refers to a process that was carried out in part through the spread of Christianity. Whereas premodern pagan societies made no strict demarcation between the human self and enchanted nature, Reformist and individualistic forms of Christianity turned the moral focus of people inward - creating a deeper sense of self at the cost of an increasing disenchantment with nature and one another. Secularization, far from being a process external to Christianity, emerged from tendencies within the Christian tradition itself.\n\nWalsh's pseudotheological scribblings are important to keep in mind when dissecting the pseudoscientific transphobia of What is a Woman?\n\nThere, in head-spinning fashion, he veers from insisting on the existence of demons and implying the literal truth of the Genesis myth to posturing as a disciple of scientific rationalism. Of course, since overwhelming majorities in the \"medical establishment, professional organizations, and psychiatrists\" don't support Walsh's regressive view of so-called \"gender confused people,\" he must dismiss them as \"ideologues\" and \"in it for the money.\" By contrast, anti-trans figures like Dr Miriam Grossman who are willing to give Walsh the time of day get to be \"certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist(s).\"\n\nThis vacillating respect for scientific and academic authority continues in his interpersonal evaluations. Walsh switches between posing as a calm rationalist, just asking questions to irrational \"trans ideologues,\" and calling his enemies \"poison\" and \"predators\" and \"pathetic little gutless cowards.\"\n\nThe reason for these about-faces is that Walsh's appeals to scientific rationalism are nothing more than rank opportunism. Walsh makes his underlying views very clear at the end of the book version of What is a Woman? :\n\nThe question 'what is a woman' is certainly about sex, gender, biology, social roles, and the like. Yet more profoundly, it is a question about identity. Where do we find our identity? How do we define ourselves? Is identity something we fulfill within the grand and ornate structure of nature, community, duties and responsibilities - rooted in words like father, mother, son, daughter, friend, or child of God? Or is identity something we define from within ourselves. Maybe happiness comes not from making the world affirm 'who we are,' but by becoming who we were created to be.\n\nTo Walsh, trans individuals and LGBTQ people broadly embody the decadent worship of personalized \"identity\" in modern society. Allowing individuals to express their inner sense of self through various \"experiments in living\" challenges his sense that there's a stable cosmic order where each thing has its ordained natural place and essential characteristics.\n\nThe political takeaway is that figures like Walsh think their imagined natural order is one to which we must subordinate ourselves, since the \"Promethean\" yearning to overcome it generates anarchic chaos. Walsh's entreaties map very cleanly onto a hierarchical and authoritarian worldview, where trans and queer individuals are to remain shut away so Walsh and his brethren have a safe space from fears of existential disintegration.\n\nMeanwhile, his rhetorical bombast papers over the contradictions cutting straight through his worldview. It's why surgery to remove cancer - as scientifically natural a phenomenon as one can imagine - is fine, but gender-affirming surgeries are some kind of metaphysical crime. The former doesn't trouble Walsh's metaphysical sensitivities through its (often-profound) reconfigurations of the human body to alleviate natural conditions like disease or harm, but gender-affirming surgery that often alleviates harm to trans individuals does.\n\nThe key question Walsh should have been asking isn't \"what is a woman?\" Given how frequently he admits to not understanding the science around trans identity or gender, those kinds of metaphysical questions aren't up his alley. Instead, the key question is whether individuals should be legally allowed to transition and have their choices respected. For adults the answer has to be yes. Adults should be given wide latitude to do as they wish with their body to the extent that it doesn't harm another person.\n\nAdding to this, we can ask whether it should be an ethical norm to not misgender people. Some, like Walsh, insist that they will refuse to call anyone by their identified gender since it deviates from (crudely conceived) biology. But as Ben Burgis points out , this is an absurd claim that doesn't even conform to already-existing social expectations. For instance, when someone describes their adopted child as \"my daughter,\" no one except Matt Walsh would take issue with it by saying \"she wasn't born that way and I'll never call her your daughter!\"\n\nFor youth, the question is more complicated, but also more pressing. Walsh often makes light of claims that trans youth will take their own lives without gender-affirming care or acceptance from their families, while ignoring the reams of evidence that suggest his opponents are right. His condescension is all the more disturbing since the transphobic rhetoric he peddles makes suicides more likely.\n\nThe best form of care for trans youth is a complex question that will continue to be debated. But Walsh and those like him only make it harder to investigate dispassionately with their shrill invective , straight out of the 1950s, about \"trans violence\" and pedophilic grooming.\n\nIn the end, Walsh's worldview is deeply contrary to the \"Christian\" philosophy it espouses. In fact, for all Walsh's anxieties about secularization, he perfectly embodies Nietzsche's observation about the worst tendencies of moralistic Christianity to provide a license to demand hatred through a perversion of the language of love. Believer or nonbeliever, I can think of nothing that would make Christianity less appealing.\n\nMatt McManus is a lecturer at the University of Michigan and the author of The Emergence of Postmodernity and the forthcoming The Political Right and Inequality .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

He is the author of, among other books, The Political Right and Equality , A How To Guide to Cosmopolitan Socialism , and the forthcoming The Political Theory of Liberal Socialism .\n\nThe unfreedom workers suffer on the job has been an abiding critique of capitalism, and for good reason. A society that allows for the full development of human freedom must allow people to collectively determine the conditions under which they work.\n\nIn his latest book, right-wing provocateur Jordan Peterson looks to extract existential and political lessons from the Old Testament. Far from probing deep truths, it's a shallow, self-serving exercise in culture war.\n\nConservatives today often denigrate a concern with economic inequality as a deviant left-wing preoccupation. In fact, from antiquity to the present, canonical thinkers of diverse political orientations have diagnosed economic inequality as a great evil.\n\nAlasdair MacIntyre's original critique of liberal modernity has won followers on the Left and the Right. His account of how capitalism has undermined the conditions of human flourishing deserves the serious attention of socialists.\n\nThe historical shortcomings of liberalism don't mean that socialists should throw liberalism out wholesale. On the contrary: socialism needs liberalism.\n\nA new book argues that liberalism offers not just a set of institutional norms but a compelling way of thinking about human flourishing. To offer a complete account of the good life, liberalism needs to confront the structural injustices of capitalism.\n\nIn his new book, Slavoj Žižek advances a provocative understanding of Christianity as a progressive, secularizing force. It's classic Žižek - by turns brilliant and infuriating.\n\nIn Free and Equal , economist and philosopher Daniel Chandler argues that the ideas of John Rawls offer solutions to the crisis of liberal democracy. Jacobin spoke with Chandler to discuss how socialists should engage with Rawlsian politics.\n\nThomas Sowell has been a titan of conservative politics for decades. Underneath the erudition and prolific output is a cynical thinker who puts an intellectual gloss on social domination.\n\nOver a century ago, Friedrich Nietzsche's thought sparked a heated debate among Danish intellectuals about society's moral foundations. The dispute prefigured today's debates between the Left and the far right, which continues to be inspired by Nietzsche.\n\nThe diverse mosaic of European socialism engaged both reformists and revolutionaries, often driven by not just intellect but also profound religious conviction. Together, these elements shaped the democratic socialist tradition.\n\nThe late Michael Brooks championed a vision of international solidarity, grounded in our shared humanity. In doing so, he was reviving a tradition of cosmopolitanism that has long animated socialist and working-class movements at their best.\n\nSocialist intellectual Georg Lukács was an astute critic of right-wing philosophy and its connections to fascism. For Lukács, philosophers of the Right were united by a reactionary disavowal of reason and justice.\n\nThe political right is a diverse intellectual tradition and world-making project. But there's one thing that unites every variant of right-wing ideology: the belief that society will improve if we give up on the dream of a world where people are equal.\n\nDespite his towering academic reputation, John Rawls's ideas have had little impact outside the university. That's a shame: as the failures of neoliberalism have become increasingly stark, Rawls's egalitarian theory of justice has much to recommend it.\n\nSohrab Ahmari's critique of capitalist power is surprising and compelling. But as long as he remains committed to unjust hierarchies of power in gender and sexuality, he can't be a coalition partner with the Left.\n\nUnder capitalism, the formal equality guaranteed under the law is a farce. Democratic socialism can guarantee liberal rights like free speech while shattering the resource imbalances of capitalism.\n\nRight-wing commentator Matt Walsh has made a name for himself with his relentless, religious-inflected trans-bashing. He's a bad thinker and a bad Christian.\n\nIn his new book, Ron DeSantis presents himself as a blue-collar kid who hates elites. But the truth is, DeSantis doesn't oppose elite rule - this Ivy Leaguer simply wants a different set of elites like himself to rule over the rest of us.\n\nA new history of libertarianism challenges the conventional understanding of the tradition by spotlighting its radical currents. Unfortunately, there's barely a remnant of that history today - most libertarians threw in their lot with the Right long ago.\n\n{{ message }}"

According to him, its advocates - and all other defenders of egalitarianism - had a single aim: leveling differences and suppressing individual genius.\n\nIn postwar Europe, Friedrich Nietzsche was seen as an intellectual proto-Nazi. A new book explains how two antifascist Italian academics - one of whom was a communist - fought to recover the \"real\" Nietzsche for the Left.\n\nOver a century ago, Friedrich Nietzsche's thought sparked a heated debate among Danish intellectuals about society's moral foundations. The dispute prefigured today's debates between the Left and the far right, which continues to be inspired by Nietzsche.\n\nNietzsche's critique of modernity has fascinated thinkers on the Right and Left - but in its essence, it belongs to the Right. The Left must advance an alternative modernity.\n\nKarl Marx believed in the self-emancipation of the working class, while Friedrich Nietzsche had nothing but disdain for the masses. But a provocative new book claims the two thinkers can be read together to develop a socialism for today.\n\nLibertarians aren't pleased with Corey Robin's new work on Nietzsche and the Austrian school. Here's his lengthy rebuttal.\n\nToday's right-wing thinkers look to Nietzsche and other German reactionaries to ground their elitist politics - and to do battle with leftists' project of universal emancipation.\n\nThe theorists of the Frankfurt School wanted to promote a critical Marxism that wasn't hobbled by one-dimensional economic determinism.

He's a bad thinker and a bad Christian.\n\nThe eminent philosopher Raymond Geuss wants us to think about ways of being that exist entirely outside of liberalism.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of Tyranny, Inc.: How Private Power Crushed American Liberty - and What to Do About It by Sohrab Ahmari (Forum Books, 2023).\n\nFew contemporary American political commentators have ridden an ideological rollercoaster as wild and convoluted as Sohrab Ahmari's. Born in theocratic Iran, Ahmari was a Marxist atheist in his twenties before becoming a conservative Christian in his thirties. And not just your garden-variety conservative Christian: Ahmari went full Roman Catholic, and for a time gained fame (or infamy) as a maximalist culture warrior willing to take shots at center-right pundits like David French for being too soft on matters like using the state to advance militantly social conservative cultural policies. I became aware of Ahmari around the time of that debate, and penned several articles and reviews taking issue with pretty much all of his talking points.\n\nBut mercurial to his core, Ahmari has pivoted yet again. Since 2020 he has become more critical of the conservative movement for ignoring the economic travails of the American working class . Ahmari helped found Compact magazine , an ideologically syncretic outlet in the spirit of Christopher Lasch . Compact' s ambition is to argue for a strong social democratic state that also resists libertine ideologies and upholds local, national, familial, and religious communities, often with a reactionary bent.\n\nIn keeping with that vision, Ahmari's latest book, Tyranny, Inc.: How Private Power Crushed American Liberty - and What to Do About It , hearkens back to his Marxist days. Ahmari deserves credit for not following in the footsteps of other right-wing commentators and pols: in the book, he's not going the route of Ron DeSantis , who believes that homophobic diatribes about getting gay characters out of Disney films plus lowering the minimum wage somehow makes him an anti-corporate warrior. Ahmari argues that the \"populist conservatism heralded by Trump's election in 2016 has so far proved illusory. It's largely a cultural phenomenon, with Republican lawmakers, for example, loudly griping about businesses that discriminate against conservative employees and customers - without lifting a finger to alter the fundamental balance of power between corporations and the rest of us.\"\n\nIn this, Ahmari is absolutely right. While my previous readings of Ahmari's work made me wary going into Tyranny, Inc. , I ultimately found it a very sharp and readable critique of workplace exploitation and domination by corporations, which behave like private, undemocratic governments . Ahmari's genuine empathetic concern for America's working class shines through, as does his disdain for neoliberalism.\n\nUnfortunately, while I have nothing but praise for Tyranny, Inc. , I cannot endorse a social democratic compact between social conservatives and radical leftists. Such a coalition is neither viable nor desirable.\n\nAhmari begins Tyranny Inc. with a presentation of three outrageous scenarios of repression. The first occurs in the People's Republic of China, where a state-owned slaughterhouse constantly surveys its employees, stoking fear and docking pay for \"wasting the people's time.\" One employee leads a walkout to demand better safety conditions and is immediately terminated. The second takes place in Russia, where employees of Gazprom are told they must attend a speech by Vladimir Putin or take the day off without pay.\n\nFinally, in Iran, a junior level analyst named Pourmoradi is tracked by his commanders through keylogger software that records every word he types. They commandeer his email password and use it to snoop through his private correspondences, discovering to their horror that he joked about the weight of a commanding officer. When Pourmoradi discovers this and confronts the powers that be, he is dishonorably discharged and sent packing.\n\nIt's a clever sleight of hand: in reality, Ahmari reveals, all of these events took place in the United States. The Chinese slaughterhouse was actually Amazon, and the brave employee was Amazon union organizer Christian Smalls. Gazprom is in fact Shell, and Vladimir Putin was Donald Trump. And the real Pourmoradi was Lisa Rene, whose employer G. F. Fishers monitored her private life and then fired her when she brought the matter to light. Far from anomalies, Ahmari posits these stories as the tip of a very large iceberg of corporate domination that has grown under neoliberalism.\n\nDrawing heavily on Marxist theorists like David Harvey , Ahmari describes neoliberalism as a framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade, a \"theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills\" within a specific set of coercive institutions:\n\nNeoliberal theory, the successor to laissez-faire ideology, is arguably more utopian than the original. Yet put to practice, neoliberalism has yielded a brute \"restoration of class power\" as the economic geographer David Harvey puts it. More than that, neoliberalism has transfigured what it means to belong to a political community and what states are for, dramatically narrowing the scope for resisting economic power.\n\nAhmari goes on to cite the great left-wing political theorist Wendy Brown to stress how contemporary neoliberalism differs from \"old school laissez faire.\" Classical economic liberals wanted the state to withdraw within certain parameters - after coercively establishing a legal regime enforcing property rights, of course. By contrast, neoliberals sought to \"activate the state on behalf of the economy,\" shielding the market from democratic pressures and expanding capitalism into previously insulated domains.\n\nQuoting Michel Foucault, Ahmari claims that \"neoliberalism seeks to regulate society by the market.\" From Ahmari's perspective, neoliberalism has been tremendously successful in this ambition over the last half-century, subordinating vast numbers of people to domination by private and unaccountable power.\n\nAfter they finish reeling with surprise at a well-known American conservative positively referencing David Harvey, there is nothing much in the above for a democratic socialist to quibble with. Indeed, Ahmari doesn't just go after the systemic and theoretical roots of private power. He also names names, criticizing a wide array of right-wing voices and conservative institutions for their collusion with private corporate tyranny.\n\nHis targets notably include the current Supreme Court, which Ahmari calls the \"Bosses' Court\" and censures as a handmaiden of private power. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, comes in for special ribbing. Ahmari discusses Epic Systems v. Lewis , a case concerning whether an employer can mandate that workers agree to private arbitration and ban them from pursuing class action suits.\n\nThe question was of vital importance since, particularly when facing down large companies, it is often very difficult for employees to sue unless they organize a class action suit. Delivering what Ahmari describes as \"one of the cruelest decisions ever issued by a high court,\" Gorsuch dismissed the employee's claim.\n\nAll this testifies to Ahmari's sincerity as a critic of economic power and conveys the impression that he wants the book to be taken seriously by the Left. And credit where due, Tyranny, Inc. deserves to be taken seriously. To the extent that his book suggests an emerging consensus on the dangers of private government, that should be celebrated as contributing to a shift in the overton window of the economically possible.\n\nAs a singular book, I truly enjoyed Tyranny, Inc. But the remaining question is whether that consensus can translate into a real-world coalition. On the matter of whether the Left and the Right can be united on the basis of a shared commitment to robust social democracy and social conservatism, I am far more skeptical.\n\nAhmari doesn't address this at great length in Tyranny, Inc. , mostly limiting himself to observing that conservatives are often \"the first to lament\" the \"cultural ramifications\" of market society while chastising them for not extending their critique to the \"shape of our political-economic order.\" He does not specify the nature of those \"ramifications\" - are we talking about \"cancel culture\" or gay marriage?\n\nIt may hypothetically be possible to enact some kind of left-right synthesis in a way that does equal service to each. But in the wild, political ideologies are frequently forged in ways that can seem baffling to theorists. Theoretically, there would seem to be little shared ground between, say, social conservatives and libertarians. In the real world, commitments to anti-communism and an opposition to basic concerns of social justice and attempts to dismantle hierarchies around race and gender made just such a \"fusionist\" synthesis the ruling ideology of the American right for decades.\n\nNevertheless, there is a deep theoretical affinity between the Left's desire to resist domination and inequality in the economy, and the aspiration to similarly put pressure on unjust patriarchal, ethno-national, heteronormative, and cultural hierarchies of the sort that social conservatives - including Ahmari - have historically defended. These positions flow from a set of unifying aspirations that have been central to the Left since before even the French Revolution: the yearning to secure liberty, equality, and solidarity for all, regardless of circumstance. Resisting private economic power is one element in this project, and arguably the most crucial, but it isn't the only one.\n\nMoreover, it isn't even clear that one can be a successful anti-capitalist without committing to struggles against social domination. For instance, as Nancy Fraser reminds us in Cannibal Capitalism , early capitalist societies relied very heavily on women's care work and domestic work as an unacknowledged and uncompensated contribution to the production process - a clear example of structural overlap between economic and patriarchal domination. That arrangement has not fully been dissolved, even as women have entered the official workforce; in fact, they are now often subject to new forms of exploitation on top of the old. It would thus be impractical and unjust to cordon off feminism from anti-capitalism.\n\nThe same can be said of the many other struggles to which the Left must remain committed. Social oppression and economic exploitation are not one and the same, but they tend to reinforce each other. In practice, one can't credibly resist the latter without taking a firm stance against the former.\n\nThe Right is eager to condemn \"woke\" identity politics, and indeed a certain style of discourse on the identitarian left is worthy of some condemnation. But the Right does not disentangle these from legitimate battles against oppression, seeing them as one and the same.\n\nFor instance, right now conservatives like Ron DeSantis are proposing to ban transgender people from the military and trying to stop teachers from acknowledging the existence of LGBTQ people. He couches these efforts as part of a broader war on \"wokeness,\" but it's clearly just a war on LGBTQ people. Trans citizens are currently facing one of the most cruelly hostile reactions in decades, with pundits like Matt Walsh actively calling for a more \" hate \"-based Christian right. Moreover, Republican politicians who talk a big game about going to war with corporate power are simultaneously employing austerity and anti-worker policies in practice, as DeSantis's policies on minimum wages have shown.\n\nDeSantis's proposals are a form a tyrannical domination by a coercive state every bit as pronounced as the forms of workplace tyranny expertly skewered in Ahmari's book. We can oppose them both simultaneously. The Right is not going to do the same.\n\nI admire Ahmari's recent acknowledgement that the GOP \"will never\" be a party for the working class, his (at least partial) break with Trump, and his embrace of Sanders- and Warren-style economics. But unless Ahmari has recently changed his mind, he continues to oppose gay marriage and abortion.\n\nMeanwhile, Adrian Vermeule and Patrick Deneen have expressed deep reservations about democracy and endorsed forms of \"aristopopulism\" oriented around erecting a new conservative elite to replace our current neoliberal one. Until they're willing to reconsider these positions and disentangle their opposition to cancel culture with the Right's opposition to social equality, the Left can't see them as allies. This reflects the abiding fact that the Right is committed to the preservation or restoration of old hierarchies, or in its more radical forms the construction of new ones. This is simply something an emancipatory left can never get behind.\n\nAhmari has surprised this reader and longtime critic with his trenchant critique of neoliberalism and corporate power, and I'm pleased to see him argue to end the reign of tyranny in the workplace. I'm happy to say that Tyranny, Inc. is a very engaging book that draws attention to vital issues with passion and lucidity, and it will hopefully spark much needed reflection among conservatives. But until the populist right recognizes the harm caused by anti-feminism, homophobia, racism, and more, it'll have to be thanks but no thanks on an enduring compact.\n\nMatt McManus is a lecturer at the University of Michigan and the author of The Emergence of Postmodernity and the forthcoming The Political Right and Inequality .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But in reality, winning elections and protecting elite interests is the point - and transgender kids and their families are caught in the crosshairs.\n\nIn recent years, a cavalcade of British liberals has taken to Twitter to denounce the supposed trans takeover. But as last week's Labour Party conference showed, pushback against trans rights has also become a key weapon in the Blairite war against the Left.\n\nRegarding anti-trans* rhetoric as legitimate erases the experiences of an entire class of people.\n\nHe has a long history of supporting trans rights, his platform addresses the specific problems trans people face, and he takes pains to include transgender people in the sweeping universal programs that are his hallmark. There's no question: on trans issues, Bernie Sanders is the best candidate in the presidential race.\n\nIt's sometimes hard to remember that five years ago, both Labour and Conservatives were in general agreement about the need to expand rights for trans people. But since then, both parties have drifted to the right on LGBTQ politics.\n\nAs necessary as queer legal protections are, we should be cautious of transgender equality by legislative interpretation.\n\nRight-wing commentator Matt Walsh has made a name for himself with his relentless, religious-inflected trans-bashing. He's a bad thinker and a bad Christian.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing a vicious anti-trans agenda. Unions are one of the best tools we have to fight back.\n\nBy viciously attacking transgender kids and their families, Texas governor Greg Abbott and his conservative admirers have proven that they're talking nonsense when they claim to care about shielding families from the overreach of government bureaucrats.\n\nThe TPP's language is complex, but its result would be simple: more corporate power, and less democratic control.\n\nLabor's ability to improve queer workers' lives stems from its power to raise standards for all workers.\n\nTransgender Day of Remembrance is a time to commemorate past victims of violence - and rededicate ourselves to ending it.\n\nThe Argentine gay rights movement also fought for marriage equality. Why has it been so much more radical than the American one?\n\nReflections on the life of Leslie Feinberg, the late radical activist and author of Stone Butch Blues .\n\nJessa Crispin's new book Why I Am Not a Feminist offers some ideas on how to weave a strong class politics into twenty-first century feminism.\n\nIn Who's Afraid of Gender? , Judith Butler seeks to explain the global right's obsession with gender. Their latest book, however, fails to see that the aim of conservative scapegoating is to legitimize an unpopular political program.\n\n{{ message }}"

I have no idea who is behind it,\" the Republican said over the summer about the blueprint largely written by members of his own team . He added, \"I have nothing to do with them.\"\n\nAs recently as two weeks ago, Trump went so far as to question whether it was even legal for people to air campaign ads pointing out his connections to Project 2025. It came on the heels of an online item in which he said in reference to the right-wing agenda, \"I have, and had, nothing to do with it, NEVER READ IT, NEVER SAW IT.\"\n\nElection 2024 has obviously come and gone, and while time will tell the degree to which the incoming Trump administration follows the radical plan, Project 2025 is already working its way back into the spotlight.\n\nJust hours after Trump was declared the winner, conservative commentator Matt Walsh published an item to social media that read, \"Now that the election is over I think we can finally say that yeah actually Project 2025 is the agenda. Lol.\"\n\nMaybe he was joking or maybe he was just trying to get a rise out of the left, but Steve Bannon - recently released from prison - took time on his post-election show to highlight Walsh's missive and describe it \"fabulous.\"\n\nA report in The New Republic added, \"Later during the livestream, Bannon could be seen holding a hard copy of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 'Mandate For Leadership' up to the camera in celebration.\"\n\nRolling Stone highlighted a handful of related examples: \"Right-wing podcast Benny Johnson also gloated about the project. 'It is my honor to inform you all that Project 2025 was real the whole time,' he wrote. In a separate post, Tarrant County GOP Chair Bo French wrote, 'So can we admit now that we are going to implement Project 2025?'\"\n\nI recognize trolling when I see it. These guys are probably needling opponents rather than ripping the mask off a sinister plan.

I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad you're exactly who you are.\"\n\nThe post, which garnered more than 120,000 likes on Instagram and 393,000 on TikTok, became immediate fodder for the anti-LGBTQ culture war , which has infiltrated classrooms, libraries and online rhetoric. Right-wing circles in recent years have pushed anti-LGBTQ narratives by accusing the community of being pedophiles, weaponizing the term \"groomer\" to antagonize LGBTQ people and their allies.\n\nA slew of right-wing figures blasted Accurso online and used their platforms to encourage parents to bar their children from watching her content.\n\nDaily Wire host Matt Walsh, who describes himself in his social media bio as a \"theocratic fascist,\" reposted Accurso's Pride-themed video to X, writing: \"This is a message to conservatives parents. She doesn't want your business. You should respond accordingly.\"\n\nSeveral popular commentators in right-wing circles, including  YouTuber Abby Shapiro (the sister of popular conservative pundit Ben Shapiro) and Morgonn McMichael (a Turning Point USA contributor), echoed Walsh's criticism. The inflammatory Libs of TikTok social media account also posted about the creator on X.\n\nWalsh, Shapiro and McMichael did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nAccurso appeared to have anticipated the backlash, as she noted the potential loss of anti-LGBTQ viewers in her Saturday video. She said that she is \"not chasing fame or views\" but rather \"standing strong in love.\"\n\nThis vocal social media criticism led her to make a response video on Monday morning, in which she told viewers her faith is \"really important\" to her and is part of why she chooses to \"love every neighbor,\" citing one of the most alluded to Christian principles in the Bible.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Accurso said that she has received some emails from those who said they \"couldn't watch anymore due to [her] support of the LGBTQ+ community.\" But she said she \"responded to that with love which was genuine.\"\n\n\"We have met so many wonderful families who watch the show, all with different beliefs, religions and political views,\" Accurso wrote in an email on Monday. \"We treat everyone with empathy and respect. I think it's important to find common ground, and we all want what's best for our little ones. I believe there should be less division and more dialogue.\"\n\nSome online showed gratitude for Accurso's open acceptance of the LGBTQ community and defended her from the right-wing criticism.\n\nThis is not the first time the creator has been at the target of conservatives' ire. Last year, some parents expressed anger and frustration around her featuring a nonbinary co-star in her videos. The outcry grew so intense that Accurso announced she was taking a break from TikTok, writing, \"Hurtful videos and comments, no matter how much attention they get, will not bring you want you want. Only love can do that.\"\n\nBut Accurso has not shied away from being vocal on topics that may generate political controversy. Earlier this month, she said she experienced bullying after launching a fundraiser for children living in conflict zones, including the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"That is who I am,\" she said in an emotional video at the time. \"I love my neighbor. I love every child.\"\n\nI'm a reporter covering internet and tech culture.

The typical approach for any administration is to hold its fire and file appeals challenging these rulings. But many influential voices on the right are instead advocating for an approach that threatens to cause a genuine constitutional crisis - brazenly defying federal courts instead of complying with their rulings.\n\nVice President JD Vance has repeatedly said over the years that he thinks presidents should ignore court rulings they consider \"illegitimate.\" He echoed this sentiment in a post about the recent judicial standoff, writing, \"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.\"\n\nMany influential voices on the right are instead advocating for an approach that threatens to cause a genuine constitutional crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Trump should \"take a page out of Andrew Jackson's playbook,\" referring to the infamous historical example in which President Jackson defied a Supreme Court ruling to move forward with the brutal forced relocation of Native Americans via the \"Trail of Tears.\" (You wouldn't think that a sitting member of Congress would cite such a heinous historical example positively ... but apparently you would be wrong.)\n\nSome in the MAGA punditry sphere are also advocating for this drastic tactic.\n\n\"If a district court judge tries to usurp the authority of the chief executive of this country, he should absolutely defy it,\" political commentator Scott Jennings said . \"Ignore this disgusting freak,\" Daily Wire host Matt Walsh similarly said of another federal judge who ruled against the Trump administration. \"Judges are completely out of control in this country.\"\n\nThis view is so extreme that even some die-hard MAGA warriors, like Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., aren't on board. Reporter Bryan Metzger asked him about suggestions Trump should ignore the courts, and Hawley said, \"You can't do that.\"\n\n\"Andrew Jackson did that, infamously,\" the senator continued. \"He was wrong on that. That was the Trail of Tears. That was lawless. That was wrong.\"\n\nKudos to Hawley, who previously practiced constitutional law, for retaining some shred of integrity and common sense. (Other MAGA loyalists ought to consider how far beyond the pale this idea is when it has lost even Josh Hawley.)\n\nIt's hard to understate how destructive this approach, if taken, would be for our constitutional order and system of checks and balances. Simply put, if presidents start routinely ignoring rulings against them they disagree with, the courts quickly lose their power, and an important check on the president that prevents overreach is effectively neutered.\n\n\"If the president is able to defy or ignore court orders against him, then the executive branch would be effectively free of legal constraints on its actions - including those of the Constitution,\" law professor Ilya Somin explains . \"It could violate constitutional rights, usurp the authority of Congress, and more. In that scenario, we would no longer have a constitutionally constrained federal government, except perhaps in name only.\"\n\nNewsflash, conservatives: If Trump can just ignore rulings that go against him, so can the next Democratic president.\n\nIt really doesn't matter whether one supports the Trump administration's underlying efforts or not - no short-term policy goal is worth destroying our system of checks and balances. The absurd impatience of this drastic approach is even more glaring when you consider that the Supreme Court is currently controlled by a 6-3 conservative majority, meaning the Trump administration ultimately faces favorable odds if it appeals rulings limiting its efforts.\n\nAnd newsflash, conservatives: If Trump can just ignore rulings that go against him, so can the next Democratic president.\n\nAfter all, President Joe Biden's efforts were repeatedly stymied by the judicial branch, on everything from student loan cancellation to Covid vaccination mandates to the nationwide \"eviction moratorium.\" But under the approach many Republicans are advocating for today, Biden could've simply declared these rulings \"illegitimate\" and enforced his agenda anyway. Is that really something conservatives want to enable?\n\nSome MAGA pundits, like Jennings, argue that Biden set a precedent and \"defied\" the Supreme Court when it blocked his student loan cancellation efforts. This is not accurate, as Somin explains . Biden did try to work around the court's ruling and use different legal methods that hadn't been struck down to cancel student debt, but he abided by its ruling, and his original $400 billion debt-relief effort never went forward.\n\nTo be fair to the MAGA right, some in the Democratic Party have also participated in the ongoing erosion of our checks and balances. When a Trump-appointed judge issued a controversial ruling about abortion medication in April 2023, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., openly said the Biden administration should \"ignore it.\" Other Democratic leaders, like Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, said the same . But thankfully, Biden ignored their reckless calls, which conservatives had no trouble recognizing as dangerous and destructive at the time.\n\nKeeping that same energy now that Republicans are in power is a simple test of basic integrity and intellectual consistency. Sadly, it's one that many on the right are utterly and woefully failing.\n\nBrad Polumbo is an independent journalist and host of the \" Brad vs Everyone\" podcast .\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Their real goal is much worse.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nTarget announced earlier this week that the company was removing some LGBTQ-themed items from shelves and moving displays intended to honor Pride Month to the back of the store in response to a public backlash from the right . But what happened at Target goes far beyond just some people calling for a boycott.\n\nAs Target explained in a statement, some customers had knocked down Pride displays at stores while others outraged by Pride-themed merchandise angrily approached workers as well as posted threatening videos on social media. Target has been celebrating Pride Month for more than a decade, but as the company noted, \"since introducing this year's collection, we've experienced threats impacting our team members' sense of safety and wellbeing while at work.\"\n\nFor those who doubly identify as LGBTQ and Muslim, this new method of attack is a sore reminder of the harm this relentless conservative effort to marginalize them is capable of.\n\nThese physical threats of violence are deeply alarming - but not that surprising. They are the expected, and even intended, result of the concerted campaign by both Republican-elected officials and leading conservative voices to make all things LGBTQ-related \"toxic.\" They also strike a nerve for other communities, such as my own Muslim American community, whose members have experienced the wrath and concerted attacks from conservatives with similar objectives - to alienate, make toxic and further marginalize from mainstream society - in the past. And for those who doubly identify as LGBTQ and Muslim, this new method of attack is a sore reminder of the harm this relentless conservative effort to marginalize them is capable of.\n\n\"The goal is to make 'pride' toxic for brands,\" right-wing commentator Matt Walsh wrote on Twitter. That sentiment was reiterated by conservative outlet Daily Wire commentator Michael Knowles, who urged his listeners \"to make that symbol toxic, the pride flag symbol, we need to make that toxic.\"\n\n2024 GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy slammed Target while on Fox News for choosing to \"spit in\" the face of conservatives, declaring that \"Target just put a target on its back from its base of consumers.\"\n\nConservative radio host Charlie Kirk declared on his show the same day Target announced that some employees had been threatened: \"The only thing they understand is force\" - \"they\" presumably meaning proponents of LGBTQ representation. Kirk urged his audience to inflict financial \"pain\" on Target by pushing to bankrupt the conglomerate, saying, \"Pain is a teacher and the pain of crossing the line to perverting our children and grooming them, it's going to be a lesson I hope corporate America watches because ordinary America is pushing back.\"\n\nRepublican state legislators in 2023 introduced a record number of bills designed to otherize the LGBTQ community, according to the American Civil Liberties Union . The legislation proposed and enacted ranges from bans on gender-affirming care for transgender teenagers to banning books that address LGBTQ issues to rolling back \"nondiscrimination laws by allowing employers, businesses, and even hospitals to turn away LGBTQ people or refuse them equal treatment.\"\n\nThe real-world impact is not just stores like Target being bullied but also self-censorship out of fear that some will violate these laws. Since Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed his original so-called Don't Say Gay law in 2022, some Florida teachers, out of fear of losing their teaching licenses, have erred on the side of removing entire shelves of books that even sightly touch on LGBTQ topics. Some decided not to form LGBTQ clubs in schools given the law.\n\nThis is the climate the GOP and their media allies have nurtured.  And they won't stop as long as they believe weaponizing the LGBTQ community helps them politically - even if it leads to a spike in hate crimes against the LGBTQ community. I can say that with great certainty because I saw the GOP do this to my own community of  Muslim Americans .\n\nRepublican state legislators in 2023 introduced a record number of bills designed to otherize the LGBTQ community, according to the ACLU.\n\nThe extreme voices on the right did their best to make anything Muslim inherently toxic. For example, GOP members of Congress in 2009 claimed that Muslim American organizations were planting \"spies\" as interns in congressional offices. Other members of Congress including then-Rep. Michele Bachmann spread Islamophobic rumors that Muslims were \"infiltrating\" the government. The goal was to keep us out of American politics.\n\nSome on the right even demanded in 2007 that Urban Outfitters stop selling fabrics bearing the pattern of the Arabic scarf known as a kaffiyeh because they claimed it was tied to terrorism . Like Target, Urban Outfitters gave in to the bigots, pulling the item \"due to the sensitive nature\" of the scarf while apologizing \"if we offended anyone.\"\n\nIt wasn't long until GOP officials and activists began to peddle the lie that Muslim Americans wanted to impose Islamic law (Shariah law). In response, Republicans in state legislatures introduced a swath of anti-Shariah legislation. (Muslim Americans never wanted to impose our religious beliefs as law, as opposed to the GOP, which is literally doing that today with its abortion bans.)\n\nBy the 2016 presidential campaign, the groundwork was set for Donald Trump to take anti-Muslim bigotry to new dangerous lows, from his lies that Muslims in New Jersey cheered on 9/11 to calling for a ban on Muslims entering the country. The very alarming result was that hate crimes against Muslims in 2016 reached a higher level than in the year after 9/11 - from attacks on our places of worship to physical assaults against our community to an increase in anti-Muslim bullying in school.\n\nThat was the climate the GOP helped foster then for Muslims - and I'm seeing plenty of parallels today in response to the LGBTQ community. That is why it's not surprising that in March, armed white supremacists and members of several extremist groups, including some offering Nazi salutes, targeted a drag queen storytelling event in Ohio. In California, members of the Trump-centric Proud Boys disrupted a similar event by screaming anti-LGBTQ slurs. The physical confrontation at Target of employees or knocking down of Pride Month displays is another warning sign.\n\nConservatives' goal of making Pride merchandise \"toxic\" is not just bigoted, and it's not just about merchandise. Ultimately, conservatives and GOP leaders saw that anti-Muslim hate was a losing strategy. We need to show them that anti-LGBTQ bigotry will not help them. Only then will they stop.\n\nCORRECTION (May 29, 2023, 6:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the first name of a former member of Congress.

That's bad for media - and its audience.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the mob storming the Capitol on Jan. 6 , there was hope that the tide of violent rhetoric had peaked. Nearly two years later, this is clearly not the case. Authoritarian attacks on democracy and explicit threats to violence are again on the rise , even more than a year out from the 2024 election. And right-wing media remain the dependable engine for the whole hate machine.\n\nSome mainstream outlets have recently reported on calls to violence from Donald Trump, again the likely Republican presidential nominee. The former president has called for shoplifters to be shot on sight, advocated for the execution of former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley , told his supporters to \"go after\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, and threatened that if Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg takes legal action against him , the result will be \"potential death and destruction.\"\n\nTrump is aping what is said in conservative media.\n\nThe coverage of these threats, while necessary, has often omitted that, as he did in office, Trump is aping what is said in conservative media. As my colleague John Knefel wrote in May, right-wing pundits are increasingly open about who they believe should be killed. Most recently, Fox News' Greg Gutfeld said \"elections don't work\" and instead endorsed civil war. \"You need to make war to bring peace,\" he told his \"The Five\" co-hosts, \"because you have a side that cannot change.\"\n\nThese comments are typical for Gutfeld - who also hosts the late-night show \"Gutfeld!\" - and belie the mainstream media profiles of him as an affable iconoclast bringing comedy to a channel where you wouldn't expect it. In June, The New York Times described him as engaging in \"merry trolling,\" a \"striking inversion\" of traditional late night comedy that is a \"hard-won victory for the right.\" Gutfeld's attempts at comedy are a thin cover for the usual toxic rhetoric. Like the former president , Gutfeld has called for targeting protesters, callin g on Fox News viewers to post \"exact names and addresses online\" to \"make their lives extra difficult.\" Before the 2020 election, Gutfeld dismissed violence from right-wing militias as \"a lie\" and \"easily disprovable.\" At the same time, he blames social unrest on fictitious reverse racism, recently claiming that white people will \"always be the target.\"\n\nGutfeld is not the only one on the network promoting violence. A July panel on \"The Five\" fantasized about a similar scenario to Trump's concept of shoplifters being shot. Jesse Watters, recently promoted to Fox News' coveted 8 p.m. slot, recently s uggested climate protesters should be \"run ... over\" and has called for \"martial law\" in San Francisco. On his radio show, Fox host Mark Levin said Trump's election-interference indictment is like \"the Dred Scott decision,\" which \"served as the foundation for the Civil War.\"\n\nFox News' competitors both on cable and the web are following suit. Commentators on rival network Newsmax are grasping for relevance by matching this rhetoric . Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk suggests Democrats are provoking the right into \"violence,\" PragerU co-founder Dennis Prager warns that the U.S. is \"already in a civil war\" and Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro suggested secession more than two years ago . Shapiro's Daily Wire colleague Michael Knowles has advocated for bringing back public executions , while fellow Daily Wire host Matt Walsh claimed the Founders would \"violently overthrow\" our current government.\n\nToday's right-wing media audience will not tune in without the promise of shock value. They've become numb to the same old racist fearmongering and political scapegoating of recent years, just as they tired of warmongering and poor-shaming during the Bush and Obama eras. Every time, there's a demand for outlets and hosts to raise the stakes, lest they lose out to other demagogues.\n\nThe screaming demand for increasingly violent commentary is a direct threat to the peaceful function of American democracy.\n\nWe know from the Dominion case that Fox News executives do know better than to play into these impulses - but also that they will say or do pretty much anything to avoid losing their audience. Including, as it turns out, attacking democracy itself.\n\nHere we are again listening to the biggest cable news platform, the entire digital right-wing media, and a former president advocate for extrajudicial murders and violent retaliation for the exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech.\n\nThe screaming demand for increasingly violent commentary is a direct threat to the peaceful function of American democracy. Jan. 6 warned us of the consequences of this rhetoric. If even that horrific day was not enough to quench the thirst for violence, we should all remain vigilant to the ongoing authoritarian threat.\n\nMadeline Peltz is the Deputy Director of Rapid Response at Media Matters for America.

      "text": "RFK Jr. has a distinct appeal when it comes to young male voters\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nLast summer, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted a workout video to his account on X (formerly Twitter). Shirtless, bench-pressing and pounding out pushups at Los Angeles' famed Gold's Gym, the aspiring presidential candidate was the model of virility, his rippling pecs and abs visible over faded Levi's. Although hardly a young man at age 69, RFK Jr.'s image strikingly contrasted with the octogenarian front-runners in a plodding race that often elicits an understandably uninspired reaction from many young people .\n\nKennedy's video ultimately racked up over a million views, left a Fox anchorman swooning at its \" sheer masculinity ,\" and helped launch a long-shot Democratic primary challenge that has since morphed into a third-party bid for the presidency. Once best known for his famous family and crusading environmentalism, Kennedy has more recently become infamous for his overheated anti-vaccine rhetoric and doting celebrity wife.\n\nKennedy's popularity is concentrated in the podcasts and blogs that make up the \"manosphere\" at the same time growing evidence indicates young men are gravitating rightward.\n\nBut six months later, younger voters in particular are giving this candidate a very serious look: In December, a Quinnipiac poll found Kennedy getting 40% of the 18-34 vote, compared to 11% of the 65-plus vote. He leads both Trump and Biden among registered voters under 45 by 1%. His lead is consistent across race and gender, but his appeal to young men especially bears careful scrutiny; Kennedy's popularity is concentrated in the podcasts and blogs that make up the \"manosphere\" - a medium he has committed to dominate - at the same time growing evidence indicates young men are gravitating rightward politically and feeling disaffected socially.\n\nThis does not mean we have lost this generation forever. At least not yet. But probing the origins of this generational unease and Kennedy's appeal as its antidote might just hold the key to redirecting us toward a future where these young men choose civic participation over conspiracism, and find inspiration in collective action rather than atomized self-improvement.\n\nYounger millennials and members of Generation Z of all genders have been raised amid ongoing war, increasing inequality, and impending climate catastrophe. The forced social isolation of Covid-19 hit just when they would have been independently exploring the world. This is to say, they should be given some grace for viewing politicians skeptically. Young males seem to be faring especially badly amid this tumult, as many have noted. \"Men are lost; here's a map out of the wilderness,\" cried Christine Emba in The Washington Post last summer. \"Andrew Tate is the symptom, not the cause,\" wrote Heather Stewart for The Guardian . Even the Financial Times warned of the \"far reaching consequences\" of a \"great gender divergence\" transpiring among American youth. This young male disaffection is not just coincidental with Kennedy's rise; the two are inextricably intertwined.\n\n\"Americans are angry at being left out, left behind, swindled, cheated and belittled by a smug elite that has rigged the system in its favor,\" Kennedy declared when he announced his run as a third-party candidate last fall. This resentment is a common talking point for him on podcasts hosted by the likes of Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson, personalities who have amassed millions of mostly male followers by channeling and amplifying such sentiments that have swirled with particular intensity since 2020. Kennedy's message is perfectly pitched for these messengers: Covid lockdowns are tantamount to Nazi totalitarianism ; vaccines are a ploy by profiteering Big Pharma execs who callously afflict children with autism; \" taking people's guns away \" with policy is futile, dangerous government overreach; \" wokeness \" has corrupted both capitalism and campus discourse. A chorus of endorsements from billionaire tech bros and celebrity athletes who unironically celebrate Kennedy's championing of \"the common man\" and steely resolve only solidifies this sense of specifically male outrage.\n\nBut we believe there is still hope. After all, his young fans have not embraced Trump's brazen moral bankruptcy, or opted out of the electoral project entirely. Rather, it could be a signal that young voters are looking for something different to latch onto. Kennedy's campaign embodies a potential way station on the quest for purpose for anxious young men who might begin with enthusiastically following wellness bros and otherwise end in a full-on embrace of extremist groups such as the Proud Boys.\n\nKennedy's core brand is crusading idealism - it was his campaign to rid the Hudson River of pollutants that was the foundation of his career. Men's Journal dubbed him a \"hero\" for suing corporate giants for poisoning wildlife and local inhabitants. The real harm caused by his anti-vaccine activism has rightly eclipsed these earlier plaudits, but even his detractors acknowledge that his latest antipollution efforts against microplastics are uniquely on point . Kennedy's focus on fitness is not only about his SoCal context or carrying on his uncle John F. Kennedy's famed presidential physical education policies, but is of a piece with this commitment to a sort of \"natural\" health; exercise is a concrete, preventive measure any responsible person can take to protect against illness and its frequent attendant descent into pharmacological dependency.\n\nThis appetite for self-efficacy and purpose animates Kennedy's broader attractiveness as the embodiment of a sort of American dream that young men feel is increasingly elusive, and thus even more enticing. Kennedy has prestigious degrees, a meaningful career, a mansion in Beverly Hills and a mountain house, a bunch of dogs and a blended family including a glamorous, accomplished wife who stands behind him and his most quixotic ambitions . Of course, his membership in one of the nation's most influential political clans has been integral to these achievements, but the fact remains: Despite a past heroin addiction and notorious womanizing, he was still able to do it all. His run is emblematic of masculine success, including - especially - second chances.\n\nEconomic and cultural circumstances have converged to make this kind of life feel impossible. Men have declining prospects in education , in the workplace and in marriage . Combined with student loan burdens and rising interest rates, these factors place homeownership and the broader breadwinner ideal, once a hallmark of male achievement, effectively out of reach.\n\n\"The central fulcrum of the American dream was that if you worked hard and you played by the rules, you could finance a home, you could raise a family, you could take a summer vacation, and you could put something aside for your retirement on one job,\" Kennedy said to a Nebraska crowd late last year. \"There is nobody in (the younger) generation who believes that that promise applies to them.\" Progressive and Democratic labor, housing and health care policies are focused on remedying precisely these inequalities, but a vocal strand of the left's cultural messaging - decrying \"toxic masculinity,\" dismissing any talk of \"a crisis of masculinity\" as overwrought, or even declaring \" men are trash \" - only serves to scold young men for these aspirations, and to make the liberal left seem impervious to their ambitions and anxieties.\n\nA virtuous inclination toward protection and self-sufficiency powers Kennedy's appeal, but in equal measure so does a paranoia that invites fascism in the name of fighting authoritarianism.\n\nWhile GOP policies have arguably only intensified this alienation, the far right has seized the role as the savior of \"real men\" from the clutches of feminists and nanny-state liberals. Trump's 2016 win was powered by men's right's advocates like Mike Cernovich , who were at the front lines of misogynistic attacks on Hillary Clinton, but began their careers blogging about self-improvement for men, interspersed with rapey dating advice . Frenzied fears about #MeToo overreach drove Tucker Carlson into such a panic about emasculation that by 2022, he was hawking testicle tanning and proclaiming \"The End of Men.\" Libs aren't just man-haters, right-wing troll Matt Walsh announced in his viral documentary \"What Is a Woman?\" They want to attack the very idea that men, or women, are even real . Years of this drumbeat have had an effect: 68% of Republicans and 27% of independents believe the Democratic Party is hostile to \"masculine values.\"\n\nKennedy sees this yearning and he puts cause to the void, affirming a male sense of betrayal while avoiding the overtly hateful rage common in much of the manosphere. His campaign against private equity companies for limiting the stock of single-family homes since the 2009 housing crisis is one such example. \"So they can outbid you, and they can outbid your children. Our families are now competing against these companies, which are trying to buy every single-family home,\" Kennedy said last fall, typically muddling crucial details to fit his particular morality tale. The Washington Post called it a \"conspiracy theory,\" but for millions of men who equate home ownership with the core identity of breadwinner , they had a villain to blame for their failure, and validation for their frustrated aspirations.\n\nKennedy's brand of masculinity sits at the nexus of virtue and delusion. His salutary focus on exercise and self-improvement can slide seamlessly into the anti-science denialism of anti-vaxxers, and from there it's a short trip into other, equally noxious sensibilities. Since hitting the campaign trail, he has downplayed these more virulent ideas, but they remain integral to his worldview, and visible despite a more respectable veneer : Solidarity with steelworkers quickly skips into conspiracism about globalists planning for the Great Reset . Concern about profit margins for pharmaceutical companies during a pandemic morphs into vilifying health care workers and sowing distrust of the government. Worry about foreign intervention in American politics becomes racist fantasy about a Jewish and Chinese plot to spread the coronavirus.\n\nA virtuous inclination toward protection and self-sufficiency powers Kennedy's appeal, but in equal measure so does a paranoia that invites fascism in the name of fighting authoritarianism. Our charge is to meet young men at this nexus and convince them to stay on the side of rationality, purpose and collective progress. They're constantly being lured to burn everything down - or reinstate an old order, as some would like. In order to secure the future of pluralistic democracy, we must provide a counternarrative that acknowledges the frustrations and harnesses the aspirations of young men in a pro-social way. If our attempts to defeat this spoiler end up allowing the icons of the manosphere to chart their path, we will likely watch these young people slide from a fascination with fitness to become followers of fanatics.\n\nThe words of first gentleman Doug Emhoff, with which 73% of both Democrats and Republicans agree, are an inspired starting point: \"We've kind of confused what it means to be a man. ... You've got this trope out there that you've got to be tough and angry and lash out to be strong. It's just the opposite. ... Strength is how you show your love for people. ... And how you stick up for other people and [push back] against bullies.\" Failing to take seriously what Kennedy represents could give us another four years with the biggest bully our nation has ever known - and that is only the most immediate consequence of such ignorance.\n\nNatalia Mehlman Petrzela is Professor of History at The New School in New York City.

      "text": "The business sense behind Carrie Underwood's MAGA makeover\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe news that Carrie Underwood had agreed to perform \"America the Beautiful\" at Donald Trump's presidential inauguration was a shock to some of the country music star's fans - her LGBTQ+ fans in particular, who'd previously seen the superstar as a rare ally in the notoriously conservative genre. \"I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future,\" Underwood said in a statement.\n\nTrue, country music has never exactly been a haven for queer fans, but Underwood's rare allyship in the genre made her decision to support Trump, whose own allies and administration have been historically anti-LGBTQ+, a disappointing move. How can Underwood ask her queer fans to unite with people who have literally called for their eradication ?\n\nDespite her recent struggles in country radio, Underwood is easily the most high-profile artist ever booked to perform at a Trump political event.\n\nThe future offers little hope for queer people in America facing a barrage of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation from the right and increasingly unregulated hate speech online as tech companies like Meta eliminate fact-checking and content moderation .\n\nUnderstanding the country star's not-so-sudden pivot from LGBTQ+ advocate to MAGA supporter makes more sense if you consider Carrie Underwood not as an individual, but as a business. If you take a look both at her public LGBTQ+ advocacy and her embrace of Trump, you'll see both are driven by the practical necessity of commercial success in country music.\n\nFollow MSNBC's live blog for the latest updates and expert analysis on Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nUnderwood launched her career in 2005, just two years after the Chicks were ousted from country music in 2003, and likely felt the pressure to keep any political views to herself lest she experience the same fate. So, the LGBTQ+ community stood up and took notice when she made the case for gay marriage in a 2012 interview with The Independent , saying, \"As a married person myself, I don't know what it's like to be told I can't marry somebody I love, and want to marry. I can't imagine how that must feel. I definitely think we should all have the right to love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love.\"\n\nShe received some backlash from her fellow evangelical Christians over the comments, but Underwood had popular opinion on her side at the time. Public support for gay marriage in the U.S. was on the rise in 2012 before the Supreme Court legalized it in 2015. Even in country music, a song affirming LGBTQ+ fans - Kacey Musgraves' \"Follow Your Arrow\" - won song of the year at the 2014 CMA Awards, despite country radio completely ignoring it. It peaked at No. 43 on the country airplay chart, and Musgraves became the rare woman in country music to build an audience with no support from country radio.\n\nIn 2018, Underwood moved from her longtime label Sony Music Nashville to Musgraves' label, Universal Music Group. That year, she seemed to double down on her LGBTQ+ allyship, releasing the single \"Love Wins.\" While the song doesn't explicitly call for LGBTQ+ acceptance, and Underwood never made that connection in interviews, the lyrics make a general plea for love and acceptance in the face of \"politics and prejudice,\" while using the slogan of the marriage equality movement as the title.\n\nUnderwood's LGBTQ+ fans adopted \"Love Wins\" as an affirming anthem, but country radio was not on board. After 27 consecutive top-10 singles, \"Love Wins\" broke Underwood's streak and stalled out at No. 11.\n\nUnderwood later denied her music included any political messages at all, telling The Guardian in 2019, \"I feel like more people try to pin me places politically. I try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins.\"\n\nFast-forward to 2021, and any post-Chicks pretense of avoiding political discourse in country music was long gone. The Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol served as a coming-out party for country star Jason Aldean, whose wife, Brittany, emerged as a right-wing influencer, posting her support for the insurrectionists in real time as they stormed the Capitol.\n\nA few months later, Underwood released a duet with Aldean, \"If I Didn't Love You,\" securing Underwood's first No. 1 on the country airplay chart in five years. Apparently, the radio success and industry awards Underwood took home for the song offset any concern she may have had about taking on the Aldeans' political baggage.\n\nIn May 2021, Underwood's husband, former professional hockey player Mike Fisher, appeared as a guest on former Daily Wire correspondent Candace Owens' talk show . That August, Underwood liked a video opposing school mask mandates from Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh, who moved to Nashville where the outlet has been headquartered since 2020. As the debate over Covid subsided, far-right influencers like Walsh discovered a new source for outrage against the medical community - physicians providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. Underwood stayed silent on that matter, but the Aldeans leaned in hard, selling clothing printed with anti-LGBTQ+ messaging as they accepted invitations to spend New Year's Eve 2022 and 2023 with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMusically, Aldean translated all that MAGA grievance into the biggest hit of his career with 2023's \" Try That in a Small Town ,\" which paints a cartoonish picture of the urban-rural divide, with the video depicting civil unrest stemming from the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020.\n\nAfter Country Music Television pulled the video from rotation, the ensuing controversy further cemented Aldean's status as a marginalized warrior among the MAGA faithful, and the song became his first to top the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 chart. His success was a clear indication of where the industry was headed.\n\nIn the wake of that success, Aldean points to newer country artists Parker McCollum and Cody Johnson as MAGA supporters who are \"like-minded people now that aren't scared to go out and talk about it.\"\n\nDespite her recent struggles in country radio, Underwood is easily the most high-profile artist ever booked to perform at a Trump political event.\n\nMcCollum and Aldean are both slated to perform at inaugural balls for Trump, and Johnson has also been speaking out on division and politics at his concerts. In one clip, Johnson shares a more fleshed-out view of what unity under Trump will look like, and it pointedly includes no more room for discussion on gender. Yet Republicans have introduced more than 100 anti-trans bills in state legislatures already this year. The House just passed legislation that would ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports at schools and institutions receiving federal funds. If the issue is settled for Johnson, he must be pleased to see these bills progress.\n\nUnderwood's current single on country radio is a duet with Johnson, titled \"I'm Gonna Love You.\" It's poised to enter the top 10 on the airplay chart very soon, offering Underwood another much-needed boost from a conservative male artist after her last two solo singles stalled at No. 20 and No. 18.\n\nDespite her recent struggles in country radio, Underwood is easily the most high-profile artist ever booked to perform at a Trump political event. That's a big win for the right. As an eight-time Grammy winner, Underwood has a seal of approval from the creative community. As the face of NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" for a 12th season this year, she is a spokesperson for the NFL; the concert film of her long-running Las Vegas residency, \"Reflection,\" premieres on Hulu on Jan. 24; and now she is returning as a judge on the show that launched her career, \"American Idol,\" in March.\n\nUnlike in 2016, there is little risk of Underwood losing her key partnerships as a result of her ties to Trump.\n\nAs for Underwood, even if she still believes in marriage equality, it may not be apparent to her that the right's unrelenting campaign against transgender people directly correlates with its effort to turn back public opinion against gay marriage.\n\nOverturning gay marriage is clearly part of the plan, as evidenced by Justice Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion in the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in which he said the Supreme Court should \"reconsider\" marriage equality. Just recently, Republicans in Idaho have filed a resolution asking the Supreme Court to overturn its decision to legalize gay marriage so the state can reinstate its ban on same-sex unions.\n\nWith all she stands to gain by aligning herself with the MAGA movement, connecting these dots is not likely to make Underwood change course. Whether that association leads to continued commercial success for Underwood, like it has for Aldean, remains to be seen. Despite her long track record of No. 1 hits and millions of albums sold, Carrie Underwood is still a woman in country music fighting for one of those precious few \"female slots\" on the radio.\n\nHunter Kelly is a journalist and broadcaster focused on music and LGBTQ+ issues.

      "text": "Matt Walsh: The First Time I Was Hustled (by Evel Knievel)\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThe First Time\n\nBy Matt Walsh\n\nAs a boy in the '70s, I worshiped Evel Knievel . His motorcycle jumps, whether successes or bone-crushing failures, were legendary. He traveled the world attempting to leap over cars, buses, canyons and even sharks in his signature leather jumpsuit and cape. I consumed all of his trading cards, posters and toys , and my friends and I would spend our summer days in Chicago building ramps in the street and trying to leap things on our Schwinn bicycles. One friend, Johnny P., seemed to break a bone every year trying to emulate our hero. I outgrew Knievel mania as an adult, but it still lurked deep down, waiting to be reignited.\n\nThe most meaningful celebrity encounter of my life happened in the early '90s. My brother Pat took me on a golf weekend in Clearwater, Fla., where he was visiting his part-time bookie buddy, Ray. And when we got to the golf club, who happened to be playing Ray for big money ? None other than Robert Craig Knievel himself. When we met them near the pro shop, Knievel was older, slower and grayer than I imagined, but he still had that swagger. Ray introduced us, and I was so star struck that I was completely frozen.\n\nAs we all sat for a beer at the clubhouse, my brother suddenly offered to play Evel for money the next day. Phone numbers were exchanged, and Evel left us with a vague \"Maybe I will see you tomorrow.\"\n\nAt this point, I could finally speak: \"Did we just have a beer with Evel Knievel?\"\n\nThe next morning the phone rang early in our condo, and I answered it groggily. A strange voice on the line said, \"Are we playing?\" Confused by who would be ringing so early, I asked, \"Who's calling?\" The response was perfect: \"Come on man! It's me, Evel.\"\n\nWe met him at the course and began an 18-hole match, me and my brother versus Evel. I couldn't focus and played poorly. I was mentally transcribing every word Evel said, knowing this was a story my future grandchildren would tell their offspring.\n\nI also marveled at his surprising athleticism. Here he was, with a body that had basically been shattered many times, finessing golf shots in between zapping himself with a magnetic arthritis reliever. I could mutter only \"Yes, sir\" and small factoids about my fledgling acting career while Evel built a small lead over Team Walsh. My brother chided me to wake up and make a game of it, and I started playing better on the back nine, rescuing shots when it mattered.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Videotaper's Inside View of the Patriots' Spying\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Greg Bishop\n\nWASHINGTON  Until the New England Patriots were caught cheating during a game against the Jets last September, Matt Walsh was a largely unknown former staff member who had done his work behind the video camera. Now he finds himself in front of it, the only person who was involved with the Patriots' illicit videotaping operation who has spoken publicly about how the team skirted league rules for years.\n\nWalsh's view differs from that of the Patriots, the N.F.L. and anyone else who contends that the videotaping of opponents' signals had little effect on the Patriots' performance. His vantage point was from behind the lens, inside the Patriots' organization and further inside the small, secret circle of coaches and staff members who, Walsh said, knowingly broke N.F.L. rules to gain advantages in future games.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Walsh disputed several statements given by Coach Bill Belichick, who has insisted that he misinterpreted the league's rules and described the impact of the tapes as minimal, telling The Boston Globe in February that the value of the tactics rated as a 1 on a scale of 1 to 100.\n\n\"We live in a country that's very forgiving, if you come out and admit the mistake that you've made,\" Walsh said. \"In saying that, 'I misinterpreted the rules,' he didn't come across to me as being culpable for the actions he had taken. It seemed a little arrogant.\"\n\nStacey James, the Patriots' vice president for media relations, said in a statement: \"We question the truthfulness of many of Matt Walsh's stories, and others should do the same.\n\n\"Matt Walsh was a video operator. For him to attempt to speak with any authority on the process of coaching, play-calling, or the decisions made by offensive or defensive coordinators is an embarrassment.\"\n\nWhen the Patriots were caught filming the Jets' defensive signals in the season opener in September, Walsh watched intently from Hawaii, where he works as a golf professional far removed from his seven seasons with the Patriots. He said he was surprised the N.F.L. never called him during its initial investigation.\n\nHe laughed at the television commentators trying to explain how the filming operation worked or what benefit it might have. Walsh knew the truth.\n\nHe was there in the beginning.\n\nWalsh never operated a Beta video camera until he went to work for the Patriots' video department in 1999. \"Don't worry,\" Walsh said his bosses told him. \"We'll teach you everything you need to know.\"\n\nThe real education came a year later, when Belichick became the coach and installed the new wrinkle  videotaping opponents' signals.\n\nWalsh spent three seasons, from 1999 until after the 2002 Super Bowl, behind the camera.\n\nHe said he was surprised when Belichick told The Globe that he could not pick Walsh out of a lineup. Walsh remembers specific conversations the two had, including a running joke about the book \"Friday Night Lights.\" Belichick has long been noted for his memory, and upon seeing Walsh reading the book a second time, he joked about Walsh's not having finished it.\n\nWalsh still has a sweater  charcoal, V-neck, sleeves intact despite Belichick's propensity for cutting them off his own sweatshirts  given to him at Christmas in 2001 from Belichick and his wife, Debby. When people have asked Walsh about Belichick saying he did not know him, Walsh says, \"Well, could he pick me out of one of the three team pictures we were in together?\"\n\nBelichick and Walsh never discussed the taping of opponents' signals. That fell to Ernie Adams, Belichick's right-hand man and mysterious assistant.\n\nFormer Patriots have said they rarely met Adams, let alone talked to him, but Walsh had regular contact after he started in the video department. He said Adams worked on special projects. They sometimes discussed how to tape opponents' signals. Mostly, they simply went about the process without much discussion.\n\n\"I had always been a big Patriots fan,\" Walsh said. \"I wasn't going to question what they wanted me to do.\"\n\nThe taping felt wrong, Walsh said, and that notion was reinforced when his supervisor, Jimmy Dee, told Walsh to keep his videotaping quiet. Walsh said Dee gave him alibis to use if suspicions arose with other teams.\n\nIf someone questioned why Walsh was filming an opposing sideline, he was told to say he was shooting the chains and the down-and-distance marker. If a team asked why the Patriots needed a third videographer, Walsh was instructed to say the coaches wanted two end-zone shots or tight footage.\n\nThe Patriots kept the circle of people who knew small. The only ones who knew, Walsh said, were Dee and another video department employee, Fernando Neto, Belichick, Adams, the offensive coordinator Charlie Weis and the quarterbacks.\n\nAt first, Walsh said the Patriots strictly filmed opponents they would play later in the same season. Eventually, they broadened the practice to taping mostly teams in the American Football Conference that they thought were headed for the playoffs. As the third videographer on game day, Walsh said, he was told by coaches to \"go ahead and shoot the signals\" if there was nothing else to shoot.\n\n\"The information we were gathering was meant to help us the next time we played a team,\" Walsh said. \"If it was 1 out of 100, we probably wouldn't have felt the need to do it as often as we did. Or go to the lengths we did to ensure getting the film.\"\n\nAfter filming opponents' signals, Walsh would edit the tape or deliver the original to Adams. Walsh said a quarterback  he declined to say whom  would learn the signals, and the next time the Patriots played that team, the quarterback would relay that information to Weis, who would use the coach-to-quarterback communication system to send the information to the field.\n\nThe first time Walsh filmed an opponent's signals was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2000 preseason  Belichick's first as the Patriots' coach. Before the game, Walsh said Dee seemed \"unsure of himself of what specifically it was that the coaches wanted me to film.\"\n\nThe Patriots then opened the regular season against the Buccaneers. Walsh said this was the first time he had seen quarterback Drew Bledsoe operate a no-huddle offense when not in a two-minute or hurry-up situation.\n\nIn the week after the game, Walsh said he asked a quarterback  again, he declined to name whom  how helpful the signals were. Walsh said the quarterback told him \"probably about 75 percent of the time, Tampa Bay ran the defense we thought they were going to run  if not more.\"\n\n(Bledsoe was the Patriots' starting quarterback in 2000. The other quarterbacks on the roster were Tom Brady, Michael Bishop and John Friesz.)\n\nWalsh left the video department after the 2002 Super Bowl. While watching games from the stands in 2003, 2004 and 2005, he said, he saw the same videotaping practices. He said it was also his sense that the team had \"tightened the circle of people that knew and tried to keep the quarterbacks out of it.\"\n\nBefore he left, though, Walsh went with the rest of the Patriots' video crew to the Superdome in New Orleans the day before New England faced the St. Louis Rams in the 2002 Super Bowl. After taking a team photograph, the crew set up printers behind the Patriots' bench. Walsh wore tan slacks and a white collared shirt with a Patriots logo.\n\n\"The timing of everything seemed strange to me  that they would come onto the field right after us and even begin going through a walk-through when we had video cameras there,\" he said about the Rams.\n\nWalsh noticed Rams running back Marshall Faulk returning kicks and offensive formations. He later shared this insight with Brian Daboll, a Patriots assistant who is now with the Jets.\n\nDaboll declined to comment about the incident, but in a statement called the issue a league matter. The N.F.L., in a statement, said: \"Our security department reinterviewed Brian Daboll on Wednesday, and he has no recollection of a conversation with Matt Walsh about the Rams' walk-through practice. Even if such a conversation occurred, it would not be a violation of N.F.L. rules.\"\n\nMike Martz, the Rams' coach during the Super Bowl and now the offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers, said in a statement: \"Let me make this clear  we lost to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl because we turned the ball over three times.\n\n\"If there was anything obtained from our walk-through from a casual observer that happened to be present, then that was just part of those walk-throughs and that environment.\"\n\nAsked why he did not speak publicly about not having a video of the Rams' walk-through when reports of that emerged, Walsh said he was instructed by his lawyer not to.\n\nWalsh still refers to the Patriots as \"we\" and Belichick as \"Coach,\" and he keeps his Super Bowl ring from 2002 in a safe.\n\nAsked how he hoped to be remembered, Walsh said: \"As someone who did what he was told to do, got involved in a situation he was trying to do his best to not be a part of. And then, when it was time to come forward, spoke truthfully.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Years later, conservatives called for an investigation.\n\nBy Emily Cochrane\n\nVanderbilt University Medical Center's announcement of a new transgender clinic in 2018 did little to draw attention to its practice. The four-paragraph news release amounted to a location, hours and the names of two senior staff members.\n\nThe spotlight came four years later, when Matt Walsh, a conservative political commentator at The Daily Wire in Nashville, published a series of posts and videos about the clinic. Those posts said that a staff member there had privately characterized gender-affirming medication and surgery as \"moneymakers,\" and used caustic terms to describe the center's treatments.\n\nThe medical center, which is separate from Vanderbilt University, pushed back. In a statement at the time , the center said that the clinic's mission was to serve a \"high-risk population for mental and physical health issues\" who \"have been consistently underserved by the U.S. health system.\"\n\nThe medical center said that it had not provided care to children younger than 18 without the consent of a parent, and that it would not force any employee who disagreed with the care because of personal or religious beliefs to provide it.\n\nConservatives called for an investigation into the clinic, and Republican leaders spoke at a rally Mr. Walsh organized in Nashville in October 2022 in opposition to gender-affirming care for children. When Tennessee legislators convened in January 2023, lawmakers designated a proposed ban on gender-affirming care as Senate Bill 1. The bill passed over objections from transgender people and most Democrats.\n\nEmily Cochrane is a national reporter for The Times covering the American South, based in Nashville.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Men Need Purpose More Than 'Respect'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nDavid French\n\nBy David French\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nThis month, the popular conservative podcaster Matt Walsh tweeted a thought that rapidly went viral, with approximately 18 million views. \"All a man wants,\" he wrote, \"is to come home from a long day at work to a grateful wife and children who are glad to see him, and dinner cooking on the stove. This is literally all it takes to make a man happy. We are simple. Give us this and you will have given us nearly everything we need.\"\n\nThe message was obviously trollish and intended to generate outrage. Bringing back \"Leave It to Beaver\" is not a serious strategy for renewing American masculinity. But it touched on an important question: How much should a man's self-worth depend on the respect or gratitude of others?\n\nI raise this because an overwhelming amount of evidence - from suicide , to drug overdoses , to education achievement gaps - indicates that millions of men are in crisis. And simply put, while many men demand respect , what they need is purpose , and the quest for respect can sometimes undermine the sense of purpose that will help make them whole. To put it more simply still: What men need is not for others to do things for them . They need to do things for others : for spouses, for children, for family and friends and colleagues.\n\nMany Americans - especially in evangelical circles - are familiar with the saying, \"Men want respect while women want love.\" They may need both, but they sometimes want different things. The concept was popularized by a writer and pastor named Emerson Eggerichs, who wrote the book \"Love and Respect: The Love She Most Desires; The Respect He Desperately Needs,\" but it's hardly an exclusively Christian concept. Eggerichs interviewed men and women and found that - in times of conflict - men overwhelmingly felt disrespected , not unloved, and if forced to choose, they would choose respect over love .\n\nThe demand for respect is a hallmark of much right-wing discourse about masculinity. In this narrative, too many women don't respect their husbands and the culture more broadly devalues men. Parts of this argument have merit. As the Brookings scholar Richard V. Reeves notes in his indispensable book, \"Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It,\" the phrase \"toxic masculinity,\" for example, is counterproductive. It teaches men there is \"something toxic inside them that needs to be exorcised.\"\n\nYet there is a danger in the quest for respect. Finding happiness in another person's regard is elusive and contingent. After all, we have little true control over how others perceive or treat us, yet when we're denied what we demand, we're often filled with helpless rage.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Videotaper gives an inside view of the Patriots' spying\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Greg Bishop\n\nWASHINGTON - Until the New England Patriots were caught cheating during a game against the New York Jets in September, Matt Walsh was a largely unknown former staff member who had done his work behind the video camera. Now he finds himself in front of it, the only person who was involved with the Patriots' illicit videotaping operation who has spoken publicly about how the team skirted National Football League rules for years.\n\nWalsh's view differs from that of the Patriots, the NFL and anyone else who contends that the videotaping of opponents' signals had little effect on the Patriots' performance. His vantage point was from behind the lens, inside the Patriots' organization and further inside the small, secret circle of coaches and staff members who, Walsh said, knowingly broke NFL rules to gain advantages in future games.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Walsh disputed several statements given by Coach Bill Belichick, who has insisted that he misinterpreted the league's rules and described the impact of the tapes as minimal, telling The Boston Globe in February that the value of the tactics rated as a 1 on a scale of 1 to 100.\n\n\"We live in a country that's very forgiving, if you come out and admit the mistake that you've made,\" Walsh said. \"In saying that, 'I misinterpreted the rules,' he didn't come across to me as being culpable for the actions he had taken. It seemed a little arrogant.\"\n\nStacey James, the Patriots' vice president for media relations, said in a statement, \"We question the truthfulness of many of Matt Walsh's stories, and others should do the same.\n\n\"Matt Walsh was a video operator,\" James said. \"For him to attempt to speak with any authority on the process of coaching, play-calling, or the decisions made by offensive or defensive coordinators is an embarrassment.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Former Patriots Video Assistant Reaches Deal With N.F.L.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Greg Bishop\n\nAfter more than two months of negotiations and dozens of proposals, lawyers for the N.F.L. and Matt Walsh, a former Patriots video assistant, came to an agreement Wednesday. Now, Walsh can share what information he says he has regarding New England's videotaping practices.\n\nThe question is whether Walsh will shed light on what has become known as Spygate, or whether he will merely confirm what the league already knows.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell, Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who has been critical of the league's investigation of the Patriots, and the public will find out May 13.\n\n\"I am pleased that we now have an agreement that provides Mr. Walsh with appropriate legal protections,\" Michael Levy, Walsh's lawyer, said in a statement. \"Mr. Walsh is looking forward to providing the N.F.L. with the materials he has and telling the N.F.L. what he knows.\"\n\nUnder the agreement, according to a statement released by the N.F.L., the league will compensate Walsh for \"any expenses, including legal feels that he incurs in connection with the interview.\" Walsh is also required to return any related material, including tapes, that he has from his tenure with the Patriots, whom he worked for from 1997 to 2003.\n\nWalsh, now an assistant golf pro in Hawaii, will meet with Goodell on May 13, the earliest date his schedule allows. After the meeting, the N.F.L. will hold a news conference, while Walsh will travel to Washington to meet with Specter and his staff.\n\nThe N.F.L. investigation began after New England was caught filming the Jets' defensive signals in last season's opener. Specter has specifically criticized the league's destruction of tapes related to the inquiry. During the Walsh negotiations, Specter challenged Goodell to release the correspondence between the lawyers, adding that he was not sure the league really wanted to talk to Walsh.\n\n\"I'm pleased to see it,\" Specter, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said of the agreement. \"It's very important the public knows what Matt Walsh has to say.\"\n\nThe Patriots issued a statement Wednesday, calling the negotiations \"frustrating\" and \"lengthy,\" and again denied taping the St. Louis Rams' walk-through practice before Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002. That allegation was reported the day before this year's Super Bowl by The Boston Herald, citing an anonymous source.\n\n\"The New England Patriots are pleased to learn that Matt Walsh is finally willing to come forward,\" the statement said. \"We fully expect this meeting to conclude the league's investigation into a damaging and false allegation that was originally levied against the team on the day before this year's Super Bowl.\"\n\nCoach Bill Belichick has admitted to taping defensive signals during his tenure at New England, but he has strongly denied taping the Super Bowl walk-through.\n\nWalsh has never been connected to any walk-through tape other than through speculation. He did tell The New York Times during Super Bowl week in February: \"If I ever got brought in for a deposition or something, then I would just face the whole gantlet of questions. There would be things I'd be forced to answer that some people haven't taken responsibility for.\"\n\nThe Patriots also reiterated in their statement that Walsh never signed a confidentiality agreement with the team. According to legal experts, the indemnification agreement covers all legal expenses, including but not limited to confidentiality agreements. Walsh sought full indemnification, including if he is sued or deposed after speaking to the league.\n\nWalsh is now covered in that regard. Stephanie Stradley, a legal expert who has written and lectured on contractual indemnification law and writes a sports blog for AOL, reviewed the agreement Wednesday.\n\n\"It does a nice job of protecting each party from the worries each has,\" she wrote via e-mail. \"It's very reasonable.\"\n\nStradley said that Walsh still had legal risks, but that they were greatly reduced by the agreement. She said part of the agreement protected the N.F.L.\n\nBy having Walsh turn over all his evidence and allowing his lawyer, Levy, to keep a copy, the league protects itself from any of the tapes leaking to the news media; otherwise the agreement is void. The agreement also says that any money Walsh makes from telling his story first goes to cover legal expenses included under indemnification.\n\nStradley added that companies with deep pockets who indemnify those with fewer assets, as in this case, run the risk of plaintiff lawyers' searching for an inviting target.\n\n\"The N.F.L. will defend Walsh, but they reserve the right to claim that Walsh wasn't working with the course and scope of his employment as it relates to losses, and the burden is on Walsh to prove it,\" Stradley said.\n\nLevy said he had not talked to Walsh after the agreement was announced Wednesday. He declined to comment further than his statement. Walsh is required to turn over all materials relating to the investigation by May 8. Then he will meet with Goodell and Specter. \"I'm waiting to see what he has to say,\" Specter said. \"Until that happens, everything else is speculative.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "The Golden Age of the Documentary Is Over, and What's Replaced It Is Grim\n\nIn Slate's annual Movie Club , film critic Dana Stevens emails with fellow critics-for 2024, Bilge Ebiri, K. Austin Collins, Alison Willmore, and Odie Henderson-about the year in cinema. Read the first entry here .\n\nHello pals,\n\nTo answer Bilge's question first, if I had the power to direct everyone's eyes to one movie this year, I think it would be Brett Story and Stephen Maing's Union . I've been feeling awfully glum about the state of the documentary lately; they have been subject to a monkey's-paw wish where they can be more dominant than ever, so long as that dominance comes in the form of bloated docuseries about cults, murders, corporate scandals, and celebrities who also happen to be executive producers. Or right-wing grievance! I got a \"For your consideration\" email a month ago for Am I Racist? that touted Matt Walsh's Daily Wire effort as \"The Highest-Grossing Documentary at the Box Office for 2024,\" a claim I felt driven to check myself. Not only is that accurate, but rounding out the Top 5 are Pharrell's misbegotten Lego self-portrait, the Glen Powell-produced military advertisement that was the Blue Angels documentary, and two faith-based Fathom Events releases about the Eucharist and the supposed scientific basis for Noah's flood. The hard time that No Other Land and Union have had getting distribution because of their subject matter feels absolutely in line with the way that so much of the documentary landscape has been ceded to streaming and the pressures those platforms exert on what gets made and promoted. Docs have rarely been box-office giants, but it's also a lot safer for a platform to delve into the transgressions of the years-dead Lou Pearlman over three episodes than it is to risk putting out a movie that might actually cause a ruckus.\n\nThe reason I'd want people to watch Union isn't just because of what it's about, though what it's about-a group of organizers trying to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island-is incredible. Their battle can't rightfully be described as a David-and-Goliath one, because David and Goliath still existed on the same human scale, and nothing about the corporation that the Amazon Labor Union is going up against exists in a scope for humans. But while I love the way the film chronicles a righteous fight being carried out by exhausted, fallible people, what I love even more are the formal choices Story and Maing make, the way they emphasize Amazon's impassive vastness through droll, disturbing shots of conveyor belts whirring away, of the warehouse itself as it squats balefully in a huge parking lot, or of the container ships bringing all those goods across the ocean to fill all those packages. I laughed out loud at the shot of one gargantuan vessel sliding into view just enough to reveal that it's emblazoned with the word \"Capital.\" Union is a real film in the craft sense, which shouldn't feel as revelatory as it does, but it's also a reminder that, as you said, Kam, sometimes you just need to be on the nose.\n\nI've been off Twitter for more than a year now, and have been using Instagram and Bluesky sparingly, and the result is that I've never been more distant from the online film conversation in the entire time I've been doing this job. I still keep a toe in, because I feel professionally obligated and because I am just too online to have it in me to break away entirely. But it has been a blessed relief, no longer being submerged in those fights, no longer having the voices of dozens of hot-takers incepted into my head, no longer anticipating some overblown direction the discourse is likely to turn toward. So while it's true that hyperbole remains the default mode for so many discussions, it hasn't really bothered me. I don't really care that Challengers isn't as horny as the kids online insist, because for me the effervescent delight of that movie comes from its absurd commitment to the idea that what happens on the court is the greatest intimacy of all, as well the ways its characters sublimate sexual competition into their tennis game rather than vice versa. I feel the same way about Babygirl , whose main character is an uptight girlboss who carries so much shame around her desire to be dominated that she can't acknowledge that what she wants is still practically vanilla. Harris Dickinson's character even compares what the pair of them get up to with the playacting of children! The movie's real charge comes from its acknowledgement that what people find sexy is deeply personal, and also potentially silly and weird-looking from the outside, such as being cradled like a toddler in someone's arms while they sway to George Michael (quite possibly my needle drop of the year).\n\nWhen it comes to Megalopolis , well, I never bought into the read that it represented Francis Ford Coppola somehow losing the thread. But that whole movie just reads to me like an apologia for genius as a personal brand-one that's decidedly masculine, brooding, and mercurial. The greatness of Adam Driver's Cesar Catilina is attested to not by his ideas, which remain a golden blur and a set of platitudes even when he realizes and saves the day with them, but by the fact that he's an imperious asshole who quotes Shakespeare and does what he wants, the world be damned. It felt like a plea for a very specific kind of creative indulgence from someone who doesn't actually have anything to say-but the reason I hated it is that it didn't offer me a whiff of pleasure. And criticism, in the most basic sense, has become to me the process of encountering a film, then trying to tease out afterward why it made me feel the way it did. \"Pleasure\" is a weird term to use in the context of something like Red Rooms , Pascal Plante's chilly, devastating psychological thriller about getting lost down an obsessive online rabbit hole, but I can't really think of a better word for what I want from a moviegoing experience, whether it comes from aesthetics or craft or narrative choices or acting or ideas or ambition.\n\nPleasure, in its most straightforward sense, is also what I really craved from the big screen this year, and I tried not to second-guess myself about where it might turn up. I didn't really find it in Wicked until the very end, but I loved watching Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande bellow at each other in exquisite harmony before Erivo took off with her black cape billowing. I didn't find it in Emilia Pérez at all-between it and The End , we might need to stage an intervention for joyless art-house musicals. And I didn't expect to find it in A Complete Unknown , because, like you, Dana, I generally find the biopic to be a huge drag as a genre. And yet, James Mangold's film ended up sparking something in me, not because of Timothée Chalamet's Bob Dylan impression, which was fine, but because of the way it portrayed the other characters looking at his character whenever he performed. They gaze at him with this mix of awe and envy, reverence and fear, instantly aware that this is someone whose talent exudes a gravitational force that they're going to have no choice but to be caught up in. That said more to me about genius than the entirety of Megalopolis -but enough about Coppola's misfire/masterpiece. Kam, were there films that you fell in unexpected love, or at least selective like, with this year?\n\nAlison Read all of the entries in Slate's 2024 Movie Club.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It's True: Democrats Who Covered Up Campaign Payments to a Pornographic Actress Should Also Go to Jail\n\nOne of the right's most common rhetorical responses to the prosecutions of Donald Trump has been to say something like if they can do it to him, they'll do it to you ! (Trump just said it himself at a Friday morning Trump Tower press conference at which he also brought up, for some reason, an accusation that \"Congo\" is releasing prisoners into the United States. ) The idea is to remind conservative voters about the threat of Liberal Big Government Tyranny, and it's probably an effective way to activate the Republican base even if, as this tweet points out, it doesn't quite make sense:\n\n\"if they can do it to trump they can do it to you\" oh wow I didn't realize that regular ppl could be arrested . good to know\n\nA related idea that has exploded into increased circulation since Thursday's jury verdict is that Republicans should take revenge for Trump's conviction by putting Democrats in jail too. Heavily bearded right-wing media star Matt Walsh was one of the first to call for this kind of retaliation, demanding a Biblical 10-to-1 imprisonment ratio of high-ranking Dems, although his brain seems to have been too clouded by red mist to actually name any high-ranking Democrats besides the president. (Hunter Biden is not active in Democratic politics.)\n\nDonald Trump should make and publish a list of ten high ranking Democrat criminals who he will have arrested when he takes office. First on the list should be Joe Biden. Second should be Joe Biden's crackhead son.\n\nKamala Harris! Kamala Harris is the vice president, Matt! Nancy Pelosi, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ... I could probably think of at least two or three others.\n\nBush administration lawyer John Yoo is calling for retaliatory prosecutions too, although, as Jonathan Chait points out, Yoo's argument manages to get the golden rule wrong , which is a bit embarrassing for someone whose job is supposed to be knowing what laws say. So is Sean Davis , the head of the right-wing Federalist website, and that's ironic, because a top-down system of prosecution-demanding is not federalism. Every state's voters should be able to make their own decisions about putting One to 10 Democrats to Be Named Later in the pen.\n\nBut let's take these calls with the seriousness they deserve for a minute-i.e., a Friday-afternoon blog post level of seriousness. While it doesn't seem like it would be fair to put Democrats in jail for literally nothing, perhaps a compromise could be reached of putting any Democrat who's done what Trump did in jail. (Note that Trump will not be sentenced until July, might not be sentenced to any imprisonment at all, and could delay house arrest or going to jail by appealing his conviction.)\n\nNamely, Democrats should face retaliatory imprisonment if they made nondisclosure payments to a pornographic actress to prevent her from sharing an allegation of an extramarital affair at a time when such allegations could have been politically damaging, then created fictitious transaction records to hide evidence of the payment.\n\nIt seems like a fair trade. If they could do it to him, they should be able to do it to you-that's what justice being blind really means.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Actually, It's Perfectly Rational for Republicans to Be Furious About That Supreme Court Leak\n\nOn Monday evening, Politico reported that five Supreme Court justices had decided to overturn Roe v. Wade, abolishing the constitutional right to an abortion that has existed since 1973. In addition, the outlet published a draft of the court's opinion, written back in February by Justice Samuel Alito. It's possible that votes will change before the final ruling, which is expected in June, but as of now, conservatives appear to be on the verge of a monumental legal victory they have pursued for half a century.\n\nThis should be a cause for celebration among Republicans. But the GOP's biggest names have instead treated their impending triumph mostly as an afterthought, while furiously highlighting the fact that someone leaked the decision early. Most have assumed without evidence that a liberal clerk must have fed the document to reporters in order to stir up a public backlash, and possibly cow conservative justices into switching their votes.\n\n\"By every indication, this was yet another escalation in the radical left's ongoing campaign to bully and intimidate federal judges and substitute mob rule for the rule of law,\" Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday morning , adding that \"the Department of Justice must pursue criminal charges if applicable.\" His response was typical among elected Republicans, who repeatedly called the leak an \"assault\" on the court.\n\nThe response among conservative pundits, meanwhile, has often been outright unhinged (not that there's anything unusual about that). Some, like Daily Wire editor Ben Shapiro, have suggested liberals are trying to incite murder. \"There is little question that this leak is designed to create threat to the life and limb of any justice who signs onto the majority opinion,\" he tweeted. (Such a claim might be reasonable if the pro-choice movement had any significant history whatsoever of political violence; but unlike the anti-abortion movement, it does not .) Others, such as commentator Matt Walsh, have called the leak an \" insurrection ,\" and have tried to claim it is a graver attack on American democracy than the Jan. 6 Capitol riot-which was, as you may recall, an actual violent putsch in which a mob tried to upend the results of a presidential election.\n\nThe SCOTUS leak is an actual insurrection. An attempt to completely upend and delegitimize the rule of law, incite violence and chaos, and potentially plunge the nation into civil war. January 6th was a stroll in the park compared to this. It's not even close.\n\nLiberals leaking a SCOTUS decision to pressure the justices to change their mind is an attack on our system 100000000 times more serious than the Capitol riot. This is why you should never listen to these fraudulent assholes when they prattle on about \"saving democracy\"\n\nMany Democrats have dismissed these reactions as being merely for show. Some, including Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have suggested that Republicans are trying to distract from the substance of the court's decision by talking about the leak instead, because overturning Roe is deeply unpopular. (Like, really, really , really unpopular). That's plausible enough, especially after McConnell told reporters today that they needed \"a lecture to concentrate on what the news is today. Not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked.\" Conservative media and politics also thrives on a non-stop persecution complex , and so its natural that Republicans would seize on any narrative in which they are being victimized by the forces of liberalism, even in their moment of near total triumph on a generation-defining political battle.\n\nBut in some ways, the Republican fury over this leak seems completely rational and sincere. This is not to say it's reasonable. Even setting aside the hysterical comments about murder and insurrection, we have no idea who actually leaked the opinion; it's entirely possible a conservative clerk or judge released it in order to pressure their colleagues not to switch their votes, since doing so would make it seem like they were caving to a liberal outrage. All we can do for now is speculate. (Though, if that turns out to be the story, I expect a lot of retractions). Beyond that, the actual policy goal Republicans are pursuing-stripping the right to reproductive health care from millions upon millions of women-is morally repugnant and typically only happens in countries that are backsliding out of democracy. But with that all said, it still makes perfect sense for Republicans to be very, genuinely mad that this document got out.\n\nFirst, I'm sure that some Republicans are genuinely concerned that this could ruin their impending victory. She might be jumping to conclusions, but there's no reason to think Fox News host Laura Ingraham is lying when she says she's mad about \"a naked attempt to try and change the outcome before the final decision is issued.\" The GOP is haunted by the possibility that one of the court's conservatives could go squishy and change their mind at the last minute, much the way Chief Justice John Roberts did when he decided to uphold the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate after initially voting to strike it down. Roberts did not sign on to the leaked draft opinion, and CNN reports that he wants to allow a 15-week abortion ban without junking Roe entirely. Some conservatives have to be worried about a scenario in which public anger helps the chief justice pick off one more conservative ally, and forces the court to write a more moderate decision. Genuine nerves might help explain why one conservative politician after another has urged the court to \" stay strong \" and \" not be swayed .\"\n\nTo Democrats, Republicans look like an NFL team complaining about a meaningless penalty call while they're about to win the Super Bowl. In the eyes of Republicans, though, there's still a chance they'll somehow lose the game with only seconds left on the clock (and, to maybe overextend the metaphor, if they do lose it'll be because the refs didn't call an obvious offensive pass interference penalty on their opponent; the refs in this case being the media).\n\nBesides the sheer anxiety factor, it isn't exactly a surprise to see Republicans getting worked up defending the Supreme Court's honor, and treating any breach of its internal procedures as a violation of \"sacred traditions,\" as Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn put it . After all, they control the institution! They have a durable, ideologically driven majority, meaning the party now has a vested interest in defending the court's institutional legitimacy while also pretending as if its decisions aren't driven by politics. The worst thing that could happen to the GOP would be for the public's trust in the court to collapse, just as it achieves its crowning but politically unpopular legal victory. The combination might create support for reforms that limit the conservative bloc's power. It's even dangerous for them if Democrats' faith in the justices collapses, since court packing could become a higher profile demand among the party's base.\n\nAs my colleagues at Slate have noted, such a legitimacy crisis may already be underway . Polling by both Gallup and Pew has found eroding support for the court, especially among liberals, who believe it has become too conservative. According to Pew, about two-thirds of Republicans still have a favorable view of the justices. But among Democrats, just 46 percent do, down from 65 percent in 2021; 53 percent of Democrats, meanwhile, have an unfavorable view.\n\nIn that sense, this week's leak may symbolize something deeply threatening to Republicans. If a liberal clerk really was responsible, that means someone inside the court decided that it had lost so much institutional legitimacy that it was acceptable to flout its rules and treat its ruling as just another form of political combat. It would be terrible for the conservative agenda  long term if that idea were to catch on. No wonder Republicans are mad about it.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Let Me Make Sure I Understand: Kamala Harris Is Too Hot and Childless to Be President?\n\nJust a few days after Kamala Harris entered the race for the presidency, the conservative attacks on her are already taking shape . They're both dark and predictable: She's a slut. She's childless. She's too liberal. She's too sexy. She laughs. Not in the right way.\n\nIt's the 2016 anti-Hillary playbook all over again. But it's 2024. And if Republicans lean too far into chauvinism and misogyny, they may find that this time around, they'll have a lot more pissed-off women to contend with-and they may wind up ushering the first female president right into the White House.\n\nSome of the accusations lobbed at Harris are true, insofar as she is indeed a beautiful woman who laughs and does not have biological children, although she is a stepmother to two: Cole Emhoff, who works in film, and Ella Emhoff, an artist, both of whom affectionately call Harris \"Momala.\" Harris has also racked up a series of professional accomplishments, working her way up in the California district attorney's office before becoming the attorney general of the state and then a U.S. senator before ascending to the vice presidency.\n\nBut right-wing detractors are determined to undermine both Harris' character and her achievements. One early line of attack is that \"She actually did sleep her way into and upwards in California politics,\" as former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly put it on Twitter, arguing that Harris was \"an unqualified political aspirant getting ahead based on smthg other than merit\" and that attacking her on these terms is \"relevant, and fair game.\"\n\nIt's not.\n\n(But if it were, one might ask if Kelly herself would have gotten where she is if television news, and particularly the Fox network, didn't favor female anchors who look a certain way.)\n\nHere's the story from whence this pearl-clutching about Harris stems: For roughly one year in the mid-1990s when she was 29 years old, Harris dated 60-year-old San Francisco politician Willie Brown, who was technically married but had been separated from his wife since the early '80s. Harris and Brown broke up in 1995, and in 1996, Brown was elected mayor of San Francisco, a position he would hold until 2004. Around the time they were dating, and when Brown was speaker of the California State Assembly, Brown appointed Harris to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the Medical Assistance Commission. That, apparently, was how Harris \"slept her way into and upwards in California politics\": by sitting on two boards.\n\nWell before she dated Brown, Harris was making her own way as a prosecutor, and she succeeded in her career because she was good at it, not because she dated a particular guy for a few months. She started working in the Alameda County district attorney's office in 1990. By the late 1990s, she was recruited by the San Francisco district attorney to work in his office as an assistant DA. And she replaced the man who recruited her because she won an election campaign against him in 2002, not because an ex-boyfriend or anyone else appointed her.\n\nNot that that matters to right-wingers who are convinced that any woman or person of color who gets ahead can't possibly have done so through their own merit. \"Kamala Harris got her start in politics by sleeping with Willie Brown,\" right-wing activist Matt Walsh tweeted . \"She became Vice President because Biden needed a non-white female on the ticket. Now she likely becomes the Democratic nominee for president because the guy at the top of the ticket has dementia. She's made a career out of begging for hand outs from powerful men. A thoroughly unimpressive human being.\"\n\nIt seems worth saying here that anyone who does well in politics gets a lot of help from a lot of other people. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for example, was also appointed to a state board by Brown back in 1996, after Newsom volunteered on Brown's campaign; Newsom has been a Brown protégé ever since. Brown is a notoriously effective political mover and shaker in California, who not only has connections to many influential people but has appointed untold numbers of up-and-comers to various boards and positions over his many years in office. You haven't heard of most of them, though, because it turns out that a seat on the Medical Assistance Commission is not actually a guaranteed path to fame, power, and the presidency. The idea that Harris' brief relationship with Brown three decades ago is what catapulted her to the top is as absurd as it is insulting.\n\nSo is the idea that she was made vice president simply because Biden wanted a Black woman on the ticket. Joe Biden, it's worth mentioning, was likely made vice president in part because the Black man running for the presidency wanted a white guy running with him to assuage the fears of white voters; when Hillary Clinton ran for president, she chose a white male running mate for the same reason. Harris will almost surely choose a white person as well, and probably a white man who can appeal to swing-state voters. Donald Trump selected Mike Pence for his first run because he wanted to earn the trust of evangelicals; this time around, he chose J.D. Vance, likely for Vance's potential strength among working-class whites in the Rust Belt and for Vance's relative youth.\n\nThose kinds of calculations are standard in politics; vice presidents are routinely chosen because of their skill sets, but also because of their identities. But it's only when someone outside of the norm is chosen-Harris is the only woman of color to ever be put on the vice presidential ticket of a major party-that accusations of unfairly weaponized identity politics emerge, and are manipulated to suggest that a candidate's identity playing a role in their selection means that they're wholly unqualified.\n\nAs for handouts from powerful men, well, Trump made his name on the back of his father's business and wealth, and much of his White House staff and both of his campaigns have been staffed up by unqualified lunatics whose chief qualifications seem to be an unlimited capacity for humiliation and degradation, and an infinite willingness to bend the knee and the law.\n\nObviously, the attacks on Harris aren't just laced with vile sexism and derogatory insinuations, including about others she has dated .\n\nAt a recent campaign event, Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance asked Harris (rhetorically): \"What the hell have you done other than collect a government check for the past 20 years?\" This racist dog whistle suggests that Harris is some kind of welfare queen living large on the government dime, rather than a lifelong public servant. Never mind that the check Harris is currently collecting is one Vance is gunning for, or that his bills have been paid by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. (Trump, too, engaged in years of tax avoidance , meaning that his bills and lavish lifestyle were heavily subsidized by me, you, and every other American taxpayer.)\n\nThe ugliness and hypocrisy don't stop there. Conservatives are attacking Harris for not having children , and even suggesting that stepparents aren't real parents, a great way to alienate the nearly 30 percent of American households with step-kin, a group that will include Donald Trump Jr. if he ever gets around to marrying Kimberly Guilfoyle, to whom he has been engaged for nearly four years. And it's probably not the best strategy to win over the many people who don't have children, including those 1  in 6 Americans 55 and over.\n\nWhile Trump has historically done well with men and with white working-class voters, including white working-class women, he has performed dismally with suburban women, women of color, and women with college degrees (white college-educated women were 10 points more likely to vote for Biden than Trump in 2020). Maybe he's banking on the idea that these voting blocs won't care if he, his vice president, his surrogates, and his followers smear the potential first female president as an unqualified slut. But given how many American women have been demeaned, discriminated against, denied professional advancement, and otherwise mistreated because of their gender, it's an awfully risky bet to make.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "As pro-Palestine protests spread across campuses nationwide in April and police responded with varying degrees of violence, many horrifying videos of police attacking students and professors circulated online. But so many other interactions were not recorded. Even at Columbia-the campus that seemingly every media organization swarmed to after university president Nemat Shafik called the police to arrest students and clear the protesters' encampment-so many stories of students' interactions with law enforcement have not yet surfaced. It may take months (or longer) for more documentation of what actually happened at Columbia-and so many other campuses-to come out.\n\nJazzmin Jiwa, a journalism grad student who was on Columbia's campus during the police raids, writes that few people understand what really happened, and what's coming now .\n\nThere is a surprisingly heated debate happening on Trump's Wikipedia page. Stephen Harrison reports on how editors are battling it out over the placement of the term \"convicted felon. \"\n\nThe most remarkable thing about Biden's cease-fire speech is that he endorsed Israel's proposal for an enduring cease-fire, thus sharing the risks of its success or failure.

      "text": "The First Movie From SNL 's Kyle Mooney Looks As Weird (and As Great) As You'd Expect\n\nThe trailer for Brigsby Bear , the new dramedy starring and co-written by Saturday Night Live' s Kyle Mooney, has finally arrived. The film was widely acclaimed when it premiered at Sundance back in January, and it features a stacked cast that includes Mark Hamill, Claire Danes, Greg Kinnear, Matt Walsh, and Andy Samberg. The film also has some big-name producers in the guys from the Lonely Island and the duo of Phil Lord and Chris Miller ( 21 Jump Street , The Lego Movie ). And it's the first feature directed by Dave McCary, a member of Mooney and Beck Bennett's sketch group Good Neighbor and the man who has directed some of the best SNL pre-taped segments from the past couple of years, such as the endearingly charming but cringeworthy \" Flirty .\"\n\nThe trailer is short, but it gets across a vibe reminiscent of Spike Jonze's work-it's images are at once poignant, surreal, and quirky. In other words, it looks exactly how you would expect a movie from Kyle Mooney to look. While the trailer doesn't give away much of the film's plot, Brigsby Bear tells the story of James (Kyle Mooney), who was kidnapped at a young age and raised by two people he believes are his parents (Mark Hamill and Jane Adams), and is obsessed with an elaborate children's TV show called Brigsby Bear that, unbeknownst to James, is a show that is produced only for him and watched only by him. The movie will arrive in theaters, where it can be watched by you and many other people, on July 28.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "My Megyn Kelly Week\n\nAdapted from the book Wannabe by Aisha Harris. Copyright © 2023 by Aisha Harris. Reprinted by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.\n\nSo it's 2013, I'm 25 years old, and I've been at Slate for a little under two years. It's around the holidays, and I'd been thinking about how Santa Claus' race had been a sticking point for me as a kid. The reasons my dad gave me why Santa was Black at home but white pretty much everywhere else I looked seemed like bunk. (He was a shape-shifter, my dad said, who took on the race of whatever household he was visiting. Clever, but I wasn't buying it.) It seemed outdated for Santa to still be depicted in most places as a fat old white dude. So I wondered, what if instead of representing him as a human, we just avoided race and made him some other kind of creature? And what other creature would be more perfect, more beloved-the kind of creature everyone, everywhere could get behind, no problem-than a penguin?\n\nIt was an instant hit in the room. I wrote the piece, making my case lightheartedly while noting the real bias embedded in our culture's white-as-default approach to everything, but especially fictional characters. Someone on the art team created a fun cartoon image of a fat penguin dressed up in a Santa outfit bearing gifts.\n\nThe piece went out into the world in December, and while I expected some pushback-because when you work at Slate, you're basically inviting pushback anytime you publish anything-I thought it'd come and go after a day or two like most stories do.\n\nAnd then Megyn Kelly got involved:\n\nYet another person claiming it's racist to have a white Santa, and-by the way for all you kids watching at home: Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a Black Santa. But you know, Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this 'cause someone wrote about it, kids.\n\nOn her Fox News show The Kelly File , Megyn Kelly's producers corralled a panel of Fox contributors and commentators to bring my piece \"Santa Claus Should Not Be a White Man Anymore\" to the attention of the world. To be fair to the spirit of the mostly ridiculous discussion that took place, two of the panelists, Jedediah Bila and Bernard Whitman, defended my perspective (\"our social fabric can take the elasticity of Kris Kringle,\" the latter said) and seemed to take it all as lightheartedly as I had in my article.\n\nBut no one remembers that part, and for good reason. Kelly (and less famously, the other panelist among them, Monica Crowley) was palpably incensed by what I'd written, as if she were a small child who'd just been told that not only was Santa not real, but the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny were also fakes. She said I'd gone \"off the rails\" in suggesting Santa Penguin, and insisted, with not even a modicum of irony, that \"just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change.\"\n\nOh yeah, and then she added: \"Jesus was a white man, too.\"\n\nI was not watching live when that three-minute segment aired, because I like myself too much and that's not something I do except for the rare occasion when my work requires me to do so. But it didn't take long to feel the debris falling my way as the thing detonated all over the internet that night. What follows next is my particular experience alone, but the gist of this sequence is probably fairly typical of what goes down for any journalist who suddenly goes viral:\n\n1.  First, the general public reacts. I was at a Brooklyn Nets game at the time, and suddenly I was getting messages from friends and colleagues excitedly sharing the news of what had transpired. I wasn't much of a Twitter person at that point yet (God, what a time), but when I went to check my page, I saw that the praise and, more acutely, the vitriol were gushing forth. Pretty standard stuff when you're a Black woman-name-calling, racist and misogynistic slurs (\"n--,\" \"bitch,\" and the twofer, \"n--bitch\").\n\n2.  Almost simultaneously, the outlets and online commentators react. In my case, Kelly's rant was blogged about by seemingly every major news outlet and then some, the greatest hits from the segment being the factory-made quotes \"Santa just is white\" and \"Jesus was a white man, too.\" The Daily Show With Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report each did a segment on it, as did The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\n3.  At this point, the story has grown beyond your wildest dreams (nightmares?) and you feel as though you have to respond to the hubbub in some way. The day after The Kelly File segment aired, I wrote another piece, this one headlined \" What Fox News Doesn't Understand About Santa .\"\n\n4.  While that's happening, you're probably fielding interview requests from some of those same outlets. In just a matter of days, I did the biggest number of public appearances I've ever done for a single piece I've written, including All In with Chris Hayes , The Today Show , Reliable Sources , and NPR's Tell Me More .\n\n5.  Occasionally in these instances, the furor gets so heated (or the news cycle is so slow, as it usually is as Christmas approaches) that you transcend the industry news cycle and bleed into mainstream culture, too. In my case, Kelly's rant made it as far as Saturday Night Live 's \"Weekend Update\" segment, where Kenan Thompson, dressed as Santa, revealed: \"You heard of Secret Santa? Well, here's a secret for you: I'm Black as hell.\"\n\nWhat would normally be a one-, maybe two-day news story stretched out over the course of about a week-a week of nonstop interview requests and emails from people I hadn't spoken to in years reaching out to say they'd been following the controversy. My colleagues and bosses were thrilled; my family and friends were ecstatic and proud. And why wouldn't they be? This moment gave me the kind of publicity many people dream of and spend an inordinate amount of time and effort attempting to manufacture-all because I said I wanted Santa Claus to be a penguin. This was an unqualified win.\n\nI hated nearly every moment of it.\n\nAfter I politely turned down a request from Don Lemon's show a few days into the cycle, the producer replied: \"Thanks for reaching back, Aisha. Are you just a little 'over' the story?\"\n\nMy canned response: \"I'm genuinely surprised at how much attention this continues to get but definitely glad that it sparked a discussion about how our culture is represented.\" I left it at that.\n\nA decade later, I'm more than exhausted by the ongoing discussion about cultural representation. Because frankly, it feels like déjà vu. An ongoing and particularly ridiculous example: Disney's remake of The Little Mermaid , which has the young Black singer Halle Bailey stepping into the fins of Ariel.\n\nAs it happens, my first pop-culture obsession was The Little Mermaid . I was drawn to everything about it: Sebastian's literal and figurative crabbiness, Flounder's flightiness, Ursula's seduction. But more than anything, I wanted to be Ariel, with or without the fins. The bright red hair, the clamshell bra, the handsome prince: By the time I was 3 or 4, I was already fully locked in, longing to be a Disney princess.\n\nMore to the point, I desperately wanted an Ariel doll. But there were no white dolls in our house, and that was deliberate-my dad, as the Santa article mentioned, was very aware of the infamous doll tests that had been conducted by psychologists Mamie and Kenneth Clark in the 1940s, which found that in a study of more than 200 Black kids between the ages of 3 and 7 years old, the majority assigned positive traits to white dolls and negative traits to Black ones. That study became a crucial component in the Brown v. Board of Education case on school desegregation. I was never going to own an Ariel doll.\n\nNow, Black Ariel dolls are available wherever toys are sold for $26.99. And that makes some people very, very angry.\n\nIn fact, the new Little Mermaid 's detractors just might take the cake for having the most absurdist takes this discourse has ever seen. \"From a scientific perspective, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have someone with darker skin who lives deep in the ocean,\" political commentator Matt Walsh opined on \"science\" of the mythical mermaid creatures. \"I mean, if anything, not only should the Little Mermaid be pale, she should actually be translucent. If you look at deep sea creatures, they're, like, translucent. They have no kind of pigmentation whatsoever.\"\n\nNot as pithy as \"Santa just is white,\" but you've got to hand it to him for that Olympian-grade execution of mental gymnastics. That man's mind is so twisted as to have him convinced he'd rather watch a jellyfish-colored half-human than a Black half-human fall in love with a prince for two hours.\n\nIt's all gotten so predictable some studios are now warning their minority stars to be prepared for the worst, as if any performer of color could be surprised to receive racial harassment. \"It was something that Lucasfilm actually got in front of,\" said Moses Ingram, star of Obi-Wan Kenobi , who faced her own bizarre backlash for appearing on the show . \"[They said to us], 'This is a thing that, unfortunately, likely will happen. But we are here to help you; you can let us know when it happens.' \"\n\nI can empathize. Never in my life had I been called a n-- more times than in the aftermath of Santa Penguin. I stayed off Twitter for a while and vowed never to read the comments under my own articles ever again. (I've mostly kept that promise to myself, and my mind is better for it.) But my inbox was harder to avoid. For every encouraging, friendly, and sweet email I received from people far and wide (Brazil, Nigeria, Belgium, etc.), there was a soul-sucking message from a willfully ignorant racist to counter it and try to knock me down a peg. I deleted most of them, including the handful of death threats, because I don't really need that kind of energy clogging up my inbox.\n\nBy Aisha Harris\n\nSlate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page.\n    Thank you for your support.\n\nBut while I can brush these people off as miserable and pathetic, I can't help but be filled with dread over the fact that such people aren't really outliers, or at the very least, they don't seem like outliers. They are loud and wrong and proud, and their collective voice can't just be tuned out easily.\n\nThese people cling to the purity of myths and legends, which are inherently meant to be fluid, malleable, revised, bent, and subverted through subsequent interpretations. Part of the issue stems from the fact that, no matter how many times or ways a piece of art is appropriated, there will always emerge a dominant version (or versions) of that art. When it comes to narrative storytelling, the versions that tend to prevail are white.\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to anything Disney-related. By nature of its near-monopoly on children's entertainment-and now all-ages entertainment, thanks to owning Marvel, Fox, and so much in between-the images the company has created loom large. \"The Disney version becomes the definitive version,\" animator Glen Keane once said. Which partially explains why Disney keeps creating so-called \"live action\" (CGI) remakes of its previous animated successes. Audiences like what is familiar, and that includes the physical appearances of their favorite heroes and villains. It makes me wonder: Disney may have reimagined Ariel as a Black girl with red locks for its blatant cash grab of a remake, but if a little kid visits one of the conglomerate's theme parks, will they greet an Ariel who looks like the blue-eyed 1989 version-or the 2023 version?\n\nToday, Black kids have more characters to choose from than ever before, so it's moving (and heartbreaking) to watch viral videos of parents recording their Black children as they laid eyes upon Halle Bailey as Ariel in The Little Mermaid.\n\n\"She's Black?\" says one girl. \"Yay!\"\n\n\"She's brown like me!\" exclaims another.\n\nThe joy, the recognition, the kinship these kids are finding in this new version of the character makes me so happy for them, but also a little bit sad for my younger self, who didn't get to have this experience.\n\nWhile writing the Santa piece, I'd emailed my dad asking him to send me a column he'd written for our local paper, the New Haven Register, when I was just shy of 3 years old, titled \"Black Kids Need a Black Santa.\" In some ways, my article echoed his own, though his was from the perspective of a father imagining a more inclusive world for his daughter. He wrote about wanting to make sure I grew up with a \"healthy image\" of myself: \"I do not want her to become one of those statistics that show Black children preferring white dolls to the dolls that look like them.\"\n\nYet I still wound up wishing I had Ariel's red hair and clamshell bra and longing for an Ariel doll I could call my own. If only that little girl knew what awaited her 30 years later .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Arlen Specter, R-Pa., on the same subject.\n\nGoodell and Specter each planned to hold a news conference after meeting with Walsh. Specter, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has been critical of the NFL's handling of the investigation.\n\nBefore Goodell's expected news conference, the league played for the media the tapes Walsh provided. The clips were cut from shots of opposing coaches going through their signals in games against the Patriots.\n\nGoodell arrived at 6:38 a.m. ET on Tuesday at the NFL's offices on Park Avenue in New York. He stopped briefly to speak with reporters, but did not address what he expected to hear from Walsh before entering the building.\n\nWalsh, wearing a somber expression and accompanied by his attorney, Michael N. Levy, and two other men, arrived at 280 Park Ave. at 7:25 a.m. Levy declined comment to reporters on Walsh's behalf, noting that Walsh's agreement with the NFL requires him to talk to the league before he speaks with anyone else.\n\nAfter the meeting, Levy said Walsh was flying to Washington for his meeting with Specter and would not take part in the NFL news conference.\n\n\"Mr. Walsh is pleased he has had the opportunity to assist the NFL,\" Levy said. \"Out of respect for Sen. Specter, neither Mr. Walsh nor I will speak with the media prior to meeting with the Senator.\"\n\nWalsh agreed to turn the tapes over to Goodell and the NFL last week. He suggested in January that he had information about the team's policy of taping the signals of opposing coaches.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell left open the possibility that more penalties could be levied.\n\nA Patriots employee from 1997-2003, Walsh reached an agreement to turn over the tapes in exchange for being indemnified from all future legal fees.\n\nThe New York Times obtained a list of the Walsh tapes, and the league confirmed that list, which says that the Patriots taped offensive and defensive coaches in regular-season games against the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns and San Diego Chargers. The team also made video of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2002 AFC Championship Game.\n\nWalsh's tapes do not include the video of the St. Louis Rams' walkthrough before the 2002 Super Bowl, as reported by the Boston Herald.\n\n\"Mr. Walsh has never claimed to have a tape of the walk-through,\" said Walsh's lawyer Michael Levy, according to the Times. \"Mr. Walsh has never been the source of any of the media speculation about such a tape. Mr. Walsh was not the source for the Feb. 2 Boston Herald article.\"\n\n\"This is consistent with what the Patriots had admitted they had been doing, consistent with what we already knew,\" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello told The Associated Press.\n\nWalsh has separate meetings scheduled on Tuesday with the commissioner and Senator Arlen Specter in which he is expected to provide additional details about the taping process.\n\n\"We're not going to comment,\" said Stacey James, the Patriots' vice president for media relations.

First, it keeps the budget down; and two, people are going to see this movie because of the tornadoes, not the actors. And by keeping the budget down for the talent, producers can spend more on those tornadoes. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton (\"Twister\") be damned!\n\nIn \"Into the Storm,\" we have Pete (\"Veep\"'s Matt Walsh), a guy who's been trying for years to get up-close and personal footage of a tornado. He has a film crew with him, a meteorologist (Sarah Wayne Callies from \"The Walking Dead\"), and a special vehicle he's modified to withstand winds of up to 170 MPH so he can drive right into the eye of a tornado and film that sucker.\n\nAll ABC News Movie Reviews Here\n\nMovie Review: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Starring Will Arnett, Megan Fox\n\nMovie Review: 'Get On Up' Starring Chadwick Boseman, Nelsan Ellis, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer\n\nThe other storylines include a high school vice-principal and widower (Richard Armitage) who may or may not be able to heal his fractured relationship with his 17-year-old son, and two reckless morons attempting to become famous on YouTube by shooting video of tornadoes.\n\nAnd we certainly see plenty of tornadoes. They're impressively rendered, in stunning detail like we've never before seen, from the storms themselves to the destruction they create. Less impressive are the story devices writer John Swetnam employs to get us to those tornadoes.\n\nLike many, I've grown tired of the found-footage first-person format, but here it works surprisingly well, for about 10 minutes. And by that I mean if you combine all of the scenes in which it works well, you get a grand total of about 10 minutes of actual enjoyment. As far as the story goes, there's nothing \"Into the Storm\" offers that we haven't seen before. But the tornadoes look great, and that has to count for something.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Kristi Noem, a star in conservative media, slams popular right-wing blogger for 'horrible misogyny'\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, whose profile has risen in conservative media during the pandemic, is lashing out at one of right-wing media's most popular bloggers for what she described as comments that were full of \"horrible misogyny.\"\n\nNoem, a Republican viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, garnered praise from conservatives early in the pandemic for rejecting mask mandates . But she has recently refused to stop private businesses from implementing vaccine requirements, prompting some criticism from right-wing pundits.\n\nMatt Walsh, a right-wing blogger and podcaster for the conservative Daily Wire, said there was \"no use\" for her. \"Kristi Noem is a very attractive woman,\" he said during a recent episode of his podcast. \"So she's got that going for her.\"\n\nRelated article Fox News mandates employees disclose vaccination status, contradicting rhetoric from top stars\n\n\"As far as I can tell that's the only reason why she was ever looked at as some sort of 2024 potential frontrunner,\" he continued. \"The hype and everything that she's gotten from conservative media is entirely based on the fact that she's an extremely attractive woman, which she is.\"\n\n\"But you put 50 pounds on her and another 20 years? I don't think she gets any of the hype,\" Walsh concluded.\n\nNoem slammed the remarks in a tweet on Wednesday evening. \"Instead of engaging in a debate about the proper role of government and how it isn't conservative to tell people how to do business, [Walsh] stooped to horrible misogyny,\" she wrote. \"Eyes up here, Matt.\"\n\nIn a tweet from her personal account, she said she was \"roping bulls\" that were \"bigger than [Walsh]\" when she was a teenager. She suggested Walsh was perhaps a \"steer\" and said he \"couldn't walk a day in my shoes.\"\n\nThe feud could signal that Noem's honeymoon period in right-wing media may be coming to an end. It also demonstrates how quickly the right's biggest star politicians can fall out of favor with some in conservative media.\n\nWalsh stood by his remarks, tweeting out a statement on Thursday that he sent to a Newsweek reporter.\n\n\"No, I do not regret stating an obvious truth,\" he said in that statement. \"I will however accept apologies from all of the performative idiots pretending to be offended by it.\"\n\nIn another tweet, he said he was only \"deeply sorry\" that his critics are \"all a bunch of ridiculous, whiney babies.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Right-wing media figures blame women in Secret Service and 'DEI' for security failure in Trump shooting\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nIn the days following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the Secret Service, charged with securing the Pennsylvania event, has faced scrutiny for the extraordinary breach that led to the agency's worst failure in decades.\n\nBut one narrative has quickly taken hold in parts of the right-wing media ecosystem: The security failure was the result of workforce diversity initiatives and women working as Secret Service agents.\n\nWhile the security lapse happened outside of the event's hard perimeter at a poorly secured building roughly 120 to 150 meters away from the stage, prominent right-wing figures have launched misogynistic attacks, blaming the female agents positioned near Trump as well as Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, the second woman to hold the top job and an advocate for women to join the force.\n\nRelated article Secret Service 'solely responsible' for implementation and execution of security at the Trump rally site, director tells CNN\n\nIn the seconds after shots rang out Saturday, male and female agents positioned on stage with Trump sprang into action to protect the former president with their own bodies. But in a series of social media posts and television appearances, right-wing media pundits have targeted the female agents' response, claiming they lacked the experience, size, and capability to handle the situation. Edited videos that garnered millions of views on social media as supposed evidence of female incompetence, showed a female Secret Service agent seemingly struggling to holster her gun amid the chaotic scene as a group of agents escorted Trump to his motorcade.\n\nGroups that represent women in law enforcement are also raising the alarm, saying such attacks are dangerous and disingenuous.\n\nMatt Walsh, a far-right media personality, wrote a series of posts on the social media platform X assailing the notion of women working as Secret Service agents.\n\n\"There should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women,\" he wrote.\n\nWalsh, who has advocated for traditional gender roles, claimed without evidence that if any woman is hired in the Secret Service, \"it 100 percent means that a more qualified male was passed over.\"\n\nBut those experienced in federal law enforcement note that the female agents on Trump's detail acted swiftly along with their male counterparts.\n\n\"One female agent joined the phalanx in shielding Trump from any possible additional incoming rounds, while another female agent with her gun drawn provided rear security,\" said Josh Campbell, former FBI supervisory special agent and CNN security correspondent.\n\n\"Female agents were also among those guarding Trump's armored SUV as it prepared to depart the scene,\" said Campbell.\n\nLaw enforcement experts say there is usually no hurry to holster a weapon, as doing so inherently means a firearm is not required to address a potential threat. The holstering process is also a moment where plain-clothes agents in particular must take care to ensure their trigger does not snag on a piece of loose clothing.\n\nBarbara Riggs, former deputy director of the Secret Service, called the criticism directed at female agents \"preposterous, \"crazy,\" and \"just outrageous.\"\n\nThe agents on stage acted according to their training, Riggs told CNN, communicating with each other about where they were escorting Trump despite a chaotic scene.\n\nThey \"should be commended, not vilified,\" she said.\n\nRight-wing media figures have bashed diversity initiatives for years, making \"DEI\" or \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" a slur in the right-wing media ecosystem, falsely claiming that standards have been lowered to accommodate diverse hiring practices. Everything from the Baltimore bridge collapse to safety issues in airliners has been placed at the feet of increasing diversity among the workforce.\n\nWomen have been part of the Secret Service since 1971. All agents, male or female, must meet the same standards to join the force, although women candidates have different physical fitness requirements.\n\nBy nature, security details are privy to the most personal and intimate details of a protectee's life - including any women being guarded - and the presence of women on Secret Service details has been a staple for decades.\n\nIn the immediate moments following the shooting, audio captured by Trump's microphone showed agents taking cover with Trump behind a lectern remained in place at the scene until it was clear the shooter was down. But some on the right criticized the female agents as physically incapable of covering Trump's body as he reached in the air to pump his fist in a sign of defiance to his supporters.\n\n\"Having a small person as body cover for a large man is like an undersized Speedo at the beach - doesn't cover the subject,\" X owner Elon Musk, who later endorsed Trump and dedicated millions to his reelection effort, wrote on the platform. \"Could be a man or a woman, to be clear, just needs to be large enough to do the job.\"\n\nBut even Musk, who travels with personal security, has often been spotted with male guards noticeably shorter than him.\n\nOn Fox News, host Laura Ingraham said that while she supports women, \"when it comes to shielding the body of someone who is six-foot-three ... you can't do it if you're five-foot-five. You can't do it.\"\n\nRiggs, who retired from the Secret Service in 2006, said the idea agents need to be bigger than the protectee is \"absurd,\" noting that throughout the Secret Service's history there have been male agents of varying heights, which was never an issue.\n\nBut the security failures at Trump's rally stem from a building outside of the perimeter that was being secured by local law enforcement, where the shooter managed to reach the roof and have a clear line of sight to Trump. The threat to Trump was not feet in front of him, where the female agents who were most scrutinized were located. And most of the agents with Trump that day were men.\n\nOne notable voice on the right defended the female agents who protected Trump at the rally.\n\nEric Trump, the former president's son, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday that, \"The people on that stage love him. They would take a bullet for him.\"\n\n\"One of the females on the stage, she was with me for three years. I know everything about her. She would take a bullet for me. She would take a bullet for him. As courageous as they come,\" he added. \"The same as everybody else that was around him, the head of his detail was on that stage. Believe me, the last thing they wanted was that to happen and they did all the right things.\"\n\nStill, other right-wing figures blamed DEI initiatives for incompetence at the federal agency led by Cheatle, only the second woman to head the Secret Service. Cheatle, who has served in the Secret Service for more than 25 years and was part of then-Vice President Joe Biden's security detail, previously led global security for PepsiCo. In a CBS News interview last year, she said that the agency had sought to boost the number of women in the force.\n\n\"I'm very conscious as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,\" Cheatle said.\n\nRight wing figures also attacked Cheatle's previous work as head of security at PepsiCo, one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world.\n\nTennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett, who has attacked Vice President Kamala Harris as a \"DEI\" hire in a \"box checking White House,\" wrote on X, \"I can't imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service. #sarcasm.\"\n\nOn the far-right cable channel One America News, host Dan Ball claimed Cheatle \"has been too worried about making sure all of the agents use the proper pronouns\" over ensuring the safety of the former president.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told the Washington Post on Wednesday that he believes Cheatle \"was far more concerned about DEI than protecting, for example, President Trump.\"\n\nRiggs said Cheatle did \"not get that job as a token. It's because they bring the experience, and they've been successful.\" She also defended recruitment efforts, noting that more diversity brings \"different perspectives to the table and different experiences\" that can help view a situation in a different way, with unique skills, knowledge and abilities.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Whitney Wild on Tuesday, Cheatle said, \"What happened is a terrible incident and should never happen.\"\n\n\"And we are obviously going to make sure moving forward we take whatever any lessons that come out of this and adjust accordingly,\" she added.\n\nAssociations that represent women in law enforcement reacted to the unfounded attacks on female agents with disappointment and alarm.\n\n\"Statements blaming this shooting on efforts to promote gender equity are disingenuous at best and deeply dangerous at worst,\" a group of associations, including Women in Federal Law Enforcement, International Association of Women Police, and National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, said in a statement.\n\nResearch, they said, has shown that efforts to expand the pool of qualified applicants for law enforcement positions \"makes us all safer and say they do not advocate for hiring solely based on gender or lowering standards in any way.\"\n\n\"We must reject all bad-faith efforts to seek to score political points at the expense of our safety. This is the most recent effort to sow division and blame by attacking diversity initiatives for everything from airline safety catastrophes to bridge collapse to bank failures,\" the groups said.\n\nUncompromising news and analysis at the intersection of media, technology and entertainment.\n\nBy signing up to newsletters, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the Privacy Policy .

      "text": "These stay-at-home fathers tell you why paternity leave is important\n\nThe debate over US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg taking two months off to care for his twin newborns has reached the point of absurdity.\n\nFox News personality Tucker Carlson suggested that Buttigieg was \" Trying to figure out how to breastfeed .\" Conservative political commentator Matt Walsh proclaimed on Twitter that there isn't much for a father to do during those first months of a child's life. Conservative activist Candace Owens called him weak, using the Twitter hashtag, #BringBackManlyMen .\n\nWhile those personalities were ridiculing the role a father plays in his child's life, I was with 100 other dads attending HomeDadCon, a national conference for stay-at-home fathers . When I shared these criticisms about Buttigieg's paternity leave, I thought about hiding behind the podium in case any dads wanted to throw tomatoes at me.\n\nNo matter what your gender or sexuality is, everyone deserves the benefit of welcoming a new child into their family.\n\nWhether you stay at home as a father or work, many fathers regard raising their children a priority. So, what do fathers do on paternity leave and why is it important? This is what stay-at-home dads had to say.\n\nThe United States doesn't have a national paternity or maternity leave policy that gives parents paid leave to care for their newborn children. Both types of leave are covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which gives parents up to 12 work weeks of leave to care for a new child. But companies decide if that leave is paid or not. Currently, only six states require paid family leave, with three other states fully enacting policies in the coming years, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center , a Washington, DC-based think tank.\n\nRelated article Your children need life skills -- this dad explains how to teach them\n\nThe massive spending package now in negotiations in Congress aims to establish paid family and medical leave on a national level. President Joe Biden currently proposes four weeks, limiting benefits to those who earn less than $100,000, as previously reported by CNN . But right now, paternity and maternity leave isn't an option for many families. Only 21% of US workers have access to paid FMLA, according Family Values @ Work, an advocacy group. And 93% of low-wage earners have zero access to paid leave .\n\nQuetzal Torres credits his manager with giving him eight days of unpaid time off. \"I took normal leave,\" said Torres, father of four from Cary, North Carolina. \"My boss was flexible, but it was all unpaid.\"\n\nOther fathers at the conference used similar language. \"I was in good with my manager,\" said one dad. \"My supervisor was mostly OK with it,\" said another.\n\nIt seems that some people still have a TV stereotype of childbirth and aftercare, with the dad in the waiting room smoking a cigar until he gets the good news and kisses his wife on the forehead. Then he gets back to work outside the home.\n\nRelated article How to become more patient with everyday annoyances\n\nChildbirth doesn't always go smoothly.\n\nLou Marino's first child was in the newborn intensive care unit, and he found himself in a bind. His son had breathing issues and required constant supervision.\n\n\"Every time that alarm would go off, it would freak me out,\" said Marino, of Swampscott, Massachusetts. \"It was stressful. I did a lot of skin-to-skin contact with my son to let him know I was there and that I was trying to protect him.\"\n\nSoon after his son came home, he decided to quit his job and become a stay-at-home dad.\n\nRelated article 16 cloth face masks for going back to school (CNN Underscored)\n\nJeremy Hastons of Austin, Texas, had no paternity leave and worked nights and weekends as an assistant manager at a restaurant to have enough time with his family. When his wife delivered an 11-pound baby with jaundice, he had just a week's worth of vacation time saved up. He took over all the household duties such as meal prep, cooking, cleaning and running the necessities of life while his wife recovered and focused on their newborn.\n\nCannon Ingalls was an emergency medical technician and was paid hourly. After a cesarean section, his wife couldn't drive for a month. He had to take time off to do childcare, run errands and grocery shop to give his wife time to recover. \"She wasn't very mobile, and she was stubborn. She wanted to do it all but couldn't.\"\n\nPeople who are hourly workers or don't have an \"understanding boss\" often don't get that time to be with their newborns, according to Josephine Kalipeni, executive director of Family Values @ Work.\n\n\"Paid leave is just as important for men as it is for women,\" Kalipeni said, \"to give all genders the ability to care for their families.\n\n\"It's easy to say that they want to be there, but the reality of our world often prevents that from happening,\" she said. \"We've talked to women that were sent into spirals of depression because caring for another can be so overwhelming and demanding.\" These new mothers, Kalipeni added, develop postpartum depression without enough time off to adjust and without support, whether from a co-parent or family member who has access to leave.\n\nMany dads that I spoke to talked about being pressured into not taking leave or keeping that leave to a minimum. And even the ones that did qualify for three months' worth of leave couldn't afford to take it. There are a lot of sacrifices that we make as parents, but time with our newborns shouldn't be one.\n\nHow we treat and talk about fathers matters.\n\nWe are never babysitting, and we are never helping out Mom, a phrase that insults mothers and fathers. We are parenting and we deserve to have that time with our families to raise good humans. The idea of the bumbling idiot is done, and paid paternity leave needs to be a reality.\n\nWhere are all the real men? We are busy raising and spending time with our children.\n\nShannon Carpenter is the author of \"The Ultimate Stay-at-Home Dad\" and co-host of the Dadhouse Podcast.  He and his family live in Lee's Summit, Missouri.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

But this year, Target faced an anti-LGBTQ campaign that went viral on social media.\n\nFueled by far-right personalities and on social media platforms, the anti-trans campaign spread misleading information about the company's Pride Month products and its business practices.\n\nHurting brands' sales and reputations was the stated goal of the campaign: \"The goal is to make 'pride' toxic for brands,\" said right-wing commentator Matt Walsh on Twitter . \"If they decide to shove this garbage in our face, they should know that they'll pay a price. It won't be worth whatever they think they'll gain.\"\n\nThe campaign became hostile, with threats levied against Target employees and instances of damaged products and displays in stores.\n\nRelated article Bud Light wanted to market to all. Instead, it's alienating everyone\n\nThat effectively held Target hostage: The company was forced to make an impossible choice to either safeguard its employees and stores or continue to support customers who wanted to buy the products it was selling.\n\nIn the end, Target opted to protect employee safety by removing certain items that it said caused the most \"volatile\" reaction from opponents.\n\nBut Target's response angered LGBTQ advocates and led to criticism that it was caving to extreme elements of American society.\n\n\"Target should put the products back on the shelves and ensure their Pride displays are visible on the floors, not pushed into the proverbial closet. That's what the bullies want,\" said Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights group. \"Target must be better.\"\n\nLike Bud Light before it, Target ended up alienating just about everyone in the process with its response.\n\nTarget became the focus of the anti-LGBTQ campaign's ire for its Pride Month merchandise, but the campaign misrepresented Target's ambitions.\n\nTarget, one of the largest retailers in the country, was selling Pride-themed merchandise to customers who wanted to buy them. It's capitalism and ultimately a business decision in the interest of enriching Target's shareholders.\n\nYoram Wind, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said Target was trying to reach a growing LGBTQ market of customers and employees. Around 7% of Americans identified as LGBTQ in 2021, according to Gallup , up from 3.5% in 2012.\n\n\"It's helping us drive sales, it's building greater engagement with both our teams and our guests, and those are just the right things for our business today,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell told Fortune last month of the company's diversity and inclusion initiatives .\n\nThe campaign made other false claims, including that Target was marketing one product for transgender adults to children. Target sold a women's swimsuit that was described as \"tuck friendly\" for its ability to conceal male genitalia. The bathing suit was available for adults only, according to screenshots of the items taken when they were available online.\n\nRelated article Anheuser-Busch loses top LGBTQ+ rating over its Bud Light response\n\nOpponents also highlighted Target's products made by trans designer Erik Carnell, who has designed merchandise with images of horned skulls and symbols of Satan. Target did not sell any of these products. For Target, the UK designer said on Instagram he created a bag, tote and sweatshirt for adults with messages such as \"We Belong Everywhere,\" \"Too Queer for Here,\" and \"Cure Transphobia.\" Misinformation spread that his Target collection was for children.\n\nThose products were just a handful of the approximately 2,000 in Target's Pride Month collection, such as shirts, coffee mugs and stationary.\n\nTarget on Wednesday said in a statement it was removing \"items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.\" The company said it experienced threats that impacted employees' sense of safety and well-being.\n\nThe company told the Wall Street Journal that people have confronted workers in stores, knocked down Pride merchandise displays and put threatening posts on social media with video from inside stores.\n\n\"Our focus now is on moving forward with our continuing commitment to the LGBTQIA+ community and standing with them as we celebrate Pride Month and throughout the year,\" Target said in its statement.\n\nBut Target's response has frustrated supporters of gay and transgender rights, who argued the company caved to bigoted pressure.\n\n\"CEO of Target Brian Cornell selling out the LGBTQ+ community to extremists is a real profile in courage,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Tuesday.\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, the president of advocacy group GLAAD, said that corporate leaders must step up for their LGBTQ employees and consumers and \"not cave to fringe activists calling for censorship.\"\n\nMore brands are being caught in cultural issues in part because of social media.\n\n\"It's always been best practice in my view for brands to stay away from super controversial issues that are not directly related to their business,\"  said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. \"The problem is that today there are many issues that are controversial.\"\n\nThe campaign against Target comes amid a record number of anti-LBGT bills introduced in statehouses this year and escalating political attacks on transgender people by leading Republican candidates for president.\n\nCompanies such as Bud Light and Nike have also been targeted over promotional campaigns featuring transgender people.\n\nDisney has also been caught in a protracted fight with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis stemming from legislation he  signed that prohibits teachers from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity in class, known by critics as \"Don't Say Gay.\"\n\nAnd the Los Angeles Dodgers this week also reversed course and extended a new invitation to a drag group after earlier disinviting them from the team's upcoming Pride Night at Dodger Stadium.\n\nAlthough Target was acting to protect employees, some corporate marketing experts say the company's response could embolden gay and transgender rights opponents to target other brands.\n\nThey questioned why Target couldn't attempt other solutions, such as beefing up store security or trying to educate customers and employees, before pulling the products altogether.\n\n\"It does seem like you're caving into a bully,\" said Paul Argenti, a professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth University's Tuck School of Business. \"It sets a dangerous precedent.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "When a conservative podcaster came to campus, students did not want to listen\n\nAt sunset on a beautiful spring evening on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh last week, conservative podcaster Michael Knowles was burned in effigy. Police lights flashed on several street corners, and a firetruck waited nearby. Protesters chanted, backed by drummers. An incendiary device was set off.\n\nThe cause of the furor was an event set for later that evening, when Knowles was invited to debate, \"Should Transgenderism Be Regulated By Law?\"\n\nStudent protests like this one have prompted older generations to question whether kids these days no longer have the appetite to debate controversial issues on campus, and whether these protests are somehow different than those of the past over the Iraq War, the Vietnam War, gay rights, civil rights and women's suffrage.\n\nKnowles is best known for a single line delivered in a speech at CPAC earlier this year: \"Transgenderism needs to be eradicated in public life entirely.\" Knowles asserted that the idea someone can be transgender is \"a delusional vision of human nature\" and that \"for the good of the poor people who\" think they are trans, that idea must be removed from the discourse. (The American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization say being transgender is not a mental disorder.)\n\nKnowles said he only meant \"transgender ideology\" should be eradicated, not trans people, whom he says are affected by a delusion. Protesters at Pitt did not find that persuasive.\n\n\"Eradicating transgenderism is just saying, 'We want to eradicate trans people,' because transgenderism isn't a thing. It doesn't exist. There isn't a trans ideology. There is just the existence of people who are trans,\" said Pip Mostern, a trans student at Pitt, who was demonstrating against the Knowles event.\n\nChrystal, another protester at Pitt who did not share a last name with CNN, said: \"If someone wants to inflict harm on you, are you going to debate them inflicting harm on you? No.\" Chrystal added: \"Why should someone be able to come in and tell me I don't deserve to exist? I'm not trying to walk up to someone who's Christian and tell them that they don't deserve to exist for being Christian.\"\n\nInside the building where the debate was to be held, Josh Minsky, vice president of Pitt College Republicans, stood behind his group's invitation to Knowles. \"He's very articulate, he's intelligent,\" Minsky said of Knowles. \"He should be able to speak and have freedom of speech. And sadly, that's kind of being shut down in modern society, as we can see outside.\"\n\nKnowles did get to speak at the event, which was sponsored by the conservative Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI), after police escorted protesters out of the debate hall. The opposition to his appearance came the same month as similar student demonstrations against conservative speakers just this month at universities in Iowa, Utah and New York.\n\nLast month, Stanford University law students heckled a federal judge over his record on trans rights when he came for a speaking engagement. The law school's dean, Jenny Martinez, released a public, 10-page letter scolding the students for their lack of decorum. \"Some students might feel that some points should not be up for argument ... but however appealing that position might be in some other context, it is incompatible with the training that must be delivered in a law school,\" Martinez wrote.\n\nMartinez declined CNN's request for an interview.\n\nConstitutional law scholar Mary Anne Franks said that universities should give students the opportunity to comment on proposed speakers before they're officially invited - and debate whether they'll lead to valuable intellectual discourse, or spectacle. These events are often sponsored by outside groups like ISI, and for them, Franks says, spectacle can be the point.\n\n\"It's a deliberate strategy on the part of these organizations to try to find a controversial speaker, try to provoke the liberal students into having a reaction, and making sure all of that gets filmed and edited in a certain way that makes those students look as bad as possible,\" she said.\n\nFranks is a professor at the University of Miami School of Law who argues that some conservatives and liberals are free speech fundamentalists who use the First Amendment the same way religious fundamentalists use the Bible, which undermines the integrity of the entire Constitution. She thinks that portraying the recent campus protests as threats to free speech is misleading.\n\n\"When someone backs you into a corner and says, 'I don't like your ideas,' the easiest thing for you to say is, 'Oh? Well, that's because you don't like my free speech. It's because you want to censor me,'\" Franks said. \"It's really the coward's way of trying to deal with any argument. Your answer should be, 'Here's why my ideas are interesting, and why they're important,' not invoking some kind of quasi-constitutional gloss for what you have to say.\"\n\nConservative groups including ISI and Young America's Foundation (YAF) have been involved in helping college groups put on some of the events that have become contentious.\n\nYAF has posted videos on YouTube with titles such as \"LOL: Michael Knowles SCHOOLS Woke Student Who Claimed Transgenderism Is Indigenous,\" and \"EPIC TAKEDOWN: Matt Walsh CRUSHES Woke Student Who Claims Gender Affirming Care Is 'Life-Saving.'\"\n\nYAF spokesperson Michael McGonigle said it was not his organization's strategy to make students who disagreed with their ideas look bad. \"Our strategy is to bring engaging speakers onto campus with different viewpoints, and that students want to hear from,\" McGonigle said. \"Folks like Ben Shapiro, or Michael Knowles, or Matt Walsh, they have kind of a standing rule in that they ask for anybody that has a differing viewpoint to be brought to the front of the line so that they can engage in a conversation with them. They want to engage in healthy exchange of ideas.\"\n\nRelated article Former college swimmer says she was assaulted at an event opposing the inclusion of trans women in women's sports\n\nJohnny Burtka, president of the Delaware-based non-profit ISI, said: \"We do not have an institutional strategy to provoke backlash from liberal students.\" Most of ISI's events were not about social issues, and did not spark protest, he said. \"We have interesting speakers. Sometimes they're provocative speakers, but they're wrestling with important questions.\"\n\nAt Pitt, Knowles was scheduled to appear with Deirdre McCloskey, an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and trans woman. But a week before the event, McCloskey pulled out. She told CNN, \"He's not a serious person on these matters. He doesn't know what he's talking about. He's an agitator. He wants to arouse hatred.\"\n\nMcCloskey criticized students who did not want Knowles to speak at all, and she drew a distinction between not wanting him to speak and not wanting to debate him.\n\n\"It's the old problem: Do you debate White nationalists? Do you debate fascists? Do you debate communists, for that matter?\" she said. \"The trouble is that if you do, you convey the feeling that they have something to say which you take seriously. I don't take seriously his opinions.\"\n\nAfter McCloskey dropped out, ISI offered trans writer Charlotte Clymer $10,000 to debate Knowles.\n\nClymer said no, explaining that she did not believe Knowles would engage in good faith but try to provoke an emotional reaction. \"If he can get me to look angry, he's won already,\" she said. \"His goal is to get viral videos of people who get angry with him, and then use those for his own profit. If he can make people who aren't comfortable with trans folks feel entertained, they'll give him money.\"\n\nFinally, gay libertarian podcaster Brad Polumbo agreed to debate Knowles. Asked by a Pitt student how much he got paid, Polumbo said \"a lot\" and rubbed his fingers together.\n\nIn an essay published by Newsweek after the event, Polumbo called the protesters a mob and said that he was scared for his life. Polumbo wrote, \"I ended up dispensing with my planned introduction and instead ad-libbing an admonition to those who sought to shut down the debate to 'grow the hell up.'\"\n\nThe essay did not discuss the substance of the debate, though Polumbo noted, \"I was quite literally there to defend trans rights.\"\n\nKnowles, through a spokesperson, declined CNN's request for an interview.\n\nAfter the event, he tweeted about the protesters, or retweeted tweets about them, more than 20 times. ISI tweeted, \"The protestors tried to stop it but @michaeljknowles and @brad_polumbo did not back down.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled Johnny Burtka's last name.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nDonald Trump's media allies are demanding retribution in the wake of his conviction .\n\nFollowing weeks of attacks targeting the historic hush money case against the former president, prominent right-wing media figures immediately flooded the public discourse Thursday with extreme and disturbing rhetoric after Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts.\n\nOn Fox News and other right-wing outlets, pro-Trump media personalities erupted in anger, blaming everyone from Judge Juan Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to President Joe Biden and the entire U.S. justice system for the \"disgraceful\" conviction.\n\nWhile not surprising, the furious bluster reverberating across right-wing media still carried its intended effect, burning away public trust in America's core institutions and leaving a lasting impact on the legitimacy of the rule of law in the United States.\n\nThe toxic commentary is also enflaming desires of retribution held by Trump supporters, with popular right-wing media figures openly declaring their hope that the GOP candidate to nakedly seek revenge against his critics, should he emerge victorious in November and return to the Oval Office.\n\nIndeed, it is not only that MAGA Media personalities are assailing the guilty verdict returned by a jury of 12 New Yorkers, calling it unfair and rigged. Some of the right's most popular talking heads are openly calling for the weaponization of government to seek retribution against Trump's political opponents.\n\nRelated article Trump conviction heralds a somber and volatile moment in American history\n\nThe Daily Wire's Matt Walsh, who commands a following of millions of subscribers on YouTube and social media, said after the verdict that Trump \"should make and publish a list of ten high ranking Democrat criminals who he will have arrested when he takes office.\" The Federalist chief executive Sean Davis said he wants \"to see lists of which Democrat officials are going to be put in prison.\" And Fox News' Jesse Watters declared, \"We're going to vanquish the evil forces that are destroying this republic.\"\n\nSuffice to say, that unhinged, reckless, and dangerous rhetoric is not normal. And it even exceeds some of the highly charged rhetoric that played out during Trump's administration when then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller probed the then-president over his ties to Russia. But as the legal walls actually begin to close in on Trump, the commentary in right-wing media is getting angrier, more menacing, and taking a markedly darker tone.\n\nIn the hours after the verdict was handed down Thursday, talk of the United States having transformed into a third-world dictatorship was the norm in pro-Trump media, with the term \"banana republic\" regularly tossed around. In fact, there was little room for disagreement with the radical and warped viewpoint.\n\n\"Import the Third World, become the Third World. That's what we just saw,\" right-wing extremist Tucker Carlson declared on X. \"This won't stop Trump. He'll win the election if he's not killed first. But it does mark the end of the fairest justice system in the world. Anyone who defends this verdict is a danger to you and your family.\"\n\nAs has become the new normal, Fox News also promoted a parade of dishonest right-wing talking points to its sizable audience. Laura Ingraham declared that \"the Democrats are showing [the country] what real power is ... the type of power we usually see dictators exercise in China and Cuba and North Korea.\" Sean Hannity complained that \"the foundation of our constitutional republic\" is \"literally dying before your eyes.\"\n\nThat rhetoric is, obviously, detached from reality. The United States is not a third world country. Trump got his day in court and was treated by the judge, by all accounts, quite fairly. Biden did not direct so-called deep state forces to engage in \"lawfare\" against Trump.\n\nBut the endless streams of poison flooding into the public discourse comes with consequences. It not only offers a preview of just how ugly the 2024 race will soon become, it sets the stage for Trump, if he manages to make his way back into the White House, to abuse power and deform the federal institutions to serve his purposes.\n\nPerversely, it has primed a swath of Americans into believing that such behavior would not only be warranted, but necessary .\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

His defeat of Kamala Harris is raising questions about the media's credibility, influence, and audience. Some of the questions might not be answerable for years.\n\nBut journalists are asking each other: What does this \"red wave\" election say about the information environment in the United States?\n\nIn the hours after Trump won reelection Tuesday, some of his loyalists asserted that his victory is a complete repudiation of the news media. For a time on Wednesday morning, The Federalist's lead headline was not about Trump, it was about the \"corporate media industrial complex\" being \"2024's biggest loser.\"\n\nLegacy media \"is officially dead,\" The Daily Wire podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X overnight. \"Their ability to set the narrative has been destroyed. Trump declared war on the media in 2016. Tonight he vanquished them completely. They will never be relevant again.\"\n\nThat's wishful thinking on Walsh's part - Tuesday's marathon election coverage was a testament to the media's relevance - but the point is that many Trump voters share his wish. They believe the national news media is a big part of what ails America. Not only do they distrust what they read, they often don't read it in the first place. Can anything be done to change that?\n\nA quote in a recent New York magazine column channeled that question. The quote, from an anonymous TV executive, was recirculated on social media Wednesday morning. \"If half the country has decided that Trump is qualified to be president, that means they're not reading any of this media, and we've lost this audience completely,\" the executive said. \"A Trump victory means mainstream media is dead in its current form. And the question is what does it look like after.\"\n\nRelated article Trump campaign denies and revokes journalists' election night credentials after critical coverage\n\n\"Dead\" is gross hyperbole, of course, but the comment reflected real concerns that many members of the media have. A severe trust deficit exists between the Trump base and big institutional media outlets. In a text message, a Trump campaign aide suggested that the press should show more humility.\n\nThat raises another question: Do major networks and publications have enough columnists and commentators who reflect the Trump majority's views?\n\n\"Maybe we have a point,\" the aide remarked. \"Maybe 'misinformation' is a lazy word that was never applied to press coverage of Biden's health or the border. Maybe 'offensive' things aren't offensive to most.\"\n\nThe mainstream media \"has held less clout every four years,\" Semafor's Dave Weigel wrote Wednesday morning. \"On Harris-friendly cable news, ex-Republicans broadcast their horror at who Trump was and what he'd done; in the new social media and podcasts favored by Republicans, all of that was whining disconnected from what voters really cared about.\"\n\nCNN political commentator Scott Jennings hit that point hard during the 3 a.m. hour of CNN's election coverage. He said Trump's win was \"something of an indictment of the political information complex.\"\n\n\"We have been sitting around for the last couple weeks and the story that was portrayed was not true,\" Jennings said. \"We were told Puerto Rico was going to change the election. Liz Cheney, Nikki Haley voters, women lying to their husbands. Before that it was Tim Walz and the camo hats. Night after night after night we were told all these things and gimmicks were going to somehow push Harris over the line. And we were just ignoring the fundamentals. Inflation; people feeling like they are barely able to tread water at best; those were the fundamentals of the election.\"\n\nJennings added: \"I think for all of us who cover elections and talk about elections and do this on a day-to-day basis, we have to figure out how to understand talk to and listen to the half of the country that rose up tonight and said, 'We have had enough.'\"\n\nLiberal commentator Ashley Allison responded: \"I think we have to listen to everybody, actually.\" She said, \"the people who voted for Kamala Harris are struggling too. They are feeling ignored too. A Republican's pain is no greater or less than a Democrat's pain.\"\n\nIf history is any guide, Trump is never, ever satisfied with news coverage. He always wants a more pliant, propagandistic media. He even complains about Fox News on a regular basis, despite the network's overwhelming support for him. Last month, he complained to Fox patriarch Rupert Murdoch about the network airing Democratic ads.\n\nThus, Trump's reelection portends a new period of hostility with major media outlets that strive for impartiality as well as partisan outlets that oppose him. This raises another set of questions.\n\nWill the Trump administration turn his words against the press into actions? Will he move to revoke licenses for TV stations, as he has suggested more than a dozen times this year? Will he limit press access to the White House, barring reporters he doesn't like?\n\nFurther, will media outlets engage in self-censoring to appease Trump, and if so, how will readers and viewers who oppose Trump react?\n\nOn Wednesday morning, newsroom leaders and owners are reassuring employees that they will have their backs in the uncertain months to come. \"Now, more than ever, we are steadfast in our mission to uphold the principles of independent journalism,\" Conde Nast chief Roger Lynch wrote in a memo to staffers. \"A thriving, independent press, as protected by the First Amendment, is vital to democracy and the future we all share.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nPrepare yourself for a Pride Month imbued with callous intolerance.\n\nFueled by right-wing media personalities and institutions like Fox News, conservatives are waging a ferocious war on companies that express support for the LGBTQ community, with hostilities against the celebration of gay rights swelling to levels not seen in many years. In effect, the supposedly anti-cancel culture crowd is leading the summer's biggest cancel culture campaign.\n\nIn recent weeks, right-wing media has smeared and incited boycotts against Bud Light and Target , two jumbo American brands that have been thrust into the center of the toxic culture wars. Both companies have been relentlessly attacked over their show of public support for the LGBTQ community. In recent days, The North Face, Kohl's, and Chick-fil-A have also come under assault in the expanding war. And Disney, of course, has been an endless punching bag since it spoke out against the so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" bill in Florida last year.\n\nIn the right-wing media universe, in which millions of Americans firmly reside, these companies have been portrayed as \"woke\" and evil corporations seeking to groom children with radical - even Satantic - gender ideology that will corrupt their brains and ultimately lead to the destruction of society.\n\nThe attacks have put companies in the uncomfortable position of standing up for the values of their own employees and the public writ large against a relentless volley of threats of mass boycotts, lost revenue, and ultimately, long-term brand harm. With each offensive - and claimed victories - the activists wielding the pitchforks have become more emboldened and the business atmosphere more chilled.\n\nWritten in black and white, the attacks look deranged. But it is precisely what some of the loudest and most influential right-wing media figures are promoting to their large followings, with new self-generated outrage cycles generated daily. It isn't quite QAnon, but it's close - and it is being fed to the GOP base in broad daylight. You don't have to go to the dark corners of the internet to find this style of crazed commentary; it's available each day via mainstream right-wing outlets.\n\nIn many cases, prominent personalities are not even trying to be secretive about their end goal as they perhaps would have been done in years past. In fact, they are saying the quiet part aloud. The Daily Wire's Matt Walsh, one of the leading purveyors of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in the US, has explicitly stated that the aim is to make the open embrace of the LGBTQ community harmful to brands.\n\n\"The goal is to make 'pride' toxic for brands,\" Walsh tweeted. \"If they decide to shove this garbage in our face, they should know that they'll pay a price. It won't be worth whatever they think they'll gain. First Bud Light and now Target. Our campaign is making progress. Let's keep it going.\"\n\nIt is important to remember that a not-so-insignificant portion of the American populace takes this rhetoric to heart. For the conservative news organizations and businesses that promote it, the rhetoric is profitable because it resonates with and excites their audiences. The articles generate clicks, videos attract eyeballs, and the content in general prompts significant engagement - the lifeblood of the internet.\n\nWhich is to say that this burgeoning facet of the culture wars, which is now unquestionably the most dominant strain, is not going away any time soon. In fact, with Pride Month about to get underway, and more brands showing their support for the LGBTQ community, expect more fronts to open up. As the right-wing media personalities leading this campaign have said: Bud Light and Target were just the beginning.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign released a statement Wednesday, signed by more than 100 advocacy organizations and allies, condemning the right's use of the \"extremist playbook of attacks.\"\n\n\"Their goal is clear: to prevent LGBTQ+ inclusion and representation, silence our allies and make our community invisible,\" the coalition said. \"These attacks fuel hate against LGBTQ+ people, just as we've seen this year with more than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills that restrict basic freedoms and aim to erase LGBTQ+ people.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

The online outlet has stood by her over the years, despite her penchant for trafficking in extremist and dishonest rhetoric.\n\nBut since the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel, Owens has repeatedly waded into antisemitic waters as she fiercely criticized Israel, suggesting the Jewish government was committing \"genocide\" in Gaza and claiming there is a sinister \"small ring\" of Jewish people in Hollywood and Washington, DC involved in something \"quite sinister.\"\n\nIn November, Shapiro, who is Jewish, called out Owens for her \"disgraceful\" rhetoric, blasting her \"faux sophistication\" on the topic.\n\nWithout directly naming Shapiro, Owens responded that one \"cannot serve both God and money,\" a brazen dig at The Daily Wire co-founder that was drenched in an age-old antisemitic trope.\n\nAt the time, Shapiro hit back, \"Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit.\"\n\nOwens then attacked Shapiro in an interview with Tucker Carlson, the right-wing extremist who was fired last year from Fox News, accusing him of \"ad hominem attacks.\"\n\nIn recent days, Owens has continued to generate more controversy, liking a post on X in which a user accused a rabbi of being \"drunk on Christian blood.\"\n\nOwens' behavior earned her the praise of those pushing hatred of the Jewish community, which the Anti-Defamation League noted Thursday when it blasted her for pushing \"an antisemitic agenda\" and fueling \"the fire of hate.\"\n\nOwens responded by accusing the ADL of having \"turned their smear merchant guns\" on her.\n\n\"Their attacks will have the opposite desired effect,\" Owens said. \"Awaken world.\"\n\nWhile Owens will no longer have a home at The Daily Wire, she still maintains a large platform. Her extremist commentary has catapulted her to fame in right-wing circles and she boasts millions of followers across her various social media accounts. In September, she was suspended from YouTube for her anti-LGBTQ commentary after violating the platform's rules on hate speech.\n\nOwens has long been a supporter of former President Donald Trump, amplifying his culture warrior rhetoric to her younger, online audience. \"I truly believe that Donald Trump isn't just the leader of the free world, but the savior of it as well,\" she wrote in a social media post in 2018.\n\nLast month, she was photographed with Trump at a UFC event in Las Vegas. \"It's fight night,\" she wrote in a photo caption. \"Fighters only.\"\n\nThe Daily Wire's slate of hosts are no stranger to controversy and have frequently promoted anti-LGBTQ themes and tropes. Matt Walsh, another extremist commentator employed by the Nashville-based company, has demonized gay and transgender people on his program, calling for doctors who perform gender affirming care to be imprisoned or executed.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "LGBTQ+ brand creator 'relieved' after Target pulls his items off shelves due to online backlash\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nWhen a Target distributor reached out to Erik Carnell last year about possibly placing his brand, Abprallen, in Target stores, he was thrilled.\n\nIt was \"the biggest opportunity of my career,\" Carnell told CNN. \"I was ecstatic at the thought of being able to share my stuff with an entirely new market.\" The London-based Abprallen, described on its Instagram page as \"art and accessories for the proud, loud, and colourful,\" would go from a small startup to a brand available at a major US retailer.\n\nIn the following months, Carnell pitched Target and came up with designs that would be appropriate for the big box store, he said. Ultimately, Target started selling three Abprallen items for adults: A sweatshirt, a tote bag and a messenger bag, each emblazoned with a different phrase.\n\nBut then things fell apart. About a week and a half ago, Carnell said, he started receiving hundreds of hateful messages including death threats, some of them incorrectly saying the collection was being marketed to children, as some people lashed out at Target over its Pride offerings.\n\nBy Wednesday, Target had pulled Abprallen items from its US stores and online market , Reuters reported.\n\n\"Since introducing this year's collection, we've experienced threats impacting our team members' sense of safety and wellbeing while at work,\" Target said in a statement about this year's Pride collection.\n\n\"Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior,\" Target said.\n\nCarnell's immediate reaction was relief.\n\n\"The amount of backlash that I have gotten has been overwhelming,\" he said. \"I just hope that this is the beginning of the end of the messages and the onslaught that I'm getting.\"\n\nBut for a small brand, losing access to Target's massive reach is a blow.\n\n\"When this has all died down, I'm going to be incredibly disappointed that such a huge opportunity was taken away from me.\"\n\nBut Carnell understands Target's decision regarding his line.\n\n\"I don't know what, other than pulling it, could be done to help protect the retail employees,\" he said. \"Their safety absolutely has to be the top priority.\"\n\nStill, Carnell is disappointed that Target wasn't more communicative with him about the decision. Though he's heard from a distributor he was working with, he hasn't received any word from the corporate office, he said.\n\nTarget did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nAbprallen was born out of Carnell's affinity for drawing and a desire to connect with his queer community.\n\n\"I created a couple of pins about six years ago, and it's grown since then,\" he said. For Carnell, the work is personal.\n\n\"I take what I do incredibly seriously,\" he said. \"I owe it to my younger self, who was so lost and in so much pain ... I owe it to him to create stuff that he could be proud of, stuff that tells him that who he is is not wrong. That who he is is wonderful,\" he said.\n\nWhen Carnell, who is trans, thinks about his younger self he recalls a time \"when I was a child and desperately wished that I was a boy, and didn't realize that there was a way I could do that.\" Carnell knows his experience was not isolated. \"There are so many people out there like him,\" he said, referring to his younger self.\n\nWith Abprallen, Carnell wanted to create Pride items that were more than \"just a rainbow slapped haphazardly on a T-shirt.\"\n\nAbprallen sells shirts, elaborate pins and other accessories that juxtapose pastel blues, pinks and purples with skulls, skeletons and UFOs. The images are paired with a variety of phrases, like \" Transphobia sucks \" and \" Gay icon .\" Some are in direct conversation with specific incidents, like \" Witches & wizards love trans people ,\" a response to Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling's heavily criticized comments about trans people .\n\nBut one design sparked an uproar online.\n\nThe backlash against Carnell and Abprallen has largely centered around a design that says \"Satan respects pronouns.\" Online, an anti-LGBTQ campaign urged a boycott of Target, showing images of the phrase on an Abprallen T-shirt. On TikTok, a video circulated showing an employee being asked if she supports \"satanic Pride propaganda.\" Carnell has been called a Satanist in the right-wing press .\n\nBut that particular design was never available at Target.\n\nIn early conversations, the retailer told Carnell that the \"Satan respects pronouns,\" design would not be a good fit, he said. The designs that ended up for sale are of a more neutral tone, with the phrases \"Cure transphobia, not trans people,\" \"We belong everywhere,\" and \"Too queer for here.\"\n\nStill, Carnell was not surprised when the partnership caused a backlash (though he didn't expect it to be this bad).\n\n\"I'm not naive. I absolutely knew that there would be negativity thrown my way,\" he said. \"I understand that people are incredibly passionate with their hatred towards LGBT people. And the current political climate is one that tells those people that they are correct to feel that way,\" he said.\n\nOn Twitter, right-wing commentator Matt Walsh described a targeted campaign that goes beyond Abprallen or Carnell. \"The goal is to make 'pride' toxic for brands,\" he said. \"If they decide to shove this garbage in our face, they should know that they'll pay a price. It won't be worth whatever they think they'll gain.\"\n\nThe virulent language, plus the threats reported by Target, come at a time when trans rights are under attack in the United States. Over 400 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in state legislatures this year through April 3, according to American Civil Liberties Union , including ones restricting access to gender-affirming care for trans youth. Transgender people are more than four times as likely to be victims of violent crime than cisgender people, according to a study from the UCLA School of Law .\n\nFor direct-to-consumer brands, a partnership with a major retailer is often \"the holy grail,\" said Ian Schatzberg, co-founder of the branding agency General Idea, which works with large and small brands. \"It's very expensive to run a DTC business,\" he said. \"The role that the retailer plays in the lives of these brands is really critical to their success.\"\n\nGenerally, \"if they lose distribution, they could lose their business,\" said Schatzberg, adding that large retailers are \"vital\" for small online brands.\n\nRelated article Target is being held hostage by an anti-LGBTQ campaign\n\nFor LGBTQ+ brands, space on retail shelves is \"a source of financial existence, and also of pride and visibility,\" said Schatzberg. General Idea is an LGBTQ-owned business, he noted. \"If you are removed, it creates not just an effect on that business owner, but it creates an effect on the community.\"\n\nBefore Target, Carnell, who runs Abprallen by himself, sold Abprallen products online, as well as in some markets and to some wholesale clients, he said.\n\nOne silver lining of the attention has been a spike in support, financial and emotional. The Abprallen site has gotten so many orders that he temporarily closed the virtual store in order to catch up.\n\n\"I've been inundated with support,\" he said, including \"so many beautiful, compassionate, loving messages,\" he said. \"And when I'm in a better head space, I know how much that's going to have a positive impact on me.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "3 people say they were tricked into appearing in anti-trans film 'What Is a Woman?'\n\nBREAKING: Liverpool clinches the Premier League title with a win over Tottenham\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThree people who appeared in a viral documentary that criticizes the transgender community said they were tricked into being interviewed for the movie, titled \"What Is a Woman?\"\n\nThe filmmakers' alleged sleight-of-hand tactics contradict the movie's promise to be a \" fearless \" examination of the modern gender debate, and the tactics appear to show the lengths to which some conservative activists have gone to try to cast doubt on the rights of trans people.\n\nThe video debuted in June 2022 to little fanfare but received wide attention on Twitter last month with the help of tech billionaire and Twitter owner Elon Musk, who reversed the platform's previous restrictions on the movie and allowed it to be uploaded and shared on the platform. He then promoted it on his own account, writing, \"Every parent should watch this.\" Twitter's previous management had a rule against degrading behavior or other hateful content.\n\nThe movie has since marked more than 187 million views on Twitter alone and been endlessly memed and recycled among conservatives, making it another major flashpoint in a nationwide conflict over transgender rights that's also playing out in state legislatures , public libraries and courthouses.\n\nBut three people who participated in the film's production by sitting for interviews told NBC News that its producers misrepresented how it would portray transgender topics and that they were unwittingly inserted into \"gotcha\" moments with right-wing provocateur Matt Walsh, who narrated and starred in the film. Two of the three people provided copies of emails in which a producer, Rebecca Dobkowitz, used flattering language and wrote that the documentary would bring to light the challenges facing trans people.\n\n\"What Is a Woman?\" ended up very different from that pitch.\n\nIt includes repeated attacks on trans people, with Walsh at one point calling them part of an \"insane ideological cult,\" even as the  95-minute movie employs some methods of documentary filmmaking such as formal interviews.\n\nFew who watched the movie likely knew about the tactics used to make it.\n\nWith its popularity online, the film has spread myths about sexuality and gender, including the debunked rumor that some children are identifying as cats and using litter boxes at school.\n\nDobkowitz did not respond to requests for comment via email, text and voicemail. Walsh did not respond to requests for comment sent to the conservative website The Daily Wire, which backed the film and where he has a podcast and column.\n\nWalsh said in January 2022, while the movie was in production, that he had a plan for \"waging an all out assault on gender ideology.\"\n\n\"People see that gender ideology is toxic and insane. We have the numbers to fight back and destroy it. All we need is the will to do what's necessary,\" he said on Twitter .\n\nDr. Marci Bowers, a California surgeon whose patients include trans women, said she first heard from Dobkowitz in July 2021. The producer emailed her with what seemed like a friendly request for a documentary about transgender people and the \"challenges they face in today's culture,\" according to a copy of the email that she provided to NBC News.\n\n\"Since you are a leading expert and professional in this field, we would love to interview and hear your insights,\" Dobkowitz wrote.\n\nBowers said she felt Dobkowitz was hiding her intentions with the \"completely deceptive\" email.\n\n\"I didn't really know about Matt's conservative credentials,\" she said of Walsh. \"They sugarcoated it just a little bit. They didn't give me an indication of what it would really be about, but they did give me the title of the video.\"\n\nThe movie includes footage of an interview with Bowers and with two other people, who told NBC News that they felt they were deceived: Dr. Michelle Forcier, a Brown University professor, and Naia Ōkami, a trans woman who lives in Washington state. In the movie, Forcier talks about the process children go through in learning about gender, and Ōkami talks about a different subject entirely - her affinity for wolves - as Walsh tries to make a link between animals and trans people.\n\nWhile documentary filmmakers such as Michael Moore often use edgy tactics to advance a specific point of view, the use of deception to obtain an interview is generally frowned upon, especially when the subject is a person vulnerable to harassment, according to a 2009 report from American University based on interviews with 45 professional filmmakers and producers.\n\nBut in recent years, subterfuge has been popularized by right-wing figures such as James O'Keefe , who founded the hidden-camera outfit Project Veritas.\n\nThe tactics that Walsh's team allegedly employed were already somewhat known within the trans community when the movie was in production. In February 2022, Eli Erlick, a trans rights advocate, published a Twitter thread alleging that Walsh's team had reached out to her for an interview using a fake name and a front organization called the Gender Unity Project.\n\nAt the time, Walsh did not respond to media inquiries about his methods, including from BuzzFeed News and Insider .\n\nThe tactics now seem to be spreading. Erlick said that a second right-wing figure, Robby Starbuck, recently tried to recruit her under false pretenses for another documentary-style video called \"It Takes a Village.\" She posted emails to Twitter.\n\n\"The style of Matt's film is going to be replicated,\" Erlick said in a phone interview. \"I think they're using it as a model for a new form of far-right disinformation masquerading as a documentary.\"\n\nStarbuck did not respond to emailed requests for comment. He told Rolling Stone in an email last month that trans rights activists were misrepresenting the subject of the documentary he is working on. He told the magazine that his documentary will not involve any \"unethical editing,\" that no one \"of either political side has been upset about their interview,\" and that he is taking a \"fair and honorable approach to each individual.\"\n\nBy the time Erlick revealed Walsh's tactics last year, Bowers, Forcier and Ōkami had already been interviewed by Walsh.\n\nWhen Ōkami heard from Walsh's staff in September 2021, she was already experienced in media appearances , so she pressed Dobkowitz for more information on the project.\n\nDobkowitz wrote back using the same email account she used to contact Bowers. \"This documentary will explore the challenges the transgender and LGBTQIA+ face in today's culture, as well as advancements in transgender care and gender/sex affirmation surgery,\" she wrote.\n\n\"We are coming from the position that as more attention is given to the transgender community, it's critical that accurate information is available to the public,\" she went on.\n\nIn the movie, Walsh did not use phrases such as \"transgender care\" and \"affirmation surgery\" - terms that support trans rights - and instead referred to some such treatments as \"chemical castration.\"\n\nŌkami said she would not have done the interview if Walsh's staff had been forthcoming with their perspective. In the movie, Walsh mocks Ōkami for her spiritual and psychological connection with wolves , something that is not connected to her being transgender. Opponents of trans rights often raise the alarmist and false idea that transgender identity is somehow encouraging people to identify as animals.\n\n\"It was complete fraud in my opinion,\" Ōkami said. \"He wanted to use me to make us look ridiculous, to make us look sensational.\" She said she spoke with an attorney about potential recourse but was told there was little she could do because she had signed a general release form provided by Walsh's staff.\n\nForcier, a professor of pediatrics at Brown University, said she got an email from Walsh's staff that she thought was a sincere inquiry about the science of puberty blockers.\n\n\"I said, 'sure.' Learning about blockers is really important, and I'm always trying to be available to talk about the science and help people understand,\" she said. For everyone, she said, \"I think there's room for growth, in terms of both individual and larger cultural understanding.\"\n\nForcier said she felt pressured to sign a release form before she knew much more.\n\n\"They said they needed the release before they made the effort to come down from Canada,\" she said. \"There were definitely some pressure tactics: Sign this so we can use the footage.\" She said she hasn't been able to find copies of the emails.\n\nThe interview - part of which Walsh later posted online - didn't last long, Forcier said. A few minutes in, Walsh compared gender dysphoria to believing in Santa Claus and compared puberty blockers to \"chemical castration.\" Forcier ended the interview.\n\n\"I thought, 'This is not what I thought this was going to be,'\" she said. \"I thought, 'This is now a gotcha video, and I was not quite informed about what's going to be happening today.'\"\n\n\"He was getting frustrated because I just wouldn't say some of the things he wanted me to say,\" she added.  Forcier said she tried to get in touch with Walsh's staff afterward to learn more and to ask to see the video. She said they didn't respond.\n\nDoctors who provide transgender care and their allies have been the targets of misinformation campaigns organized on social media for some time, and the promotion of the video whipped up even more of a cultural maelstrom and harassment of the people interviewed for it.\n\nForcier said she keeps a folder of the worst emails she gets in case she needs to send them to law enforcement later.\n\n\"People send really graphic, sexual, violent comments about me being a pediatric gender-care provider. It's way more graphic and sexual than any work I've done,\" she said. She shared excerpts with NBC News, including one email saying, \"I'm sure Lucifer has a nice warm seat waiting for you.\"\n\nBowers said that one person tracked down her daughter on Instagram and told the daughter she was going to hell. She said that she and her daughter try to take the harassment in stride and even joked about it on Mother's Day.\n\n\"I'd been at the front line for a long time, so I'm used to taking a lot of arrows, but we take those arrows and we send them back with kindness and truth,\" she said. Bowers is serving a two-year term as president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the medical group that writes the standards of care for trans health care.\n\nBowers said that she doesn't necessarily regret speaking to Walsh. She said her inclination is to talk to anyone and try to find common ground. But she said Walsh in the video came across to her as smug and arrogant.\n\n\"He edited it in a way that wasn't fair, so it doesn't leave people with any sort of knowledge or education. It just heightens their fears of trans people - to his and his viewers' loss,\" she said.\n\n\"Matt really is just a bully,\" she said.\n\nBowers said that she's undeterred. Her clinic near San Francisco offers surgery not only for transgender people, but also to victims of genital mutilation and other people needing gynecological services.\n\n\"I'm here helping people in three areas of medicine that are not covered by current services, so I'm pretty certain that I'm doing God's work. What is Matt Walsh doing but trying to return us to some 1950s simplified version of male and female?\" she said.\n\nForcier said that, like Bowers, she hasn't let up in her medical work and that, if anything, she now has more resolve.\n\n\"These are adults bullying and victimizing children,\" she said about Walsh and his supporters.\n\nDavid Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Right-wing influencers and media double down on anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in the wake of the Colorado shooting\n\nBREAKING: Liverpool clinches the Premier League title with a win over Tottenham\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nSome right-wing media figures and influencers have doubled down on the use of inflammatory rhetoric against the LGBTQ community in the wake of Saturday night's shooting at a Colorado gay club that killed five.\n\nThe rhetoric mirrors what LGBTQ advocates have warned about for months, most notably false claims that children are being sexualized or \"groomed\" by LGBTQ people and events . The Colorado shooter's motive is unknown, but the primary suspect Anderson Lee Aldrich is facing five counts of first-degree murder and five counts of bias-motivated crime-causing bodily injury, more commonly known as hate crimes . Aldrich's first court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday evening, Fox News host Tucker Carlson condemned the shooting, focusing on the suspect's reported history of making a bomb threat in 2021. Three minutes into his nearly 15-minute monologue, however, Carlson's show displayed a graphic reading \"STOP SEXUALIZING KIDS.\" On Tuesday evening, Carlson hosted a guest who said shootings would continue to happen \"until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children.\"\n\nAlejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic, said that the repetitive messaging from Carlson and others has opened the door for violence against LGBTQ people.\n\n\"The way they soften up the support for this kind of violence is essentially by making it seem morally justified in the minds of people who believe this,\" Caraballo said. \"The way they do this is by constantly painting LGBT people as pedophiles and groomers, and so people feel morally justified in carrying out this violence.\"\n\nSome well-followed accounts on social media that have routinely and misleadingly associated LGBTQ people with sexualizing children continued to do so in recent days.\n\nTim Pool, a conservative internet personality with 1.4 million followers on Twitter, targeted the venue, Club Q, where the shooting happened.\n\n\"We shouldn't tolerate pedophiles grooming kids,\" Pool tweeted. \"Club Q had a grooming event. How do prevent the violence and stop the grooming?\" Pool appeared to be referring to all-ages drag Sunday brunches that were being hosted at the venue.\n\nAri Drennen, the LGBTQ program director at Media Matters, a progressive watchdog organization, called Pool's tweet a false and \"insanely dangerous and irresponsible thing to say.\" Drennen, who tracks media narratives around LGBTQ people, said not even in her \"worst nightmare scenario\" did she predict the responses to the Colorado mass shooting.\n\n\"So many of these people seem to have crossed over into territory where they're very comfortable advocating for people to take matters into their own hands,\" Drennen said.\n\nLibs of TikTok, a prominent conservative social media brand created by Chaya Raichik that has 1.5 million followers on Twitter and focuses on the LGBTQ community, proceeded with its usual practices on the platform Sunday and Monday, republishing videos and posts from LGBTQ creators with smaller followings and opening them up to harassment and criticism. In one post Sunday, the account focused on Colorado specifically, highlighting a nonprofit that hosts events for kids interested in drag.\n\nMatt Walsh, a prominent conservative YouTuber known for his criticism of LGBTQ people, published a video on Tuesday titled, \"Why The Left Is So Desperate To Expose Children To Drag Queens.\" Walsh, who has 1.9 million YouTube subscribers, called the shooting \"tragic\" but doubled down on his attacks on drag queens. \"Is it that hard to not crossdress in front of kids? Is the compulsion that overwhelming?\" he asked in the video. \"If it's causing this much chaos and violence, why do you insist on continuing to do it?\"\n\nCarlson, Raichik, Walsh and Pool did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of the LGBTQ advocacy GLAAD, said the ongoing demonization of LGBTQ people by conservative media figures has taken its toll.\n\n\"No one is holding them accountable for all of the misinformation they're spreading, but then we need to prove we're not what they say we are,\" Ellis said.\n\nAt least one Republican politician also targeted LGBTQ people on social media in the wake of the shooting. On Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., published a video on her recently reinstated personal Twitter account criticizing trans people.\n\n\"The left wants you to believe that you can make your gender whatever you want,\" she said. \"They want kids in school to learn that they can change their gender to whatever they want!\"\n\nA representative for Greene responded to a request for comment from NBC News by asking, \"Are you suggesting that chromosomes can be changed?\"\n\nThe LGBTQ community has faced a wave of threats and violence .\n\nIn recently published research from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University San Bernardino, researchers found that reports of hate crimes against LGBTQ people in major cities increased by 51% in 2021.\n\nEllis said leaders in the LGBTQ community have \"seen a dramatic uptick\" in anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. She said over 344 anti-LGBTQ bills have been proposed this legislative season \"to solve problems that never existed.\"\n\n\"They use all of this language, 'grooming,' 'pedophiles,' it's mostly around kids and children,\" Ellis said. \"Meanwhile, so many in our community are parents and have kids and are trying to protect our kids.\"\n\nBroader anti-LGBTQ sentiment has been growing on social media, according to researchers.\n\nJeremy Blackburn, an assistant professor of computer science at Binghamton University in New York who studies online extremism, found that use of the term \"grooming\" on social media increased by 100% beginning in March compared to the start of 2022.\n\nOn Twitter, the use of the anti-gay slur \"fa----\" had a notable increase in the past seven days, according to data reviewed by a team of researchers at the Center for Strategic Communication at Montclair State University, which studies and monitors social media. Use of the word \"groomer\" on Twitter saw even greater growth, with data showing almost as many mentions of the word in the past two days as in the past two weeks combined, the researchers found.\n\nCaraballo noted that rising anti-LGBTQ speech on social media has been met with the rolling back of suspensions on Twitter, where she said major anti-LGBTQ accounts that were suspended in the past five years have been reinstated and \"let off the leash.\"\n\n\"This is an 'In emergency break glass' moment for social media,\" Caraballo said. \"This is priming some very violent people to do shocking acts of violence, and this is all being pushed on social media and on Fox News, on Tucker Carlson.\"\n\nBen Goggin is the deputy tech editor for NBC News.\n\nKat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

By Sunday, she had become the most recent fodder for the internet's ongoing culture war around societal expectations for women.\n\nMazur, 29, had posted a 92-second video to her 7,000 TikTok followers, laying out a day in her life as a single, childless woman, planning to take a crack at making the egg dish shakshuka and watch some TV. The next day, the hate started to pour in.\n\n\"All of a sudden on Sunday, I started receiving hateful comments, and then I caught wind that he had posted my TikTok,\" Mazur said.\n\nHe, in this case, is Matt Walsh, a conservative media provocateur who posted Mazur's video on X , the platform formerly known as Twitter, to his more than 2.4 million followers, stating that she is \"too stupid to realize how depressing this is.\" Other conservative pundits piled on . Some on the left came to her defense . Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, argued with former Trump adviser Stephen Miller about it.\n\nMazur didn't really want much to do with it.\n\n\"I deleted TikTok. I didn't delete my profile, but I deleted the app from my phone because I started to feel very overwhelmed,\" she said. \"My mental health was not in a good place to be reading that, and I felt scared.\"\n\nMazur had inadvertently found herself in an ongoing and fervent corner of the culture war that is increasingly playing out online, one where content that directs hate toward women - even against women with relatively small social media presences - has become profitable and popular inside and outside of conservative circles.\n\nWalsh and many other right-leaning voices are part of a larger conservative movement that promotes what they consider to be traditional family values. That has included targeting medical gender transition procedures and openly criticizing women who have not married and had children. One version of this ideology has become known as \" trad wife \" content, where women envision '50s-style housewife ideals including subservience to their husbands, which has made the practice controversial .\n\nThat culture war now increasingly ensnares people who may only be even tangentially aware of it. Mazur's content isn't political. She hosts a podcast about dating and relationships called \"Pretty Much Done,\" which she said refers to people who are moving past the expectation that they will be married with children by age 30.\n\nNBC News reviewed hateful comments made on X about Mazur's appearance and her ability to have children in the future, while Mazur said she also received direct hate and threats.\n\n\"I understand that with social media you're putting yourself out there to be judged or criticized. But I don't believe anyone has the right to spread hate, and the way his followers spoke about me and to me was deplorable,\" Mazur said in a phone interview. \"It definitely gave me empathy for celebrities and influencers who put themselves out there. It painted a new light for how the internet works.\"\n\nAfter seeing people defend her on X, Mazur reinstalled TikTok and in a follow-up video called out Walsh's post and the response from some of his followers.\n\n\"Some of his followers said I was going to die alone, that I should actually die and never leave my house, I should be sexually assaulted, I'm pathetic, I'm a whore, and that I was dead behind my eyes,\" Mazur said in the video.\n\nWalsh did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMazur said she also received an influx of people coming to support her in the aftermath and that she hoped her content would resonate with people in similar mindsets and situations, helping them \"feel less alone.\"\n\n\"I wanted people to be pretty much done listening to the societal pressure and the noise and be open to creating the lives they want to live for themselves, not because someone else told them that's how they should live their life,\" Mazur said.\n\nGrowing up in a first-generation Russian Jewish household, Mazur said, she heard a lot of rhetoric about \"finding a nice husband and having kids.\"\n\nBut many Americans are now marrying and having children later than in previous decades. The median age at which Americans marry has continued to rise since the 1960s, from 20 for women and 22 for men to 28 for women and 30 for men, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The timeline for marriage isn't the only thing that has been pushed back over the decades. In 2022, the median age to give birth to one's first child in the U.S. hit 30 for the first time ever.\n\n\"Society has adopted this idea that the ideal of happiness is a traditional marriage, you should get married in your 20s, you should have kids by 30, you should buy a house,\" Mazur said.\n\n\"I found myself in those safe, good-on-paper relationships, but I also found myself feeling deeply unhappy and unfulfilled because I felt like I was checking off a box to appease other people,\" she added. \"Throughout that process I realized, 'That's not the only thing that can make you fulfilled.' I'm 29 and single and I feel fulfilled by my life and my career, by my friends and family.\"\n\nKat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tate Reeves, a Republican, said he signed the bill , which bars puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery for minors, because \"there is a dangerous movement spreading across America today.\"\n\n\"It's advancing under the guise of a false ideology, and pseudo science is being pushed onto our children through radical activist, social media and online influencers, and it's trying to convince our children that they are in the wrong body,\" Reeves said at a news conference Tuesday, after he signed the bill. \"This dangerous movement attempts to convince these children that they're just a surgery away from happiness. It threatens our children's innocence, and it threatens their health.\"\n\nAfter he signed the bill, Reeves invited Matt Walsh , a commentator for the right-wing news outlet Daily Wire, to speak. Walsh has increasingly criticized hospitals, particularly Vanderbilt University Medical Center, for their treatment of transgender youth. Walsh's activism was a motivating factor in the Tennessee governor's recent decision to reject more than $8 million in federal funds to combat HIV, NBC News reported earlier this month.\n\nMississippi is one of at least 23 states this year to consider restrictions on gender-affirming health care for minors, which can include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and, rarely, surgery.\n\nIn addition to barring this type of care for minors, Mississippi's bill also bans public funding from going to any institution or individual that provides such care to minors. Health care providers who infringe the law can have their licenses revoked. The law also allows minors who receive transition-related care to sue providers for 30 years after they receive care. The measure takes effect immediately.\n\nIn the last two years, governors in seven states - Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and, now, Mississippi - have signed such measures into law, though judges have blocked Arkansas' and Alabama's laws from taking effect pending the outcome of lawsuits.\n\nThe Mississippi bill's principal author, Rep. Gene Newman, a Republican, did not respond to NBC News' request for comment.\n\nThe measure makes exceptions for intersex infants, for circumcision on babies assigned male at birth and for the treatment of health conditions unrelated to gender dysphoria, which is the distress caused by a sense of conflict between a person's assigned sex at birth and their gender identity.\n\nRestrictions on transition care are part of a wave of state legislation that targets LGBTQ people. So far this year, state lawmakers have introduced over 300 bills targeting LGBTQ people, according to counts by both the American Civil Liberties Union and a separate group of researchers who are tracking the legislation.\n\nMost of the bills focus on transgender youths, according to an NBC News analysis. In the last three years, 18 states have banned transgender girls from playing on girls' sports teams at school, according to the Movement Advancement Project , an LGBTQ think tank. At least 15 states are considering similar measures so far this year, NBC News found.\n\nStacie Pace, the owner of Spectrum: The Other Clinic, which is in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and provides transition-related care, said in a statement after the Legislature passed the bill that there are no children undergoing gender-affirming surgeries in the state.\n\n\"There are not even options for bottom (genital) surgeries for adults in this state,\" Pace said in a statement.\n\nShe added that anyone under 18 only receives gender-affirming medication after a thorough multidisciplinary evaluation and that parents are always involved. She also noted that many national medical organizations - including the American Medical Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association - support access to gender-affirming care for minors.\n\n\"Therefore, it is unclear to us where anti-trans lawmakers are getting the idea that more research needs to be done,\" Pace said. \"This problem they perceive with trans youth getting procedures done simply doesn't exist and is a smoke screen easily cleared up by speaking with those who work with this population regularly.\"\n\nJo Yurcaba is a reporter for NBC Out.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

One allegation said that the hospital offered gender-affirming hysterectomies to children under 18 years old.\n\nConservative influencers with millions of followers pushed similar false talking points and fanned the flames further. David J Harris, a podcaster and supplement seller, and single-issue activists including Chris Elston, who goes by \"Billboard Chris\" for the anti-trans statements he wears on sandwich boards, are among the right-wing social media stars  who have spread the allegations online.\n\nLast week, fact-checking organizations debunked the claims from right-wing accounts, but many of the same accounts continued to spread the false allegations this week.\n\n\"In response to commentary last week critical of our Gender Multispecialty Service (GeMS) Program, Boston Children's Hospital has been the target of a large volume of hostile internet activity, phone calls, and harassing emails including threats of violence toward our clinicians and staff,\" Boston Children's Hospital said in an emailed statement. \"We are deeply concerned by these attacks on our clinicians and staff fueled by misinformation and a lack of understanding and respect for our transgender community.\"\n\n\"Boston Children's is proud to be home to the first pediatric and adolescent transgender health program in the United States,\" the statement added.\n\nVideos from the YouTube account of Boston Children's Hospital in which several physicians discuss services provided to trans patients were shared by the accounts to suggest the Center for Gender Surgery was performing genital surgeries on children. The videos, which have since been removed from the hospital's channel, included one titled, \"What Does It Mean To Be Transgender?\" and did not suggest such surgeries were provided to minors.\n\nBoston Children's Hospital houses the Gender Multispecialty Service, the nation's first pediatric and adolescent transgender health program, which has treated more than 1,000 families, according to its website. Despite the separate Center for Gender Surgery being within Boston Childrens' Hospital, treatment is only provided to \"eligible adolescents and young adults,\" according to the center's website . \"All genital surgeries are only performed on patients age 18 and older,\" the site reads.\n\nA representative for Twitter said they were looking into the harassment campaign.\n\nBoston Children's Hospital said in its statement that the online attention \"was based on the incorrect statement that Boston Children's performs genital surgeries on minors in connection with transgender care. For hysterectomies and other genital surgeries performed as part of gender-affirming care, Boston Children's requires a patient to be capable of consenting for themselves. Age 18 is used to reflect the standard age of majority for medical decision-making. Boston Children's does not perform genital surgeries as part of gender-affirming care on a patient under the age of 18.\"\n\nNevertheless, the posts demonizing Boston Children's Hospital quickly spread through the far-right media ecosystem, promoted by right-wing media personalities including The Daily Wire's Matt Walsh and conservative websites like The Post Millennial and The Daily Caller.\n\nAnti-trans activists also targeted the individual doctors who appeared in the YouTube videos from Boston Children's Hospital, leaving vulgar and harassing comments on their social media accounts and flooding their online pages with negative reviews. Some hospital staff have since made their social media profiles private.\n\nThis isn't the first time that far-right activists have targeted doctors and medical institutions - or even Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nLee Leveille, co-director of Health Liberation Now, a trans rights advocacy group that investigates the effects of policy on trans health, said the hospital was also a target in May 2021 for providing gender-affirming care amid a similar wave of targeted harassment on medical facilities.\n\n\"The original organized network that jump started the clinic protests has been slowing down a bit and is more decentralized,\" Leveille said over email. \"Local pockets will still operate here and there, but they're less connected to a central organized push than the original ones. Now we're seeing new faces rallying the cause - including the likes of Matt Walsh and Libs of TikTok.\"\n\nIn June, Chaya Raichik, the Brooklyn real estate agent behind the Twitter account LibsofTikTok tweeted about a children's hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, for hosting an informational booth at a Pride event. Earlier this month, Raichik and right-wing activist Christopher Rufo targeted a children's hospital in Pittsburgh for its informational video about puberty blockers. The tweets directed waves of harassment to the hospitals' larger accounts.\n\nUnder a tweet from the Pittsburgh hospital about children with cancer, commenters' replies included, \"Pedophiles,\" and \"We will destroy you.\"\n\nThe targeting of children's hospitals is just the most recent in a spate of online abuse aimed at institutions that promote pro-LGBT ideas and events.\n\n\"They've received just an absolute torrent of abuse, oftentimes, with real, in-person, consequences,\" said Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic and LGBTQ+ advocate.\n\nCaraballo cited recent anti-LGBT arson attacks in Baltimore and Brooklyn , widespread threats against organizers of Pride events and Drag Queen Story Hours , and instances where far-right hate groups showed up to protest and were arrested for incitement of violence.\n\n\"We've already had months and months of this reinforcing propaganda, that LGBTQ people are groomers, that they're pedophiles, that they are threats to children,\" she said. \"It's very disturbing to see people justify attacking a children's hospital because of their transphobia and their hatred of trans people.\"\n\nLeveille and Ky Schevers, the other co-director of Health Liberation Now, said they feared violence could come next, targeting doctors, patients and medical facilities that provide gender-affirming care.\n\nBoston Children's Hospital said it was working with law enforcement to ensure the safety of its staff.\n\n\"We condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms, and we reject the false narrative upon which they are based,\" the hospital said in its statement. \"We are working with law enforcement to protect our clinicians, staff, patients, families, and the broader Boston Children's community and hold the offenders accountable. We will continue to take all appropriate measures to protect our people.\"\n\nBrandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News.

      "text": "Pride flag killing suspect appears to have a long history of anti-LGBTQ social posts\n\nBREAKING: Liverpool clinches the Premier League title with a win over Tottenham\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThe 27-year-old man who police say shot and killed a California business owner over a Pride flag draped in her store appears to have had a yearslong history of posting disturbing - and often violent - anti-LGBTQ messages on social media.\n\nThe suspect, Travis Ikeguchi, gunned down Laura Ann Carleton, 66, on Friday, after confronting her and \"yelling many homophobic slurs\" over her clothing store's Pride flag, San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus said at a news conference Monday. Shortly after fleeing the store, Mag.Pi, Ikeguchi was killed in a shootout with law enforcement.\n\nOfficials said Ikeguchi had a history of sharing posts that were critical of the LGBTQ community on social media, including on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWhile officials said they have not received confirmation on social media pages belonging to Ikeguchi, an X account that includes Ikeguchi's full name was created in 2015. Throughout the account's existence, posts were shared repeatedly using the suspect's full name and at least one post included a California location, which corresponds with the suspect's known state of residence.\n\nMany of the account's earlier tweets include references to Christianity and anti-LGBTQ sentiments. In June 2018, the account rebuked a Mastercard advertisement that featured model Elliott Sailors talking about LGBTQ inclusion.\n\n\"LGBT people need to stop asking the world for acceptance, instead they should start accepting Jesus Christ in their hearts and turn away from their false sexual identity that the devil deceived them to be!\" the account tweeted,\" calling LGBTQ inclusion \"a cancer.\"\n\nIn August 2021, the account compared the user's views on LGBTQ rights with his views on abortion, saying, \"Abortion is a path to death for the unborn. LGBTQ is a path to death for the once who are already been born.\"\n\nIn some of the account's more recent posts - and as anti-LGBTQ rhetoric has become somewhat mainstream among far-right elected officials and media pundits - the anti-LGBTQ comments appeared to become more graphic and violent.\n\nOn June 13, during Pride Month, the account posted a photo of a burning Pride flag with the text: \"What to do with the LGBTQP flag?\" The \"P\" added to the LGBTQ initialism appears to refer to \"pedophile,\" a trope that has resurfaced in anti-LGBTQ rhetoric over the last two years.\n\nThree days later, the account retweeted and condemned an image of a scissor cutting through the center of the \"LGBTIQA+\" initialism, which appears to advocate for gay, lesbian and bisexual people dissociating from the transgender and gender-nonconforming communities.\n\n\"This tactic is not going to solve anything. Where you are cutting off the legs of the octopus and can grow back another one,\" the account wrote. \"KILL THE OCTOPUS!! Not just its legs!!!\"\n\nMore recently, the account retweeted several posts with anti-LGBTQ sentiments from right-wing provocateur Matt Walsh , who has over 2.4 million followers on X, and far-right cable news channel One America News Network, also known as OAN.\n\nThe X account isn't the only social media profile that appears to have been maintained by Ikeguchi. On a Gab account linked to directly by the X account, a user appearing to be Ikeguchi described himself as \"Anti-zionism, Anti-jesuits, and Anti-paganism\" in his bio, adding \"same-sex marriage should be abolished.\"\n\nGab bills itself as a free speech platform and is mostly known for providing a platform for far-right extremists.\n\nIn a pinned Gab post from January 2021, the user appearing to be Ikeguchi wrote, \"We need to STOP COMPROMISING on this LGBT dictatorship and not let them take over our lives! Stop accepting this abomination that the government is forcing us to submit to these mentally disordered tyrants!\"\n\nGab did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Gab profile is no longer public, appearing to have been removed within the last several days. It's typical for social media companies to remove profiles of suspected shooters who have spread hateful rhetoric on their platforms.\n\nBut on X, the profile appearing to belong to Ikeguchi along with the anti-LGBTQ tweets were still publicly viewable four days after the shooting, and some users are tagging the company's owner, Elon Musk, trying to bring attention to the hateful rhetoric on the platform.\n\nSince taking over the company in October, Musk has criticized the platform's previous enforcement around hate speech and has reversed a prior rule that forbade misgendering trans people, saying that any type of speech should be allowed on the platform as long as it doesn't break the law.\n\nMusk has also promoted criticisms of LGBTQ people on his own X profile, where he has 153.9 million followers. In July, for example, he liked a post containing the image of a burning LGBTQ Pride flag. He also promoted a documentary widely considered to be anti-transgender from his personal X account.\n\nIn response to a 2020 article alleging that Musk does not support transgender people, Musk tweeted, \"I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare.\"\n\nTwitter representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAri Carleton, the daughter of the slain store owner, declined to comment on Ikeguchi's apparent social media posts, telling NBC News in a direct message on Instagram, \"We want this to be about her.\"\n\nLaura Ann Carleton, who went by Lauri, was a mother of nine who was \"married to the same man for 28 years,\" according to her store's website. Her killing on Friday has prompted an outpouring of grief from LGBTQ activists, lawmakers and celebrities, including actors Jamie Lee Curtis and Kristin Davis.\n\nOn Sunday, \"Bridesmaids\" and \"Ghostbusters\" director Paul Feig posted a photo of him and Carleton, calling her a \"wonderful friend.\"\n\n\"Anyone using hateful language against the LGBTQ+ community has to realize their words matter, that their words can inspire violence against innocent loving people,\" Feig said. \"Let's all keep moving forward with tolerance and love. Let's not let Lauri's tragic death be in vain.\"\n\nMatt Lavietes is a reporter for NBC News.\n\nBen Goggin is the deputy tech editor for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Conservative indie publishing boom turns to bust\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nItâs hardly a surprise that Ben Shapiro is working on another book. Publishing remains one of the most lucrative elements of a successful media career on the right, and the Daily Wire co-founder is at the top of the list of in-demand voices. The new book will be a payday for the commentator, already a multiple-time New York Times bestselling author.\n\nBut Shapiro would apparently rather be the author of the book than its publisher.\n\nJust three years after its splashy launch, the Daily Wireâs publishing arm has largely wound down its operations. Alyssa Cordova, who was brought on to lead the imprint when it launched in 2021, is now a communications person for the media company. Plans for books by Candace Owens never materialized after she flamed out and parted ways with the company. And when Shapiro publishes his next book, it will likely be with a major publisher, not his own imprint.\n\nâDaily Wire was actually quite successful with the books we did publish by industry standards, but traditional book publishing is high effort and low margin and doesnât make sense for the pace of our business right now,â Cordova told Semafor in an email. âWe are still positioned to publish books in-house that make sense for us (for example, specialty books like Johnny the Walrus by Matt Walsh â which has sold over 150,000 copies â and kidsâ books tied with our childrenâs entertainment content) but, for now, current events nonfiction books by our hosts make more sense to outsource.â\n\nThe Daily Wireâs pivot reflects a broader realization on the right, as publishers have struggled to recreate the book sales of the conservative imprints at major publishing houses.\n\nPeople close to Donald Trump launched Winning Team Publishing in 2021 with the goal of circumventing major publishers and self-publishing books by the former president and members of his political coalition. But the company hasnât had much luck selling books beyond those written by its signature author.\n\nItâs difficult to tell how many books Winning Team has sold because the publisher sells many of the titles directly to customers, meaning its sales donât show up in BookScan, which tallies sales from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other retailers. But Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro, whose last book with Hachette sold 75,000 copies, published a book via Winning Team in 2023 that sold 18,000, according to BookScan. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirkâs 2022 book with the Trump family publisher sold just more than 15,500 copies, while his latest book released in June has sold just 6,000. When Kirk released his 2020 book with HarperCollins, it sold nearly 60,000 copies. Still, others did worse: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs Winning Team-published book sold just under 4,000 copies in major retailers, per BookScan.\n\nThe publisher has brought in some real revenue selling high-priced Trump books as, essentially, collectorsâ items. BookScan said it sold nearly 47,000 copies at $99 each, and 42,000 copies of Trumpâs Our Journey Together at $74.99 per book. Thatâs a lot of money for a self-publisher, though it is nowhere close to the sales numbers of other recent presidential memoirs; Barack Obamaâs post-White House memoir sold several million copies, while Michelle Obamaâs book did even better.\n\nSteve Bannonâs War Room Books imprint hasnât fared much better. Conservative internet personality and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec â though currently a New York Times bestseller â has sold 23,000 copies of his book Unhumans: The Secret History of Communist Revolutions (and How to Crush Them) since it was released last month. But other books, like a biography of Trump attorney Roy Cohn, have sold just a few hundred copies in major online and physical retailers, according to BookScan.\n\nThe numbers stand in stark contrast to sales by the major imprints, which have been much higher over the same period.\n\nMark Levinâs book, published by Simon & Schusterâs Threshold Editions late last year, has sold more than 310,000 copies. Philip C. McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, has sold 100,000 copies of his anti-cancel culture book this year, while Kellyanne Conwayâs book is nearing 80,000 copies sold. Fox News personalities Harris Faulkner and Shannon Bream published books over the last two years that cleared 369,000 and 325,000 copies, respectively, as did Pete Hegseth, who has sold more than 300,000 copies of his last two books (all three published with HarperCollinsâ imprint Fox News Books).\n\nOther conservative upstarts have found that the nonfiction book publishing business is thorny and can occasionally be complicated by real-life events.\n\nAll Seasons Press, started by former executives from Simon & Schuster and Hachette, has been embroiled in a series of lawsuits with some of its own authors, including former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows. The publisher has spent the last year trying to claw back its $350,000 book advance, saying that Meadows violated his contract with the publisher by telling U.S. special prosecutor Jack Smith that he never believed Trumpâs election fraud claims, a contradiction of what he wrote in his 2021 book. The publisher was recently acquired by Skyhorse, another independent publisher that over the last several months has hoovered up conservative publishers, including Regnery.\n\nIn late 2021, Shapiroâs conservative digital media company, the Daily Wire, announced it was launching a book publishing arm with an ambitious goal: break the stranglehold the traditional book publishing houses had on conservative books.\n\nThe strategy, which mirrored the one laid out by the founders of All Seasons Press, was both practical and ideological. Shapiro understood that conservative books made money and represented legitimate revenue for the five major book publishing houses. A company like the Daily Wire, with its large online audience, could use its distribution to sell copies to its audiences without needing promotion in mainstream outlets or major airtime on Fox News, which remains one of the best ways to sell a conservative book.\n\nThere are some successful examples of this. The Daily Wire had a hit with a book by one of its personalities, Matt Walsh, who sold 115,000 copies, according to BookScan. I was personally surprised that All Seasonsâ Peter Navarro book cracked 80,000 copies sold, given that he has been a more fringe player within the Trump universe.\n\nWhile the publishing houses had their own conservative labels, conservatives increasingly felt that they were being isolated and censored at major publishers. Staff and other authors were organizing boycotts or raising concerns about conservative authors, particularly those who had stood with Trump or made excuses for his actions on Jan. 6.\n\nSemafor editor-in-chief Ben Smith, then The New York Timesâ media columnist, wrote that internal tensions at the major publishers following the riot on Jan. 6 represented a shift that could change conservative book publishing. New independent publishers could â have their pick of the MAGA litter, â and while conservative authors wouldnât get the huge advances offered by major publishers, internal uproars from left-leaning staff might slow the publication of major titles to a trickle.\n\nThe opposite has happened. The Biden era hasnât been the kind of boon to the conservative book publishing world that the Obama or Trump administrations were. But conservative imprints at major publishing houses have continued to publish a steady stream of titles that have put up impressive numbers.\n\nAnd the continued outperformance of books released by the traditional publishers demonstrates the edge that the traditional big players have in author selection, strategy, press, and distribution. The big playersâ scale also has allowed them to withstand flops, while the upstart indie publishers still need hits in order to justify the advances they need to woo authors away from the Big Five publishers.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "Donald Trumpâs personal attacks on Kamala Harris split his campaign message in two\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDonald Trumpâs campaign has been rolling out traditional attack lines against their new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris â tying her to âradicalâ policies and blaming her for illegal border crossings and inflation under President Biden.\n\nDonald Trump, the candidate, is another story.\n\nOn Wednesday, days after his campaign notched a big ad buy in battleground states honing in on Harrisâ record with the border, the former president did what he does best: Thrust himself back into the spotlight. Speaking on stage at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago, Trump attacked Harris with a different angle, falsely suggesting sheâd only recently âhappened to turnâ Black after presenting herself as South Asian. On Truth Social, he kept it up, again posting about the topic, while the White House press secretary denounced his comments as ârepulsive.â On Thursday morning, he shared a family picture of a young Harris in traditional Indian garb. (Harrisâ mother is from India and her father is from Jamaica; she has discussed her biracial heritage throughout her career and attended Howard University, a historically Black learning institution.)\n\nThe Trump campaign had overwhelmingly been focused on hitting Harris on her record. Now faced with a new line from its boss, it began to find ways to incorporate it.\n\nâI think he pointed out the fundamental chameleon-like nature of Kamala Harris,â his vice presidential pick, JD Vance, told reporters on his plane shortly after the NABJ conference.\n\nAt a rally in Pennsylvania after Wednesdayâs event, the campaign projected onto a big screen an old Business Insider headline that described Harris as the âfirst Indian-American US senator,â implying that coverage of one half of her ethnic background somehow invalidated coverage of the other half. Alina Habba, one of the opening speakers, seemed to also reference Trumpâs remarks, saying âunlike you, Kamala, I know who my roots are and where I come from.â\n\nOn X, the official âTrump War Roomâ account posted a handful of references to the comments, mostly from others. Posts included a CNN clip in which Sen. Tom Cotton defended them, which made no mention of the substance in the text, and a retweet of a short clip of Harris meeting with Mindy Kaling.\n\nBut it was also still unclear whether the Trump episode was a one-off eruption, or the start of a new campaign front. Overwhelmingly the campaignâs message remained the same as before and by Thursday morning, its accounts on X had largely pivoted to pushing Harris to respond to an Olympics gender testing controversy . A 15-point list of items purporting to expose the âReal Kamalaâ that the RNC Research account posted included no mention of her ethnicity.\n\nSome allies were openly hoping to move on, even ones who are typically eager to defend Trumpâs more controversial rhetoric. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said it wasnât âa great idea for either of the parties to be playing racial identity politics,â and Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said he was not going to âget involved in that,â and would personally be focusing his commentary on âhow bad our country is in shape right now because of her.â Others were more eager to jump in, like Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, and trust that Trumpâs instincts were correct.\n\nWithin Trumpâs orbit, people also seemed privately split between clapping along with Trumpâs attack or just resigning themselves to it. Responses ranged from metaphorical shrugs â that this is part of the deal that comes with working on behalf of his election â to individuals who praised the appearance as âawesome.â Overall, the most common response seemed to be that this event would quickly be eclipsed by the next piece of news. The people who liked or disliked Trump before the NABJ would have the same feelings afterwards, they argued, and he showed he was willing to go into a hostile environment and take questions.\n\nBut veteran Trump watchers noted that the episode fit a familiar pattern âÂ an extreme, even self-defeating, desire to dominate the political conversation at any cost. Some allies blamed his 2020 loss on a related failure to focus voters on Bidenâs vulnerabilities and instead find new ways to demand they validate his own performance. Similarly, some observers credited his victory in 2016 to an uncharacteristic decision to stay on message in the final days of the race while Hillary Clinton dealt with a briefly reopened FBI investigation.\n\nThe NABJ interview notably came at a rare time, arguably the first since early in the primaries, in which a political rival was enjoying an extended positive stretch of coverage.\n\nâThe campaign wants to be defined by discipline. They want to be very on message all the time, and the message is: Make this a referendum on the Biden-Harris record,â Alex Conant said. âTrump doesnât like giving up the spotlight, and what he did yesterday, like, for the first time since he was shot, he led the news, which is what he wants.â\n\nAsked about their messaging this week, the campaign sent a statement that did not include mention of the Trump-angled attacks on race. Trump spokesman Brian Hughes reiterated many of the core arguments the campaign is making against Harris: Pointing to her history with the border, tying her directly to Joe Biden, and bringing up some of her more liberal past stances like abolishing private healthcare.\n\nâHarris is weak, failed and dangerously liberal,â Hughes said. âHer dishonesty is demonstrated by her active role in years of gaslighting Americans about the mental competency of Biden, and now her efforts every day to delete her California liberal past. Kamala tries to shape shift to obscure reality.â\n\nMeanwhile, three of Trumpâs top Black surrogates are expected to hit the airwaves today following his NABJ appearance, CNN reported .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThis is often the reality when working with Trump: Current and former aides have always told me that, at the end of the day, the candidate has the last word â and he has a sometimes unique ability to complicate things for himself and his campaign.\n\nThis unwillingness to get ahead of Trump was already visible in the days leading up to the NABJ event, as Republicans debated the merits of criticizing Harris as a âDEIâ nominee, a frame that House Republican leaders asked their members to avoid . Trumpâs campaign did not initially join in on the âDEIâ talk and directed Republicans to other topics âÂ but at the same time senior aides were reluctant to concede that these attacks were âoff-limits,â knowing the candidate might adopt them later on.\n\nIn some ways, the campaign has already been built to work around this dynamic, leaving Trump free to emphasize his favored topics and his staff to focus on messages they see as most effective in winning over voters. His onstage remarks might frequently play up his support for Jan. 6 defendants , for example, but those topics have not been a focus of paid media or talking points for surrogates.\n\nTo be clear, Trump also incorporates the more traditional attacks that his advisors seem to favor. His convention address was a display of this tension in action, with Trump frequently departing from his tightly honed teleprompter speech to go off on his own tangents.\n\nUntil recently, the results had been positive for Trump. After prior races that featured infighting between some advisors trying to discipline the candidate and others arguing for a âLet Trump be Trumpâ approach â often through leaks to the press â the new approach seemed to keep everyone on the same page. But everything is different when the campaign is on defense in the press and in the polls, and the episode showed how fragile the arrangement could be as they head into another month where Harris is likely to dominate the news with her running mate selection and convention.\n\nConservative commentator Matt Walsh argued that âthe stuff about Kamalaâs race was fine for Trump to bring upâ and that his overall performance on Wednesday was beneficial, making âhim look honest, cool, and unbothered to the average voter.â But he also cautioned against leaning too much on personal attacks versus focusing on Harrisâ policies and record.\n\nâHe should be taking the attention and shifting it back to the stuff that will actually hurt her. No voter gives a shit about the fact that Kamala is biracial. No voter is going to vote for Trump because they find out Kamala has an Indian mom,â Walsh tweeted .\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMilwaukee, WI â âThese are my people. This is where I belong.â\n\nSo said Amber Rose âÂ a onetime video vixen, anti-rape âSlut Walkâ pioneer, abortion rights advocate, and OnlyFans performer â at the RNC Convention. The primetime audience gave her a standing ovation.\n\nBut Roseâs speech, which touched on her life as a mother and her gradual acceptance of Donald Trump, also provoked a ripple of division in a typically united Republican Party this week.\n\nâThe RNC gives a primetime speaking slot to a pro-abortion feminist and self-proclaimed slut with a face tattoo whose only claim to fame is having sex with rappers,â the conservative commentator Matt Walsh tweeted . âTruly an embarrassment. Not a single voter will be mobilized by this person.â\n\nâNo lies detected,â âThe Blazeâ host Steve Deace replied .\n\nâIn a rare moment, Walsh is right,â a National Review article by Haley Strack declared â referring to follow-up comments from Walsh where he argued that âconservatism as a movement is in even worse shape thanâ he thought if suggesting someone like Rose shouldnât be a prime-time Republican speaker was an âoutrageous and offensiveâ take.\n\nBut the mainstream of the Republican Party right now sees Rose more as opportunity than threat âÂ the reason she was on stage in the first place.\n\nâAmber Rose telling her followers on OnlyFans to vote for Donald Trump shouldnât be controversial at all,â Terry Schilling, president of the socially conservative American Principles Project, told Semafor. âThe Republican Party should welcome all votes to support it in our quest to save America. If I were running, I would want as many Democrats to vote for me as possible. I tell people to ignore the clickbait and focus on winning â both in elections and on policy.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nSome of these conservatives are worried about Rose because of what she represents: A Republican Party that absorbs secular, pop culture norms, and trades religious conservatism for something easier. And, beyond that, these concerns dive into broader anxieties among more traditional Republicans worried about what gets left behind in a fully MAGA party: The tapered-down platform on abortion and picking a Ukraine-aid skeptic as vice president being two notable topics Iâve heard grumbled about this week.\n\nâI donât want to be saying you shouldnât have Amber Rose speak, because you want to be expanding, you want to be reaching out to new converts,â as Marc Short, who formally served as Mike Penceâs chief of staff, put it. âAt the same time, though, I think the choice of speakers on Monday came on the heels of significant [change] to the platform.â\n\nâItâs just the combination of the factors, the timing, is alarming,â he added.\n\nItâs taboo to even bring up within the party these days, but for years a defining debate between what became the âNever Trumpâ Republicans and those who stayed in the GOP was also how Trumpâs personal qualities, including his sexual ethics, would transform their votersâ expectations. He arrived at the convention freshly convicted in a case involving hush money payments to an adult film actress, and Roseâs presence on the stage was another reminder of how Trump has changed the GOPâs relationship to secular culture.\n\nTo be clear, the defining feature of this Republican National Convention is party unity around Trump. At the convention this week, a debate over a reality TV star is ultimately just a tiny fracture.\n\nBut itâs worth keeping an eye on these little divides: They could widen after a Trump victory, when the party is no longer just focused on a critical upcoming election and can return to debating its future more openly.\n\nHere at the RNC, there are hints everywhere at how the party is changing drastically, Politico detailed earlier this week.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Vance, to his political benefit and detriment, is very online. His media fluency helped propel him to conservative stardom, but could be a political risk among a wider audience. Walz is a folksy master of the cable TV cycle, but also a guy who spent a lot of time with reporters on Capitol Hill, and his addition to the ticket was partially the result of a concerted campaign by his team to raise his profile over the last two years.\n\nAll of it amounts to a fascinating and, letâs be honest here, exciting moment for a political news media that has been pretty parched over the past few years. And as the presidential cycles swallows the news over the next few months, itâs one weâll be navigating here â please respond to this email if youâve got story ideas, or other ways we could make this product better.\n\nAlso : This week, I used Benâs absence as an opportunity to write about a thesis he didnât get quite right during the Biden era: the struggles of independent conservative publishers, which have benefited less than they hoped from the Biden years. Plus Nancy Pelosiâs book tour, a wrinkle for Smartmatic, and more British media news in America. (Scoop count: 5)\n\nItâs hardly a surprise that Ben Shapiro is working on another book. Publishing remains one of the most lucrative elements of a successful media career on the right, and the Daily Wire co-founder is at the top of the list of in-demand voices. The new book will be a payday for the commentator, already a multiple-time New York Times bestselling author.\n\nBut Shapiro would apparently rather be the author of the book than its publisher.\n\nJust three years after its splashy launch, the Daily Wireâs publishing arm has largely wound down its operations. Alyssa Cordova, who was brought on to lead the imprint when it launched in 2021, is now a communications person for the media company. Plans for books by Candace Owens never materialized after she flamed out and parted ways with the company. And when Shapiro publishes his next book, it will likely be with a major publisher, not his own imprint.\n\nâDaily Wire was actually quite successful with the books we did publish by industry standards, but traditional book publishing is high effort and low margin and doesnât make sense for the pace of our business right now,â Cordova told Semafor in an email. âWe are still positioned to publish books in-house that make sense for us (for example, specialty books like Johnny the Walrus by Matt Walsh â which has sold over 150,000 copies â and kidsâ books tied with our childrenâs entertainment content) but, for now, current events nonfiction books by our hosts make more sense to outsource.â\n\nThe Daily Wireâs pivot reflects a broader realization on the right, as publishers have struggled to recreate the book sales of the conservative imprints at major publishing houses.\n\nPeople close to Donald Trump launched Winning Team Publishing in 2021 with the goal of circumventing major publishers and self-publishing books by the former president and members of his political coalition. But the company hasnât had much luck selling books beyond those written by its signature author.\n\nItâs difficult to tell how many books Winning Team has sold because the publisher sells many of the titles directly to customers, meaning its sales donât show up in BookScan, which tallies sales from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other retailers. But Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro, whose last book with Hachette sold 75,000 copies, published a book via Winning Team in 2023 that sold 18,000, according to BookScan. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirkâs 2022 book with the Trump family publisher sold just more than 15,500 copies, while his latest book released in June has sold just 6,000. When Kirk released his 2020 book with HarperCollins, it sold nearly 60,000 copies. Still, others did worse: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs Winning Team-published book sold just under 4,000 copies in major retailers, per BookScan.\n\nThe publisher has brought in some real revenue selling high-priced Trump books as, essentially, collectorsâ items. BookScan said it sold nearly 47,000 copies at $99 each, and 42,000 copies of Trumpâs Our Journey Together at $74.99 per book. Thatâs a lot of money for a self-publisher, though it is nowhere close to the sales numbers of other recent presidential memoirs; Barack Obamaâs post-White House memoir sold several million copies, while Michelle Obamaâs book did even better.\n\nSteve Bannonâs War Room Books imprint hasnât fared much better. Conservative internet personality and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec â though currently a New York Times bestseller â has sold 23,000 copies of his book Unhumans: The Secret History of Communist Revolutions (and How to Crush Them) since it was released last month. But other books, like a biography of Trump attorney Roy Cohn, have sold just a few hundred copies in major online and physical retailers, according to BookScan.\n\nThe numbers stand in stark contrast to sales by the major imprints, which have been much higher over the same period.\n\nMark Levinâs book, published by Simon & Schusterâs Threshold Editions late last year, has sold more than 310,000 copies. Philip C. McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, has sold 100,000 copies of his anti-cancel culture book this year, while Kellyanne Conwayâs book is nearing 80,000 copies sold. Fox News personalities Harris Faulkner and Shannon Bream published books over the last two years that cleared 369,000 and 325,000 copies, respectively, as did Pete Hegseth, who has sold more than 300,000 copies of his last two books (all three published with HarperCollinsâ imprint Broadside).\n\nOther conservative upstarts have found that the nonfiction book publishing business is thorny and can occasionally be complicated by real-life events.\n\nAll Seasons Press, started by former executives from Simon & Schuster and Hachette, has been embroiled in a series of lawsuits with some of its own authors, including former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows. The publisher has spent the last year trying to claw back its $350,000 book advance, saying that Meadows violated his contract with the publisher by telling U.S. special prosecutor Jack Smith that he never believed Trumpâs election fraud claims, a contradiction of what he wrote in his 2021 book. The publisher was recently acquired by Skyhorse, another independent publisher that over the last several months has hoovered up conservative publishers, including Regnery.\n\nRead on for details on the rightâs publishing ambitions and Maxâs View .  â\n\nRead on for details on the rightâs publishing ambitions and Maxâs View .  â\n\nInside the biggest stories transforming the Arabian Peninsula and the world .

The former House Speaker has been on a media tour this week promoting her new book The Art of Power amid intense media interest in the former speaker, who helped play a role in pressuring Joe Biden to step aside and advocating for Vice President Kamala Harris to select Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nIt hasnât gone unnoticed by Pelosiâs allies, who have privately congratulated her on helping put together a Democratic ticket that seems poised to compete with Trump in November. During one of her media stops earlier this week in New York, a Semafor tipster could overhear Pelosi on the phone with a close confidante who congratulated the former speaker, telling her: âThis is your ticket. You created this.â\n\nPhoto finish: Will we ever see the photos taken of Joe Biden and his family as he mulled over whether to drop out of the race? In late June, The New York Times reported that much of the Biden family had gathered in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz. It was remarkable timing for the iconic American portrait photographer, who is responsible for some of the most memorable images of American presidents. It turns out the photos may not be seen for a while. According to one person familiar with the photoshoot, it was not for a Conde Nast publication (where she publishes the majority of her news-focused portraiture) but rather a personal project for the family.\n\nVoguing: JFKâs viral grandson Jack Schlossberg, newly a campaign correspondent for Vogue, is proving that even in the era of fragmentation, members of the news media can still be celebrities on the campaign trail.\n\nBritish Invasion: The BBC is bringing on Ben Goldberger as GM and GM & Executive Director of Editorial Content at BBC Studios to head up the companyâs editorial strategy outside the United States. Goldberger, who joins the organization in September, is currently an executive with Time. Itâs the latest move for the British news organization which has increasingly looked to grow its US news presence. Last year, the company expanded its Washington, D.C. primetime evening programming, launched a daily podcast aimed at North American audiences, debuted its first ever brand campaign outside the UK, and relaunched its North America website.\n\nâIâm delighted Ben is joining BBC Studios. He is a rare, brilliant talent, combining editorial excellence with commercial experience. He has a track record of digital innovation and will be a huge asset to the business,â Deborah Turness, CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement first shared with Semafor. âI look forward to partnering with him to grow our international news offer - particularly in the US market. This is a hugely consequential time in the US with the countdown to Novemberâs election, and the BBC is the most trusted brand that rises above Americaâs polarised politics to deliver facts, not opinion.â\n\nDept. of Reputational Harm : Ben and Semaforâs Shelby Talcott got the scoop , back before we launched, about an federal investigation into allegations that the voting machine company Smartmatic corrupty obtained a contract in the Philippines. Now two executives at the company have been indicted â a move greeted with relief at Fox Corp,, which faces a defamation lawsuit similar to the one that it paid $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to settle in 2023. Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly told Semafor, however that while the company takes the charges âseriously,â they âshould not impactâ the case: âThe recent development does not change the fact that these defendants lied about the 2020 election, the lie injured Smartmatic, and they need to answer for the consequences of their actions.â\n\nItâs on: Trump reversed course this week, agreeing to an ABC News-hosted debate with Harris after backing out late Saturday evening. But as we wrote last week, while ABC has the only confirmed debate, NBC News is in discussions with both campaigns about a potential additional contest.\n\nOlympic jump: This yearâs summer Olympic broadcasts have been a major bounceback for NBC from a disappointing 2021 Tokyo broadcast. NBC averaged 32.2 million viewers across its TV and streaming platforms, a 76% increase from 2021, and accounted for 8 of the top 10 most streamed days on Peacock.\n\nSports talk: Vox Media is continuing to build out its high-level sports podcast business. We reported earlier this week that Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward was bringing his podcast to Vox Media (it was previously distributed by ESPN), the second sports podcast it has signed in three months following the relaunch of Megan Rapinoe and Sue Birdâs show. While ESPN remains by far the biggest game in town, some more outspoken athletes have found that dealing with a media partner who doesnât have broadcast rights can be an appealing offer for more editorial freedom.\n\nSetting things straight: After a union walkout this week, Crooked Media and its employee union settled their labor dispute, releasing a joint statement saying they were âready to channel the immense talent, passion, and creativity into calling JD Vance a creepy weirdo.â\n\nOthello in the Desert: Our colleague Liz Hoffman reported recently on Daniel Craig and Bond producer Barbara Broccoliâs quest to find money â and perhaps a location â in Qatar to finance a passion product of Craigâs, a version of Othello set in an American barracks in Iraq. Now the project seems to have some momentum: A Bond fan tipped us off to a British filing by Broccoliâs Eon Productions, registering a new Othello Film Company Limited . Craig and Broccoli, along with director Sam Gold, are â a person familiar with conversations told us âare hoping to bring the 2016 limited run of the show, which got rave reviews, to the screen. The filings are silent on another question: Whether the Qataris could use the talks to get Broccoli to set part of a bond film in Doha.\n\nNovel idea : Bad earnings reports from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount last week were a reminder that the cable news business continues to be a bad one. At Business Insider, Peter Kafka makes the case for why Apple should use WBDâs cable woes as an opportunity to buy the company at a discounted price, potentially spinning off the declining assets and keeping the studio and streaming service.\n\nProrated: The Atlantic, Time magazine, the Financial Times, and other publishers have struck deals with the AI company ProRata, which is launching its own chatbot/search engine that will identify content generated by AI.\n\nRight on target: DotDash Meredith is touting its cookieless ad targeting tool, saying it was responsible for its second straight quarter of double digit ad revenue growth.\n\nWhat do the social media teams at Netflix, Apple, and Disney have in common?

      "text": "Pride Month is a war. Brands are the battlefield.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn Saturday, California Rep. Robert Garcia told his state partyâs LGBTQ caucus to be ready for a pride month fight.\n\nConservatives were protesting Pride displays at Target, convincing the retailer to drop a transgender designerâs items . Members of Congress had called for a boycott of The North Face after the outdoors retailer featured a drag queen in its âSummer of Prideâ campaign. Even the L.A. Dodgers had disinvited the longtime activist group Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence from a Pride Month award ceremony â then reinvited them, after progressives fought back.\n\nâWe have to remember that pride started off as a protest,â said Garcia, who was the first openly gay mayor of Long Beach before winning his House seat last year. âIt cannot just be a celebration anymore. We are being systematically attacked.â\n\nEnergized by a boycott of Bud Light â and before that, by Ron DeSantisâs parental rights battle with Disney â social conservatives see this yearâs Pride Month as an opportunity to make corporations pay for LGBTQ-friendly marketing, especially for products enjoyed by children.\n\nThe goal is reversing a decade-long, market-chasing trend toward more LGBTQ visibility, and to âmake that rainbow flag absolutely toxic,â as Daily Wire podcast host Michael Knowles told listeners last week. In the political arena, DeSantis has contrasted his approach to fighting âwoke corporationsâ to Donald Trumpâs, elevating the issue in the GOP primary.\n\nâI think a multi-billion-dollar company that sexualizes children is not consistent with the values of Florida, or the values of a place like Iowa,â DeSantis said of Disney, in an interview on âFox and Friendsâ yesterday, referring to the corporationâs opposition to a law he signed that restricts classroom discussion of gender and sexual orientation.\n\nWhether or not they support him for president, Republicans increasingly support that mission. On his âVerdictâ podcast last week, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said there had been a âcumulative effectâ from campaigns to boycott and damage brands, starting with Disney and continuing with Bud Light and Target.\n\nâTheyâre saying, we donât want to be Bud Light. We donât want to be Bud Light,â Cruz explained, citing reporting on how the protests had rattled corporations. âWell, you know what the next company is gonna say? We donât want to be Bud Light or Target. We donât want to be Bud Light or Target. That starts to get really powerful.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe boycott push is as straightforward as culture war gets. Pride month grew out of the 1969 Stonewall riots, and began as the Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade one year later â aÂ  public demonstration that gay people were part of society, like it or not. The backlash is largely about making LGBTQ people, particularly trans people, less visible.\n\nâWhat we did with Bud Light and Target comes right from Saul Alinskyâs Rules for Radicals,â Daily Wire host Matt Walsh told listeners before the holiday weekend, citing the left-wing organizerâs advice to pick a target, freeze it, and personalize it. âEvery pride flag that a company takes down, or hides in the back of their store in shame, is a victory.â\n\nThere have been many targets , and overlapping grievances. The drag-dressing Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence were accused of mocking Catholicism ; Hersheyâs âHerSheâ campaign , in Canada, featured a transgender woman; Kohlâs was selling baby onesies with LGBTQ-positive messaging. The campaign against Target started when Walsh discussed âtuck-friendlyâ swimsuits being sold by the brand to transgender customers in âsizes for kids or for very, very, very small adults.â\n\nThe false idea that the swimsuits were for children took off. Heritage Foundation scholar Sarah Parshall Perry, a general counsel at the Department of Education under the Trump administration, filmed herself visiting a Target to handle its LGBTQ-positive merchandise herself, noting that the tuck-friendly swimsuit was small and positioned âright next to a child mannequin.â The video for âBoycott Target,â which rapper Forgiato Blow released the same day as the Heritage clip, shows the âmayor of MAGAvilleâ scouring the store for Pride merchandise.\n\nâWhy they pushinâ agendas, promoting sexual genders?â Blow rapped. âIâm only rockinâ with Bruce, donât rock with no Caitlyn Jenner.â\n\nThat content simply wasnât taking off a year or two earlier, which is one reason itâs grabbed so much attention and startled progressives. At the start of the Biden presidency, the corporate embrace of LGBTQ people and Pride celebrations had become so enthusiastic that it inspired protests calling for a return to the eventâs real mission; jokes about Disney constantly (if awkwardly) announcing its âfirstâ gay character; and a Saturday Night Live sketch where people enjoying their first post-COVID Pride weekend dance morosely on a Deutsche Bank float.\n\nBut the corporate support was also hard-won. Target started selling Pride merchandise in 2012, after protests of the companyâs donations to gay marriage critics convinced Lady Gaga to scrap a marketing deal. And mainstream businesses powered resistance to a âbathroom billâ passed in North Carolina and a religious freedom law in Indiana. Companies that marketed to LGBTQ consumers and allies âÂ and employed them â opposed those laws , discouraging similar efforts for years.\n\nâThey have to grow their market,â said Andrew Essex, a longtime marketing executive. âBut there can be a myopia of the corporate boardroom â thereâs so much enthusiasm that they can piggyback into cultural relevance, that they forget the idea might alienate their core audience.â\n\nWhy the backlash now? Jon Schweppe, the policy director of the conservative American Principles Project, said that the debate had changed as the LGBTQ rights movement focused more on transgender rights and visibility. There were corporations who âwanted to show support for Pride,â he said, âbut not wade into the trans kids debate.â\n\nDeSantis got credit, too, as did the burgeoning conservative media, and the new owner of Twitter â a multi-billionaire whoâs rolled back restrictions on speech that mocks âtransgender individuals.â Accounts like End Wokeness, with 1.1 million followers, are now making pro-LGBTQ products infamous (in between Musk-approved tweets about âinterracial violent crimeâ) in ways that the prior ownership might have sought to prevent.\n\nâThereâs no level of LGBTQ inclusion that theyâll tolerate,â said Ari Drennen, the LGBTQ program director at Media Matters. She pointed to the pummeling Bud Light got even after it issued a sort-of apology last month as evidence that brands had little to gain if they listened to the boycotters. âI personally donât think that the 30 angriest people on the internet should dictate what products are available to consumers.â\n\nMeanwhile, the backlash to the backlash can be just as fierce. Groups like GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, which work with brands on how to market to LGBTQ consumers, have pilloried Target for de-listing and moving some Pride products, demanding a response that reaffirms their âcommitment to the LGBTQ+ community.â It hasnât come yet.\n\nâItâs not just the policies weâre looking for â we need businesses to match those internal efforts with public statements and action,â said Jared Todd, the HRCâs press secretary. âRight now, businesses who value and have worked with the LGBTQ+ community, businesses that openly support their LGBTQ+ employees, shareholders and customers, need to step up and speak out.â\n\nNational Review Online editor Phil Klein tweeted that he doesnât have a problem with LGBTQ-friendly Kohlâs onesies, drawing some ire from social conservatives. âI fear conservatives are imitating some of the worst instincts of the other side,â he argued in a follow-up piece. âListening to conservatives discuss how every little thing â including a onesie â is inextricably linked to every aspect of the left-wing agenda reminds me of Oberlin undergrads complaining about âmicroaggressions.ââ\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Inside Tucker Carlsonâs new media plan\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nTucker Carlsonâs move to Twitter is intended to preserve his influence and political relevance, a person familiar with his plans said âÂ but doesnât solve his, or the struggling platformâs, long term challenges.\n\nâTucker prioritizes influence, Twitter allows him to not just be another podcaster, and get in front of a large, influential audience,â said a person familiar with his thinking. âHe can get back to talking about the news quickly there.â\n\nCarlson and Twitter proprietor Elon Musk had not met before Carlson interviewed Musk last month, but each saw an opportunity.\n\nâThe timing works out as Twitter is looking for content creators and Tucker is looking for a place to talk,â the person said.\n\nCarlson is the biggest name in right-wing American media and a leader of the Republican Partyâs populist wing. He  has fielded interest from cable networks and new media platforms âÂ but he didnât bid his show out to the various interested parties, one conservative media figure who has communicated with Carlson said.\n\nInstead, he decided in recent days to relaunch his show on a platform that has no clear way to build a business around a streaming television show or podcast.\n\nThe former Fox News host also chose a platform that he has been permitted to operate on his own while at Fox âÂ a relevant fact while he negotiates his way out of a $20 million contract, and aims to take as much money with him as he can.\n\nThe person close to Carlson also said that several former staffers from his Fox program planned to join him, including executive producer Justin Wells, who will likely play a role in the new Twitter show.\n\nMusk tweeted that Carlsonâs partnership with the platform was not an exclusive arrangement. And other media competitors who have been attempting to woo Carlson are still planning to pursue deals with the TV host.\n\nNewsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, who had proposed changing his networkâs name to Carlsonâs, told Semafor that he was still open to doing a deal with Carlson if he found Twitter to be a lackluster partner.\n\nâItâs hard to think Twitter will be Tuckerâs final destination,â he said. âWe remain open to having a conversation with him.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nMuskâs embrace of Carlson carries immediate risks for a major source of Twitterâs revenue, as Carlson will likely alienate some of Twitterâs remaining advertisers. His inflammatory remarks on Fox News became a liability for the network as advertisers fled. And Muskâs erratic moves since taking over the platform have already caused it to shed millions in ad revenue from major companies.\n\nâThis is yet another example of Elon Muskâs Twitter being purposely tone deaf when it comes to advertisersâ concerns about content moderation under the guise of free speech and to his financial detriment,â veteran ad executive Lou Paskalis told Semafor. âHe is now the undisputed master of self-inflicted wounds in that regard. I doubt heâs pursuing Rachel Maddow or any other left-leaning pundit as a follow-up to Tucker Carlson.â\n\nMusk continues to race through discarded Twitter business models as he seeks to reinvent the platform. I had first-hand experience with this from 2017 to 2020, when BuzzFeed News, of which I was editor, launched a show called AM2DM, with the idea that a morning show hosted by Twitter natives and focused on the platformâs obsessions could draw an audience. (âElon is launching AM to DM for Great Replacement enthusiasts,â one of my former colleagues, Joel Anderson, tweeted Tuesday.)\n\nThe program brought in real money, through advertiser-friendly segments delivered on clips, and had wonderful moments. But it ran into a fatal conflict with the platformâs core mechanics. A former Twitter employee who worked on it told me today that the core issue with attempting to shift Twitter toward television is the contrast between the requirement that you sit still to watch a show and the basic Twitter experience of scrolling.\n\nâItâs doomscrolling versus doomstaying,â the former Twitter employee said. The notion that Carlson could build a significant video business on Twitter, he said, was âstupid.â\n\nTwitter may temporarily solve Carlsonâs need for relevance. Soon, however, he will need to find a business model âÂ perhaps as the loss-leader for a platform like Rumble, or perhaps the biggest of a set of conservative personalities selling subscriptions to videos and podcasts, the most successful of which has been The Daily Wire.\n\nBut drawn-out negotiations Fox may lower his value. âThe shelf life on the internet is real short,â said one potential bidder for Carlsonâs services.\n\nThe Daily Wireâs Matt Walsh, who has risen to prominence promoting traditional conceptions of gender and sometimes vitriolic attacks on trans people, tweeted that he saw a transformation coming to the social network: âThis will become a major movement now. Forget YouTube. This is the free speech platform.â\n\nAnd Twitter could, in theory, simply transform itself into a conservative media company, as it completes a race through other possible business models. An earlier generation of Twitter executives once imagined that Twitter could move in the direction of television. Musk could remake Twitter as a conservative subscription video platform to compete with The Daily Wire and Rumble, though thatâs a far smaller business than what Twitter once was, and would likely be a difficult sell to most of its users.\n\nCarlsonâs move also sets up a potential battle between two previously friendly right-leaning media businessmen.\n\nLess than three months ago, Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch was hanging out with Musk in a box at the Super Bowl, and telling Semafor that he thought the eccentric billionaire was doing a âgreat jobâ running Twitter. Now, the two seem to be in direct competition for who will control the next generation of conservative media audiences.\n\nTuesdayâs announcement sets up a battle between Carlson and Fox, which will likely argue that the former host has violated his exclusive deal with the network. A Fox Corp spokesperson declined to comment on Carlsonâs announcement.\n\nFox has some leverage if it wants to punish Musk for pursuing Carlson.\n\nFox News abstained from posting on the platform for several years after several Twitter users shared the address of one of Carlsonâs homes. Fox News could once again stop sharing content on the site. So could Fox Sports, which arguably would have a more noticeable impact, since sports remains a major driver of eyeballs to the platform.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "'DWTS' contestant Matt Walsh walks out; ABC premiere may be delayed amid Hollywood strikes\n\n\" Dancing with the Stars \" may no longer be in step with its scheduled premiere date.\n\nABC confirmed to USA TODAY that it's making plans to delay the 32nd season premiere of its battle of the ballroom, scheduled for Tuesday, amid the writers and actors strikes .\n\nCelebrity contestant Matt Walsh (\"Veep\"), partnered with pro Koko Iwasaki, says he walked out of a rehearsal Thursday.

      "text": "'They're speaking against who I am.' Hundreds flood campus to protest, listen to anti-trans speech\n\nLAS CRUCES - Over a thousand people flooded New Mexico State University's campus Tuesday evening. About half the crowd appeared to hear a speaker voicing rhetoric damning the existence of transgender people. The other half emerged in protest to the speaker.\n\nThe protest featured students, community members, local politicians, and university instructors and numbered in the hundreds.\n\nThe speaker, Matt Walsh, works as a podcaster and a far-right commentator. He's one of the staunchest anti-trans activists in America. In his podcast and books, Walsh has compared transgender people to animals and said a demonstrable phenomenon of higher suicide rates among the groups is misreporte d. In a recent podcast episode, he described a \"gender ideology movement\" as the \"most hateful and violent movement in America.\"\n\nHis 90-minute talk at NMSU focused mainly on that stance. However, Walsh also spoke to the arrest of former U.S. President Donald Trump, saying the arrest was meritless and suggesting district attorneys with conservative leanings should arrest elected Democrats in retaliation.\n\nThe protest outside Walsh's talk was organized by Students For Reproductive Rights, a student organization at NMSU. The whole experience remained peaceful, if not occasionally tense, during Walsh's speech or when protestors confronted attendees afterward. Inside Walsh's address, police removed at least two people after they tried to shout Walsh down.\n\nNMSU did not invite Walsh to speak. A student organization called Young Americans for Freedom asked Walsh to appear. In a statement, NMSU said they would not step in and prevent Walsh's talk. The statement noted that NMSU lacked the authority to intercede and described it as an expression of free speech.\n\nA day after Walsh's remarks, NMSU Chancellor Dan Arvizu provided a statement regarding the talk and protest.\n\n\"The university also realizes that certain speech may have a negative impact on some members of our community. It's written into NMSU policy that the free exchange of ideas is a reflection of the university's public land-grant heritage, interest in diverse points of view, and commitment to excellence in education and research. The freedom of speech is also recognized and protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes speech that might be offensive or hurtful,\" Arvizu said.\n\nAnd, for as much as the protestors sought to counter Walsh's words, many protesters expressed anger at NMSU for allowing Walsh to speak at all.\n\nAround 300 students, faculty, staff and members of the Las Cruces community gathered outside Corbett Center Student Union to protest Walsh's appearance on campus. Many were members of the LGBTQ+ community who voiced fear and concern regarding Walsh's rhetoric.\n\nTwo students, who described themselves as queer, said they respected the university's need to honor free speech but felt that they were not being heard. Daxton Strobbe, 19, an NMSU student, said people should be protected at their school, but many do not feel that way.\n\n\"I feel it's oppressive to have the amount of students that are queer, that identify beyond the spectrum or inside the spectrum - to allow (Walsh) to speak here feels like silencing us or running us out or like they don't care about our opinions,\" Strobbe said.\n\nStrobbe added he was surprised to see the hundreds who showed up for the speech.\n\n\"It's hard for me to support them when they're speaking against who I am. Because my identity as a trans person is constantly being debated by the government,\" said student Matthew Galey, 19. \"I've heard so many awful things about trans people, and I just live my life like anyone else. So it's honestly, it's kind of scary. I'm scared to be who I am.\"\n\nState Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) was among several state legislators and local elected officials who joined the protest. She said she was disappointed in the university's lack of consideration for the potential harm such speakers can have on LGBTQ+ students.\n\n\"There's a lot of trans students here whose lives are at risk if any of the language he spews incites any type of violence,\" she said.\n\nRubio said she considers Walsh's rhetoric hate speech and inflammatory. She added she joined the crowd because supporting members of your community is crucial.\n\nState Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla) appeared and said she shared Rubio's views. Sen. Carrie Hamblen (D-Las Cruces) told the Sun-News that she would write a letter to the NMSU administration to condemn Walsh's speech.\n\nLas Cruces City Councilor Becky Corran also participated in the protest. Corran, who teaches at Doña Ana Community College, said it was important for trans students to know Las Cruces supports them. She added that the university could do more to support trans students.\n\n\"I think making sure that they have the most accessible trans policies, including things related to name changes and healthcare. Those would be two primary ways,\" she said.\n\nNMSU's Associate Vice President for Marketing and Communications Justin Bannister reiterated that the university stands with its students. However, the issue \"boils down\" to First Amendment rights, he said.\n\n\"I think there's been a tremendous amount of support for LGBTQ students,\" Bannister told the Sun-News . \"Students invited (Walsh). They filled out all the right forms, and it's a free speech issue.\"\n\nStretching to include three ballrooms at the top of NMSU's Corbett Center, late-coming attendees were greeted to standing room only.\n\nStudent ushers with Young Americans for Freedom estimated the room contained about 400 seats, all of which were filled by the time Walsh spoke. Around a hundred more attendees stood behind.\n\nThe Sun-News conducted several interviews with attendees before members of Young Americans for Freedom asked media not to interview crowd members.\n\nYoung Americans for Freedom said it didn't want attendees to say something inaccurate or misleading. The Sun-News requested an interview with Young Americans for Freedom's student president. However, an interview could not be arranged before Walsh's talk.\n\nThe crowd was comprised of students, Las Cruces community members, and some individuals from outside Doña Ana County. In all, at least five hundred people appeared to hear Walsh. One of those people was Ryan Palmeri.\n\nPalmeri is an NMSU freshman studying horticulture. Palmeri said he considers himself to be informed on most political issues. He told the Sun-News he knew of Walsh before Tuesday's talk but did not consider himself a follower. Still, he said the event had \"lots of hype\" leading up to it and came to see what Walsh was about.\n\n\"It just seemed entertaining,\" Palmeri said.\n\nPalmeri said he felt NMSU made the right decision in not stepping in to stop Walsh's talk. He added that if the university allowed drag shows on campus, they should enable speakers like Walsh too. Palmeri reiterated that striking a balance was vital when asked why he felt drag shows and Walsh's speech were comparable. He added that he was glad people had the opportunity to protest outside.\n\nThe talk remained peaceful despite rumors of disruption beforehand. About 10 minutes into Walsh's speech, police escorted out a person shouting Walsh down. Then, about halfway into Walsh's talk, police escorted a second person out. Police on-scene confirmed that neither person would be charged with a crime.\n\nAfter about an hour, Walsh took about half a dozen questions from the attendees. Most of these questions came from supporters asking Walsh about his past or policy options for formalizing his ideas. To that latter question, Walsh suggested focusing on federal policy and foregoing state legislatures.\n\nThe most extended question and answers came from two women who opposed Walsh's talk. Both women told Walsh about their experience with gender and their experience with anti-trans rhetoric. One of those women was Luna Burd.\n\nBurd, a University of New Mexico undergraduate and first responder in Albuquerque, said she drove to Las Cruces for the event. She said she wanted Walsh and his supporters to see her.\n\n\"It wasn't that I felt like I needed to own Matt Walsh,\" Burd said in an interview with the Sun-News the day after the speech. \"I wanted to look at a person who had some of the most hateful opinions I've ever seen about people like me and talk to that person and have them recognize that I see them, and I am not afraid of that person.\"\n\nAfter his speech, Walsh posted a six-minute clip of his exchange with Burd on Twitter, misgendering her in the post. In the clip, Burd asks Walsh to define \"woman.\" Walsh responds, saying \"an adult human female\" before suggesting in a follow-up question that pregnancy is the defining trait of women.\n\nThe crowd, meanwhile, ridiculed Burd at several points, laughing, interrupting and shouting. Burd said she expected that treatment from Walsh and his supporters. But appearing in that space was paramount, Burd said, because providing a human face to Walsh's speech and fighting back mattered most.\n\nBut Burd said she also saw Walsh's talk in another light.\n\n\"And it reminded me of hearing a story about George Lincoln Rockwell,\" Burd said, referring to the founder of the American Nazi Party. As Burd pointed out, Rockwell toured college campuses in the 1960s after receiving invitations to speak from student organizations .\n\n\"One of his tactics was to go to universities and speak, knowing that he wasn't necessarily going to be well received and knowing that he wasn't necessarily going to convert a lot of people to his opinion, but the point was to go to these universities and talk and platform and create a base,\" Burd said.\n\n\"And I felt like I was kind of watching these tactics, revitalized,\" Burd said. \"I wanted to be part of sending a message saying we're not going to tolerate this.\"\n\nJustin Garcia covers public safety and local government in Las Cruces.

Fifty-four other women told her they'd been sexually harassed during the event in Indio, California, whose 250,000 attendance skews 54 percent female.\n\nThe annual festival, which recently kicked off the first of its two consecutive weekends, has responded by prioritizing a new campaign against sexual harassment. For thousands of female attendees - resplendent in daisy crowns, fedoras, and cat-ear headbands (a nod to headliner Ariana Grande) - it's a welcome step.\n\nFortunately for Coachella's parent company Goldenvoice, several organizations reached out to offer guidance. In recent years, several campaigns have sprung up to educate concertgoers, musicians, and venues on how to make shows safer for women. Founded by musicians and music fans, the campaigns include the U.K.-based Safe Gigs for Women, the Boston-based Calling All Crows, and the Chicago-based Our Music My Body. Something they have in common: They're helmed by millennials who are tired of complacent attitudes toward what happens at shows once the lights go down.\n\nHarassment's patterns are often detectible. When artists playing music festivals and their fans started to notice those patterns, they wondered: Will people listen if we try to prevent it? This year, Coachella did.\n\n\"As more people share their story, less people are willing to ignore it or excuse it,\" says Maggie Arthur, co-leader of Our Music My Body. \"When I first told my mom about this campaign ... she was kind of surprised that we were taking the time because she was kind of like, 'That's been happening since forever.' \"\n\nMost of the campaigns narrowly predate the #MeToo movement. As such, communicating their message often felt as effective as conducting a conversation next to a stack of amplifiers. In 2016, Ms. Arthur, an educator at Resilience, a rape crisis organization, partnered with Matt Walsh of Between Friends, a domestic violence agency. They begun cold-calling Chicago-area festivals to offer their expertise in crafting sexual harassment policies, educating festivalgoers about consent, and training staff in how to assist victims of assault and misconduct.\n\n\"The overwhelming response was, 'Well, sure we could see that that's happening, but it's definitely not happening at our festival,'\" says Ms. Arthur. Her response? \"Let us just come and talk to people and see if that's true.\"\n\nOur Music My Body launched a two-week online survey in 2017 in which 509 male, female, and LGBTQ participants anonymously reported 1,286 instances of groping, receiving unsolicited comments about their bodies, and being aggressively hit on. In Boston, a similar 2018 survey by Calling All Crows reported 1,006 incidents of harassment or assault by 686 respondents. The organizations note that the unscientific surveys may be flawed, yet they yielded powerful anecdotal evidence to present to recalcitrant music venues.\n\nSadie Dupuis, singer and songwriter of the popular indie rock band Speedy Ortiz, has firsthand experience of harassment in a music culture that, she says, is \"built upon alcohol sales and consumption.\" She was in a crowd at a festival they'd played at when a stranger started harassing her, touching her, and not taking no for an answer. Onlookers failed to intervene when the situation escalated. Her status as a festival performer allowed her to flee to a backstage area policed by security.\n\n\"That experience made me think that we as performers - we have certain privileges and certain types of access that showgoers don't have,\" says Ms. Dupuis, who cranked up her Stratocaster against sexual harassers on last year's pop-punk #MeToo anthem \"Villain.\" \"So that's why we set up a hotline that people can text if they are experiencing harassment. And in such a case we're able to get someone from the venue on board to help out, or to bring the person backstage or to bring them out of harm's way.\"\n\nDuring its 2015 tour, Speedy Ortiz also handed out flyers to educate fans about bystander intervention and de-escalation tactics in cases of sexual misconduct.\n\nThat same year, music fan Tracey Wise founded Safe Gigs for Women. The catalyst was a Manic Street Preachers show during which a fan lunged out, placed both arms around her, and pulled her into him. \"It's the last song,\" was his feeble excuse.\n\nAt the time, such efforts were novel. But, since then, there have been two game-changing moments for anti-harassment campaigns. The first one was the emergence of the #MeToo movement in 2017.

There was a collective shift in thought.\n\n\"It's the same reason that any movement comes to a head: A lot of people have nearly identical experiences and are sick of putting up with it and are sick of a culture that puts up with it,\" she says.\n\nThe second game-changer arrived a year ago.\n\n\"The biggest thing that I saw have an effect in the music industry was the Teen Vogue article on Coachella last year.

Fifty-four other women told her they'd been sexually harassed during the event in Indio, California, whose 250,000 attendance skews 54 percent female.\n\nThe annual festival, which recently kicked off the first of its two consecutive weekends, has responded by prioritizing a new campaign against sexual harassment. For thousands of female attendees - resplendent in daisy crowns, fedoras, and cat-ear headbands (a nod to headliner Ariana Grande) - it's a welcome step.\n\nFortunately for Coachella's parent company Goldenvoice, several organizations reached out to offer guidance. In recent years, several campaigns have sprung up to educate concertgoers, musicians, and venues on how to make shows safer for women. Founded by musicians and music fans, the campaigns include the U.K.-based Safe Gigs for Women, the Boston-based Calling All Crows, and the Chicago-based Our Music My Body. Something they have in common: They're helmed by millennials who are tired of complacent attitudes toward what happens at shows once the lights go down.\n\nHarassment's patterns are often detectible. When artists playing music festivals and their fans started to notice those patterns, they wondered: Will people listen if we try to prevent it? This year, Coachella did.\n\n\"As more people share their story, less people are willing to ignore it or excuse it,\" says Maggie Arthur, co-leader of Our Music My Body. \"When I first told my mom about this campaign ... she was kind of surprised that we were taking the time because she was kind of like, 'That's been happening since forever.' \"\n\nMost of the campaigns narrowly predate the #MeToo movement. As such, communicating their message often felt as effective as conducting a conversation next to a stack of amplifiers. In 2016, Ms. Arthur, an educator at Resilience, a rape crisis organization, partnered with Matt Walsh of Between Friends, a domestic violence agency. They begun cold-calling Chicago-area festivals to offer their expertise in crafting sexual harassment policies, educating festivalgoers about consent, and training staff in how to assist victims of assault and misconduct.\n\n\"The overwhelming response was, 'Well, sure we could see that that's happening, but it's definitely not happening at our festival,'\" says Ms. Arthur. Her response? \"Let us just come and talk to people and see if that's true.\"\n\nOur Music My Body launched a two-week online survey in 2017 in which 509 male, female, and LGBTQ participants anonymously reported 1,286 instances of groping, receiving unsolicited comments about their bodies, and being aggressively hit on. In Boston, a similar 2018 survey by Calling All Crows reported 1,006 incidents of harassment or assault by 686 respondents. The organizations note that the unscientific surveys may be flawed, yet they yielded powerful anecdotal evidence to present to recalcitrant music venues.\n\nSadie Dupuis, singer and songwriter of the popular indie rock band Speedy Ortiz, has firsthand experience of harassment in a music culture that, she says, is \"built upon alcohol sales and consumption.\" She was in a crowd at a festival they'd played at when a stranger started harassing her, touching her, and not taking no for an answer. Onlookers failed to intervene when the situation escalated. Her status as a festival performer allowed her to flee to a backstage area policed by security.\n\n\"That experience made me think that we as performers - we have certain privileges and certain types of access that showgoers don't have,\" says Ms. Dupuis, who cranked up her Stratocaster against sexual harassers on last year's pop-punk #MeToo anthem \"Villain.\" \"So that's why we set up a hotline that people can text if they are experiencing harassment. And in such a case we're able to get someone from the venue on board to help out, or to bring the person backstage or to bring them out of harm's way.\"\n\nDuring its 2015 tour, Speedy Ortiz also handed out flyers to educate fans about bystander intervention and de-escalation tactics in cases of sexual misconduct.\n\nThat same year, music fan Tracey Wise founded Safe Gigs for Women. The catalyst was a Manic Street Preachers show during which a fan lunged out, placed both arms around her, and pulled her into him. \"It's the last song,\" was his feeble excuse.\n\nAt the time, such efforts were novel. But, since then, there have been two game-changing moments for anti-harassment campaigns. The first one was the emergence of the #MeToo movement in 2017. Ms. Dupuis observes that she wasn't the only artist writing songs about sexual consent shortly before the #MeToo movement took off.

Simpson: American Crime Story' from rising star FX.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated July 15, 2016, 9:07 a.m. ET\n\nSome of the nominees for this year's Emmy Awards include network contenders like \"Black-ish\" and \"Modern Family\" as well as cable and streaming offers like \"Better Call Saul\" and \"Master of None.\" New programs from FX, nominated for some of the prizes, demonstrate the breadth of the network's offerings.\n\nHBO's \"Game of Thrones,\" which won the best drama Emmy Award last year, received the most nominations, but a couple of developments involving FX show the network's current strength.\n\nFX is the network behind \"American Crime Story\" (not the TV show \"American Crime,\" which airs on ABC - yes, it's confusing). In its debut story, the TV show focused on the trial of O.J. Simpson and the season received rave reviews. Actors were honored by the Emmys for their work on the show, too - Cuba Gooding Jr. and Courtney B. Vance received nominations for best actor in a limited series or movie, while Sarah Paulson received a nomination for best actress in a limited series or movie. Sterling K. Brown, David Schwimmer, and John Travolta all received nominations for best supporting actor in a limited series or movie.\n\nAll these nods helped \"Simpson\" achieve the second-most nominations this year, behind only \"Thrones.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a long-acclaimed show from FX received Emmy nods in major categories this year for the first time. \"The Americans,\" which stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys and depicts Russian spies living in America during the Cold War, was nominated for best drama series and Ms. Russell and Mr. Rhys were nominated in their respective categories as well.\n\nHere are the other major nominees:\n\nThe TV shows \"Mr. Robot,\" \"House of Cards,\" \"Homeland,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Downton Abbey,\" \"Better Call Saul,\" and \"The Americans\" are nominated for the best drama series award, while \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" \"Transparent,\" \"Veep,\" \"Silicon Valley,\" \"Modern Family,\" \"Master of None,\" and \"Black-ish\" are nominated for best comedy series.\n\nThe programs vying for the best limited series Emmy are \"Roots,\" \"The People v O.J.

More recently, he posted photos of what appeared to be the Ghostbusters' costumes and proton packs, tools they use to fight spirits in the films.\n\nNow Feig's newest photo may reveal the Ghostbusters' vehicle.\n\n#whattheygonnadrive pic.twitter.com/bBLEhrfTEQ\n\nThe movie is currently filming and is set to be released in summer 2016. It follows two films, both released in the 1980s, which starred Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson as the Ghostbusters.\n\nFeig is behind the comedy hits \"Bridesmaids\" and \"The Heat,\" both of which starred Ms. McCarthy (and \"Bridesmaids\" also starred Ms. Wiig). He also directed McCarthy's movie \"Spy,\" which was released this past June.\n\nIn this age of social media, directors and stars can drop more hints about upcoming movies. However, the prevalence of photo- and video-taking cell phones means fans can also learn more than ever before and some directors and stars try to keep plot details about a movie as close to the vest as possible.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

For example, some fans were angered about the campaign of secrecy surrounding the 2013 film \"Star Trek Into Darkness,\" in which those behind the scenes made statements that seemed to imply the film's villain was not legendary \"Trek\" character Khan (it turns out it was).

The Monitor is owned by The Christian Science Church, and we've always been transparent about that.\n\nThe Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we've aimed \"to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,\" as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it.\n\nHere, you'll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences - a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope.\n\nA deeper view that unites instead of divides, connecting why the story matters to you.\n\nBehind the news are values that drive people and nations. Explore them here.\n\nWe all learn from the examples set by others, particularly when we see a courage and compassion that refuses to be quelled. Two stories today center on people with vastly different life experiences, but a common conviction in the power of good. Pope Francis challenged indifference by washing the feet of migrants, inspiring millions with his humility. And in his new memoir, Gidon Lev, a Holocaust survivor, writes, \"To me, hard times are like hide-and-seek - where is the solution, where is the hope?

More recently, he posted photos of what appeared to be the Ghostbusters' costumes and proton packs, tools they use to fight spirits in the films.\n\nNow Feig's newest photo may reveal the Ghostbusters' vehicle.\n\n#whattheygonnadrive pic.twitter.com/bBLEhrfTEQ\n\nThe movie is currently filming and is set to be released in summer 2016. It follows two films, both released in the 1980s, which starred Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, and Ernie Hudson as the Ghostbusters.\n\nFeig is behind the comedy hits \"Bridesmaids\" and \"The Heat,\" both of which starred Ms. McCarthy (and \"Bridesmaids\" also starred Ms. Wiig). He also directed McCarthy's movie \"Spy,\" which was released this past June.\n\nIn this age of social media, directors and stars can drop more hints about upcoming movies. However, the prevalence of photo- and video-taking cell phones means fans can also learn more than ever before and some directors and stars try to keep plot details about a movie as close to the vest as possible.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nSo far, Feig has tantalized fans with these photos but not revealed too much about the plot of the film (for example, actors such as Andy Garcia, Matt Walsh, Cecily Strong, and Michael Kenneth Williams reportedly came on board recently for the new movie, but information on who most of them are playing has been hard to come by, though reports say Mr. Garcia is portraying New York City's mayor).\n\nIt's a fine line directors and stars have to walk now in terms of releasing too much or too little information. For example, some fans were angered about the campaign of secrecy surrounding the 2013 film \"Star Trek Into Darkness,\" in which those behind the scenes made statements that seemed to imply the film's villain was not legendary \"Trek\" character Khan (it turns out it was). J.J. Abrams, the film's director, later said , \"The truth is, I think it probably would have been smarter just to say up front, 'This is who it is.'\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Matt Walsh: If You Can't Date Seriously, Stay Out Of The Game\n\nBy Alyson Krueger\n\nBy Alyson Krueger ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nOver the weekend I read Matt Walsh's piece, Dear single dudes: it's time to man up , with fascination and relief. In it he calls for single men to stop playing games while dating - to stop just \"hanging out\" or \"hooking up\" with women instead of building long term relationships with them. In case you haven't read it (which you absolutely should) here is his argument:\n\n1) \"Nobody has any idea what is going on in their own love lives.\" Walsh quotes a USA Today Survey that reveals 70 percent of us don't know if we are on a date when they go on a date. Singles spend all their time texting suitors, flirting with them through email, hanging out in groups, or just \"hooking up\" that we don't know if getting serious with someone or if someone wants to get serious with us. \"Confusion is the name of the game these days,\" he says.\n\n2) This confusion might have to do with people being afraid of commitment. Walsh says it perfectly: \"It went from courting, to dating, to hanging out. Sometimes even hanging out reeks of too much commitment, in which case 'talking' can be used. And if talking sounds too serious, maybe we'll start hearing 'vicinitizing.' That's a word I just made up, and it means that you and your female friend are often in the same vicinity, but it doesn't get all intense by insinuating that you're actually in that general location together on purpose.\"\n\n3) It's time to put an end to this silliness. Both men and women crave something real. They don't want to be confused. They want to connect with one another. They want to feel wanted. They want to be able to find a life partner with whom they can talk to and spend their days and feel safe. And while it isn't anybody's fault this is what dating has become, it is up to the men to take the lead and pull it back together. \"If you're hanging out with a woman and you feel like you might be into her, tell her,\" says Walsh. \"Call her on the phone. Take her on the date. Say the words: 'I'd like to take you out.' No ambiguity...Go out on a limb for once.\"\n\n4) And if you aren't ready to do so, stay out of the game entirely. Perhaps the most controversial thing Walsh says is if you aren't ready to date seriously with an open heart and a purpose, than you should stop dating until you are ready. The human heart, he says, is just too vulnerable for all this game playing. \"No matter what anyone does, or says, or thinks; no matter what we tell ourselves,; no matter what society insists,\" says Walsh. \"Romantic relationships are always serious business.\"\n\nThere is only one thing I would add to Walsh's piece - It's not just up to the man to take the lead and end game playing. It's also up to the women. We have to get to know ourselves, figure out what we want, and then stick to it. If we really and truly just want fun and sex, that's fine. Go for it! Enjoy! But if we want more, something that's going to fulfill us and give us meaning, don't settle for less. When a man asks us to \"hang out\" we should say, \"No thank you, but I would love to have dinner on Thursday.\" When he makes a pass before we are ready, respond \"I am not ready for this. I want to get to know you better.\" When we aren't sure if we are dating or moving towards a relationship we should ask. If he responds with any iteration of \"You are moving too fast\" or \"You are being insecure\" he isn't the one anyway.\n\nI know this is hard. Trust me, I KNOW! But I think we will all have better relationships for it. And be happier with our love lives. Thank you Matt Walsh for initiating. Now it's up to all of us to make it a reality."

More participate until the strikes are resolved. (Photo by Angela Weiss/Getty Images for Caruso Affiliated)\n\nReality dance competition show Dancing with the Stars , which is a WGA-covered show because it employs one writer who is a guild member, planned to return next week without its WGA writer, but may postpone its return because of the ongoing Hollywood strikes, ABC confirmed to Variety .\n\nAs writers and actors on strike have condemned Dancing with the Stars and WGA-covered talk shows for returning to air, actor Matt Walsh-known for his role on HBO's Veep -said he would not participate on the show until the strike is resolved.\n\nDancing with the Stars may be able to continue without Walsh, but production may be disrupted if more celebrities drop out, Variety reported .\n\nThe show reportedly intended to return so its 500 other crew members who are not on strike and aren't affiliated with the WGA can remain on the job, and it maintains it will follow strike rules, including for its celebrity participants, some of whom are members of the actors' union SAG-AFTRA and are not allowed to discuss or promote film or television projects due to a separate actors' strike.\n\nThough Dancing with the Stars is largely unscripted, the show's WGA writer typically works with the host to provide talking points and written announcements, according to Variety .\n\nThe Writers Guild has pledged to picket any WGA-covered shows that resume production-which includes Dancing with the Stars , as well as other shows that have been the recent targets of scrutiny, including The Drew Barrymore Show, Real Time with Bill Maher and The Talk .\n\nDrew Barrymore's show has been the highest-profile target of picketing writers: The actress faced widespread backlash from writers, actors and the WGA itself for announcing her daytime talk show's return without writers last week, citing her non-WGA staff, but she ultimately announced Sunday her show would not return until after the strike.\n\nBill Maher similarly pledged to bring his show back so his non-writing staff could return to work, making him the only late-night talk show host to announce a return since the writers' strike began in May, but he dropped his plans one day after Barrymore, stating he hopes the strike can be resolved soon.\n\n\"I am taking a pause from 'Dancing with the Stars' until an agreement is made with the WGA. I was excited to join the show and did so under the impression that it was not a WGA show and fell under a different agreement. This morning when I was informed by my union, the WGA, that it is considered struck work I walked out of my rehearsal. I have been and will always stand with my union members of the WGA, SAG and DGA,\" Walsh told Variety in a statement.\n\nDuring the 2007-08 writers' strike, Dancing with the Stars aired and was not picketed by the WGA. Some talk shows went off the air but later returned before the strike had ended, while late-night shows returned without writers after several months, and Ellen DeGeneres' talk show continued production (and faced criticism from the WGA).\n\nDancer Cheryl Burke, who competed on Dancing with the Stars for 25 seasons, said the show should remain off the air until the strikes are over. \"In order for things to change, we have to stick together, point blank, because if one show just decides to think about the show on its own, this is not going to make big changes,\" Burke said in a Variety interview. Former WGA board member David Slack tweeted Dancing with the Stars cannot be made without \"scab writing,\" and urged the celebrity cast-including co-host Alfonso Ribiero, who is an actor-to \"refuse to cross our picket line.\" WGA member Bill Wolkoff urged his fellow writers to picket the Dancing with the Stars lot at CBS TV City, stating the union will have \"a BIG week on our lot picketing struck WGA shows that have decided to return. This prolongs the strike!\" Wolkoff tweeted a picture of himself outside the studio where Dancing with the Stars films Tuesday morning, stating writers are \"ready to picket if they go to air.\"\n\nShows criticized for returning to the air have defended their decisions as an effort to return their non-writing crew members to work, and some that do not employ WGA writers say they aren't crossing any picket lines at all. Sherri Shepherd, the host of daytime talk show Sherri , said her show does not and has never employed WGA writers, meaning her show hasn't violated WGA strike rules. Other shows like The Drew Barrymore Show and Real Time have argued it's possible to resume taping without writers and still abide by the WGA's strike rules, often by focusing on unscripted interviews instead of segments that rely on writers. Some film industry workers-both in the United States and abroad-have said the strikes are negatively impacting their ability to work. \"There are people who are suffering in the U.K.,\" Marcus Ryder, the incoming chief executive of the Film and TV Charity, told the New York Times . Bectu, a British union for behind-the-scenes entertainment industry roles (which clarified it supports the strike), said 80% of its members reported their work being impacted by the strikes. Other industries have felt the impact of the strike-like food catering, cleaners and set builders-particularly in the Los Angeles area, where roles adjacent to the entertainment industry account for about 20% of the area's income, CNBC reported .\n\nThe WGA strike began in May, while the SAG-AFTRA strike started in July, shutting down much of Hollywood in the industry's biggest labor dispute in decades. Both strikes concern disputes between the guilds and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents studios in negotiations. A key issue for both strikes is residual payments-writers and actors have said the streaming era has diminished opportunities to earn money from prior work, including from reruns on television, making it much more difficult to earn a living. Both guilds are also demanding protections against artificial intelligence, which writers fear can essentially replace their jobs and actors fear can use their likenesses without their consent. The studios argue they have offered the writers and actors large pay increases that show their \"commitment to ending the strike.\"\n\nWill Dancing with the Stars continue to air as planned-or will the public pressure campaigns, like those faced by Barrymore and Maher, lead it to pause production? The show is set to return for its 32nd season on September 28 on ABC and Disney+.\n\n'Dancing With the Stars' Keeping Plans to Premiere Next Week Despite Blowback From WGA (Variety)\n\nDrew Barrymore Backtracks: Talk Show Paused Until Hollywood Strikes End After Union Criticism (Forbes)\n\nBill Maher Reverses Course: Pauses HBO Show Due To Writers' Strike (Forbes)\n\nTalk Shows By Bill Maher And Drew Barrymore Are Returning-But Are They Breaking Strike Rules?

That is not at all true.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nIn reality? This quote is not even from this decade. It's eight years old, and the interview is in the context of her award-winning films about honor killings and acid attacks against women in her home country of Pakistan. That brutal patriarchy is full of the men she \"likes making uncomfortable.\" But now it's being dragged up, stripped of context and using in the latest anti-women crusade that has plagued Star Wars for years, already feeding the maw of outrage YouTubers who make widely watched videos about how her upcoming Rey movie is \"doomed\" because of her feminism.\n\nThis is the second time in a few weeks an Obaid-Chinoy quote has made the rounds in this crowd, with the last one actually about Star Wars itself, albeit willingly misread many times over. There, Obaid-Chinoy said \"We're in 2024. It's about time we have a woman shape a story in a galaxy far, far away.\" This led men to start listing important female Star Wars characters, but Obaid-Chinoy is obviously referring to her being the first female director of any Star Wars movie ever, which is just...a fact.\n\nRey\n\nAs I've said previously, this discourse is going to be an utter nightmare. Obaid-Chinoy is going to keep delivering completely normal quotes about empowering women, and Ted Cruz and Matt Walsh and 200 YouTubers and their millions of subscribers are going to lose their minds. Plus, her film is about Rey, the character accused of being a \"Mary Sue,\" not earning her place as a powerful force-using lead, for the duration of the new trilogy.\n\nWhat's ironic is that Obaid-Chinoy's quote about making men uncomfortable does stay true today, but instead of confronting men about horrific acid attacks, we have men (\"men\") being made uncomfortable by a...woman directing a Star Wars movie, starring a woman, and talking about it publicly. It's going to be a long few years.\n\nFollow me on Twitter , Threads , YouTube , and Instagram .\n\nPick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy ."

That is not at all true.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nIn reality? This quote is not even from this decade. It's eight years old, and the interview is in the context of her award-winning films about honor killings and acid attacks against women in her home country of Pakistan. That brutal patriarchy is full of the men she \"likes making uncomfortable.\" But now it's being dragged up, stripped of context and using in the latest anti-women crusade that has plagued Star Wars for years, already feeding the maw of outrage YouTubers who make widely watched videos about how her upcoming Rey movie is \"doomed\" because of her feminism.\n\nThis is the second time in a few weeks an Obaid-Chinoy quote has made the rounds in this crowd, with the last one actually about Star Wars itself, albeit willingly misread many times over. There, Obaid-Chinoy said \"We're in 2024. It's about time we have a woman shape a story in a galaxy far, far away.\" This led men to start listing important female Star Wars characters, but Obaid-Chinoy is obviously referring to her being the first female director of any Star Wars movie ever, which is just...a fact.\n\nRey\n\nAs I've said previously, this discourse is going to be an utter nightmare. Obaid-Chinoy is going to keep delivering completely normal quotes about empowering women, and Ted Cruz and Matt Walsh and 200 YouTubers and their millions of subscribers are going to lose their minds. Plus, her film is about Rey, the character accused of being a \"Mary Sue,\" not earning her place as a powerful force-using lead, for the duration of the new trilogy.\n\nWhat's ironic is that Obaid-Chinoy's quote about making men uncomfortable does stay true today, but instead of confronting men about horrific acid attacks, we have men (\"men\") being made uncomfortable by a...woman directing a Star Wars movie, starring a woman, and talking about it publicly. It's going to be a long few years.\n\nFollow me on Twitter , Threads , YouTube , and Instagram .\n\nPick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and The Earthborn Trilogy ."
